00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.936
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.560
SPEAKER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.560
Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.890
I am [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.950
I work on Google Translate.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.750
Today, we have a very special
guest, Dr. Douglas Fields.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.530
He is a neuroscientist and
an international authority

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.360
on brain development,
neuron and glia

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.010
interactions, and the
cellular mechanisms of memory.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.190
He is currently Chief of
Nervous System Development

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.510
and Plasticity Section at the
National Institutes of Health,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.690
and he is the author of many
magazine articles and books,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.950
including "Why We Snap,"
which you can grab in the back

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.030
if you haven't yet.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.140
And later, we're going to
have a quick book signing.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.010
And his other book
is, "The Other Brain."

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.350
Please give a warm welcome
to Dr. Douglas Fields.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.116
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.800
DOUGLAS FIELDS:
Thank you very much.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.940
Thank you all for coming.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.000
It's a delight to be here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.100
So I've been given
the rare opportunity

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.737
to talk about two
books in one hour.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:13.320
Normally, either one
of these subjects

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.132
would take a whole
hour, so I apologize--

00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:17.340
I'm going to go really quick.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.090
And I'm going to only be
able to hit the high points.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.680
But you know, s I
realize here at Google

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.300
your CPUs are overclocked,
and you'll be able to do this.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.980
But we'll get through it.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.650
And the first talk is related
to the subject of snapping.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.480
So this is a very
interesting topic

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.154
that I think touches everyone
in one way or another.

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:44.820
Many people won't
admit it, but everyone

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.790
admits they know somebody
else who has issues.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.500
And snapping is
bewildering, because it's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.790
this unconscious aggressive
impulse triggered by something

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.092
in the environment.

00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:56.050
And it's not conscious.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.883
It's not deliberate.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:57.690
Why break a dish?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.370
Why smash a tennis racket?

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.610
Why get into vehicular
jousting on the freeway

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.800
and wreck your car or worse?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.310
It doesn't make any sense.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.759
So that's what snapping is.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.300
And that's what's
disturbing about it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.771
is that it's not conscious.

00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.020
It's rapid, triggered by
something in the environment,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.780
and the behavior is incorrect.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.470
It's followed by regret, so
it's kind of embarrassing.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.702
If it's appropriate
behavior, we call it--

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:24.660
we don't call snapping.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.670
We call it quick thinking
or something like that.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.680
So it is interesting
because this

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.380
covers an unconscious
part of the brain

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.150
that we're talking about.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.050
And it seemed to me that
this is a new subject

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.420
but a very important
and overlooked subject.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.250
When I read the
newspapers every day,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.580
we read about the violence
and domestic disputes,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.620
barroom brawls, all
these kinds of things.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.262
And it's not
mentally ill people.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:55.470
People with mental illness
do not commit violent acts

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.600
any more than anyone else.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.890
And so we do
understand how drugs

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.350
can interfere with judgment.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.440
But I think we're
overlooking the big issue.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.070
The majority of what we
call snapping or violence

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.420
that we read about every day
is so-called normal people.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.660
And I'd like to
understand how that works.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.090
But it's actually
broader than snapping.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.090
When you get into the subject,
the book has more than that.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.170
Because it's talking about--

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.540
it involves the neural circuitry
of unconscious behaviors

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.781
and threat detection.

00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:33.780
What's different about
this approach in the book

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.370
is it's not a
psychological approach

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.760
that you may be familiar with.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.090
It's a neuroscience
approach, which we

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.280
look at snapping as a behavior.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.270
All behaviors are
controlled by the brain.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.686
Let's go in the
brain and see what

00:03:44.686 --> 00:03:46.410
circuits mediate this behavior.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.130
It's only been possible with
new methods of neuroscience.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.490
So that's the new approach--

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.580
and also, unconscious operation
of the brain, but also

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.330
fear and whatnot.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.940
So the point is we're
all wired for violence.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.840
We don't have to
be taught violence.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.450
All animals need to have this
aggressive behavior in order

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.924
to protect themselves, to
protect their offspring.

00:04:11.924 --> 00:04:14.090
Carnivores need to have
aggressive behavior in order

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.860
to capture food.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.800
The circuits that
carry this out are not

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.285
in the conscious
part of the brain.

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.410
They're in the unconscious
part of the brain called

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.250
the hypothalamus
and other circuitry.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.050
And that's what I'd
like to talk about is

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.770
the circuitry of snapping
and aggressive behavior.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.560
We're all wired for
violence, and in order

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.240
to give you an idea of
what made me realize that,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.350
I want to read a
snippet out of my book.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.580
Because this is what inspired
me to try to understand.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.370
It was an instance
where I snapped,

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.420
and I wanted to realize
if I could risk my life

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.865
or limb in an
instant in response

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.240
to something in
my environment, I

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.190
wanted to know how
that worked and not

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.090
be consciously aware of it.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.590
So "After Paris, we traveled to
Barcelona for my next lecture

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.099
at an international
meeting of neuroscientists.

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.640
The morning before
the meeting began,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.580
we made a quick visit
to the Gaudi cathedral.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.400
Ascending the steps out of the
dingy subway station smelling

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.830
of concrete, dust,
and sweat, we emerged

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.780
in the brilliant Barcelona sun.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.630
A crowd of passengers pressed
upon us in a gray blur."

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.990
So I was traveling to
a neuroscience meeting,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.270
and I brought my 17-year-old
daughter with me.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.180
That's very unusual.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.250
Usually, I travel alone.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.230
So we thought we'd go
see the Gaudi cathedral

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.770
before I gave my lecture.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.340
So we're coming up out
of the subway system.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.847
"Suddenly, I felt a
sharp tug at my pant leg.

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.180
As if swatting a mosquito, I
slapped the zippered pocket

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.570
above my left knee.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.900
My wallet was gone.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.920
My left arm shot back
blindly in a flash.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.690
I clotheslined the
robber as he pivoted

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.670
to hand my wallet
off to his partner

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:01.260
and flee down the steps.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.840
As if swinging a sledgehammer,
I hurled him by his neck

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.350
over my left hip and slammed him
belly-first onto the pavement,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.450
where I flattened him to the
ground and applied a headlock.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.300
Splaying my legs for hip
control like a wrestler pinning

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.590
an opponent, I yelled for help.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.180
All right, 56-years-old, 130
pounds, wire-rimmed glasses,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.650
gray hair.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.130
I have no martial arts training.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.610
[LAUGHS] I have no
military experience,

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.870
no background in
street fighting.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.470
Drawing on junior high school
wrestling moves 40 years ago,

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.040
I found myself applying
an illegal chokehold.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.590
The street-smart hoodlum
struggling in my arms

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.900
was in his late
20s or early 30s.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.842
'Police!' I shouted.

00:06:39.842 --> 00:06:40.550
'Call the police.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.020
I've got him.'

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.750
Well, there was no
reply, no gasps of shock

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.220
from the dense crowd.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.080
No one was coming to my aid.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.600
Instead, from my
perspective on the ground,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.000
all I saw were mens'
feet closing in around me

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.340
in a tight circle.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.840
They were all part of the gang.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.550
Oblivious to being
hunted as prey,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.820
we assumed that the crowd was
the normal throng of passengers

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.240
bumping and jostling through
the Barcelona metro system.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.670
The muscled beneath me
struggled to break my grip.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.690
With his neck in the
crook of my left arm,

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.660
I cinched with all the
force my biceps could

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.880
produce, cutting the
blood off to his brain

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.410
and air to his lungs.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.740
Bending his head back, I torqued
his spine backward painfully,

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.960
tipping his face skyward,
his eyes and mouth

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.330
open wide in shock,
pain, and fear.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:26.210
The wallet popped free as he
tossed it toward his accomplice

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.850
and grass furiously at my
arm to break my strength.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.040
'That's my wallet,' I yelled.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.860
A woman's hand shot between
the thick of the legs.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.060
Instantly, I recognized
it as my daughter's.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.270
She had been cut off by
the gang that encircled

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.900
and trapped us, encircling me
silently like a pack of wolves.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.710
Captain of the ultimate
Frisbee team, Kelly

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.030
dove through the
air in an arc as

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.030
if to deflect the disk
inches from an opponent's

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.210
grasp in a full on layout
on the solid concrete.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.130
She intercepted
the pass in mid-air

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.650
and tipped the wallet into the
palm of my outstretched right

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.070
hand.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.560
Reading the eyes of
an accomplice fixating

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.420
on my BlackBerry
spinning on the pavement,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.602
she lunged again and
beat him to the prize.

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:08.310
With my wallet retrieved,
I realized then

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.510
I was horribly outnumbered.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.650
I released the thief and
bounced to the balls of my feet

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.420
as he scurried
backwards on his butt,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.610
like an injured crab escaping.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.110
'Crazy man,' he gasped.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.654
Looking into the eyes of the
half dozen muscular thugs

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:24.070
surrounding me, I
tried to discern

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.310
if he choked out those parting
words to deflect suspicion

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.290
or if he meant it as a threat.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.700
Now what?

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.429
A massive surge of adrenaline
fueled my twitching muscles

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.610
and nerves to levels of raw
power I'd never felt before.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.460
I was now struggling not to pick
up the next hoodlum squaring

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.960
off with me, hoist
him over my head,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.570
and hurl him into
the accomplices,

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.444
knocking them all down
the steps of the metro

00:08:45.444 --> 00:08:46.597
station like bowling pins.

00:08:46.597 --> 00:08:48.430
Now, it wasn't a question
of whether I could

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:50.170
execute the superhuman feat.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.730
I had no doubt
that I could do it.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.010
I was charged with adrenaline.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.780
Rather, I was trying
not to do it simply

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.410
because this might not be my
best move, at least not yet.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:01.510
Suddenly, a middle-aged
well-dressed Spaniard

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.010
stuck casually between
me and the attackers

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.080
and with flicking shooing
motions of his fingers,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.480
he said, 'He no crazy.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.300
Go now.' Without
breaking stride,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.790
he descended the steps
into the metro station.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.280
As he passed me, he
smiled and said, 'Bueno.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.910
Good.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:20.750
Go now.' In passing, he had
deflected the situation to its

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.360
best possible outcome, a draw.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.730
The band of robbers scattered
into the metro station

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.070
like rats down a sewer,
leaving my daughter

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.080
and me standing there
stunned, my wallet

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.200
clenched in a death
grip in my right hand.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.159
Unfortunately, that
was not the end of it.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.200
The gang pursued Kelly
and me throughout the city

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.880
for the next two hours.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.150
They were not after
my wallet anymore.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.400
I had humiliated and beaten
up a member of their gang.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.140
They wanted revenge.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.670
I tried every trick
to elude them--

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.430
fleeing into tourist shops
and through noisy restaurants,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.680
cutting through back alleys,
abruptly crossing streets

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.410
to reverse course, changing
clothing, and when they got too

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.690
close, leaving the
sidewalk and running down

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.510
the center of the boulevard,
weaving through oncoming cars.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.460
At one point, we
stopped traffic to jump

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.010
into a taxi in the middle
of a three-lane boulevard,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.750
but they had cell phones.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.000
And everywhere we went,
they sent increasingly

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.420
menacing tattooed thugs
with steroid-bloated biceps

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:14.920
to intercept us.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.420
As we dodged the
gang of robbers,

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.840
we witnessed them casually pick
wallets from two more tourists.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.990
I even snapped photographs
of them doing it.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.567
A stupid mistake,
as it turned out,

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:25.400
because the lookout on
my side of the street

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.960
caught me doing it.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.340
The unshaven goon
came running up

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.950
the sidewalk jabbering
Russian into a cell phone

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.480
and extending a video camera
in an unconvincing attempt

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.260
to pass as a tourist.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.190
We fled down the side street.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.950
As they closed in on us, we
were forced to jump into a taxi

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.800
and escape to a small
town an hour away.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.110
In the cab, my daughter
asked in a tone

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.480
filled with shock and
disbelief, 'Where did you

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.727
learn to do that?

00:10:48.727 --> 00:10:50.810
I looked over and saw you
swinging some guy around

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:51.380
by the neck.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.570
I couldn't figure out
what was happening.'

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.850
I laughed a nervous relief.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.370
170 euro cab fare later,
we were broke but safe.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.870
And now my daughter is convinced
that my job at the National

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.300
Institutes of Health
is just a cover

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.680
for my real job as a spy."

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.880
All right, so I realized--

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.080
there I was on the ground.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.580
And suddenly this
thought bubbles up

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.110
to my head, what the
heck are you doing?

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.260
So the point is the
neural circuitry

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.070
involved in that behavior didn't
involve my cerebral cortex.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.570
And that's because
when you're faced

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.660
with a sudden
threatening situation,

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.940
conscious deliberation
is too slow.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.025
Your conscious brain can't
hold enough information,

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:36.090
and it operates too slowly.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.950
So the brain's threat
detection mechanism

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:43.230
is subcortical, unconscious,
and the wiring for this

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:50.040
is in the amygdala and
in the hypothalamus.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.580
So as I was wandering
around Barcelona

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.590
with my daughter
consciously engaged

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.980
in where we're going to go,
my threat detection mechanism

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.577
was looking at
threats, and that's

00:12:00.577 --> 00:12:01.660
happening with all of you.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.990
You're constantly--
huge part of your brain

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.440
devoted to threat detection
and on the lookout for threats.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.930
So all the sensory
information, before it

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.670
goes to your cerebral
cortex, vision,

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.120
sound goes to the center of
your threat detection mechanism

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.170
in the amygdala.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.170
That's why you can dodge a
basketball, get out of the way,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.760
and then you go, what was that?

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.820
That was visual information
going to your amygdala

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.380
and then later goes to
your cerebral cortex,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.030
but you've already acted.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.440
So in the early
'20s, Walter Hess

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.030
stuck electrodes
into a cat brain

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.350
and stimulated different
parts of the brain.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.290
And he found one part
in the hypothalamus.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:44.070
When he stimulated this, the
cat launched into an attack

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.680
and would kill another
animal in its cage.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.460
So this area is called the
hypothalamic attack area.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.230
And this is true
in other animals,

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.620
and humans have it as well.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.280
So the question is, what
feeds into this attack area

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.790
to cause this violent response?

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.650
And the new
information is showing

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:09.420
that very discreet circuits
feed into this area in response

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.250
to different threats.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.280
Aggressive behavior
is highly regulated.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.710
You're not going to engage
in aggression for anything

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.020
but very-- except
very specific reasons,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.190
because you're risking
your life and limb.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.730
So it's highly regulated.

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.950
Now, although it seems that
anything can trigger aggression

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.120
when you read the
paper, in fact,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.540
very few things can, only
nine different things.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.330
And these involve
different circuits.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.890
So what scientists have been
able to do in recent years

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.970
is use new methods, optogenetics
and genetic engineering,

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:47.100
so you can engineer neurons
to release flashes of light

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.410
when they fire,
stick a fiber optic

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.465
camera into an
experimental animal,

00:13:51.465 --> 00:13:54.850
have it engage in aggression,
and see which neurons light up.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.700
And now, you know the circuitry.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.580
You can activate and
inactivate specific neurons

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.610
by shining a laser into
the brain, and neurons that

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:07.086
are genetically encoded to
respond to that light by firing

00:14:07.086 --> 00:14:08.710
or inhibiting-- so
now, you can turn it

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:12.070
on behaviors, different
aggressive behaviors.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.110
What this line of
research has shown

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.871
is that very specific behaviors,
like maternal aggression--

00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:18.370
you're familiar--
we're all familiar

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.760
with maternal aggression.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.300
If you threaten
a mother's young,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.727
then the mother will attack.

00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:27.310
Using these methods
I've talked about,

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.230
you could see that circuitry.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.360
You can activate those
circuits with a laser

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.430
and activate the mother to
exhibit aggressive behavior

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.690
against an intruder.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.480
You can inactivate that, and
the mother will no longer

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.830
protect her pups.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:45.280
However, she still will
have aggressive responses

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.200
to different kinds of threats.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.050
So this has led to realizing
that our threat detection

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.580
mechanism, unlike the old
idea of the lizard brain--

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.250
a primitive part
the brain causes

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.910
you to do beastly things--
no, we have very elaborate,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:03.820
exquisite neural circuitry to
release aggression in response

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.660
to specific triggers.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:12.210
So let me tell you
about the triggers.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:15.020
And again, these are
based on neural circuitry,

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.040
not on some classification.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.820
And if you read the neuroscience
behaviorist, physiologist,

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.630
and psychologist, they all
have different terminology

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.190
for aggression-- different
kinds of aggression.

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.310
I've dispensed with that
and for two reasons.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.360
I thought that would be helpful
to understand the mechanisms

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.390
to having a mnemonic, so you
can remember these nine circuits

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.190
that will trigger aggression.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.530
And secondly, this
will also allow

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.560
you to control the circuitry,
because in fact, we

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.720
have these circuits
because we need them.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.020
You don't want to
prevent this response

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.640
in the right
circumstance; you just

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.080
want to prevent the misfires.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.010
So if you can suddenly feel the
sense of rage on the highway,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:16:00.310
let's say, and understand
which of these LIFEMORTS

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.640
it triggered--

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.460
the mnemonic I created
was LIFEMORTS--

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.550
then you can control
the rage response.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.530
Because you'll realize
it's a misfire,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.970
and the rage will subside.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.960
So there's not really time to
go through all these triggers,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.860
but I'll just quickly
talk about some.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.210
L for Life and Limb.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.790
We've already talked about
defensive aggression.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.820
If you're attacked,
you will fight back.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.750
Any animal will.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.390
We also mentioned
maternal aggression.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.475
That's the F in LIFEMORTS.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.950
The E trigger is Environment.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.350
Many animals are
territorial, and they

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.070
will defend their territory
aggressively and mark it.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.100
They'll fiercely
defend intruders.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.580
Primates and humans are
fiercely territorial.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:55.810
Intruders will be shot.

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.620
If somebody enters
your house unannounced,

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.090
it's going to trigger
an aggressive response.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.395
So that's the E trigger.

00:17:04.395 --> 00:17:06.020
Just going to give
you another example.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.186
I can't go through them all.

00:17:07.186 --> 00:17:08.890
T Is for Tribe.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:13.720
Social animals use aggression
to protect their group.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.680
Many animals will have this,
and certainly human beings

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.940
have this capability as well.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.440
I mean, the selective
service system

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.180
proves that we all
have the capability

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.200
for violence and
destruction to protect

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.580
our country, for example.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.040
So that's the T for Tribe.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:30.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.610
We need to realize that's
also the key to our success,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.080
that we can go shirts
and skins and play

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.170
at the maximal physical, mental
capability of a human being

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.110
on a basketball court,
just arbitrarily

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:45.537
divided into two teams.

00:17:45.537 --> 00:17:46.870
This is what got us to the moon.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.160
We compete with another country.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.230
So this is really the key
to our success as a species,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.490
but it also leads to racism.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.830
It leads to wars.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.120
It leads to gang violence.

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.107
So those are two of the
triggers that I want to mention.

00:18:02.107 --> 00:18:04.190
And I just don't have time
to go through them all,

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:05.440
but I want to give one--

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.730
make one more point.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.010
We have these circuits
embedded in our brain

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:12.050
because we have the same
brain we had 100,000 years ago

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:13.715
when we lived in the
plains of Africa,

00:18:13.715 --> 00:18:18.250
and we were fighting tooth
and nail for survival.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.055
Same brain, but
we're now operating

00:18:20.055 --> 00:18:23.440
in an environment our brain has
never evolved to operate in--

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.070
completely different world.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.920
So what happens is
you get misfires

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.320
triggered by situations
in the modern world that

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.060
never existed.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.430
Driving is a great example.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.250
It hits almost all
these triggers.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.000
So I'll just give you one,
and it's that e trigger.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.600
So you're out on 101.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.011
You're driving on the freeway.

00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:41.260
Somebody cuts in front of you.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.970
Suddenly, you're
feeling enraged,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.290
and some people will end
in a gun battle or a wreck.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:52.510
But many people will feel sudden
rage when somebody does that.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.270
Why?

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.520
Why do we feel anger?

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.910
Why don't we feel
some other emotion?

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.170
That's a misfire.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.620
We perceive the area around
our cars our territory.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:06.850
Somebody's intruded into our
territory, tripped this trigger

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:09.090
for us to defend it.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:11.220
For the purpose of the
activity we're involved in,

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.870
transportation,
it doesn't matter

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.120
if the guy's on your front
bumper or your back bumper.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.400
It's a matter of a couple
of seconds difference.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.605
But it's this illusion that
we're traveling with territory.

00:19:20.605 --> 00:19:22.980
If you're running and having
a foot race over the ground,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:23.790
that never happens.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.299
People are free to
run ahead of you.

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:27.840
Somebody cuts in front of you
and is faster, you might laugh.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.100
You wouldn't get angry.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.380
So that's an example
of a misfire.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.610
So the point is we have these
circuits because we need them.

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:44.220
They exist because they're
important to our survival.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:51.805
And it's not necessarily a
disorder but a misfiring.

00:19:51.805 --> 00:19:54.180
And I want to give an example--
again, read a snippet out

00:19:54.180 --> 00:20:00.060
of the book that demonstrates
why we have these triggers

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.750
and just say that in many
cases, the same thing happens

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.840
when you have a hero.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.970
We'll come to the
aid of somebody

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.940
and they say, well, what were
you thinking when you did that?

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.850
And they'll say, I didn't think.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.630
I just reacted.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.040
And afterwards, they're shaking.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.590
But they were heroic.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.760
So here's a snippet
from the book.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.944
"'Lucky, what are you doing?

00:20:18.944 --> 00:20:19.860
Get your butt up here.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.300
Let's go.' Heather Lucky
Penny was a 26-year-old DC Air

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.090
National Guard lieutenant
stationed in Andrews Air Force

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:28.680
Base in Maryland.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.350
Jolted by urgency, she aborted
the methodical checklist,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.100
climbed in, ignited the engines,
and screamed for a ground crew

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.900
to pull the wheel chocks.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.310
Within minutes,
the petite blonde

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.370
was piloting the F-16 fighter
jets screeching at top speed

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.010
through the crystal blue sky
with her commander, Colonel

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.310
Marc Sasseville, piloting
his own jet on her wing.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:52.360
The date was September 11, 2001.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.095
Both the twin towers and the
Pentagon had just been hit.

00:20:56.095 --> 00:20:57.970
There was a fourth
passenger jet commandeered

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.160
by Islamic terrorists
targeting the United States

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.350
capital and the White House.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.750
Obviously, Heather knew
there was no chance

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.010
that any of the men,
women, and children

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.490
onboard United
Airlines 757 passenger

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.290
jet she was intent on
intercepting setting

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.762
would survive.

00:21:12.762 --> 00:21:15.790
In an improbable twist of
fate, there was a good chance

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.830
that Heather Penny's
own father could

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.740
be the captain on
United Flight 93, which

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.960
she was determined to destroy.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.370
'This sounds cold-hearted.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:29.920
I mean, that was my Daddy,"
Penny said in an interview

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.696
afterwards.

00:21:31.696 --> 00:21:32.820
'I couldn't think about it.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.390
I had a job to do,' she
said later to her mom.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.030
'We don't train to bring down
airliners,' Colonel Sasseville

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.920
said, describing
the gut wrenching,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.000
unthinkable act he and Heather
Penny were about to commit.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.490
Training would have been
useless in any case.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.720
Neither of their jets was armed.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.530
No one had anticipated the need
to have fully-armed fighter

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.050
jets at the ready to protect
against an aerial attack

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.510
originating from within
the United States.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.090
'I'm going to go for the
cockpit,' Sasseville said.

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:07.170
'I'll take the tail,' Penny
replied without hesitation.

00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.960
'I genuinely believed that this
was going to be the last time I

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.560
took off,' she said, now a
single mom with two girls.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:18.320
'I had already given myself
up knowing what my duty was.'

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.760
She was fully
committed to ramming

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.240
her jet into the passenger
plane to bring it down.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.970
As fate would have it, her
father, Colonel John Penny,

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.120
was not piloting
United 93 that morning.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.400
It was his good
friend Jason Dahl.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.840
With Jason on the
plane, it would

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.520
have been an additional level
of grief John Penny said later.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.560
But Lieutenant Penny
and Colonel Sasseville

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:43.870
never had to execute
their kamikaze mission.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.390
'Let's roll,' said
32-year-old Todd Beamer,

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.810
a passenger on a
hijacked flight.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.270
Those were the last words of
the soon-to-be father ending

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.840
his conversation with telephone
switchboard operator Lisa

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.360
Jefferson whom he had
been relaying information

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.990
to for the last 13
minutes of the hijacking.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:05.320
They had just finished reciting
the Lord's Prayer and Psalms 23

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.610
together.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:09.050
'Though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.590
I fear no evil, for
thou art with me,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.570
they rod and they staff.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:16.930
They comfort me.'

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.300
Beamer and the other passengers
stormed the hijackers.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.790
Jeremy Glick was a
six-foot judo champion.

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.010
Mark Bingham was a rugby player.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.980
Tom Burnett had been
a college quarterback.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.870
Lewis [? Nakh ?]
was a weightlifter.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.540
William Cashman, a
former paratrooper.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.300
The cockpit recorder captures
the sound of food carts ramming

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.230
the cockpit door and
the cries of terrorists

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.130
screaming at one another
to hold the door closed.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.540
The door burst open.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.090
'Let's get him,' is heard on
the recording as passengers

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.820
overwhelm the terrorists.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.640
'They were the true
heroes,' Heather Penny says.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.710
'There were average,
everyday Americans

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.350
who gave their lives
to save countless more.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.410
Their selflessness reminds us
that we are a part of something

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.140
greater than ourselves, that
there are things in this world

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.012
more important than ourselves.'

00:24:02.012 --> 00:24:03.970
Today, there's a memorial
on the green pastures

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.011
in southwestern Pennsylvania,
and the White House

00:24:06.011 --> 00:24:07.600
and the United
States capital stands

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:09.920
spared from the destruction.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.270
This is the power
of the tribe trigger

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.840
to life-risking violence.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:17.470
Gangs, wars, racism
are its ugly dark side.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.450
But this bit of neural
circuitry is very much

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.640
a part of what makes us human.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.530
It can unleash the
best in human nature,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.960
selfless sacrifice for others.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.577
It is the trigger of heroism.

00:24:27.577 --> 00:24:30.160
And as the monument now standing
in the fields of Pennsylvania

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.700
remind us, it's a vital
part of every one of us."

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:40.350
So we have these
circuits for a reason.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:43.510
In the interest of time,
I have to come to a close.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.450
I've got other
important points that I

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.330
would like to make-- is
that stress is important.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.430
Knowing the circuits
is important,

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.720
because you can control it.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.210
Understanding that stress
changes that threshold--

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:56.400
if you're in a
stressful environment,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.290
you're more likely
to have these trip,

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.450
same as the military
putting its defense

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.120
mechanism on high alert.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.480
If you grow up in bad part
of Palo Alto or Baltimore,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.670
you're going to wire
the brain so that you

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:14.310
have a hair-trigger, because you
can't afford to be victimized.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:20.490
And I don't want to give away
the book, but-- well, I will.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.890
I reacted that way in
Barcelona because we

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.420
were under intense stress.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.730
That was the second
time we were robbed.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.334
And my amygdala had
learned that and didn't

00:25:29.334 --> 00:25:30.750
talk to my cortex
about it, but it

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.210
wasn't going to happen again.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.750
The second point
I'd like to make

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.120
is that this mechanism--
threat detection

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.360
mechanism is controlled
by the cerebral cortex.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.485
And there are people who
are completely nonviolent,

00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:42.160
and I interviewed them--

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.700
James, for example, who will
kill nothing and no living

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:48.540
animal.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.350
And so it is possible
to have cortical control

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.180
over the circuitry.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:59.310
I spoke to a SEAL Team
Six member, told him

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:00.555
what I did in Barcelona.

00:26:00.555 --> 00:26:02.490
He said, yeah, I never
would have done that.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.830
Here's a guy who could take
out a pickpocket with a judo

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:07.590
chop while doing a selfie,
and he wouldn't have done it.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:14.790
And they train so that they can
control, with cortical control,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.457
these defensive behaviors.

00:26:17.457 --> 00:26:20.040
And the other thing I wish I had
time to talk about is gender.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.340
The most important factor
in aggression is gender.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:34.370
94% of all criminals in prison
for violent crime are male,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:37.430
but 94% of the people who have
been given awards for heroism

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.040
by the Carnegie
Foundation are male.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.390
A quarter of those died,
instantly giving their life,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.720
often a stranger, to
come to their aid.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.380
So gender is very important.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.370
The neuroscience of that
is very interesting.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:52.986
Men and women face
different threats.

00:26:52.986 --> 00:26:54.860
They're threat detection
wiring is different.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.026
I wish I could go into that.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.890
Let's see.

00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:08.360
I'll just end on one thing, that
it has been known for some time

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.000
that stimulating the
hypothalamic attack

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.820
region in animals, in addition
to inducing aggression,

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.280
can induce copulation.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.760
So you know through
literature and psychology,

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.250
there's always this connection
between sex and violence.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.200
Now what we never knew
is if you stimulate

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.360
this hypothalamic
region, are you

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.130
stimulating nerve
fibers that are just

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:32.990
passing by your
electrode, and the neurons

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.790
or somewhere else in the brain?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.430
Well, it turns out-- recent
work by David Anderson

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.380
and his colleagues at Caltech
using the new methods,

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.060
optogenetics, that found
that they stimulate neurons

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.560
in the hypothalamic region,
and the same neurons control

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.520
copulation and aggression.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.770
And they use a fiber optic laser
to stimulate these neurons,

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:55.910
and they can switch--

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.230
flip of a switch--

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:01.700
make this mouse go from
mating to fighting.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.780
So that's interesting.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.130
So in conclusion, I want
to say that understanding

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.930
is the first step in
controlling anything.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.620
So I hope that people can
understand that we all

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.740
have this circuitry,
how it works,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.500
that it's an amazingly
intricate and elaborate circuit.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.980
I hope that people can
benefit from understanding

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.470
how it can misfire and
that we do need better ways

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.450
to control aggression,
particularly these days when

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.979
we have so much aggression.

00:28:31.979 --> 00:28:33.770
The police are always
looking for a motive.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.895
I understand what they say.

00:28:34.895 --> 00:28:36.019
We're looking for a motive.

00:28:36.019 --> 00:28:37.070
But there is no motive.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.004
It's a rage-induced violence.

00:28:41.004 --> 00:28:42.420
And that's what I
hope that we can

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.810
begin to understand by getting
a neuroscience perspective to go

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:50.130
along with the perspective
of psychology and behavior.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.090
So that's it for why we snap.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.820
Thank you.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.710
Now, for something
completely different--

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.406
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.020
I have to go to my second talk.

00:29:10.007 --> 00:29:12.090
I tell you, either of these
talks is over an hour.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:15.610
And the Q&amp;A is the best part,
but we just don't have time.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.294
So let's talk about
the other brain.

00:29:18.294 --> 00:29:19.710
Throughout my
career, I've studied

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.454
how neurons are wired
together in development,

00:29:22.454 --> 00:29:24.870
how they change the strength
of their synaptic connections

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.450
through experience, and
how we store memories.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.880
But did you know that only
15% of the cells in your brain

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.070
are neurons?

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.140
What are the other 85%?

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.400
Well, they're called glia.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.690
The word means glue.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.190
And that's how
they've been regarded

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:40.140
is just packing material.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:44.334
Glia do not fire
electrical impulses,

00:29:44.334 --> 00:29:46.500
so they're considered the
cellular domestic servants

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.259
of neurons.

00:29:47.259 --> 00:29:49.800
They clean up after neurons, or
they remove neurotransmitters

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.990
and maintain the ionic balance.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.300
They certainly respond
to injury and disease.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.920
But in recent years,
neuroscientists

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.190
have come to realize
that these cells do

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.780
far more than anyone expected.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.110
Excuse me, I'm trying
to stay on time.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.250
These cells do far more
than anyone ever expected.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.050
In fact, glia are involved in
every aspect of brain function

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.570
in health and
disease, and they're

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.520
overturning our
century-old assumption

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:16.355
about how the brain works.

00:30:16.355 --> 00:30:17.980
So this is what I
call the other brain.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.490
It's an exciting new
frontier of science

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.960
that's only now being explored.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.180
So I want to describe to you
the major kinds of glial cells,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.680
tell you some of
the things they do.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.500
I'm going to have to skip
a lot of things they do--

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.740
hit the high points.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:35.070
And some of this work's
from my lab, but most of it

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.510
comes from discoveries
from around the world.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.960
And I'm speaking here today
in a personal capacity

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.460
and not representing, in an
official way, the NIH at all.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.860
But first, let's trace back
to the roots of the story

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.540
and try to understand
how we could

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:53.120
have overlooked half the brain,
especially brain scientists.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.600
So this is the object
of our fascination.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.660
You know, all our
thoughts, our intellect,

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.890
our emotions, our compassion,
hate, reasoning, perceptions,

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.900
creativity, music,
art, everything

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.760
comes out of this bodily organ.

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.395
Our unconscious
automatic responses--

00:31:07.395 --> 00:31:13.250
our respiration control,
temperature control,

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:15.320
kinds of things I was
just talking about--

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.960
threat detection,
our personality,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:22.850
and our identity, our
memories, our cycles of sleep--

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:26.210
all of this comes from
two-and-a-half pounds of flesh

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.447
that can think.

00:31:28.447 --> 00:31:30.155
Yet to look at it, we
don't have idea how

00:31:30.155 --> 00:31:31.520
it does any of those things.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.620
And the reason is that the
working parts of the brain

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.110
are so concentrated
and minute, they're

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:41.750
invisible to the human eye.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.440
Yet, our fundamental idea
about how the brain works

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.780
hasn't changed in 100 years.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.660
We're so accustomed to this
analogy of the brain working

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.030
as an electronic circuit
that it's difficult for us

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.255
to think that it might operate
in any other way, but it could.

00:31:56.255 --> 00:31:58.880
And it's hard for us to realize
that when this electric circuit

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.380
analogy was
proposed, it was seen

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.510
as revolutionary
and controversial.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.430
So our understanding
of how the brain works

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:08.150
is based on an Italian
neuroscientist, Golgi,

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:09.650
who developed a
staining method that

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.781
allowed us, for the first
time, to see neurons.

00:32:11.781 --> 00:32:13.280
And you can imagine
their excitement

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:14.988
when they looked at
these exquisite cells

00:32:14.988 --> 00:32:16.760
unlike anything
else in the body.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.250
Ramon y Cajal, looking
at the same tissue,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.150
using the same method saw
something entirely different.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:25.100
Golgi saw that
neurons were connected

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.570
into a hydraulic network.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.770
Hydraulics was the most
advanced science of the day.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.290
That's why we probably
think of the brain working

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.907
like a computer
today, because that's

00:32:31.907 --> 00:32:32.990
the most advanced science.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.510
But he saw it as hydraulics.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:38.390
All of these pathways
are hooked together.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.530
But Cajal was an artist
before he was a scientist,

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:47.520
and he had an ability to
determine function from form.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.840
And looking at
the same material,

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:56.390
he had a sudden insight
that neurons were not

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.320
connected together, that
they-- each one was separate,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.110
and each neuron was separated
by a gulf of separation,

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.120
which he called a synapse.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.240
And he saw logic.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.000
That's what these arrows are.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.890
He realized that the
neurons are polarized,

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.380
that information passes
one way through neurons,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.530
in through the dendrites
and out through the axons.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.990
So all of our ideas about
how the brain worked

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.620
is based on this idea,
the neuron doctrine.

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.000
And that is that communication
and information processing

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.370
in the brain takes place by
electrical signals flowing

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.130
through neurons,
communicating across synapses.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.970
But in the last few
years, scientists

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:36.460
have become startled to realize
that this assumption is not

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.310
entirely correct.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.860
Now, Cajal made these
insightful discoveries

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.590
with simple tools--
razorblades, simple microscopes.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.144
Here he is working
in his kitchen.

00:33:47.144 --> 00:33:47.810
So it's amazing.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.018
You can't even see a synapse
with a light microscope.

00:33:50.018 --> 00:33:51.560
It's smaller than you can see.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.800
Today, we use the most
advanced electron microscopy

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.710
supercomputers.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.880
This is from Mark Ellisman's
lab in UC San Diego.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.240
In order to study to
understand neural structure,

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.930
here's, from his
lab, one neuron.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.420
One neuron can have up
to 100,000 synapses.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.389
That's what these little
spines are on these dendrites.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.429
Your brain and spinal
cord are comprised

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:17.570
of 100 billion neurons, all
have to be connected, correct?

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.409
But this is not a vacuum
of outer space over here,

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.885
except in our thinking.

00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:25.760
So let's look at what
the tissue really looks

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.630
like-- again, from
Mark Ellisman's lab.

00:34:30.576 --> 00:34:32.409
What we're doing now
is going into the brain

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.840
of a rat at an electron
microscope level,

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.250
peeling away layer at a time.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:37.520
Here's a blood vessel.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.010
There is a nucleus.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.530
Here are the axons going by.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:45.010
The point is only 15% of what
you're seeing are neurons.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.684
And at this magnification,
you can't even see synapses.

00:34:47.684 --> 00:34:49.600
There's got to be enormous
communication going

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.657
on among these cells that is
non-synaptic and non-neuronal.

00:34:55.657 --> 00:34:57.115
And look at the
intricate circuitry

00:34:57.115 --> 00:34:58.120
we were talking about.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.086
And I think you can appreciate
what Cajal achieved.

00:35:01.086 --> 00:35:02.710
Now as you zoom back,
you see that this

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.160
is only a thin section
that's only six-layers thick

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.611
of this mouse brain.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.587
So neurons are great.

00:35:17.587 --> 00:35:19.170
They have these
elaborate cell bodies.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.107
They form these
networks, but so do glia.

00:35:22.107 --> 00:35:24.690
As you got the evolutionary tree
from lower animals to higher,

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.030
you get more glia per
neuron the higher you go up

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.950
on the evolutionary tree.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.530
If you raise an animal in
an enriched environment,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.510
you will get more glia.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:34.560
The brain gets thicker.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.600
It's because you get more glia.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.670
And if that doesn't
interest you,

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.760
when Marian Diamond
here at UC Berkeley

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.430
looked at the brain of Albert
Einstein to try and understand

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.590
why he was so intelligent,
she couldn't find

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.210
any difference in his neurons.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:52.920
But what she found
is that he had

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.780
more glia in the parts of the
brain involved in imagination.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.030
So that's just an observation.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.160
Doesn't prove
anything, but it really

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.250
intrigued people that glia might
be doing more than we think.

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.060
So physiologists, how did
we miss half the brain?

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.010
Well, we used the wrong
tools physiologists

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.990
use tools to study
electrical signals,

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:15.930
but glia don't communicate
using electricity.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.550
So let me invite
you into my lab,

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.410
and I'll show you how
physiologists study the brain.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.040
The first thing we do is we
dissect out the part we want.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:24.960
This is the
hippocampus of a rat.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:29.670
Then, we slice it very thin,
400 microns thick in this case,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:32.070
so that we can keep
this tissue alive.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:38.100
Then, we put this brain
slice into a Faraday cage,

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.887
because we have to exclude all
the electrical interference

00:36:40.887 --> 00:36:41.970
in our modern environment.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.000
We use amplifiers
and stimulators

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.390
so that we can record the
weak signals in neurons

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.160
and synapses.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.618
Here, I'm studying
something called

00:36:49.618 --> 00:36:53.580
LTP where the synapse gets
strengthened during a memory.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.580
The tissue is kept alive in
artificial cerebral spinal

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.690
fluid, warmed, oxygenated.

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.570
And then, we use
these electrodes

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.960
to stimulate and record
the electrical activity.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.160
The point is all of this is
useless, because glia don't

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.750
communicate with electricity.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.110
So what broke it open?

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:22.240
What broke open the other brain
was kids playing video games.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.700
Because playing video
games drove the development

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.900
of faster computers, color
monitors, better video cameras.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.100
So scientists grafted
all that technology

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.975
under the microscope.

00:37:31.975 --> 00:37:35.200
And in the past, we just used
formaldehyde, fixed the tissue,

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.060
stained it, and
looked at dead tissue.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.410
But now with the video
camera on the microscope,

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.990
we could look at living tissue.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:43.510
And new dyes were
developed that work

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:48.210
like this, a glow stick, where
when two compounds get mixed,

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.230
it creates light.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.960
This led to something called
calcium imaging, where dyes

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.940
were developed that calcium--

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.370
when calcium was added, glowed.

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.320
Why was that important?

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.670
Because when neurons fire,
calcium ions come in.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.310
So this would allow us to
put a dye in brain tissue

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.030
and watch neurons fire
electrical activity

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:13.330
and use a microscope instead
of using electrical recording.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:15.340
And it was so exciting,
when we first did this,

00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.290
to see neurons firing.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:20.200
But it exposed the other brain.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.290
The textbook view of
the neuron synapses

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.480
always leaves out this part.

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:27.971
It's really the part
comprised of astrocytes.

00:38:27.971 --> 00:38:29.470
We can find out
what these cells are

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:32.410
doing by using calcium imaging.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.690
And as I'll show you
here, we put a calcium

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.790
dye in with astrocytes.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.530
Pseudocolor, so
calcium is bright red.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:43.830
Watch what's happening.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:47.600
These cells are
communicating, and they're not

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.920
using electricity.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.815
They're communicating
with waves of calcium.

00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:52.440
And watch this.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.610
When I stimulate
the neurons here,

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:54.943
it'll look like lightning bolts.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.550
There-- the
astrocytes responded.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:03.800
So now, we have
non-electric communication

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.670
going through brain
cells, not neurons,

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.045
responding to
electrical activity

00:39:08.045 --> 00:39:12.380
in neurons, no synapses-- all
outside the neuron doctrine.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.680
Why are they doing this?

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.410
How are they doing this?

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:18.750
So quickly discovered
how they're doing this.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.510
And you can participate
in the same way,

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:23.510
because Peter Guthrie
loaned me this image, which

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:27.860
was this experiment in which
they did an experiment to test.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.837
One idea is calcium might just
go through the cell membrane

00:39:30.837 --> 00:39:32.420
through gap junctions,
which are kinds

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.430
of channels between cells.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.680
And that's how calcium
waves go through tissue.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.890
So to prove that, they made
a firebreak, so they just

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.990
scratched off the
cells here in culture,

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.800
started a calcium wave here.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.320
And if this is
the way it worked,

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.830
then the signaling should
stop at the firebreak.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.397
So now, you can
see, the same way

00:39:50.397 --> 00:39:52.730
they did, the first time they
did their experiment, what

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.229
happened.

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.120
Glial cells communicate
by broadcasting signals.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.680
They don't have to be touching.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.800
Those signals are
neurotransmitters.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.870
Quickly, it turned out that
glial cells, astrocytes,

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.450
have the same neurotransmitter
receptors that neurons have

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.280
to communicate at synapses.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.440
And they're releasing the
same neurotransmitters.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.390
That means that they
can communicate,

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.560
but they can also interact
with signaling that's going

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.840
on with neurons at synapses.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.830
So we understand that neuronal
communication by the neuron

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.260
doctrine takes place
by neurotransmitters

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.810
going from presynaptic to
the postsynaptic membrane.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.684
Of course, there's never
anything else shown,

00:40:33.684 --> 00:40:35.440
but let's take a
look at here at glia.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.870
These are actual glial
cells, astrocytes.

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.104
When the neurotransmitter
is released,

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:41.770
it definitely signals
to the other cell,

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.050
but it's also picked
up by the astrocyte.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.960
The astrocyte, in turn,
releases neurotransmitters

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.770
that can regulate.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.490
It can augment or inhibit
synaptic transmission.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.850
So astrocytes can control
the strength of the synapse.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.970
And because they can
signal among each other

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:00.910
without electricity,
they can send that signal

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.440
to a different
part of the brain,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.740
release signaling compounds
and neurotransmitters

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.530
to control a synapse in a
different part of the brain

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.960
that's not wired to
this part through

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.360
a non-electric mechanism
of communication,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.410
through non-neurons.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.340
That's what I call
the other brain.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.462
And so this, I think,
is so fascinating.

00:41:18.462 --> 00:41:19.420
Here's another picture.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.030
I just love watching
these cells communicating.

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.825
So we're 100 years behind
understanding glia--

00:41:25.825 --> 00:41:27.540
again from Mark Ellisman's lab.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.790
We don't know the basic
things about their morphology.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:31.100
They're really complicated.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.710
They fill all the space
between neurons and interact

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.669
with the synapses.

00:41:34.669 --> 00:41:36.710
And what was recently
discovered, a big surprise,

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.040
is that they form
non-overlapping domains.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.550
So they divide up the cerebral
cortex into separate domains.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.130
We don't know why, but
it seems that astrocytes

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.770
may impose a higher
level of structure

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.640
on information
processing in the brain.

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.590
You can look at a
neuron from a rat,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.920
and it's identical to
a neuron in a human.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.180
Not true for astrocytes.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.630
Human astrocytes are unique.

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:02.780
They're even different
from primate astrocytes.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:03.800
They're huge.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.430
One human astrocyte can
encompass two million synapses.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:11.120
And an interesting experiment
by Nedergaard and Goldman,

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.760
they transplanted human
astrocytes into mice,

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.270
and it made these
mice brilliant.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:21.340
They ran mazes
quicker, and synapses

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:24.321
strengthened much easier.

00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:25.820
Moving on to other
things astrocytes

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.185
do-- astrocytes are
associated with blood vessels.

00:42:28.185 --> 00:42:29.810
I told you they take
neurotransmitters.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:33.955
They dump the waste from
synapses and neurons

00:42:33.955 --> 00:42:34.830
into the bloodstream.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.920
They also take nutrients
out of the bloodstream

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.320
and deliver them to the neurons.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.570
Look this intricate structure.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:41.930
If you could see, they're
interacting with synapses.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:44.990
But this also involves
astrocytes and all kinds

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:48.680
of vascular disorders.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.520
Astrocytes also
control blood flow.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.850
This is from Eric Newman's lab.

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.810
Here is a blood
vessel in the retina.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:55.070
Here's an astrocyte.

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:58.130
And he's stimulated the neurons
to fire by shining a light.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.110
You'll see that here
with the yellow dot.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.434
And look what happens
to the blood vessel.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.090
Astrocytes control the local
swelling and constriction

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:13.310
of blood vessels in the
brain, so in response

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.170
to neural activity.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.800
You may be familiar
with fMRI, which is used

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.570
to image activity in the brain.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.310
That's based on
local blood flow.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.100
It doesn't sense neural
activity directly.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.340
It's sensing
oxygenated hemoglobin.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.980
And the astrocytes are
controlling that local blood

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.735
flow.

00:43:32.735 --> 00:43:36.451
Neurodegenerative
diseases overlooked glia,

00:43:36.451 --> 00:43:38.950
and now we know they're involved
in all kinds of disorders--

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.240
ALS, Parkinson's, epilepsy.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.985
Don't have time to go into it.

00:43:42.985 --> 00:43:45.110
Brain cancer has almost
nothing to do with neurons,

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.560
because neurons don't divide.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.030
And cancers run
away cell division.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:55.700
But new research
developing new drugs

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:58.000
that can target
these brain cells

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.940
is leading to new therapies
to treat brain cancer.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.530
And here, this one's coming
right in on the cancer better

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.180
than surgery.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.890
This was a surprise--

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:10.670
astrocytes and glia involved
in psychiatric illnesses.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:12.530
Schizophrenia,
bipolar, depression

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.090
are all associated with
changes in astrocytes

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.169
and the other glia.

00:44:17.169 --> 00:44:18.710
We understand these
are all disorders

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.110
of synaptic transmission,
and we treat them

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.230
with SSRIs and other drugs to
control synaptic transmission.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.930
But what's the cell that does
this in the brain normally?

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.560
Astrocytes.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.490
So astrocytes could be
the cause or be involved

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:33.346
in a number of
psychiatric conditions,

00:44:33.346 --> 00:44:34.970
because they stabilize
the environment.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.845
They release neurotransmitters
and growth factors and whatnot.

00:44:37.845 --> 00:44:45.760
And in fact, discoveries are
often made and then forgotten.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.312
The electroshock
therapy that's used

00:44:48.312 --> 00:44:50.770
for treating depression, still
the most effective treatment

00:44:50.770 --> 00:44:53.140
for depression that can't
be treated in other ways,

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:55.180
where did that crazy idea
come from of shocking

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.900
a person's brain and curing them
of schizophrenia or depression?

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.950
Came from Ladislas
Meduna, who, in the 1930s,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:04.210
was a pathologist.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.480
And he noticed people who died
of schizophrenia and depression

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.580
had fewer astrocytes
in their brain.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:12.280
And people who died of
epilepsy had too many.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.810
So he just said,
oh, these disorders

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.090
are caused by an
imbalance of astrocytes.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.740
So he induced a seizure to
try to make more astrocytes

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:22.701
and cure schizophrenia
and depression.

00:45:22.701 --> 00:45:24.700
And now, we don't know
that that's how it works,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.340
but considering all of the
growth factors and functions

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.520
that astrocytes carry
out, they're certainly

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.520
likely to be part of it.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.622
And new drugs can
be treated to that.

00:45:32.622 --> 00:45:33.830
There are four kinds of glia.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:37.030
So far, I've only
talked about astrocytes.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.070
The brain has its
own immune cell

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.500
isolated from the bloodstream
by the blood brain barrier.

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.090
And these are called microglia.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.910
And in these experiments
by the [? Gann ?] lab,

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:47.710
engineered a mouse
genetically so

00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:49.900
that the microglia
fluoresce green.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.400
Then, he put a
window in the cranium

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.358
and stuck the mouse's
head under the microscope

00:45:53.358 --> 00:45:55.330
and looked into the
brain and then could

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:56.920
see what these
microglia are doing.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.470
In addition, he created an
injury with a laser beam,

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:04.040
and here's what they found.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.260
These cells were dynamic.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.850
They were moving.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:09.130
And when you create an
injury, they were like Marines

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.620
descending on this-- it could
be a bacteria or a virus

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.610
or an injury--

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:13.360
to deal with this.

00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.193
So this is going on in
your brain right now.

00:46:15.193 --> 00:46:17.770
Those little fingers are going
around checking your synapses

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.200
for damage and whatnot.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.270
Glia are involved in
infectious disease.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:23.590
Good example is HIV.

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:28.480
Doesn't even affect neurons;
yet, there's dementia in HIV.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.120
But it does affect astrocytes.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:36.500
In Alzheimer's, ever
since Alzheimer described

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.400
the disorder, he noticed
microglia involved

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.920
and also these plaques.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.900
Well, these amyloid plaques
are surrounded by microglia.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.410
But we now can see that they're
eating the amyloid involved

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.659
in Alzheimer's.

00:46:48.659 --> 00:46:50.950
And this is thought to be
just a reaction to pathology,

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.575
but now you realize,
well, what if they

00:46:52.575 --> 00:46:55.060
don't carry out this function
normally throughout life?

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.480
That could cause Alzheimer's.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.530
And in fact, new research are
showing that microglia becomes

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:05.140
senescent ahead of the neuronal
dysfunctions in the brain,

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.190
indicating a role of microglia
in initiating Alzheimer's.

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:12.290
Chronic pain, it also involves--

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.060
and morphine addiction
also involves microglia.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.520
And chronic pain is a
pain that won't go away

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.359
after your injury heals.

00:47:20.359 --> 00:47:22.150
You have an injury to
the peripheral nerve.

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:25.660
It turns out that the microglia
inside the spinal cord

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.630
become reactive.

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:27.490
They change.

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:30.910
They start to release
substances like cytokines

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:34.930
and other factors that
make neurons excitable.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:38.260
So your pain neurons are
firing because the microglia

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.300
are stimulating them.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.600
And here, you can see
microglia releasing

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.700
these vesicles full of all
of these kinds of substances

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.620
that excite neurons
and cause pain.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.630
This is also important
in opiate addiction,

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.180
because opiates decrease
neural activity.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.160
Turns out microglia
release substances

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.545
to bring it back to
normal, and you ratchet it

00:47:59.545 --> 00:48:02.290
up so that you now need more
and more and more morphine.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.630
And if you block the
morphine, then you

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.190
have this terrible rebound.

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:09.490
So microglia are
involved in that.

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:11.230
Another interesting
aspect of microglia

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:14.380
is that many people will take
marijuana to control pain

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:15.730
and inflammation.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.905
They don't want the
cognitive side effects.

00:48:17.905 --> 00:48:20.290
And it turns out that
the receptor that

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:23.350
is important in
inflammation and pain

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.100
is on microglia, not on neurons,
is called a CB2 receptor.

00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:29.950
And this is leading to new drugs
that can treat pain and not

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.720
involve--

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.930
not have the cognitive effects.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.440
Now, I'm going to end
with myelin-forming cells.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.810
These cells form electrical
insulation on the axons.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.300
We've cut an exon here
in half, nerve fiber.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.490
And it's wrapped around
this membrane of insulation

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.750
like electrical tape.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.110
Schwann cells, spindle-shaped
cells, do that in your arms

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:50.970
and trunk, the peripheral
nervous system.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.940
And these octopus cells do this
in the central nervous system,

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.380
a very different cell.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.620
Now, I want to show you
the experiment that got me

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.160
into neuron-glia interactions.

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.270
And this looks a little old,
because this is old technology.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:06.060
But I put DRG neurons,
which are sensory neurons--

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:08.880
the ones that sense
pain and touch--

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.550
in culture, these big
round circles here.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.450
And then I added Schwann cells.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.410
I stimulated the
neurons to fire.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.160
I used that calcium dye.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.890
And certainly, the
neurons responded.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:24.690
But then to my surprise,
the Schwann cells did.

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:25.210
No synapses.

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:27.830
And again, why is
this happening?

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:28.780
How does it happen?

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.980
What are the consequences?

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.634
That's what got me interested.

00:49:31.634 --> 00:49:33.550
Then, I moved into the
central nervous system,

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:37.220
because oligodendrocytes
are the myelin-forming cells

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.340
in the central nervous system.

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:41.140
Cells unlike any
other cell in the body

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:44.740
can wrap up to 100 layers
of membrane around an axon

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:47.950
through 50 different
processes simultaneously.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.920
Could they be involved
in cognitive function?

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.540
So myelinating glia changed the
way impulses are transmitted.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.970
They accelerate the
speed of transmission

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:01.810
by constraining
impulses to be generated

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:05.660
only at these bare patches every
millimeter or so long the axon.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:07.120
So they act like repeaters.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.210
So vertebrates are the only
animals that have myelin,

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:14.430
and the conduction velocity
is 50 times faster.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.406
Half the brain is
composed of white matter.

00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:19.030
The gray matter is
what you hear about.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:20.946
That's where the neurons
are and the dendrite,

00:50:20.946 --> 00:50:23.700
but the white matter is
all bundles of these axons.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.490
And by and large, people
ignored white matter,

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.100
because the interesting stuff
was going on up here, according

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.630
to the neuron doctrine.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.240
The human brain, half of
it is white matter, more

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.010
than any other animal--

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:36.540
a mouse brain's only 10%--

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.740
because we have so
many connections.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.462
We can see these here
with imaging DTI.

00:50:42.462 --> 00:50:44.920
So I'm going to show you here
what white matter looks like.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:48.340
I showed you similar
images of gray matter.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:51.610
This is, again, serial
electron microscopy.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:54.280
I need to make the point
that the structure of myelin

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.554
is submicroscopic.

00:50:55.554 --> 00:50:57.220
You can't see it with
light microscopes.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.330
You need electron microscopy.

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.670
So we go through.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:02.230
This happens to the optic nerve.

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:04.240
Here's the capillary, axons.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.360
When we find a node of
Ranvier, we can trace it,

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:09.020
put that in the computer.

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.840
This is only one-half
a micron distance.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:16.120
And then, we can
reconstruct the structure

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.200
of the node of Ranvier.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.950
This is understood
that myelin's important

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:23.410
in de-myelinating disorders,
like multiple sclerosis,

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:26.551
because if you have a conduction
block, conduction failure,

00:51:26.551 --> 00:51:28.300
you're going to have
a functional failure.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.850
But I wondered, could myelin
be involved in learning?

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.280
And here's the avenue--

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.230
here's what intrigued
me, that imaging

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.170
began to show that all kinds
of neurological diseases

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:40.730
had changes in white matter.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.820
This is just brain imaging.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.300
Things like dyslexia, autism,
stuttering, psychiatric

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.480
disorders associated with
changes in white matter.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.700
These are synaptic disorders.

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.810
And differences in
cognitive ability

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.020
is associated with white
matter differences.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.060
If you're good at
music or bad at music,

00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.900
if you're good at
arithmetic or bad,

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:02.040
there are differences in
white matter structure.

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.970
Now, we're not talking
about dysfunction.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.640
We're talking about
normal ranges of function.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.250
So another important
thing to know

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:13.010
about white matter and myelin
is that it's not done at birth.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:16.900
It takes place throughout
life and is shown here

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:20.170
in increasing colors of blue in
the human brain from the back

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.580
of the cortex to the front.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.640
Prefrontal cortex
is not myelinated

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.300
until your early 20s.

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:29.280
That's also why the
prefrontal cortex judgment

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.500
higher-level executive
function can't really

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.990
take place until the early 20s.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.150
That's when we get
legal responsibility.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.260
But the question is, why?

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:40.319
If it was just insulation,
why wasn't it done

00:52:40.319 --> 00:52:41.110
when you were born?

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:43.120
Why do we see
myeling taking place

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.040
over childhood and
adolescence where

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:48.760
we understand experience
sculpts and guides

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.840
the connections in the brain?

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:54.160
So this led to a theory
that myelin could be plastic

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.270
and involved in learning.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:58.070
And I think this was
a head-scratcher,

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.020
but it'd probably be
really obvious to you

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.450
working in the internet.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:07.950
And this is what we're calling
activity-dependent myelin.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:12.130
Myelin's function is to regulate
production velocity, speed

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.732
impulse conduction.

00:53:13.732 --> 00:53:15.190
We like to think
of the human brain

00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:17.800
as the most complicated
network in the universe,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.891
and to do any kind of
cognitive function,

00:53:19.891 --> 00:53:22.390
you need to send information
from one relay point to another

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:26.507
to another in order to
carry out this function.

00:53:26.507 --> 00:53:28.090
I don't know about
the internet, but I

00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:31.060
know in transportation,
the most important thing is

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:32.710
when I get to my relay point.

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:34.420
If I'm flying to
San Francisco, I

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.930
need to get my connection
in Chicago simultaneously

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:39.310
with my connecting flight.

00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:42.040
If I get there too
late, it doesn't work.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.590
If I get there five hours
early, that's not optimal.

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:46.460
Has a lot of disadvantages.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:47.950
We know that the
conduction speed

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:50.860
through all of these
pathways in the brain

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.900
varies from a slow walk--

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:56.710
pace of a slow walk to
the pace of a Ferrari.

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.180
How did all those
speeds get set?

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.265
If they're not set right,
then you'll have dysfunction.

00:54:01.265 --> 00:54:04.600
And so it seemed to me likely
that maybe functional feedback

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.020
experience could
change the myelination

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.710
and then, therefore, promote
synchrony, spike time arrival.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.290
So that's how myeling
could be involved.

00:54:14.290 --> 00:54:17.164
Studies in other labs have
shown that after learning

00:54:17.164 --> 00:54:19.330
there are changes in white
matter-- here's juggling.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:21.760
But it's been done with
classroom learning, video game

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.670
learning, every kind of
learning you can think of.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.400
But now, we're completely
uncharted waters.

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.950
And we've always been
thinking of the synapse.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:34.240
But now, if we're going to
involve myelin in learning,

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.650
there's so many questions.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:38.620
This has to be a not
synoptic communication

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.330
but action potentials.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:43.090
How do myelinating glia
sense activity in axons?

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:44.170
There are no synapses.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.000
How would it modify myeling?

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.950
Would it be important
in information

00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.050
processing and learning?

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:50.530
And just how plastic is myeling?

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.120
People think of it as static.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.550
So in my lab, we do our
studies of cell culture.

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:55.870
We have electrodes.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.000
We put in sensory
neurons here, and we

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.060
put on myelinating
glia oligodendrocytes.

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:04.060
We stimulate them in
culture any way we want.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.120
And we can study the effects of
neural activity on myelination.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.600
We can do gene analysis
on the glial cells

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.742
and see how they respond
to electrical firing.

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:14.950
We can block signals-- we're
like neurotransmitters--

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.480
and understand how this
communication is taking place.

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.580
We can do calcium imaging.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.430
Here's an oligo on
axons that are red.

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.150
And when I stimulate the
axons, the oligodendrocyte

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:27.340
responds no synapses,
no neuron doctrine.

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.480
And if I put it botulinum toxin,
which blocks vesicle release

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.600
and stimulates the neurons,
the oligodendrocytes

00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.630
still responded.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.780
That tells us that in
addition to vesicles

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.582
releasing neurotransmitters,
there are non-vesicular means,

00:55:40.582 --> 00:55:42.790
like channels, that are
releasing neurotransmitters--

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:44.620
all kinds of mechanism
communication

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:46.240
activity-dependent
that we've ignored,

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.630
because we're so
focused on the synapse.

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.030
Our work has shown that
electrical activity promotes

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:53.900
the initiation of myelination.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:55.960
This means that
electrically-active axons

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.430
are preferentially myelinated.

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.650
So as you're learning
to play the piano,

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:03.550
those pathways become
preferentially myelinated.

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:05.890
We've identified a number
of the cellular mechanisms,

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:08.920
the signals involved
over the years.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:09.820
This is from our lab.

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.700
And other labs are
finding new signals.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.290
The whole point is that
we're likely to find

00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.290
as many mechanisms
of myelin plasticity

00:56:17.290 --> 00:56:19.420
as there are for
synaptic plasticity.

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:21.730
It's just that we're
just getting started.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:25.280
And most recent work
is Richardson's lab

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.040
used a mouse
genetically-modified so

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.260
that it couldn't form
new myelin and trained

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.150
it to run on this
wheel missing rungs,

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:32.720
and it learned more slowly.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:36.020
So myelin facilitated
learning in this case.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:38.110
So here's what the neuron
doctrine left out--

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:41.470
astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
Schwann cells, micro glia,

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:43.490
and all the communication,
rich communication

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.100
going on among these cells.

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.780
All types of glia sense and
respond to neural activity.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.380
Glia communicate with each
other and with neurons.

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.855
They regulate the
neuronal brain.

00:56:52.855 --> 00:56:56.330
They're central to psychiatric
neurological disorders.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:59.740
And myeling speeds
impulse conduction

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.720
may be very important as
a new set of mechanism

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.330
of learning to promote synchrony
and optimal flow of information

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:07.730
through complex networks.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:09.320
And it's important that--

00:57:11.964 --> 00:57:13.630
OK, I had some other
things, and they're

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.710
showing-- oh, there it is.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:19.130
The neuron doctrine doesn't work
without glia, I don't think.

00:57:19.130 --> 00:57:21.890
Glia work in different ways.

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.950
They broadcast signals, and
neurons communicate serially.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:26.210
They communicate slowly.

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.460
Every movie I showed
you was sped up.

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:32.090
But if glia did the same
thing as neurons, why would

00:57:32.090 --> 00:57:32.900
we have the?

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.640
So we have to look at glia
through a different lens.

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.240
And this offers new
possibilities for new drugs

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.610
and alternative treatments that
were directed towards glia.

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.724
And if you want to know
more, this is the book.

00:57:45.724 --> 00:57:47.390
And what I tried to
capture in this book

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:51.230
was the excitement
of neuroscientists

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:55.030
on the cusp of a new
vision of the brain

00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:58.700
that completely overturned
previous thinking.

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.200
And I wanted to
capture that moment.

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.537
This happens in science all
the time in every field,

00:58:02.537 --> 00:58:04.870
and this is what's happening
right now in brain science.

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:07.119
So I'd like to thank you
very much for your attention.

00:58:07.119 --> 00:58:07.757
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:07.757 --> 00:58:09.590
SPEAKER: We're going
to take some questions.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:14.650
Feel free to come up to
the mice and ask questions.

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.960
Meanwhile, I'm going
to ask a question.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.910
So if I understood
correctly, glia cells

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:25.010
regulate functioning of the
neuronal parts of the brain.

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:28.760
Like for example, when we
see activity in the fMRI,

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.300
that's sort of the
glia or astrocytes

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:35.710
specifically regulating
what parts get activated.

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.399
Is that correct?

00:58:36.399 --> 00:58:37.690
DOUGLAS FIELDS: That's correct.

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:40.720
So the glia are sensing
neural activity,

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.010
and they're responding to it.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:44.410
And they're modulating
neural activity.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:47.500
And they're modulating
also local blood flow.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.269
So fMRI is interesting.

00:58:49.269 --> 00:58:51.310
We take it for granted
that you can look at-- you

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.454
can put-- give someone
a cognitive task

00:58:53.454 --> 00:58:55.870
and look in the brain and see
what part of the brain, what

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:56.869
circuitry is involved.

00:58:56.869 --> 00:58:58.660
But you realize we're
doing that by looking

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.280
at blood-- local blood flow.

00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.900
And astrocytes are
controlling that.

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:03.400
But that raises the
bigger question,

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.292
what if that didn't happen?

00:59:05.292 --> 00:59:07.750
So right now as we're talking,
different parts of our brain

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.960
are being activated, and that
means that astrocytes are

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.450
controlling local blood flow.

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.830
If that didn't happen, what
would happen to cognition?

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.830
The neurons wouldn't
get enough glucose,

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:20.710
and they would build
up too much potassium.

00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:24.515
So beyond this
importance in imaging,

00:59:24.515 --> 00:59:26.140
it raises a really
fundamental question

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.680
that I think is really not
explored, is how glia and blood

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.592
flow is actually
controlling our cognition

00:59:31.592 --> 00:59:32.800
or allowing it to take place.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.660
SPEAKER: Mm-hmm.

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:40.210
Are we anywhere close to
learning how to regulate glia,

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.730
so like how to regulate
the regulation,

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:43.810
if we wanted to do that--

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:44.320
DOUGLAS FIELDS: Yeah, we are.

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.820
SPEAKER: --to enhance focus and
learning and things like that?

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:46.872
DOUGLAS FIELDS: Exactly.

00:59:46.872 --> 00:59:48.038
So we have to get new tools.

00:59:48.038 --> 00:59:49.480
This is very hard.

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:51.580
And there are new
tools being developed.

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.160
I also have to say
part of the reason we

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:58.720
overlooked half the brain is
the nature of how science works.

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.500
If you worked on
unimportant cells,

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:04.329
you weren't likely
to get grants.

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:06.370
Your papers didn't get
published in big journals.

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:08.080
Nobody heard about it.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.420
People's careers
were really stifled,

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:12.940
because they worked
on glia cells.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.380
And now, we have that problem.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.921
We understand the
glia are important.

01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:21.810
But if you work on
synaptic transmission

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:23.790
as a neurophysiologist,
you're not

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:26.800
necessarily eager to have
that picture complicated,

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:29.880
bring in another cell, whole
other kind of technique.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.440
And so the field is struggling
right now to make advances,

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.860
to get new techniques
that everyone will accept.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.140
And there is this enormous--

01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:41.609
almost a conflict of interest.

01:00:41.609 --> 01:00:43.650
Because if you're studying
synaptic transmission,

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.066
you don't want to
understand-- you

01:00:45.066 --> 01:00:47.130
don't want to have to
start studying myelin.

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:48.870
But new tools need
to be developed,

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:51.150
and people are working
very hard to make them.

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.610
SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:53.800
AUDIENCE: Yes, a question.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.310
It's a very interesting talk.

01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:59.250
About on the snap, you
said the SEALs actually

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:03.390
get trained not to react like--

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:05.070
have those snaps.

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.230
So what kind of
training they receive?

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.939
I'm very curious.

01:01:07.939 --> 01:01:09.855
DOUGLAS FIELDS: Well,
the Navy works on these,

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:11.270
and he described some of the--

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:15.720
they have exercises to
teach them to control

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.010
these aggressive responses.

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.650
So they have very
specific programs.

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:22.470
One was they called the hooded--

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:25.110
they put a hood on them, and
then they take off the hood.

01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:27.480
And there's all kinds
of threats around them.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.560
There might be a hostage
situation or something.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.495
And they have to analyze
very systematically,

01:01:31.495 --> 01:01:32.370
what are the threats?

01:01:32.370 --> 01:01:33.670
Prioritize them.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:36.270
In other words, they rely
on cognitive function

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:41.310
to break down the threats
and respond not just on a gut

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:41.910
level.

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.570
At the same time, you'll
talk to these guys--

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:45.736
and I also interviewed a
lot of fascinating people--

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.570
Secret Service but
also sports figures.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.310
They also rely on their gut.

01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:53.460
They'll walk into a
building in Afghanistan

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.130
and say, this just
doesn't feel right.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.470
And they'll leave and
find out that there's--

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.840
and it blows up when
they walk out the door.

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.940
And that's because your threat
detection mechanism is fast,

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.440
I told you.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.630
That's one reason.

01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:06.610
It's fast.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:10.020
But it's also much more capable
of handling enormous amounts

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.490
of information.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:14.070
We can hold eight digits
in our mind at once--

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:16.470
that's pathetic-- in
our consciousness.

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:18.060
That's why we can't
do long division.

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:20.643
It's not difficult, but we can't
hold that intermediate answer

01:02:20.643 --> 01:02:22.620
long enough to do the next step.

01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:25.080
Your unconscious
brain is constantly

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.440
crunching enormous amount of
data about your internal state,

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.274
your external state.

01:02:29.274 --> 01:02:31.190
That's how I was able
to do that in Barcelona.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:32.820
That's what amazed
me is that we all

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:37.160
have this ability to
constantly survey for dangers.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.410
And so people do learn--

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:43.170
who work at high
levels of performance--

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:46.410
do learn to trust their gut and
how to develop that as well.

01:02:46.410 --> 01:02:47.516
So it takes both.

01:02:47.516 --> 01:02:48.640
Athletes do the same thing.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.970
I have some stories about
athletes and avalanches

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.349
and skiers and things
where they rely on the gut.

01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:54.140
But think about it.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.460
The most complicated
decisions we make in life

01:02:56.460 --> 01:02:59.940
we don't do rationally--
who to marry, where to live.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:03.050
You can't make a
spreadsheet and come up--

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:04.404
you rely on your gut.

01:03:04.404 --> 01:03:06.570
And that's because there's
too much information, too

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:07.153
many unknowns.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:17.050
AUDIENCE: Our brain processes
images and experiences

01:03:17.050 --> 01:03:19.270
differently from
the way we process

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.630
logical information in math,
computer science, for example.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.600
And I've noticed that some
ancient orators basically

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:30.370
deliver a speech for hours
without looking for any note.

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:35.540
And also, very genius,
like at Tesla and DaVinci,

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.930
they see their invention.

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:43.050
For example, Tesla was able to
see the detailed picture of DC

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:48.140
generator before he actually
did any detailed work.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.450
And in the past few
years, I've been

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:54.470
trying to kind of
combine these techniques

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.060
and try to apply that
in computer science.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:59.360
For example, I-- in
[INAUDIBLE] structure,

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.390
in architecture
stuff, I try to map

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:04.514
that to nursery information.

01:04:04.514 --> 01:04:05.930
Like when I walk
though nursery, I

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:07.600
get a lot of
inspiration, the way

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.490
they arrange the flowers
and the trees, everything.

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.820
So my question for
you is, can you

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.240
shed some light on how
our brain works in terms

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.710
of recalling experience?

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:20.770
For example, your
experience in Barcelona

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:23.585
is so vivid, where you jumped
to street and got into the taxi.

01:04:23.585 --> 01:04:27.040
It cost you 176 euros
to evade from thugs.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.600
It is so vivid.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.710
So you will never
forget about that.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:33.570
Versus some math formula or
some computer [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.100
data structure, it will be
more difficult to recall.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.860
So how do you-- if we combine
these two parts of brain

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.760
and work together, can you
shed some light on underlying

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.910
scientific mechanisms?

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:45.710
Well, those are good questions.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:47.293
You've combined a
couple of questions.

01:04:47.293 --> 01:04:49.680
So first in terms of
what goes into memory,

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:52.266
memory is not about
recording the past.

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:54.890
You want to remember that great
parking place you had at Target

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.450
three years ago?

01:04:56.450 --> 01:05:00.240
Most of what we experience
during the day, we forget.

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:03.710
And so what you
remember are experiences

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.480
that are likely to
have significance

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.670
for the future, survival value.

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:09.260
And so as you go
to sleep at night,

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.330
you relive your
experiences of the day,

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:14.750
and that's when short-term
memories get converted

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:15.760
to long-term memories.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:19.200
And my lab's done
research on this as well.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.610
And so things that are
novel are likely to be

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:24.890
important for the future.

01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:28.670
If you have bad food
at a restaurant,

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:29.960
you don't need to do it twice.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:32.650
You're not going to
do eat that again.

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:35.535
So emotion-- and we understand
very much about the physiology

01:05:35.535 --> 01:05:36.410
about how that works.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:37.951
Emotion is one of
the things, novelty

01:05:37.951 --> 01:05:40.370
is one of the things that
converts short-term memory

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.480
to long-term memory.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.690
Your second question
was about vision.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:48.050
Vision is an extremely important
sense for human beings.

01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:51.410
Not true for mice
and other animals.

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:52.880
And we have an amazing capacity.

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.829
You're right.

01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:56.370
There have been
studies-- and I don't

01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:57.620
want to give the wrong answer.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:59.420
But you can look
through a magazine

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:02.940
that you've looked through
a couple of years ago

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.750
and identify every picture.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.560
Yeah, I've seen that picture.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.160
That's normal.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.250
We have an amazing
capacity for visual memory.

01:06:11.250 --> 01:06:14.610
That is because a third
of our cerebral cortex

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:15.920
is devoted to vision.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.150
It is such an important
process for us.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:19.770
I interviewed
somebody in the book

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:23.230
who was a blind person,
who's congenitally blind.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.980
And she doesn't have
pigment in her retina.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:29.340
And so there's no
question about it

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:34.650
being malingering or something.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.200
We did put her in an
fMRI, and she can't see.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.380
But a third of her cortex is
sitting there with nothing

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:41.160
to do.

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:44.520
So what happens is other
senses get wired to the cortex.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:49.910
She can see pictures by putting
her fingers over a page,

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:53.160
and she's probably picking up
on little thermal differences.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.170
We can do this,
maybe, if we practice.

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.970
I mean, we could all play the
violin I suppose, in theory.

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:03.890
But she's using
this enormous brain

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:07.800
power that has nothing to do,
normally devoted to vision.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.110
She can echolocate
walking around.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:14.100
She has tremendous synesthesia,
because her senses get mixed.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:20.580
She can read five times
faster than anyone else--

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:22.720
than the sighted person.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.430
And it just turns up the speed
until it sounds like gibberish,

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:28.442
and that's no problem
for her to decode it.

01:07:28.442 --> 01:07:30.150
Because the brain
power is devoted to it.

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:32.970
So it's true, vision
is very important.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:35.340
And people who do have
these remarkable abilities

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:37.830
from memory, one of the
tricks they always use

01:07:37.830 --> 01:07:38.670
is to make an image.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:41.572
It makes them concoct some
image of a monkey sitting

01:07:41.572 --> 01:07:43.530
on a chair that reminds
them of something else.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:45.029
They create this
big scene, and then

01:07:45.029 --> 01:07:47.250
they just describe the scene.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:48.731
Yep.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.610
AUDIENCE: So I just
had a quick question.

01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:53.590
So what advances in
imaging technology

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:58.050
are going to be needed to
really continue to progress

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.670
the study of glia cells?

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:00.600
DOUGLAS FIELDS: Yeah.

01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:02.110
Well, I'm working
on some of my labs

01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:05.670
that will allow me to look at
myelin structure in a living

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:10.350
mouse without any dyes or
genetic engineering using

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:16.895
new spectroscopy methods
adapted to imaging.

01:08:16.895 --> 01:08:18.770
I think there's a lot
of development imaging.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:21.062
The two photon and the
[INAUDIBLE] focal imaging

01:08:21.062 --> 01:08:22.020
have been a great help.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.479
Fiber optic cameras
have been a great help.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:27.720
Really, building cameras--
building microscopes

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.170
that are miniature microscopes
that can be put on the skull

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:35.560
and connected with a fiber
optic lens into the brain,

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:37.260
and then we can
see neurons firing.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.910
So that's one area.

01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:42.390
There's a lot of area-- because
optogenetics stimulates neurons

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:46.529
with light, being able to direct
laser beams so that you can not

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:49.029
just stimulate a
whole bunch of tissue,

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:52.470
but you can target individual
cells-- imagine that--

01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:54.810
and begin to decode
this network.

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:57.750
Because you can activate
specific cells in any sequence,

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:00.689
and you can record the
responses with the camera

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:02.880
to all of these, this
whole population, things

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:05.580
you could never do with
the electrode-- not never.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:09.529
Never say never-- but very
hard to do with electrodes.

01:09:09.529 --> 01:09:11.177
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:09:11.177 --> 01:09:13.010
SPEAKER: OK, I wish we
could have more time.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:14.960
But we're going to wrap up.

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.670
Thank you all so
much for coming.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.170
And thanks to Dr.
Douglas Fields.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.200
This was really fascinating.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.700
DOUGLAS FIELDS:
Thank you very much.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.150
