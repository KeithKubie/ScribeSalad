00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.180
- [Narrator] This
program is a presentation

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.383
of UCTV for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:17.193
(bright instrumental music)

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180
- So let's see if I'm doing my math right,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.180
today is day 2585 of our
90 day mission to Mars.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.257
(audience clapping)

00:01:00.257 --> 00:01:02.500
The mission is still
going on and in the next

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.360
hour or so I'm gonna try to share with you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.810
some of the adventure story that has been

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.550
the Mars Exploration Rover project.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.040
This of course is Mars,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.260
the object of our affections,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.330
it's a truly terrible place.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.680
If you went there you
would absolutely hate it.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.800
The average temperature is about

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.330
60 degrees below zero, Celsius.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.660
It goes down to minus 100 at night.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.770
If you took all the water
vapor on the Martian surface

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.930
and you condensed it out,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.280
took all the water vapor
in the Martian atmosphere

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.330
and condensed it out
on the planet's surface

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.150
you'd make a layer of frost barely

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.000
one hundredth of a millimeter thick.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.960
So it's a cold and dry
and desolate world today.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.750
But in the past it was different.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.360
This is a picture that
was taken from orbit,

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.980
and it shows a little sinuous valley

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.350
across the Martian surface and this valley

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.120
was carved by flowing water.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.890
In fact you can look up here and you can

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.100
actually see in the upper right the little

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.490
channel through which
the water that carved

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.583
that valley flowed.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.580
But you can't do this on Mars today.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.570
On Mars today it's too cold,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.300
and it's too dry to allow
something like this to happen.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.150
So what this is telling
us is that in the past

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.650
it was different.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.260
It was warmer, it was wetter,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.910
it may have been more like Earth.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.940
Now any geologist will tell you that

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.940
any place that you have
erosion somewhere else

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.760
there has to be deposition.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.950
And there are places
that you can go on Mars

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.940
where you'll find these wonderful

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.870
sequences of layered sedimentary rocks.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.760
The great thing about
layered sedimentary rocks

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.840
is that they preserve in their details,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.260
in their chemistry, in their texture,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.650
information about what
the conditions were like

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.750
when the rocks were laid down.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.300
So if can go to these rocks,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.790
you can find them and then you can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.550
investigate them with
the right set of tools

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.640
you can read the story that
the rocks have to tell,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.430
about what conditions were
like on Mars long ago.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.530
Was it warm, was it wet,
were there conditions there

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.480
that would have been suitable for life.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.730
So to do this we built
two robot geologists.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.300
This picture was taken at Cape Canaveral

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.930
over seven years ago,
this is the Rover Spirit,

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.790
in the foreground, all tricked
out and ready to go to Mars,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.500
you can see Opportunity
in the background there

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.090
doesn't have her wheels on yet,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.130
on the handsome guy in
the white suit here.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.530
And these rovers
effectively are surrogates.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.390
We explore Mars through their sensors

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.373
we see Mars through their eyes.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.180
The rover itself carries
a scientific payload

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.970
and the scientific payload
comes in two main parts.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.700
One part is supported
by that big fat white

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.050
stovepipe looking thing, that mast there,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.380
and that sports two instruments,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.530
one is a set of very high resolution

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.230
color stereo cameras
at the top of the mast,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.750
and then down at the base of the mast

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.800
there's an infrared spectrometer.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.610
And what that does is
it looks up the inside

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.730
of the mast, it's hollow on the inside,

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.720
and then there's a pair
of mirrors at the top

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.620
that can be used to scan the countryside,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.540
this thing's basically a periscope.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.960
And so the infrared spectrometer

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.360
gets the same view of
Mars that the cameras get.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.910
Once we've identified interesting rocks

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.750
using the camera, using the spectrometer,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.187
we then can drive over to them,

00:04:22.187 --> 00:04:25.000
and on the front end of
the vehicle there's an arm.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.860
The arm has a shoulder,
an elbow, and a wrist,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.720
it has exactly the same
dimensions as my arm,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.260
which is purely a
coincidence. (audience laughs)

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.650
And at the end of the arm there's a hand

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.780
and the hand has four fingers on it,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.810
there's a microscope for telling us

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.230
what the rocks look like close up,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.620
two more spectrometers for telling us

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.620
what the rocks are made of in detail,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.020
and this device here that we call the RAT,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.970
R-A-T the rock abrasion tool.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.940
And that's a diamond tip grinding tool

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.540
that can grind away the
outer surface of a rock,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.730
kind of opening a window
into it's interior

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.703
for the other instruments to look through.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.310
Now the spacecraft that gets
this contraption to Mars

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.720
is built sort of like one
of those Russian doll sets,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.150
you know where there's
a doll inside a doll

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.480
inside a doll, it's like that.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.630
The rover, shown here, folds up in this

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.193
horrifyingly intricate fashion,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.680
to produce a compact little package

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.800
that will then fit inside the lander.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.410
This is the lander here.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.470
Now lander has these three things

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.660
on the sides that we call petals.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.360
Because they're like
the petals of a flower

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.900
and what they do is they fold up

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.500
around the rover,
enclosing it, encasing it,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.790
protecting it, and producing this kind of

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.000
tetrahedral pyramid.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.940
That's what the lander looks like when

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.890
it's all folded up.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.210
That is then encased in
turn in another shell

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.670
that has two parts, the first part here

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.290
is called the heat
shield and what this does

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.230
is protect the vehicle during it's fiery

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.050
descent through the Martian atmosphere.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.840
That cone shaped thing
that goes on the back,

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.590
we call the back shell and that completes

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.100
that outer shell.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.020
And then this kind of blue frisbee

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.640
looking deal on the back end,

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.720
we call that the cruise stage.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.440
And what the cruise stage provides is

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.330
propulsion, electrical power,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.020
the stuff you need to get you to Mars.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.400
This is what the spacecraft looks like

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.350
when it's all put together,

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.250
this is the Spirit
spacecraft hanging inside

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.760
a giant thermal vacuum chamber at

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.010
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where we did

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.713
the assembly and testing of the vehicles.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.800
We launched them in the summer of 2003,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.990
two Delta II rockets from
Cape Canaveral in Florida,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.120
one in the daytime, and one at night.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.363
The launches were beautiful
exhilarating things to see.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.053
It took us seven months to get to Mars.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.290
Now once you get to Mars,

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.753
you hit the top of the Martian
atmosphere going Mach 27.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.533
27 times the speed of sound.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.770
That heat shield bleeds off kinetic energy

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.880
slows the vehicle down,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.280
and then once you get down
to a nice leisurely Mach 2,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.980
you deploy a supersonic parachute.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.930
We learned the hard way
that supersonic parachutes

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.540
are very difficult things
to design and build.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.360
The lander descends on a long cord,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.010
and this is what the vehicle
looks like as it's still

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.420
screaming down towards the Martian surface

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.230
at three or four hundred miles an hour.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.313
You do not drift down lazily
on a parachute on Mars.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.500
The atmosphere is too thin.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.930
We had a terrible time
with our parachutes.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.360
These are some stills from a video

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.100
of the first test that we did of

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.860
the parachute design that we thought

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.850
would land us successfully on Mars.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.210
Remember we did these tests at a

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.460
National Guard gunnery range
outside of Boise Idaho.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.385
It's the kind of place where you can drop

00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:57.330
big heavy things from the sky
and they won't kill anybody.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.710
And we dropped our test article from

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.850
a helicopter at 4000 feet,

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.550
the parachute deployed,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.300
it blossomed to make this beautiful

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.460
perfect orange and white bowl,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.330
and then it just exploded.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.920
It just ripped to ribbons.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.880
And parachute after parachute failed.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.580
What had happened was that as

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.060
the design of our vehicle matured,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.230
our understanding of how
heavy it would be got bigger.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.740
And by the time we did these tests

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.980
the vehicle was too
heavy for the parachute

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.130
to successfully land it.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:36.130
So we had to go on a crash
program of parachute redesign,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.330
we actually came up with three different

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.940
parachutes that we designed in parallel,

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.490
praying that one of them would work.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.680
One of them did, we did our final

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.510
testing of the parachutes in a big NASA

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:50.640
wind tunnel just across the bay

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.030
at NASA Ames Research Center.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.160
This is the design,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.070
this is the design of the actual parachute

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.950
that landed successfully on Mars.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.600
This test, our first successful test,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.850
of a parachute, took place only eight

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.280
months before we had to be on top of

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.850
the rocket in Florida.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.853
So it was a really scary schedule.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.540
We'd land using air bags.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:19.040
The air bags inflate
explosively around the vehicle.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.830
They're sort of like
the airbags in your car

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.730
except a lot more expensive.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.720
And then what happens is we fire

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.510
the solid rocket motors oh maybe

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.920
20, 30 meters above the surface,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.560
we cut the airbags free,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.530
and they fall to the
surface and they bounce.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.840
And they bounce and they
bounce and they bounce

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.090
and they roll and they roll and they roll

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.610
and they can bounce and
roll as much as a kilometer

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.760
before the vehicle finally comes to rest.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.170
And this is just a, an airbag engineer,

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:47.170
JPL being consumed by his
work. (audience laughs)

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:48.970
We had an awful time with the airbags too.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.380
This is some stills again from a video

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.070
of our first airbag testing this was done

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.037
at a NASA, the world's
largest vacuum chamber

00:09:57.037 --> 00:10:00.330
it's a NASA facility in Sandusky Ohio.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.990
And you can sort of tell
from the looks on their faces

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:03.240
it's not going real well,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.410
I mean the way this test works

00:10:07.357 --> 00:10:08.760
you decompress this chamber and then

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.580
basically use giant bungee cords to whack

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.010
the airbags down onto a panel that's

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.157
studded with sharp pointy rocks

00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:19.270
and the bags just ripped, they shredded.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.490
And that right there that's a gaping hole,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:22.860
in one of the bags.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.720
Again what had happened is the design of

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.500
the vehicle had become so heavy that

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.150
the airbags couldn't handle it.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.770
And so we had to strengthen the bags

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.900
adding layer upon layer upon layer to them

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.380
making them heavier making
the other problems even worse.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.563
We eventually got the airbags to work too.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.600
The picture on the left is from

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.140
one of our first successful airbag tests

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.810
and of course the ultimate test,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.640
these are airbag bounce marks

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:49.790
on the surface of Mars.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.883
Now once this thing lands,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.050
we retract the airbags, the petals open up

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.130
and it flips the vehicle right side up.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.900
And then inside, all folded up still

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.440
is the rover, looking
nothing like a rover yet.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.200
So this thing now has to
do origami in reverse,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.330
unfolding itself through multiple stages

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.240
to turn itself into a rover.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.690
Now there were a lot of
parts of this mission

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.040
that made me nervous but
this part right here,

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.430
with all the gears and motors

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.880
and springs and hinges and latches,

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.240
was terrifying.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.890
What you're seeing right here,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.820
those are the solar arrays.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.140
Those carry the life
giving solar cells that

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.810
must be exposed to the
sun the first day on Mars

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.900
and if they aren't,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.510
the vehicle doesn't survive
the first night on Mars.

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.670
The camera mast comes up,

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.800
the antenna comes out,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.180
and now by the time we
get to this configuration,

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.333
the vehicle is safe.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.920
The sun is shining on the
solar arrays so we have power,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.910
the mast is up so we can take pictures,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.650
the antenna's out so we can transmit

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.430
those pictures back to Earth.

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.240
But we can't go anywhere yet,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.500
because the whole suspension system

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.130
is still folded up underneath the vehicle.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.480
There's another step, and
it's even worse, watch this.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.020
There's a jack underneath the vehicle

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.810
like the jack in your
car that lifts it up,

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.193
and now watch what the
front wheels do, watch this.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.380
Yeah, I mean. (audience laughs)

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.810
It's been seven years and I still

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.364
get the heebie-jeebies watching that.

00:12:21.364 --> 00:12:23.670
You know if those latches don't latch,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.370
you're done, your mission is over.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.670
Now when we came up with this whole

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.930
cockamamie scheme for landing on Mars

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.040
with the heat shield and the parachute

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.620
and the airbags and the bouncing

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.360
and the unfolding and everything,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.750
we thought that once we
got to this configuration,

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.310
with the vehicle standing
up on the lander deck

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.760
we were pretty much home free.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.560
We just cut the cable that connects

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.010
the rover to the lander,

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.900
we go monster trucking down
onto the Martian surface,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.775
and everything's good.

00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:55.763
And we did some tests. (audience laughs)

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.210
Yeah this was a bad day.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.240
It turns out that when
you drive one of these

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.410
vehicles off a lander it can flip

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:06.810
upside down under certain conditions.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.660
So we had to fix that.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.900
The solution that we came
up with you actually saw

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.450
when those petals first opened.

00:13:13.857 --> 00:13:18.857
Between the petals, made of
fabric, we built some ramps.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.490
And what happens is when
the petals fold into place,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.420
the ramps, which are just fabric,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.260
they're made of the same fabric

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.880
as the airbags really tough stuff,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.520
those snap into position.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.023
And then the rover can
drive down the fabric ramps.

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.290
Now once you get on the Martian surface

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.070
you gotta deal with the fact
that it's not exactly paved.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.310
There are rocks and bumps
and drifts and dunes

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.110
and things that the rover
has to be able to negotiate.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.150
And so our mechanical
engineers had to come up

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.740
with a scheme whereby the wheels of this

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.750
complex six-wheeled vehicle could go over

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.380
topography and could conform to whatever

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.230
topography they encountered without

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.030
the rover bumping around
too much, or tipping over.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.950
It's an elegant system, this
sort of shows it in action.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.670
Watch this, watch the wheels,
watch the suspension system.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.770
As we go over this topography, watch this.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.630
Isn't that cool?

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.130
I mean if we find a corrugated metal roof

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.950
on Mars we're all set. (audience laughs)

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.540
But watch we'll do a little spin here,

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.453
it's a very very elegant system.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.700
Really neat mechanical engineering.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:31.723
Okay now driving.

00:14:31.723 --> 00:14:33.103
How do you drive this thing.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.330
What I wish I had of course,
is a joystick, right.

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.210
What I wanna be able to
do is sit in my office

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.760
and steer it around rocks
and other obstacles,

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.639
but you can't do that.

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:46.320
Now on the night we landed,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.920
when Earth and Mars were
pretty close together

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.350
it still took ten minutes
for that radio signal

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.870
traveling at the speed of
light to go from Earth to Mars.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.510
Something happens on Mars,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.530
ten minutes for the result to come back,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.960
twenty minute round trip,
I'm gonna run into a rock.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.710
Okay so what we've had to do instead,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.700
is endow the vehicles with vision

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.100
and intelligence and the
ability to make their

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.683
own decisions about what
is safe and what is not.

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:22.920
And what we've done is we've
built into the vehicles

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.850
a pair of these wide
angle, googly-eyed cameras,

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.760
that take this 120 degree fish eye view

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:30.630
off the front end or the
back end of the vehicle

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.220
and they build up a
little three dimensional

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.770
model in their computer brain of what the

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.400
topography looks like.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.480
And they can compute is that obstacle

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.710
small enough that I can drive over it.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.233
Or is it big enough that
I have to go around it.

00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:45.490
And we can program different levels

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.160
of courage, or cowardice,
into the vehicles

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.720
depending on how difficult and dangerous

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.400
we think the terrain is.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.770
Here's a drive that was done by

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:54.880
Spirit early in the mission.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.968
The first part here we
commanded explicitly

00:15:57.968 --> 00:15:59.500
but from here on the rover's gonna be

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.590
making it's own decisions

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:02.250
and this is exactly what it did.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.070
So it drove along and then right here,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.310
there was a scary pile of rocks.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.510
So it thinks about it for a minute

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.850
thinks about it, says okay I can do this,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.960
I'll do it backwards, makes
that beep beep beep sound

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.360
you know as it's backing up.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.830
Another pile of rocks here,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.050
thinking about it, thinking about it,

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.180
says okay I'll go this way,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.890
and I think they told
me to stop right here.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:24.470
All done.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.243
They're pretty smart little vehicles.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.593
Okay the RAT.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.950
The Rock Abrasion Tool.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.180
This is one of the most important parts

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.050
of the science payload.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.773
When a rock sits on the
surface of a planet,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.050
it get exposed to the elements.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.950
Sunlight, dust, wind, humidity,

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.930
these are things that produce a process

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.400
that geologists call weathering.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.923
It modifies the surface of a rock.

00:16:52.805 --> 00:16:55.090
What it does is it destroys the evidence

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.190
of what that rock was originally like.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.990
So if you wanna know what
the rock is really like

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.220
you need to be able to get through that

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.100
weathered material and down
into the fresh rock underneath

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.200
and our tool for doing this is the RAT.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.560
It has these diamond tipped grind heads

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.900
that spin at 3000 rpm.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.500
And they can over a period of time

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.640
grind into the hardest rocks that

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.390
we've encountered on Mars.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.920
So the RAT is effectively,
it's a power tool.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.820
It's the world's first
interplanetary power tool

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.830
and as with all power tools
we have to be very careful

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.480
when we use the rat, so that
we don't (audience laughs)

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.433
do anything like that, I'm sorry.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.580
I thought the wheel coming off was

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.640
a nice touch anyway. (audience laughs)

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.053
Alright, let's go to Mars.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.930
I'm gonna start with Spirit.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.210
The landing site that we chose for Spirit

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.030
is this crater, big
blue crater right there

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.420
it's called Gusev crater,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.860
it's about 160 kilometers in diameter

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.670
it lies at 16 degrees
south latitude on Mars.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.743
The reason we chose it,
what sets this crater apart,

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:06.483
is this.

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.110
There's a great big dried up riverbed

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.630
flowing into that crater.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.660
Now there's no water in that riverbed now

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.020
and there hasn't been
for billions of years.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.640
But this is a big hole in the ground

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.070
with a dry river flowing into it

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:21.970
there has to have been a lake

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.470
in Gusev crater at some point in the past.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.930
So we went to Gusev hoping
and expecting to find

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:30.710
layered sedimentary rocks that had been

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.113
laid down billions of years
ago in a Martian lake.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.010
We landed, and we saw this, nice and flat,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.220
easy for driving.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.890
I managed to convince
myself for about three days

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.403
that this is what a Martian dry
lake bed ought to look like.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.350
But then we started looking at the rocks.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.840
The first rock that we looked
at was this one right here.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.343
We named it Adirondack
it's about that big.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.250
And we hit this thing with
everything that we had.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.917
We drilled into it with the RAT,

00:19:00.917 --> 00:19:02.150
we looked at it with our spectrometers,

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.450
with our microscope,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:06.550
we did everything we could to this rock,

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:07.730
and what we found,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.430
and you can sort of guess
just by looking at it,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.960
is this is not a sedimentary rock at all.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.740
There are no layers in that.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.630
It's a piece of lava this is basalt

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.650
this is a volcanic rock.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.060
And every other rock for kilometers

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:24.540
in every direction is
the exact same stuff.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.993
We landed on a bunch of lava.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.870
Mars faked us out here.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:30.930
I still believe those layered sediments

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.440
must be down there somewhere

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.460
but what happened was after
the sediments were deposited,

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.520
they were covered with lava.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.170
And we didn't know that until we landed

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.660
and reached out and touched the rocks.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.460
So this was a bitter disappointment.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.220
Now our rovers were designed
to last for 90 Martian days,

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.133
and to drive 600 meters
over their lifetimes.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.200
When we landed and we looked around,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.360
off to the southeast
at a distance of about

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.380
two and a half kilometers,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.070
we saw this beautiful range of hills.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.680
We name them the Columbia Hills

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.330
after the Columbia space shuttle.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.660
At two and a half kilometers away

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.160
they seemed impossibly distant.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.160
But given the fact that
we realized quickly

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.420
that there as nothing
but lava in this scene.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.980
We realized that we had to go to

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.310
the Columbia Hills or else we were

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:27.290
gonna see nothing but
lava the whole mission.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.393
So off we went.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.360
We reached the base of the Columbia Hills

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.333
on day 156 of our 90 day mission,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.810
and everything changed.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.450
The minute we entered the
hills everything was different.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.040
This is the view from the base of

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.280
one of the highest hills in the range

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.070
this one is named Husband Hill

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.060
it's named after Rick Husband who was

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.530
the commander of the
Columbia when it went down.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.860
And this is the hill
that we chose to climb.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.550
We worked our way over a period of

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.960
hundreds of Martian days,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:07.270
up the slopes of Husband Hill,

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:09.770
finding some very different
rocks along the way.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.520
This is a picture, set of pictures taken

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.960
with our microscopic imager,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:17.870
this image here is just
three centimeters across.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.140
So now we're seeing layering.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:24.680
Now we're seeing sub-centimeter
scale layering in the rocks.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.490
When we look at these rocks
with our spectrometers

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.940
we start to see other minerals

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.200
we see minerals like goethite,

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.370
which is an iron oxy hydroxide.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.450
Hydroxide, that means that you need water

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.283
to make goethite.

00:21:36.283 --> 00:21:38.180
So now we're starting to see layered rocks

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.920
we're starting to see rocks that show

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.890
compelling evidence of
water being implicated

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:44.883
in their formation.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.590
Over a period of hundreds of Martian days

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.240
we did the first ever
mountaineering on Mars,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.410
working our way laboriously
up to the summit

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.740
of a Martian mountain as tall as

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.840
the Statue of Liberty.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.500
Like any good mountaineer,

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.623
we took a picture when we got to the top.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:07.580
This is part of the spectacular view

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.490
from the summit of Husband Hill

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:11.120
looking off to the south.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.750
And as we speak, the Spirit
rover is right there,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:20.750
having spent nearly 2600
days on the surface of Mars.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.630
Spirit has had a tough time.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.193
Martian mountaineering is
pretty tough on a robot.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.430
And after about 800 days
of driving this vehicle,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:36.290
the right front wheel failed.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:38.690
So the right front wheel
would no longer turn.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.120
And what that meant was,

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.270
that when we drove the vehicle

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.690
we had to drive it backwards,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.890
dragging that dead wheel through the soil.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.100
It made it very hard to drive.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.990
What we discovered though
was that this cloud

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.530
had a wonderful silver lining in that

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:58.250
dragging that wheel digs this marvelous

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:01.260
hundreds of meters long trench

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.510
through the Martian soil.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.230
And what we found to our surprise was that

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.300
every so often something fascinating

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.920
will pop up in the floor of that trench.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.480
There was one day when we were driving

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.810
the rover very close to where I showed

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.563
you in that most recent image,

00:23:17.922 --> 00:23:20.363
we're driving the rover
through a little valley,

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.763
and at the end of the drive,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.010
the front wheel, the right front wheel

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:27.910
had dredged up some soil that was

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.533
as bright as white snow.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.810
This caught our attention.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.520
We went over with our spectrometers,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.800
we made a measurement of the
composition of this stuff.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.403
This one is, this stuff
is 91% pure silica, SiO2.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.550
This is not quartz, not beach sand,

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.830
this is amorphous silica.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.860
This is opal, sort of like the gemstone.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:56.860
This is the kind of stuff
that typically forms in

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.293
hot springs, and volcanic
steam vents on Earth.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:06.450
So what this silica deposit in this little

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.730
valley on Mars is pointing to,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.250
is an environment billions of years ago

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.240
that would have been
one, suitable for life.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.650
You can go to volcanic steam vents

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:17.540
you can go to hydrothermic
systems on Earth

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.040
and they're teeming with microbial life.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.190
Now I do not know if life was ever here,

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.040
but these silica deposits
in this valley represent

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.240
a former habitable environment on Mars.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.390
Of course we named the
place Silica Valley.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.870
Spirit has had a tough
life in another way too.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:44.570
This is a picture that the vehicle,

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.490
this is a self portrait.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.620
A picture that Spirit took of itself

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.970
on day 330 of the mission.

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:55.693
And the solar arrays are brown.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.080
They are coated with dust.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:00.020
Dust in the Martian atmosphere

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.520
settles out of the atmosphere and it

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.823
just coats horizontal
surfaces on the rover.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.650
When this rover was brand new,

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.290
straight off the showroom floor,

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.400
those solar arrays would put out about

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:15.560
900 watt hours of power per day.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.950
So enough energy to run a 100 watt

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.550
light bulb for nine hours.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.990
By the time this picture was taken,

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:23.380
with all the dust on the arrays,

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.940
that number was hovering between

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.510
250 and 300 watt hours.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.050
And we think that death for the vehicle

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.920
was somewhere a little below 200.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.350
So it was looking like
Spirit was close to the end.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.113
And then one marvelous day, this happened.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.550
A lucky gust of wind hit the vehicle,

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.160
cleaned it off, and overnight the power

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.430
went back up to 850 watt hours.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.293
Pure dumb luck.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.193
It was as if this had happened.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.500
Somebody sent me this picture
I thought this was great.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.550
What was really going on, check this out.

00:25:59.292 --> 00:26:00.400
Look at this.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.233
Dust devils.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.470
Little Martian mini tornadoes that go

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.780
whirling through the
scene in the summertime.

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:07.800
I'll play this again.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.360
I love this thing.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.913
You almost see Dorothy and Todo
flying through all of that.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.103
Check this out.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.283
What was that, anybody know?

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.530
Eclipse, I heard it, yes eclipse.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.130
Mars has two moons,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.680
the names are Phobos and Deimos.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.950
This is the moon Phobos
passing in front of the sun.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.200
This is the first solar eclipse

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.500
ever witnessed from the
surface of another planet.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.940
There's no science in this at all,

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.440
we just did it cause we could.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.023
And that's a sunset.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.460
On Mars the sky is pink in the daytime,

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.950
and it turns blue at sunset.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.563
It's the opposite of Earth.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.370
Now this sunset picture,
this beautiful image,

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.120
this was taken by Spirit.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.120
Where things stand with
the Spirit rover right now

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.033
is we have not heard from
Spirit in about a year.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.540
Spirit we managed to coax through three

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.503
very long dark difficult Martian winters.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.870
By the time the fourth winter came

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.490
the mobility system, the wheels were

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.910
sufficiently crippled
that we could no longer

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.930
force Spirit up onto steep slopes

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.000
so it would point the solar
arrays towards the sun.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.330
And it's beginning to appear that Spirit

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.673
may not have survived
the most recent winter.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.310
We have dug very deeply
into our bag of tricks

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:33.580
to contact the vehicle we have
another few things to try,

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.310
we're gonna keep trying
for a little while longer,

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:39.033
but Spirit may have reached it's end.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:41.710
Opportunity on the other hand,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.633
is still doing well.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.220
Let me talk about the
Opportunity mission now.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.400
These slides show the
Opportunity landing site.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.640
We chose the landing site for Opportunity

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.570
not because of it's topography,

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.440
no big hole in the
ground, no dry riverbed.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.700
We chose it on the
basis of it's chemistry.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.270
The picture at the right

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.600
shows data from an infrared spectrometer

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.300
collected from orbit.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.380
The blue stuff is boring old lava again

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.540
but the red and yellow and green,

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.820
that's a mineral called hematite.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.440
Hematite's an iron oxide,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.300
it's a mineral that is present in rust.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.910
And it's a mineral that sometimes,

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.230
not always but often forms as a result

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:24.933
of the action of liquid water.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.590
So this hematite
signature is like a beacon

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.970
visible from space saying
hey come land here.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.220
Water may have been here.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.120
Now this picture here shows an image

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.560
of what the landing site
looks like close up.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.480
Very smooth, very flat,
extremely safe for landing,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.270
very easy for driving, great landing site.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.140
But, the thing that made
me nervous about this site

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.340
is that it's so smooth
and so flat I feared

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.470
that we might not ever encounter

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.960
the topography that we
would need to expose

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.813
the bedrock we would want to see.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.623
Turns out I need not have worried.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.950
These are some of my favorite images

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.920
from the entire mission.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.340
When our vehicle was landing,

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:13.230
as it's descending on that parachute,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.110
it had mounted on the
underside of the lander

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.860
a camera that was looking
down at the surface.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.650
That camera snapped off three pictures,

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.100
as we're going through this violent

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.440
and rapid landing process.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.500
The little black dot that you see

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:28.960
just to the left of that crater,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.010
that's the shadow of the parachute, okay.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:34.550
This picture at the lower right is just

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.500
the same scene being viewed obliquely.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.600
Now what the red curve is, the red curve

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:42.880
is the reconstruction of the trajectory

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.050
that our spacecraft followed as we went

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:48.080
through the landing process.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.240
So here we are coming
screaming in from space

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.800
hundreds of kilometers an hour,

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.000
right here, we fire those rocket motors

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.890
and we cut the airbags free and they fall

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.240
to the surface and begin to bounce.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.670
Now the wind that afternoon on Mars

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:03.690
was blowing from the south.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.950
And so the trajectory bends to the north,

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.320
bounce bounce bounce bounce
bounce bounce bounce,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.820
and then reading the green perfectly,

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.480
the trajectory bends to the left,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.900
and goes right into a little

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.553
20 meter diameter impact crater.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.720
Tiger Woods on his best day

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.348
could not have accomplished this, again,

00:30:25.348 --> 00:30:27.810
it was just pure dumb luck.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:29.320
We opened our eyes,

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.150
and there was this spectacular outcrop

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.470
of layered bedrock in
the wall of the crater

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.270
right in front of the rover.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.450
Now the night that we landed,

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:40.670
when we first saw these images

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.943
we didn't know which crater we were in.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.793
So we didn't know how far
away the crater wall was.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.293
So we didn't know how big the outcrop was.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.250
And on the night that
we landed when my team

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.990
saw this massive outcrop that we were

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.960
gonna have to negotiate,

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.280
the name that they gave it that night,

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.760
what they called it at
first was The Great Wall.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.660
That was the name.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.650
Then we took some stereo images

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.150
and did a little trigonometry,

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.490
little tiny outcrop great big rover

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:13.610
the great wall is about
this high. (audience laughs)

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.950
But its small size was part of it's charm

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:17.360
because what that meant was that this

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.123
layering that we were
seeing was very very fine.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.260
You gotta remember this
is only three weeks

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:25.070
after we had landed at Gusev crater

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.440
with Spirit and seen nothing but lava.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:31.010
Here we clearly had something
very different on our hands.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.610
The first thing we went
looking for while we were

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.070
still on the lander was the hematite,

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.120
that was what brought us here.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.370
Our infrared spectrometer is
good at detecting hematite,

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.470
we went looking for it,

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:43.923
again red is lots of
hematite, blue is none.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.760
There's lots of hematite
outside the crater

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:50.740
and some in the soil on the crater wall.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:53.230
There's a bit of hematite in the outcrop,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.910
not nearly as much.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.180
And then on the crater floor in blue,

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.050
there are these weird splotches that have

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.270
no hematite at all.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:05.083
The splotches are the airbag bounce marks.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.350
So you bounce in the dirt here

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.240
and hematite goes away.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.923
This is one of the first of many clues.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.490
I've show you this picture before,

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.410
you can see the airbag
bounce marks very smooth,

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:23.060
and in between, where the
hematite is there's this gravel.

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.163
So we're thinking ah, the
hematite must be in the gravel.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.560
We drove off the lander,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.850
we looked down with our cameras and

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:32.410
took the first good picture of that gravel

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.898
and here it is,

00:32:33.898 --> 00:32:34.870
and we start to notice that those grains

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.513
of gravel looked awfully round.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.810
So we took out our microscope

00:32:39.695 --> 00:32:40.945
and we took this picture.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.770
And I will remember as long as I live

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:47.350
where I was standing, and how I felt,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.290
and the unrepeatable words that I said,

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.490
when I saw this picture.

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.410
The surface of Mars at this landing site

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:56.590
is littered with an uncountable number

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.163
of little round things.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.630
And they're four, five, six
millimeters in diameter,

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.470
and they are absolutely everywhere.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.443
We had no idea what we were dealing with.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.110
We drove over to the outcrop,

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:13.129
and what we quickly learned was that

00:33:13.129 --> 00:33:15.110
the little round things are embedded in

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.203
the outcrop like blueberries in a muffin.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.170
The muffin is soft, the
blueberries are hard.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.060
The muffin erodes away and
the blueberries fall out.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.210
And they're everywhere.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.330
Now at this point of
course we're desperate

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:29.760
to know what the blueberries
are actually made of.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.010
We suspected that they
were made of hematite.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.370
Now on the end of the arm,

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.040
we have a spectrometer that's
a wonderful hematite detector.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.760
The problem with that spectrometer is that

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.181
it's field of view,

00:33:40.181 --> 00:33:41.150
this is a picture taken
with our microscope.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.970
It's three centimeters across.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:44.480
Okay the field of view
of that spectrometer

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.860
is a centimeter and a half.

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.510
So if you try to go up to just one little

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:49.930
blueberry embedded in the rock

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.190
what you wind up with is a

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.670
spectrometer whose field of view

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.100
is filled by a little bit of blueberry

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.890
and a whole lotta muffin.

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.320
And it's hard to figure
out what you're looking at.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:02.600
So what we needed instead was
a gathering of blueberries.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.630
We found one, right here

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:05.710
there's a place where there's a little

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.140
bowl shaped depression in the rocks

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:09.730
and a bunch of the blueberries had rolled

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.050
down into it, we called it the Berry Bowl.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.430
And we stuffed our spectrometer
into the Berry Bowl

00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:16.150
and we made a measurement of this stuff

00:34:16.150 --> 00:34:19.313
and sure enough, the berries
are made of hematite.

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.300
Now after looking at
these things for awhile

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.190
what we came to realize
is that the blueberries

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.173
are what geologists call concretions.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.610
Concretions form in
sedimentary rocks on Earth

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.310
that are saturated with liquid water.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.770
And there's some mineral
dissolved in the rocks,

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:40.230
or dissolved in the water
that wants to precipitate out.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.187
It's supersaturated.

00:34:41.187 --> 00:34:42.877
And it finds a little nucleation point

00:34:42.877 --> 00:34:44.850
and it begins to precipitate.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.910
And it adds layer upon layer upon layer

00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:49.860
as more minerals precipitate and it grows,

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.060
building a little hard spherical nodule

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.860
in the rock sort of like the
way an oyster builds a pearl.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.580
So what this is showing us
is that at this location

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:01.760
at one time in the past

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.993
the rocks here were
saturated with liquid water.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.440
Now we were also interested
in whether or not

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.300
water came to the surface.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.570
And this is some experiments done where

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.540
you have water flowing over sand.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.790
If you've ever looked into the bed

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.470
of a sandy stream you've seen this.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.040
Where water flows over
sand it makes ripples.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.790
Then the ripples propagate downstream

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.630
and the key thing here that you observe

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.920
is that the crests of those
ripples are not straight.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.970
They're highly sinuous over length scales

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:32.400
of five or ten centimeters.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.450
And that sinuosity of the ripple crest

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:37.858
is the signature of water as the fluid

00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:40.853
that is transporting the sediments.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:44.600
Here's the same thing being
simulated in the computer.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.830
So sinuous crests and ripples,

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.460
propagating downstream, and
look what's left behind.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.750
What's left behind in
the sedimentary record

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.240
is not flat lying sediments,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:01.240
instead what you get is
these little concave upward

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:06.533
smiley shapes in the rocks,
five or ten centimeters in size.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.550
Here's the real thing, these are from

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.360
some sediments in the Colorado river,

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.800
in southwestern United States,

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.950
and here it is on Mars.

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.010
Little smiley shapes in the rocks,

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.320
these are rare, we haven't
seen these all over the place

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.480
we've seen them only in a few spots.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.260
And what they say is
that not only was there

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.840
water beneath the ground,

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.800
but occasionally water
came up to the surface

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.900
and flowed across the ground here on Mars.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:40.240
We spent 60 wonderful Martian days

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.780
exploring this little crater,

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.250
you see tire tracks everywhere.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.590
And then we left,

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.353
and the place that we went
to was Endurance crater.

00:36:50.001 --> 00:36:53.670
Endurance crater, 150 meters in diameter,

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.040
20 meters deep it's this spectacular thing

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.440
and I remember telling reporters,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.550
telling people in the news media,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.050
oh yeah when we get to Endurance crater

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.690
it's gonna be great
we're gonna be able to go

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.310
down into the crater and look at all

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.890
these layers in the rocks.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.490
We got to the crater rim and it scared

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.017
the living daylights out of us.

00:37:11.017 --> 00:37:14.150
I mean that looks like an
overhanging cliff, there,

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.070
that's exactly what it is.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.960
This is the kind of place
where if we screwed up,

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:21.060
our little rover could
fall off a cliff and die.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.410
It was a frightening place.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.800
But look at those layered
sedimentary rocks.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:33.020
We had to find some way to
get down into this crater.

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.010
Now I showed you that picture before

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.710
with the little outcrop and the big rover,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.000
here it is to scale at Endurance.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.330
This is a very frightening place.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.840
But I will tell you,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.250
that at 200 days of
operating in this crater

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.050
we drove that little rover
down into the crater,

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:50.890
and up to this spot right here.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.560
We were parked right on
top of that rock there

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.590
and I'll show you a
picture take from there

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.440
in just a second.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:01.460
Now when we first took on
this task we had no idea

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.500
what the rover could do in
terms of climbing steep slopes.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.270
We had not designed it
for this kind of thing.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.280
So we had to test it and
we went out, literally,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.783
we went out to Home Depot,

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.260
and we bought a bunch of paving stones,

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.250
we got a bunch of sand,

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:18.790
I had grad students
gluing BBs onto the rocks,

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.420
to make blueberries.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:22.560
And we took our test rover and we would

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.940
tilt this thing at different angles

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.020
and run it up and down
the slop and it turns out

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.240
the rover climbs pretty well,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.230
it can handle slopes
up to about 34 degrees.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.963
So into the crater we went.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.940
Over a period of months,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.750
we worked our way slowly systematically

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.290
down through this beautifully exposed

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.570
stack of layered rocks.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.390
And each time we got into
a new layer we put in

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.950
a hole with the RAT,

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.330
we'd look at it with our microscope,

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:50.070
we'd look at it with our spectrometers,

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.150
we'd study how things changed as we went

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.233
down the section, as a
geologist would put it.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.910
In geology what you try
to do in sedimentary rocks

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:01.320
is you try to construct what's called

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.930
a stratigraphic section,

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:04.900
measurements through a whole set of layers

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:06.245
and that's what we did here,

00:39:06.245 --> 00:39:08.995
it's the first stratigraphic
section ever done on Mars.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.160
We got down on the floor of the crater

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.520
we found some really weird stuff.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.810
This is the rock that when
the picture first came down

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.560
my team called it the petrified
Martian dinosaur brain.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.540
When this one came down
one of the guys on the team

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.470
said now that's what a rock

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.780
from another planet should look like.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.280
No idea what's going on there.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.480
We then worked our way up
to the base of that cliff,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.313
and we took this image.

00:39:33.313 --> 00:39:36.580
And I wish I could show you this image

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.370
in it's full high resolution glory

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.080
there's about three IMAX screens

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.370
worth of data in this image.

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:47.690
I'm gonna just zero in on one tiny little

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:49.600
section of it up here.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.225
There it is.

00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:53.080
And the entire image is that good.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.980
And every single image
that we've ever taken

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.790
since the day we landed on Mars

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.890
is on the web, anybody can download it,

00:39:58.890 --> 00:39:59.970
anybody can work with it,

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.870
this is a treasure trove of data that

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.600
people are gonna be working with

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.000
for decades into the future.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.220
We left the crater,

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:13.440
and the next place that we
went was our heat shield.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.470
Okay you remember the heat shield,

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.650
it protects the vehicle as you're

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.140
descending through the atmosphere,

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.690
when we don't need the heat shield anymore

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:19.960
we drop it off the vehicle,

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.570
it falls to the surface,

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.490
and it hits the surface.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.200
Here's the heat shield at the top

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:26.600
as it looked last time I saw it

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.380
in Cape Canaveral in Florida,

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.370
here it is busted into
pieces on the Martian surface

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:37.370
along with the crater
that it made when it hit.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.330
Now we went to visit the heat shield

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.830
not to learn about Mars,

00:40:40.830 --> 00:40:43.610
we went to it to learn about heat shields.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.950
For decades, engineers
have been given the task

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.570
of designing a heat shield that will work

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.550
in the very poorly understood
Martian atmosphere.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.590
But until our mission not
one of those engineers

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:57.800
had had the luxury of
seeing their creation

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.450
after it had done it's job.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.270
We were able to drive
up to this heat shield,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:05.610
take our microscope and take a microscopic

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.860
image of a cross section
through the broken heat shield,

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.370
and give that image to the engineer who

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.860
had designed and built the thing,

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.110
so he could assess how
well it had performed.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.810
Now at the same time that we're doing

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.860
our engineering investigation
on the heat shield,

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.900
you know we're scientists so we're

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.207
looking around for rocks.

00:41:22.207 --> 00:41:24.800
And we saw one right
next to the heat shield,

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.270
here it is.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.530
We named it Heat Shield Rock.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.970
And we went over to Heat Shied Rock

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.810
and we measured it's composition,

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:34.350
turns out this thing is not made of

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.450
conventional rock at all.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.550
This thing is made of a nickel-iron alloy.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.260
It's a meteorite.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.510
This is an iron meteorite
just sitting there

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.340
right next to the heat shield.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.820
Again, pure dumb luck.

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.160
I told the team we shouldn't stay here

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:50.580
this is obviously a place where

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.380
big metal objects fall from the sky.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.040
We drove away from the heat shield,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.753
and we embarked on a long
arduous drive to the south.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.290
Many kilometers.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:06.660
And as we got farther
and farther to the south,

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.330
the nature of the terrain changed.

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:12.090
And where it once had been
perfectly smooth and flat,

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:16.563
now we began to see these
little wind blown ripples.

00:42:17.448 --> 00:42:18.740
And the farther south we got,

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:21.740
the bigger and bigger and bigger they got.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.810
And we blithely just
drove over those things.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:26.940
Bombing along up one side, down the next,

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.163
we drove over hundreds of these things.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:33.390
And then one terrible day,

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.130
we hit a ripple that was somehow,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:37.297
and I still don't
completely understand this,

00:42:37.297 --> 00:42:39.610
but we hit a ripple that was just a little

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.330
bit different from the
hundreds that had come before,

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.070
and instead of driving over our wheels

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.970
broke through the crust of this thing,

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.020
and started to sink in.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.050
And we did 50 meters of wheel turns

00:42:52.050 --> 00:42:54.130
thinking we were driving across the plains

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:55.360
when in fact we were just sinking

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.173
deeper and deeper and
deeper into this thing.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.880
We came in the next
morning and all six wheels

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.020
were buried over the hubcaps.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.093
This was a bad day.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.370
Now the first rule in
a situation like this

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.310
is don't do anything stupid that's gonna

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.510
make the problem worse.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.190
The sun is shining, we
have electrical power,

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:21.080
the vehicle's safe, it's
certainly not going anywhere,

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.030
we have time to figure out the problem.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.860
Now when we built the rovers
we actually built four of them.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.937
Spirit and Opportunity are on Mars

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.750
but we have two that
are back here on Earth.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:32.420
And we can use the ones
that are here on Earth

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.870
to simulate predicaments that
we've gotten ourselves into

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.780
on Mars and then try to
figure a way out of it.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.131
In order to figure a way
out of this predicament

00:43:42.131 --> 00:43:45.970
what we needed was a large quantity

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.443
of fake Martian soil.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.160
Now if you're ever called upon to make

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.550
fake Martian soil, here's the
recipe that you should use.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.030
It is roughly equal parts play sand,

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.250
the stuff in kids sandboxes,

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:04.400
clay, and diatomaceous earth.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.450
The stuff that's used in
swimming pool filters.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:08.940
Once we figured out this recipe

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.510
a bunch of engineers in pick up trucks

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:12.770
fanned out across the
LA basin and bought up

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.610
literally tons of these three ingredients.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.020
I mean people were getting algae in their

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.240
swimming pools across
Los Angeles all summer

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.920
because we bought all
the diatomaceous earth.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.700
We brought it back to JPL,

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.350
and we mixed it together,

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.190
and we created mounds and pits and drifts

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.130
and dunes and we drove the rover into it

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.323
and we got it stuck.

00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:36.600
And we spent two and a
half weeks rehearsing,

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.110
trying to find the optimal way to extract

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.083
the robot from a sand
dune on another planet.

00:44:43.065 --> 00:44:44.870
There are a lot of things you can do.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.480
You can steer the wheels back and forth,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.940
to try to open up the holes
that they're in a little bit.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.890
You can run the wheels
at different velocities

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:52.900
you can rock the vehicle.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.230
We tried all those
things and a bunch more.

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:58.060
After two and a half weeks we
found the optimal technique,

00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.590
the optimal technique it turns out was to

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:03.343
put it in reverse and
gun it. (audience laughs)

00:45:04.888 --> 00:45:07.647
You know there's no place
you go to look this stuff up.

00:45:11.157 --> 00:45:14.090
So here we are, gunning it on Mars,

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.983
this is the left front wheel.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.400
Here's the left rear wheel I mean

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.630
we were really stuck, we were in trouble.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.630
We had to do 192 meters
worth of wheel turns

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.663
to get the rover to move one meter.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.453
But one marvelous Saturday morning,

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.580
after six weeks stuck in the feature

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.783
that we later came to call Purgatory Dune,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.370
the vehicle popped out,

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.680
and we have been treating those ripples

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.963
with much greater respect ever since.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.220
So this shows where we operated
over a period of years.

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.590
Here's Eagle crater, that's
a one kilometer scale bar.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.470
Here's Eagle crater where we landed,

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.310
there's Endurance where
we spent all that time,

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.680
the heat shield was about here,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.660
Purgatory Dune was about here.

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.130
The place we were hoping to get to

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:08.473
was Victoria crater.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.810
Now you notice that the craters on here

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:17.010
are all named after famous
ships of exploration.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.240
Eagle of course was the
lunar module on Apollo 11,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.690
Endurance was Shackleton's ship.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:26.983
Victoria was one of Magellan's ships.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.780
Magellan left Spain with five ships,

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:30.860
Victoria was one of them,

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.820
260 men on board,

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.270
with the intention of
circumnavigating the globe.

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.860
Magellan himself was
killed in the Philippines.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.320
After three years at sea
the one remaining ship

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.920
from the original five,

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.500
with 18 remaining surviving sailors

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.353
from the original 260,

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.180
limped back to Spain.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.530
So we chose that name
for this crater because

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.870
we thought it was a suitable
analogy for the shape

00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:59.570
that we would be in with
our beat up little rover

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:02.440
being driven by 18
surviving graduate students,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.160
if we ever got as far as the crater.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.810
But I'm pleased and proud
to say that we did make it.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.890
This is a wonderful
image of Victoria crater.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.010
This was taken from orbit,

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.993
by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.300
This was a marvelous coincidence,

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.930
at almost the exact moment

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:24.300
that we rolled up to the
rim of Victoria crater,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.650
MRO went into orbit around Mars,

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:28.250
turned on its camera for the first time

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.420
and one of the very first pictures it took

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.400
was this image of Victoria.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.020
I'll blow up just that
little portion of it,

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.380
there it is,

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:41.730
if you look carefully, that's Opportunity.

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.690
In fact if you look really carefully,

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.700
You can see the shadow of the camera mast

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.320
being cast on the Martian surface.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.420
It was really nice to see our rover again.

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.900
We spent two years
exploring Victoria crater.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:00.620
And you can see in this image,

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.470
taken after about a years worth,

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:05.590
the wheel tracks that we made

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.980
as we worked our way along
the rim of this crater.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.070
The rover drivers told me
that when this was done

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.910
that was gonna spell out hi Steven,

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.960
I'm not seeing it. (audience laughs)

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.550
Seriously, these wheel
tracks to me actually

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.170
represent one of the
finest accomplishments

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:23.000
in the history of space robotic systems.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.610
And you gotta realize
the rovers are operated

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:28.790
by a group of engineers
whose first and foremost

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:31.010
job is to keep the vehicle safe.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.500
We're driving it along the top of an eight

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.240
meter tall cliff, with a
bunch of scientists saying,

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.620
go closer, go closer, go
closer. (audience laughs)

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.850
And time and again they
took us right to the edge.

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:45.130
And we got just spectacular
images in the process.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.970
Here's one of them,

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:48.940
this is a place called Cape St. Mary

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.880
that cliff's about eight meters tall,

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.360
I'm gonna zoom in on this portion of it,

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.800
there it is.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.850
Look at the layering.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.360
This is what geologists call cross bedding

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.360
just spectacular layering exposed
in the wall of this cliff.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.490
What this is telling us
is this was an ancient

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:12.270
sand dune, billions of years ago on Mars,

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:16.700
with this sand blowing
around in the Martian wind.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.080
I don't know if you've been to
a lot of talks by geologists,

00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.380
but geologists when they show a picture

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.110
of an outcrop they always
put their rock hammer

00:49:23.110 --> 00:49:24.420
in it for scale.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.850
So there's my virtual
rock hammer for scale,

00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.780
I wish it were my real one.

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.863
But anyway, just spectacular stuff.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.377
A couple years ago we
left Victoria crater,

00:49:35.377 --> 00:49:38.803
and we have continued
our trek to the south.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.700
So let's see.

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.220
Endurance crater is that little tiny dot

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.480
right below the letter
U in the word endurance.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.770
Big old Victoria crater,
800 meters in diameter,

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.370
is right there.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:57.370
As we speak today, the rover
Opportunity is right there.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.687
We have driven 28 and a half kilometers,

00:50:01.687 --> 00:50:04.770
and we are now just four
and a half kilometers away

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.653
from the rim of Endeavor crater.

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.860
Endeavor crater is 25
kilometers in diameter,

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.740
it is hundreds of meters deep,

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:18.080
it's rim is composed of
materials that we know

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.500
by looking at it from orbit
are fundamentally different

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:25.860
from anything we've ever seen
before, with either rover.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.240
If we can manage to keep this very old

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.730
and very tired rover going for another

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.300
four and a half kilometers,

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.500
and get to the rim of Endeavor,

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.313
it's gonna be like the mission
has started all over again.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.700
Are we gonna make it,
I don't have any idea,

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.023
but we're sure gonna try.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.560
This picture came down this morning.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.870
This was taken yesterday on Mars,

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:54.140
we are back into very
smooth very flat terrain,

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.950
the rover is making very good progress.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.050
These wheel tracks are
from a single days drive

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:03.010
of 120 meters, so we're
making really good progress,

00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:05.350
and if the vehicle stays healthy,

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:07.030
I'm looking forward to getting to the rim

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.780
of Endeavor crater before too long.

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.427
Whenever I give talks about

00:51:12.427 --> 00:51:15.040
the Mars Exploration Rover project,

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.310
I always end them with this slide.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.300
I wrote a book about the
project called Roving Mars

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.690
and in an appendix of that
book I made an attempt

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.990
to list the names of all
the people who worked

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.550
on the project.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:31.000
There are more than
4000 names on that list

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.370
I'm just one member of
that 4000 person team.

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:35.860
Here are some more people on the team,

00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:38.410
this is at Cape Canaveral,
down in Florida,

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:40.810
this is the night that
we sent the Opportunity

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.010
spacecraft which you see at upper right,

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:44.110
out to the launch pad.

00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.930
For every one of us who has had

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:50.330
the remarkable experience

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:51.530
of being part of this mission,

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.980
it has been in the literally
sense of the phrase,

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.795
the adventure of a lifetime.

00:51:56.795 --> 00:51:57.730
And I want to thank you very much

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.883
for inviting me here to tell
you about it. Thanks a lot.

00:52:00.893 --> 00:52:03.643
(audience claps)

00:52:06.027 --> 00:52:06.860
Thank you.

00:52:12.448 --> 00:52:14.092
Yes.

00:52:14.092 --> 00:52:15.053
Can we bring the lights up?

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.140
Let's bring the lights up and I'd be happy

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.637
to take your questions.

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:23.703
Questions, oh you got a
microphone, there we go, alright.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:29.410
- [Audience Member] I do recall that they,

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.910
they kicked up some, it
looked like a white stuff

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:36.723
on the tracks, it looked
like a salt or ice,

00:52:38.443 --> 00:52:40.710
was it actually liquid water ice?

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.810
- No, we have not found ice at all

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.856
with either one of the rovers,

00:52:44.856 --> 00:52:46.540
we, as you saw with Spirit,

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.140
we did have that very bright stuff,

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.110
that turned out to be silica.

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.720
There have been other places where

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.480
what we have found turned
out to be sulfate salts,

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.300
but nowhere have we found ice.

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.133
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

00:52:57.133 --> 00:52:58.420
- We're pretty close
to the equator on Mars

00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.730
and so you wouldn't really
expect it, it's too warm there.

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:06.730
The Phoenix lander, which landed
78 degrees north latitude,

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:11.730
was able to dig into the
soil with it's robotic arm,

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.850
and five centimeters below the surface,

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:16.100
found bright deposits of ice.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.386
So that's been done, but
that's closer to the pole.

00:53:18.386 --> 00:53:19.385
- [Audience Member] That was ice.

00:53:19.385 --> 00:53:22.276
- That was ice, yes, that was
a different mission. Yeah.

00:53:22.276 --> 00:53:23.370
- [Audience Member 2] 120 meters per day

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:25.230
is very impressive for a machine

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.300
on Mars but for us here on Earth

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.580
we could walk that in a few minutes,

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.890
so I'm curious how does
the rover spend it's time

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:32.240
does it spend a lot of time thinking where

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.183
it's going next?

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.720
- Yeah, that's part of it, it depends on

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.760
where you are in the drive.

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.430
So why can you only do
about 120 meters a day.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.810
Fundamentally we're limited by power.

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.790
Right now the solar arrays on Opportunity

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:46.933
are pretty dusty,

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.190
right now Opportunity's got
about 400 watt hours per cell.

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:54.060
It's 400 watt hours to do everything,

00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.980
all of the driving, all the computing,

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:58.760
taking the images,
transmitting the data to Earth,

00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.450
running the heaters to keep the vehicle

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:02.360
warm at night, et cetera.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:04.210
So we're fundamentally power limited.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:08.740
The way we drive the vehicle
is the first part of the drive,

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.660
we will just simply command
it, we call it blind driving,

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.940
and what it means is we
know the terrain is safe

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.740
we just say rover, go,

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.920
and it will just drive
at top speed you apply

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.370
full voltage to the wheels,

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:21.067
you get about six centimeters a second.

00:54:21.067 --> 00:54:22.980
And that's how fast it goes.

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.720
Once we've gone about 80 meters out,

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.120
then we've driven so far
that the images are not

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:31.300
good enough to recognize
potential obstacles

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.900
and that's when we turn on that automatic

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:35.253
hazard avoiding stuff.

00:54:37.066 --> 00:54:38.630
When the rover's doing that it is

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:40.773
excruciatingly slow.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.600
You can watch one of these rovers,

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:44.820
we've tested them on Earth and it will

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:47.960
go like this, and it'll
stop and take a picture,

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.100
and it'll think for
two and a half minutes,

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.270
about what to do before it will move on.

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:57.700
The computer inside this rover

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.100
was a smoking hot machine in about 1987.

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.600
It runs at a screaming 10mips.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:08.250
And so the rover's, I mean
your cellphone is a lot smarter

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.380
than my rovers.

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.830
My rovers are on Mars though.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.930
And so it's excruciatingly slow

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.250
but yeah we're fundamentally limited

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:17.520
by how much power we have.

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.090
If the solar rays were completely clean

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.592
we'd be able to get more mileage per day.

00:55:22.592 --> 00:55:23.593
- [Audience Member 2] Thank you.

00:55:23.593 --> 00:55:24.676
- Yeah, sure.

00:55:27.088 --> 00:55:28.003
- [Audience Member 3]
I was very interested

00:55:28.003 --> 00:55:31.280
to see the microscopic images.

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:33.050
I had wondered from the beginning of

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:34.870
the Mars Exploration Program,

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:39.729
why microscopes were not
put on the earliest rovers.

00:55:39.729 --> 00:55:42.240
- Yeah, the microscopes,

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.010
it has been one of the most
fundamentally useful things

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:45.843
on our payload.

00:55:45.843 --> 00:55:47.460
I think the answer to your question is,

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.090
I mean recognize there
weren't too many missions

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.720
that preceded ours.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.590
There were the two Viking landers,

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:56.330
Viking was fundamentally about looking for

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.390
microbial life in the soil,

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:01.850
and rather than a
microscopic approach to that

00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:04.670
which is very difficult with even soil

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:06.480
samples on Earth, I mean you'd need an

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.620
electron microscope to do it properly,

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:10.860
which is very hard to do for space,

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.220
the approach they took
was a set of experiments

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.240
that you would look at a labeled release

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.830
experiment where you'd feed it a nutrient

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:19.050
and look at the gases come off.

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.400
The next mission was Mars Pathfinder,

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.240
and that was fundamentally
an engineering mission

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.467
that wasn't really about science at all

00:56:25.467 --> 00:56:27.554
and the next mission after that was us,

00:56:27.554 --> 00:56:29.615
so, it kind of makes sense.

00:56:29.615 --> 00:56:31.500
- [Audience Member 3] The
second part of what I'm asking

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.080
really is going forward,
I mean clearly what we'd

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.003
really like to see is evidence of life, so

00:56:37.003 --> 00:56:40.540
what we need is not only
the very fine microscopy,

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.893
but also to be able to dig
down to where there's water.

00:56:44.775 --> 00:56:45.630
And I realize that's a big challenge

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.580
but I was interested in your remarks.

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.260
- That's a very big challenge but it's

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.453
a very important one.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:54.500
Right now, the next missions going to Mars

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.260
is the Mars Science
Laboratory, a big rover,

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.740
what it focuses on
primarily is trying to look

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:03.770
not for water but to look for,

00:57:03.770 --> 00:57:06.750
at very very low concentrations
organic materials

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:08.590
in the rocks and the soil.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:11.530
And then the next step
after that is probably

00:57:11.530 --> 00:57:15.430
to bring samples back
from Mars and that process

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.500
I hope and expect will involve a drill

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.288
that can go a meter or
two below the surface.

00:57:22.288 --> 00:57:23.670
- [Audience Member 3] Thank you.

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:25.210
- [Announcer] Please join me in thanking

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:27.105
professor Squyres for the
wonderful presentation.

00:57:27.105 --> 00:57:30.105
(audience clapping)

00:57:33.813 --> 00:57:37.480
(bright instrumental music)
