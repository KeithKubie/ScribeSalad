00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:18.450
such virtuous notions as dedication and integrity.
I think the more leaders, men, women, all

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:27.460
the young we have in the Middle East can capture
the essence of a combination of moral driven

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.030
dedication to that work. And integrity and
service of the public or the private sector,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.530
the more we're likely to see institutions
that work and not only can inspire and value

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:46.640
people not only within workplace but outside,
the more you can create the dynamics of society

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.770
that lead to the emergence of ideals in people
who help to further the collective common

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.110
good.
