00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.450
So, to mitigate the shortcomings of a scatter plot, we can

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.950
plot the same data as a line chart, and connect the

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.750
dots with lines, as we see in this image. Putting lines

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.240
here really emphasizes trends. So, as we can see, there was

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.810
a pretty bad series of Red Sox teams in the 90s.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.860
And that the Red Sox teams have been doing pretty well

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.090
in the 2000s. It's a little bit harder to see this

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.860
when we just have the points without the lines. That being said,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.850
having lines that connect each point really puts

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.550
a focus on year to year variability. We

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.980
can see, for example that from 1964 to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.940
1965, there's a huge drop. But it's a little

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.840
bit harder to have a good sense of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.970
the more global trends. Are the teams getting better

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.560
or worse on average? For this reason, we

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.100
might introduce a lowest curve instead of these lines.
