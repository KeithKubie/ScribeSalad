well population control is naturally

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
well population control is naturally
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.180
well population control is naturally
occurring I mean in Europe and Japan as

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190
occurring I mean in Europe and Japan as
 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.589
occurring I mean in Europe and Japan as
populations of live longer they have

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
populations of live longer they have
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.950
populations of live longer they have
dramatically reduced the birthrate so in

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
dramatically reduced the birthrate so in
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.109
dramatically reduced the birthrate so in
fact there's a shrinkage in both Europe

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119
fact there's a shrinkage in both Europe
 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.000
fact there's a shrinkage in both Europe
and Japan not in the United States

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
and Japan not in the United States
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.750
and Japan not in the United States
because of immigration but I think it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
because of immigration but I think it
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.359
because of immigration but I think it
sort of balances itself out as people

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369
sort of balances itself out as people
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.800
sort of balances itself out as people
live longer they tend to have fewer

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
live longer they tend to have fewer
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.840
live longer they tend to have fewer
babies and as a result they're able to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
babies and as a result they're able to
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.840
babies and as a result they're able to
put more resources into the education

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
put more resources into the education
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030
put more resources into the education
and the health of the children so it's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
and the health of the children so it's
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790
and the health of the children so it's
been a very positive thing if you think

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
been a very positive thing if you think
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.340
been a very positive thing if you think
back to 1900 when the average life

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
back to 1900 when the average life
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.100
back to 1900 when the average life
expectancy was 47 and you were asking me

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
expectancy was 47 and you were asking me
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.869
expectancy was 47 and you were asking me
this question you could have been

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
this question you could have been
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.830
this question you could have been
thinking where we're going to have all

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
thinking where we're going to have all
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319
thinking where we're going to have all
those 50 year olds and now we have all

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
those 50 year olds and now we have all
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.299
those 50 year olds and now we have all
those 50 year olds so what I think we'll

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
those 50 year olds so what I think we'll
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.130
those 50 year olds so what I think we'll
see is a healthier more vigorous

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
see is a healthier more vigorous
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.319
see is a healthier more vigorous
population of people in their 70s and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329
population of people in their 70s and
 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.930
population of people in their 70s and
80s then we've had before it's a result

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
80s then we've had before it's a result
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.720
80s then we've had before it's a result
of medical science and hopefully people

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
of medical science and hopefully people
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.090
of medical science and hopefully people
taking better care of themselves

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100
 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.159
