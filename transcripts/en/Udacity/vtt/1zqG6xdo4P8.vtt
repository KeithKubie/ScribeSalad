00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.160
First, as far as methods are concerned, where do the methods come from?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.280
One obvious source is the operations in our analysis model.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.490
In addition to the specific services provided, there are signals, okay, and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.970
there maybe actions, activities, and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.560
events in any behavior model such as state charts.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.940
We also have to make sure that we're signing those operations in the form of

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.040
methods to particular classes.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.660
In addition to those that come directly from the analysis model, there's others

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.670
we should always be aware might need to be included in our classes.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.962
You should include constructors and destructors, getters and

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:41.030
setters,copy constructors, printers or,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.310
or methods that construct string versions of the data inside of a class.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.760
Selectors, if you have, complex data,

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.060
how you're going to take out the pieces of it.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.920
And, any kind of, iterators if you have,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.370
if your class has more than one, you know, is a collection class of some sort.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.100
How are you going to provide the elements of that collection.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.120
It's not necessarily the case that every class has to have all of these methods,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.730
but you should be aware of the possibility of their existence so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.440
you can determine early on whether or not that you need to define them
