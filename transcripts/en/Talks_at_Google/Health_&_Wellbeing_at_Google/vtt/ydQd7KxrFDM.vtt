00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:08.870
SPEAKER 1: Sweet.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.050
All right, well thank
you all for joining.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.870
I'm happy here to
have Celeste Headlee.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.300
Celeste has been a
journalist since 1999.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.700
She's worked as reporter,
producer, and host

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.335
in Public Radio on
the local, national,

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.790
and international level.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.260
She started her
broadcasting career

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.950
at Arizona Public
Radio in Flagstaff,

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.100
then moved to WDET in Detroit
before taking a job with NPR.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.960
She's also a TED speaker.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.780
And she wrote this excellent
book called "We Need to Talk."

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.880
It's really awesome.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.005
And she's going to share
some tips on conversation,

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.650
and what we could do to
become better in conversation.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.380
So without much further
ado, let's welcome Celeste.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.676
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:48.800
CELESTE HEADLEE: Most of
us have a pretty hard time

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.650
accepting that we're not
great conversationalists.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.630
Generally, we seem
to think, when

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.304
we have a conversation that goes
bad, we blame the other person.

00:00:58.304 --> 00:00:59.970
And in fact, that's
not just my opinion.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.250
There's a lot of
really good research

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.950
that shows that we actually rate
our conversational skills much

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.620
higher than they actually
are, just in general.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.330
And there's two
things going on there.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.820
The first is the smarter
you are, the harder it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.390
is for you to be
good in conversation.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.510
Being smart in general is
actually pretty helpful.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.040
Logic has probably
helped you solve

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.620
a lot of problems in your life.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.330
But they don't help
you when you're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.850
talking to another human being.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.510
And that's because human
beings, even you, are inherently

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.740
emotional and illogical.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.310
Reason is not,
our logical skills

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.860
are not why we have
succeeded on the planet.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.390
It wasn't our logic
and our reason.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.880
Actually it was our soft
skills and our hive mind.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.580
So emotion isn't
actually a weakness,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.360
even though we think
of it that way.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.734
And we try to punish other
people when they bring emotion

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:49.460
to a conversation, right.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.780
So the problem is, is that you
can't just rely on your IQ.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.120
An EQ is almost more
important in a conversation

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.320
than an IQ is.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.540
You can't even
trust your own logic

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.010
when you're in a conversation.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.468
You can't even
trust your own logic

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:04.640
when you're solving
a logical problem,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.650
let alone an emotional problem.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.960
And I say that because, if
you look at the work of say,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.320
Nobel Prize-winning
psychologist Daniel Kahneman.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.540
And he was the one that
said that, very often, we

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.632
rely on system 1 thinking.

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:17.840
So what is system 1 thinking?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.640
It's really, really useful.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.620
So you're getting
out of the subway,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.699
and you see a really disheveled,
dirty, kind of smelly guy.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.990
And he's sitting on a piece
of cardboard on the ground.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.570
And you say, that's a
homeless guy, right.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.720
That's system 1 thinking.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.470
You're making an
assumption about that.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.960
And we do it all the time.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.820
And it helps us,
because if we actually

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.830
had to reason through
every single thing

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.600
that we encountered
in daily life,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.010
we would get we would get stuck.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.120
We'd never get through anything.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.320
The problem is, is that
system 1 thinking is really

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.030
easily deluded.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.210
And we make assumptions all the
time in conversations, right.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.160
We assume we know what
someone's about to say,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.450
so we interrupt them.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.340
We assume we know
what they mean,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.350
so then we come up
with our response

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.360
before they've even
finished their sentence.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.090
So system 1 thinking
is not always wrong,

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.760
it's just often wrong.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.890
And one of the ways that
Kahneman-- who I again

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.960
want to emphasize is
a psychologist, not

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.140
a mathematician --one of the
ways he demonstrated this

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.080
was by presenting these
really simple math

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.450
problems to students at MIT
and Princeton and Harvard.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.320
So, for example, he would say,
a baseball and a bat together

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.940
cost $1.10.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.130
The bat costs a dollar
more than the ball does.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.540
How much does the ball cost?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.490
And most of the students
said the ball costs $0.10.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.790
But the bat costs a
dollar more than the ball

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.640
does, which means the
ball is actually $0.05,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.120
and the baseball bat is $1.05.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.510
And it's the same thing, he had
another problem where he said,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.140
what was it, there's a
patch of lily pads on a lake

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.640
and every day the
patch doubles in size.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.500
It takes 48 days
for the lily pads

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.534
to completely cover the lake.

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:00.950
How long does it
take for the lily

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.510
pads to cover half the lake?

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.580
Well most people just
divide it in half, right.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.930
And they say 24.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.600
But it takes 47 days.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.210
Because if it doubles in
size, then the day before it

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.100
covered the whole lake,
it covered half the lake.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.920
See, system 1
thinking is even going

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.510
to steer you wrong when you're
dealing with math problems.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.980
So you can imagine how
much it gets screwed up

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.770
when you're dealing
with me, who's

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.300
full of emotion, and memory,
and illogical decisions.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.400
There's another little
wrinkle to this.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.650
And you may have heard
a little bit about this,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.230
but I'll tell you the story
of Justin Kruger and David

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.110
Dunning, knowing perfectly
well you probably Googled this

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.800
before.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.840
But back in 1999,
they were trying

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.630
to figure out how
to train people,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.510
how to train them
more efficiently.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.240
So they tested hundreds, if
not thousands, of people.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.599
And what they did was
they gave them tests.

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.140
And after they'd
taken the test, they

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.780
would say, OK, rate how well
you think you did on the test.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.840
How many problems do
you think you got wrong?

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.550
And then rate how
well you think you did

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.335
in comparison to other people.

00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:05.430
Right?

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.550
And what they discovered
was, the more ignorant

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.710
you are on a subject,
the more likely

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.280
you are to think that
you're above average.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.040
The exact same
competence that's needed

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.410
to have knowledge
of a subject is

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.230
what is needed to actually
evaluate competence.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.180
If you're incompetent
in physics,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.270
you don't know if a physics
problem is hard or easy.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.680
If you're a novice
in tennis, you

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.170
don't know if a play that
Serena Williams just executed

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.240
is difficult or not, right.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.610
If you know nothing about
wine, you'll taste the wine

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.990
and be like, this is delicious.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.880
But you actually
don't have any idea.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.260
And it goes the other way also,
except there's a wrinkle when

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.760
you are competent.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.280
The people who did
really well on the test

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.480
consistently underestimated
how well they did.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.110
And it wasn't that they didn't
know what they got wrong or got

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.650
right.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.180
They were actually
pretty accurate

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.270
in knowing what they got
wrong or what they got right.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.930
Where it went wonky was when
they compared themselves

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.710
to other people, because they
assumed everyone was competent.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.280
So they, in comparison
with others,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.470
underrated themselves thinking
that everyone basically shared

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.150
the base level of competence.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.800
OK, so why am I
telling you this?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.880
It's because 99
times out of 100,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.130
when people ask me
about conversation,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.100
it's about how to change
someone else's behavior.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.190
It's about how to stop somebody
else from interrupting you.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.620
Or how to stop somebody from
running on and on and on

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.850
and boring you to death.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.725
Or how to get out of a
conversation you don't

00:06:35.725 --> 00:06:37.270
want to be in, blah blah blah.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.090
And there's good news
and the bad news on this.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.830
And the bad news is you can't.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.620
You cannot change
someone else's behavior.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.530
The good news is, you
can change your own.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.210
And there's probably
room for improvement.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.450
The other step of
good news there

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.820
is that modeling
behavior is really

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.560
strong among human beings.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.355
If you model good
conversational etiquette,

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:06.480
it's really likely that
the people that you talk to

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.090
on a regular basis
will eventually

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.030
begin to imitate the kind
of conversational habits

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.440
that you have.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.600
So this comes up all
the time at work,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.810
right, because we tend to
think of our soft skills,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.030
the soft skills we hate talking
about, as a waste of time.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.974
We see them as a
distraction, or they're

00:07:27.974 --> 00:07:29.640
getting in the way
of what we want to do

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.490
and our coworker keeps talking
about her kids dance recital,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.891
blah blah blah blah blah.

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.180
But in fact, your
conversations are a way

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.100
to make your work better.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.200
They can make you
better at what you do,

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.360
both at work and at home.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.440
You know, one of
the most powerful

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.500
psychological and sociological
tools that we have now

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.630
is the MRI, the FMRI.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.800
Being able to scan a brain
and watch it thinking

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.230
while that person
is still conscious

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:00.630
has made us aware of
all kinds of things

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.300
that we didn't, I
guess didn't accept,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.932
or weren't aware of before.

00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:06.390
So there's this
great research that

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.670
came out of Harvard in 2014.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.270
And what they discovered is
that talking about yourself

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.400
activates the exact
same pleasure center

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.290
in the brain as sex and heroin.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.030
It's inherently pleasurable,
and not by a small amount.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.700
So I want you to think for
just a moment about maybe

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.040
the last time you
had a job interview

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.050
and you thought it went great.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.460
And then you didn't get called.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.110
Or maybe a date,
you went on a date,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.669
and you're like,
we totally clicked.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.230
That was fantastic.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.750
But you never got
called back then.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.510
That's because your experience
of that conversation

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.750
might have been very
different from theirs.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.730
It screws with our
perception all the time.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.650
Now at this point,
it becomes a problem

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.370
because one of the ways we have
of fixing this communication

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.190
problem is through
face-to-face and voice-to-voice

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.790
conversation.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.560
Human beings are evolutionarily,
biologically, cosmo--

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.310
I mean, just universally
designed beautifully

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.080
to communicate face-to-face.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.960
Or even through the voice,
to detect nuances and changes

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.050
in your voice, to detect body
language and know what it is.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:17.570
You can walk into a room,
right, and without anyone saying

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.930
anything you know if you're
either at a funeral or a party.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.670
We don't give that
very much credence,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.650
but that's actually--
that's huge.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.200
That's an incredible skill
that human beings have

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.240
that many other
creatures don't have.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.780
The problem is when you remove
any kind of human interaction,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.730
either between looking
at somebody's face

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.580
or hearing their voice, right.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.330
How many of you would
rather send an email

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.470
than make a phone call?

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.870
And be honest, because
I know the statistics.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.020
Raise your hand if you'd
rather send an email.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.055
OK.

00:09:45.055 --> 00:09:46.430
It's gotten so
bad at this point,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.560
that there's big
companies like Coke

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.200
and JP Morgan Chase that
have pretty much eliminated

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.640
their voicemail systems.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.910
They don't even have
it available anymore.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.350
So in the year 2000, Americans
sent 14 billion texts

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:01.040
per month.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.570
In 2000.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.380
By 2010, 10 years later,
it was 188 billion.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:12.050
And four years after
that, it was 561 billion.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.570
We spend almost a half
an hour every day,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.280
the average American adult,
texting, and only six minutes

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.180
on the phone.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.160
We don't actually know at this
point what effect that growth

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.320
has on our brains.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.720
The research lags so
far behind, because it

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.510
takes so long to do
a clinical study,

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:35.150
that we don't at
this point know what

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.670
effect the intrusion of
social media and smartphones

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.130
has on our human
relationships and our brains.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.830
But I can tell you
one thing, empathy

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.760
has declined by insane amounts.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.440
The University of
Michigan did a survey

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.570
that compiled the results of
about 72 different studies.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.210
And what they found is that
over a course of 30 years,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.030
empathy declined by 40%.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:05.570
And almost all of that happened
between, say 2000 and 2011.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.590
So I get it.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.420
Correlation is not causation.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.230
But it's kind of hard to
not see a relationship

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.450
between the rise in all
of this communication,

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.690
digital communication,
and the reduction

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.790
in our own human empathy
and relationships

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.200
between each other.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.080
So I wanted to stay with
empathy for just a moment,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.859
because empathy is not one
of those dreaded soft skills

00:11:26.859 --> 00:11:27.650
that we talk about.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.560
Empathy has a real purpose,
and it's important.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.330
It has an evolutionary purpose.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.830
It has a sociological purpose
and a societal purpose.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.620
And the loss of empathy
is really troubling.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.330
It can cause us
some real problems.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.080
And if you're looking
around at the world,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.440
not just in the US
where it's bad enough,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.540
but at Brexit, and
the migrant crisis,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.790
and all those things going
on in other places as well,

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.280
you can see we need
empathy in order

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.659
to be able to get
along with one another.

00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:56.450
The difference between
empathy and sympathy

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.370
is, sympathy is when
you say to somebody,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.270
you know, I feel bad for you.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:01.160
I feel for you.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.510
I'm sorry that happened to you.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.690
Empathy is when you
say, I feel with you.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.570
I can understand
what that's like.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.570
I can imagine what I
would feel like if I

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.550
were in that same situation.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.940
And it's a really, really
crucial survival skill.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.716
So again, I'm at Google.

00:12:19.716 --> 00:12:21.590
I'm not talking about
putting away your tech.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.910
I am not anti-tech.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.900
I wear a Fitbit.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.400
I've got a Surface tablet.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.550
I have pretty much every
possible technology

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.870
I could possibly get.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.570
My entire radio
show is basically

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.310
operated from Google Drive.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.530
Like, I am not anti-tech.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.560
But there are things that
tech does really, really well.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.620
There are things that tech
does better than human beings.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.830
And there are things that human
beings do better than tech,

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.080
and will always do
better than tech.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.805
And we need to learn
to separate those two.

00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:53.180
We need to start being honest
about what is an inherently

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.020
human skill, and what is an
inherently technological skill,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.920
and then render unto
Caesar what is Caesar's.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.500
So that's kind of what we're
going to be talking about.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.680
And the biggest
barrier to conversation

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.080
is that phone that all
of you probably have,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.455
if not in your hands,
then close enough.

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:13.830
Let me tell you
about this study.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.270
The average adult,
by this point,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.895
checks-- and this
was, this is research

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:19.620
that is a few years old, so
it's probably more than this,

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.500
but the average adult checks
their phone about 110 times

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.000
a day.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.520
And that's about once
every 13 seconds.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.370
It peaks at about once every
six seconds in the evenings,

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.050
by the way.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:32.450
And the problem with
that is that the phone

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.180
is having effects on your
brain that you're not actually

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.680
aware of.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.540
So they did these
studies in Britain

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.560
in which they brought in a
whole bunch of people strangers.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.880
They had never met each other.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.060
And they just had them have
five to 10 minute conversations.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.610
In half of those
conversations, they went in

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.160
and they just placed a
cell phone on the table.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.050
It didn't belong to
either of the people.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.490
It did not make any noise.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.576
They just set it
there on the table.

00:13:57.576 --> 00:14:00.200
And in those situations in which
there was a cell phone sitting

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.480
on the table, the
pairs of people

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.400
were something like
60% to 70% more

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.070
likely to say the other person
was unfriendly, untrustworthy,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.772
unempathetic, and unlikable.

00:14:09.772 --> 00:14:12.230
So I want you to think about
how many times you've sat down

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.390
to have lunch with a
friend or something,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.225
and you just set your
phone on the table,

00:14:16.225 --> 00:14:17.600
but you felt really
good about it

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.420
because you didn't look at it.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.210
What you don't realize is that,
subconsciously, your brain

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.980
is aware of that phone.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.030
It's having an effect
on the other person.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.030
It's also having
an effect on you.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:33.020
Because there's really great
research on distraction.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.880
And what that those
studies show us,

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.550
is that even when your
phone makes no noise at all,

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.940
your brain is aware of it.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.940
And it's actually in
fight or flight mode,

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.840
prepared to respond
should it make noise.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.900
Part of your brain power is
occupied in paying attention

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.400
to the email client
that you have

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.490
open in the background of
your computer at all times.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.380
It's distracting you.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.180
You're just not aware of it.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.440
So a lot of us get
advice on conversation.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.170
And almost all of it is crap.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.690
We have heard, you
know, nod your head

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.980
to show that you're listening.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.940
Say uh-huh, maintain eye
contact at all times.

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.430
Believe me, I've
tried it all out.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:18.916
It is terrible advice.

00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:20.290
You know, instead
of learning how

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.748
to pretend that you're paying
attention, which is basically

00:15:22.748 --> 00:15:24.580
what nodding and
saying uh-huh is,

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.830
it's way more authentic when
you actually pay attention.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.370
So I want you to actually
forget the advice

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.960
you've had on small talk.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.160
There's no phrases
that you can use.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.330
There's nothing that you need to
avoid saying, except for things

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:38.770
like "I'm not a racist, but."

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.690
Avoid that.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.720
Other than that,
there's no catch phrases

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:46.120
to either use or not use
that are going to help you.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.000
Because it's all
about you being who

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.850
you are as an individual,
and recognizing

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.590
that other person being who
they are as an individual.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.650
And that's always
going to be different.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.350
So I want to start
with the 10 things

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.300
that you can actually do to
make your conversations better.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.530
And I would recommend that
you choose one, choose

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.065
one thing that you can do.

00:16:10.065 --> 00:16:11.440
Don't leave the
room and be like,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.510
I'm going to be the best
conversationalist ever.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.310
No, that's not going to happen.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.740
But choose one, and
choose the easiest,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.530
the one that you think
you can make that change

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.430
without a lot of effort.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.160
So the first one
is don't multitask.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:32.750
And you've probably already
seen a lot of the research.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.572
Human beings can't multitask.

00:16:35.572 --> 00:16:37.280
It's not possible for
our brains to focus

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.710
on one thing at the
same time that we're

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.040
doing something else.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.940
But some of the other research
shows, there's a few things.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.700
A, the attempt to
multitask, when

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.740
you're trying to
do multiple things,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.320
it pumps dopamine
into your brain.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.760
It feels really, really good.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.390
But the other side of dopamine,
you probably already know,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.220
is that you then crash.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.001
So if you have spent the
day trying to multitask,

00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:03.500
you're going to go home at the
end of the day more exhausted

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.125
and feeling more
fatigued than if you'd

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.420
done one thing at a time.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.530
That's the first thing.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.050
The second thing
is that the quality

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.050
of your work of both tasks,
say you're on a conference call

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.869
but you're also answering email,
quality of work for both things

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.790
goes down by about 20%.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.339
And your IQ drops by 10 points.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.869
So I wouldn't do that.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.314
And certainly not
in conversation.

00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:26.230
And I don't mean just
putting your phone down.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.920
What I mean is being present
in that moment, being

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.690
there in that conversation.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.660
Not trying to listen to somebody
while you're thinking about a

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.490
fight that you just had.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.100
And that's not always possible.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.200
It's not always
possible to be present.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.350
And so therefore, if
you can't be present

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.630
and it's not an
urgent conversation,

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.430
it's better to walk away.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.560
If you're not able to
focus and pay attention,

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.540
it's better to put
that conversation off

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.090
until there's a time
when you can actually

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.452
be there for the conversation.

00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:57.910
Because otherwise,
you're basically

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:01.010
wasting both of your time.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.190
The second thing is
don't pontificate.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.130
Now pontificate
means to lecture.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.400
What I'm doing right
now is pontificating.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.440
But we're not in a conversation.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.530
And this is another
particularly difficult thing

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.630
for smart people
because we know a lot.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.140
And so people will start
talking about something,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.150
and we'll start telling
everybody everything

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.260
that we know about that subject.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.680
That's not a good conversation.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.420
You should not go
into a conversation

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.930
trying to educate other people.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.260
Just believe me.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.960
My book goes into exactly
all the reasons why.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.180
But it's going to turn
that other person off.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.070
And they won't
listen to you anyway.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.880
They will absorb almost nothing
of what you say to them.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.824
So don't waste your time, right.

00:18:46.824 --> 00:18:48.240
Instead, just have
a conversation,

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.490
and enter into the
conversation assuming that you

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:53.350
have something to learn.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.360
It's best to just
give up on going

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.910
into a conversation trying
to change anybody's mind

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.180
or trying to educate anybody.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.700
This point is going to
come up a little bit later.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.890
But you basically have
to be quiet and just

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.996
let people speak.

00:19:07.996 --> 00:19:09.370
I'm not actually
worried that you

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.578
have had people who said,
well, if I do what you say,

00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:12.820
I will never get to talk.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.060
I'm not actually
worried about that.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.960
There's very few
people in this world

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.030
that I'm concerned about
that would just stop talking.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.340
That's not a concern.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.620
But you're probably not
listening as much as

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.300
that you think that you are.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.460
But also you're just missing
out on a lot of things

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.530
other people have to tell you.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.350
Just because someone is
not educated, or maybe even

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.170
not smart, doesn't mean they're
not an expert in something.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.660
I mean this is how
Bill Nye says it.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.150
But what I always say,
and one of the things that

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.870
has been most surprising to
me over my career in NPR is,

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.000
everybody is an
expert in something.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.200
Everybody.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.330
There's something that high
school dropout truck driver

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.130
knows better than anybody else.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.660
His area or her
area of expertise.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.020
And if you go around with
an effort to find that,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.770
find what it is that makes
someone else really an expert,

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.740
you're going to be one of the
smartest people on the planet.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.520
I mean, even Larry
King says, you know,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.150
I'm not going to learn
anything from what I say today.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.694
The only way I'm going
to learn is by listening.

00:20:15.694 --> 00:20:17.110
And if all you're
doing is walking

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:20.170
around telling people what
you know, you're not growing.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.370
You are learning nothing.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:26.370
So view everybody as a
receptacle of information

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.240
which is 100% unique to them.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.760
Some of it is probably crap.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.829
Some of it is wrong.

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:33.620
But, you know what?

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.260
That's true of you,
too, statistically.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.380
That's also true.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.380
So you can get through
that, and you can find

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.610
real nuggets of information.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.550
Not always, but a lot of times.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.639
The third one is
open-ended questions.

00:20:45.639 --> 00:20:47.930
And this is something that
journalists use all the time

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.420
to get better information
and better interviews out

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.170
of people.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:54.090
That means a question that
starts with who, what, where,

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:55.730
when, why or how.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.500
And the formula for
a young reporter

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.050
is that, if you put a
complicated question in,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.180
you will get a
simple answer out.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:03.620
And if you put a
simple answer in,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.060
you'll get a
complicated answer out.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.870
In other words, we
often ask questions

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.250
in which we're trying to
steer their response, right.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.446
And you hear this from bad
interviewers all the time.

00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:17.820
You know, you were
in a hurricane

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.890
and the winds were going blah
blah blah 120 miles an hour.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.210
And I guess you haven't
even found your dog yet,

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.460
and your roof just peeled off.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.209
Oh my god, that must
have been terrifying.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.700
The better thing is, the
hurricane hit your house.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.700
You were still here.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.522
What happened?

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:35.230
How did you feel?

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.447
What did you hear?

00:21:37.447 --> 00:21:38.530
What happened to your dog?

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.810
Why can't you find your dog?

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.060
Let them take
control at that point

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.070
and tell you what happened.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.570
Let them have that moment.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.330
Because they were the one that
was actually experiencing it.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:52.380
And this is really, really
important with coworkers,

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:55.410
especially if you're a manager.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.810
You need to let the other
person actually describe what

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:58.976
it is they're going through.

00:21:58.976 --> 00:22:03.570
And try to resist the temptation
to assume you know what they're

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.364
about to say, and interrupt
them and then describe

00:22:06.364 --> 00:22:08.280
what it is that you think
that they're saying.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.510
That's what leads to
really bad communication.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.480
There was actually, I was at the
TED summit last year in Banff.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.257
And this nuclear scientist
from Japan comes up to me,

00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:20.840
and he says, you know I watched
your TED talk like three times

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.610
and I still can't figure out
how to start a conversation.

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:26.910
And I said, well, where
are you from in Japan?

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.140
And he says, I'm from Kyoto.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.490
And I said, you know I've
never actually been there.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.967
Is that like Tokyo?

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.550
Is it like all packed,
really crowded?

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.690
And he goes, no no no no.

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:34.380
It's more spread out.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.940
You've seen the pictures
of all the temples

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.940
and the cherry blossoms.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.560
And I was like oh, so do most
people have an apartment?

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.705
Or they have a house
with an actual yard?

00:22:42.705 --> 00:22:45.330
And so he starts describing it,
and about 5 or 10 minutes later

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.090
I said, that's how you
start a conversation.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.420
You ask questions that they know
the answer to about something

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.780
they care about.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.120
That's it.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.580
And that's why small
talk is so easy.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.330
And it's so rewarding
for your brain.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.424
And your life
expectancy gets longer

00:23:02.424 --> 00:23:04.590
if you actually talk to
your neighbors and strangers

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.640
on the subway.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.250
You actually, your blood
pressure goes down.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:10.800
Small talk that everyone
thinks is not worth your time

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.360
and you'd rather
stare at your phone,

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.640
small talk is
really good for you.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.450
Really good for you, even if
it's about nothing important,

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:23.640
like the weather or the most
recent raise in gas prices.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.210
Even those totally meaningless
conversations are great for you

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.470
as a human being.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.930
And they have zero
investment, right.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.520
You're not happy with it?

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.670
You say excuse me, and you go
back to your cell phone, right.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.140
They say something offensive?

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.030
You say hmm, it's been
nice talking to you,

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:40.488
and you go back to
your cell phone.

00:23:40.488 --> 00:23:41.340
Zero risk.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.660
No commitment.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.057
I highly recommend that
you just start talking

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:46.140
to everybody that you can.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.910
Your Uber driver,
whoever it is, just

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.710
have these meaningless
conversations.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.620
Believe me, if you're not
happier a month or two later,

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.170
you can email me and complain.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.550
Full money back guarantee.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.900
OK.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.670
The fourth one is
go with the flow.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.120
So, going with the flow
means actually allowing

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.210
the conversation
to evolve, and not

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.800
inserting your own thoughts.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.945
So let's say someone says, well
let's meet at Starbucks later.

00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:16.320
And suddenly you remember that
time you were at Starbucks

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.290
and you saw Ellen DeGeneres,
and she admired your shirt

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:19.840
or whatever.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.600
And so you stop listening
to everything else

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.190
they just said, and you're
just waiting for them

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:25.481
to take a breath so you can
tell your story about Ellen

00:24:25.481 --> 00:24:27.120
Degeneres.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.070
That's what I want
you to stop doing.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.720
You can't stop the thoughts
from coming into your head.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.350
They're going to,
but what you can do

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.540
is let go of those
thoughts and let

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.550
them flow right out of
your head and go back

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.470
to what it was the
other person was saying.

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.920
Part of this occurs through
mindfulness training,

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.280
but it's just about not
holding on to those ideas that

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.810
come into your
head and turning it

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.420
into a self-promotional video.

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.470
Besides, you probably told Ellen
Degeneres story too many times.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.600
OK, number five
is another big one

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.500
that smart people
have a problem with.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.470
And if you don't know, just
say that you don't know.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.890
I bet you can probably guess
the profession, the number one

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.047
profession that has the
hardest time with this one.

00:25:13.047 --> 00:25:15.380
What profession do you think
would have the hardest time

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.220
saying I don't know.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:16.970
AUDIENCE: Priests.

00:25:20.522 --> 00:25:21.980
CELESTE HEADLEE:
It's a good guess,

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.050
but actually it's surgeons.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:29.330
Surgeons can't seem to bring
themselves to say I don't know.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.930
And this has become a problem,
right, because they guess.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.010
So there have been studies
done based in medical offices.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.620
And one of them in which they
had their control group just

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.960
continue on as they were
doing, and this was with GPs,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.700
this one wasn't
even with surgeons.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.920
And the other one they
said, every time you don't

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.540
know an answer just say, I don't
know but I'm going to find out.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.460
That's it, they just replaced
their guesses with that phrase.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.400
And at the end of the
study, the patients who

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.460
had the second group liked
their doctors better,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.140
their estimation of
their intelligence

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.419
went up significantly,
their belief

00:26:07.419 --> 00:26:09.085
in their credibility
and their knowledge

00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:11.230
went up significantly.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.150
And I realize it seems
counter-intuitive

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.370
that saying I don't know makes
people think you know more.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.390
But when you try to figure that
out, it actually makes sense.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:23.350
Because the fact of the matter
is is we can't know everything.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.950
And so when you pretend
to know everything,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.530
people know that
some of it is BS.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.792
They just don't know which
is BS and which isn't.

00:26:31.792 --> 00:26:33.250
So they're going
to view everything

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.930
you say with a grain of salt.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.150
And when I say you
don't know, reading

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.970
the first couple of
paragraphs or the preview

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.160
that shows up in your
Google search on a subject

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.800
is not the same as knowing.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.810
You need to actually be
an expert on a subject

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.700
before you offer any
unsolicited advice.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.120
Actually forget that, don't
offer unsolicited advice.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.070
But don't say you
know something,

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:57.040
don't say a movie's
great or terrible,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.570
unless you've seen the movie.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.760
Don't base it off
somebody else's review.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.670
Just say I don't know.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.220
The sixth one is don't equate
your experience with other

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.720
people's.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.700
And this one is
surprisingly, to me at least,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.500
the hardest one for
people to accept.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.030
So if somebody says,
I just lost my job,

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:20.890
do not tell them
about the time you

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:23.110
lost your job two years ago.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.040
Or if someone's dog died, do
not tell them about the time

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.830
that you lost your dog.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.610
And I know this is
difficult for people

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:35.050
because we think that what
we're doing is empathetic.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:38.170
And I say that because
that's been my intention when

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.290
I've done that, and
I've done it plenty.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:44.180
And in the book I share a
particularly still-painful--

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.790
like my cheeks
still got hot when

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:50.050
I think about that --moment,
because it was so bad.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.200
You think that what
you're saying to them is,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.110
I've been through this.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.070
It's going to be OK.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.440
But you haven't been through it.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.580
You haven't.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.070
You've been through something
that's kind of similar.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.800
But you're a different
person in a different place

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.750
with different resources.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.620
And even just as
importantly, human beings,

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.440
when they're comfortable,
your accuracy,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.190
your empathetic accuracy,
goes into the toilet.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.540
So if you lost your job two
years ago but now you're OK,

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:24.970
you are more likely to
underestimate how much

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:26.920
the other person is suffering.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.410
If you went through a
divorce three years ago,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.170
and now it's three years later
and someone just found out

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.850
they're going to
get a divorce, you

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.620
are more likely
to think it's not

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.120
that bad, because our comfort
makes us incapable of actually

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.240
analyzing or estimating the
other person's feelings.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.940
And so you're more likely to
say things which are not good

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.600
to say, like, it's going to
be OK or, it's all right,

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.480
everything happens for
a reason or, who knows,

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.520
this could be the
universe closing the door

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.690
and opening a window.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.210
Those are terrible
things to say.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:28:59.150
They're not good.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.300
And the number one worst
thing that you could say

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.500
is, I know how you feel,
because you do not.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.640
You don't.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.410
It's just like the
open-ended questions.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.360
You need to ask them.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.720
If they have come to you
with a struggle or a pain,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.120
it means what they
need right now

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:21.090
is to be able to describe
what they're going through.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.710
That's what they're there for.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.990
They're not there to hear
about your experience

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:26.970
that you had a
couple of years ago.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.440
I know this is hard
to let go, too.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.000
I totally get it.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.330
But believe me, you're
never going to say, gee,

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.210
I really regret
telling about myself

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:36.300
in that particular moment.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.680
Like, that's never going to be
a mistake, unless they ask you,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.720
you went through a
divorce three years ago.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.740
What lawyer did you use?

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740
How did that go for you?

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.450
Then, all bets are off,
out of the gates, go ahead.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.720
Otherwise, let them talk.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.110
Number seven is don't
repeat yourself.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.460
So it's not only women.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:03.270
Everybody does this,
but women especially

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.099
tend to repeat themselves.

00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:07.140
And part of the reason is
we'll give instructions

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:10.500
to someone, a kid or a
husband or spouse or partner,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.960
and we don't get
the acknowledgment

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.890
of what we just said.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.750
And so we go about rephrasing
it a bunch of times.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.080
Now, the other class of
person that does this a lot

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.690
is managers.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.690
Like you'll be in a
meeting, and they'll say OK,

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:25.980
so the deadline is 4:00 PM.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.750
And then they'll go on talking
and they'll say, now remember,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.040
if it doesn't get
to us by 4:00 PM,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.080
such and such terrible, dire
thing is going to happen.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.246
And then later on they
rephrase it, and rephrase it,

00:30:33.246 --> 00:30:34.110
and rephrase it.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.390
Now, not only is
that really boring.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.730
But more importantly, right,
because everything you

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.230
say is really important, right.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.880
More importantly,
you're training them

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.770
not to listen to you.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.950
And this is especially true
with children, but also spouses.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.200
They're not going to pay
attention to you because they

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.825
know you're going to repeat it.

00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:52.450
That's what you're
training them to do.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.100
I'm going to say this again.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.220
So I would highly recommend
that, especially if it's

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.744
important information,
you get people into the--

00:30:59.744 --> 00:31:01.660
do you think Colin Powell
repeats himself when

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.890
he tells people to do things?

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:04.000
He does not.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.450
He says it once, and then you're
culpable if it doesn't happen.

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.720
And you deserve the same
respect as Colin Powell.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.989
So just say it once.

00:31:11.989 --> 00:31:13.780
Don't bore people, and
don't train them not

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.620
to listen to you.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.727
Just don't say it again.

00:31:15.727 --> 00:31:17.560
The first few times
that happens with a kid,

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.990
I can tell you from
experience, it's painful.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.040
But, especially if you make
the stakes high like I did,

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.009
like I'm taking your
car in to the shop.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.800
You're not going to
have it for three days.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.680
And then he gets ready to
go to work the next day

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.930
and he's like, where's my car?

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:32.211
And I'm like, I told you.

00:31:32.211 --> 00:31:34.210
I'm doing this thing where
I only tell you once.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:37.720
Yeah, it can be painful,
but it absolutely works.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.080
OK, number eight is
stay out of the weeds.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.630
And by the weeds, when
journalists say the weeds,

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.510
they mean unnecessary
details, things

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.250
that people don't need to know.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.760
Now this happens a lot
with doctors and scientists

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.150
and computer programmers
and software engineers,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.597
that they just tell you details
that are totally unnecessary.

00:31:58.597 --> 00:32:00.430
But it happens in your
regular conversations

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.330
all the time, too.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.538
Someone will say, well, I'm
going to Italy next year.

00:32:03.538 --> 00:32:06.210
And you'll say, oh my
god Italy is so great.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.780
I went there in 2011.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.980
No, you know what?

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.890
It was 2012, because
Julie had just graduated.

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:12.501
You know what?

00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:13.000
It wasn't.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.680
it was, it had to
have been 2013,

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.991
because we'd just bought that
Volvo because the other one

00:32:17.991 --> 00:32:18.490
had--

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.530
I mean, at that
point they are gone,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.790
and you will probably
not get them back.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:23.500
That's it.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.000
Nobody cares about that stuff.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.340
Now, keeping track
of those things

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.010
is actually quite good
for your own brain,

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.800
so I highly recommend
a journal or blog.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.890
But don't journal or blog
all over other people.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.900
Just keep the details out of it.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.386
Now this next one is
the most important one.

00:32:43.386 --> 00:32:45.760
So this is the one we're going
to spend the most time on,

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.620
and it's listening.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.170
Now, I said that
research shows us

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:54.220
that we tend to overestimate
our skills at conversation,

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.080
and that's especially
true of listening.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:59.830
But it's not really
our fault. Human beings

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.270
are just not designed
to listen well.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:06.550
And even going
back decades, back

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:09.670
to the father of
listening, Ralph Nichols,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.000
they showed that if they
made people listen to someone

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.760
talking for like 10 minutes,
and they would tell them

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.910
we're going to test you
on this when it's done,

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.750
so listen carefully.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.970
Immediately after that
person stopped talking,

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.280
people only retained
50% of what they heard.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.680
48 hours later, it
was down to 25%,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.370
and three months
later it was all gone.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.642
We do not retain
information well.

00:33:32.642 --> 00:33:34.850
That's why Google's so
successful as a search engine,

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:35.570
right.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.500
We need something else to
retain information and make

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.270
it archivable.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.380
We don't do that, which means
it requires training and effort

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.324
and energy for us to actually
listen in an engaged way.

00:33:49.324 --> 00:33:50.990
If you're not doing
that, though, you're

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.120
not actually having
conversations.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.921
So, I mean Buddha said,
if my mouth is open,

00:33:57.921 --> 00:33:58.920
I'm not learning, right.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:01.211
I mean there are so many
incredibly smart people who've

00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:03.630
talked about just the
crucialness of listening

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:04.500
as a skill.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.450
I mean I could spend the rest
of the time just quoting them.

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.020
But business people
and academics

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.892
have said it's one of
the top three or five,

00:34:11.892 --> 00:34:13.350
depending on which
one you look at,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:15.960
most important skills you
need for success in business.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.210
But in fact, if you look
at business journals,

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.997
1.5% of the articles
deal with listening.

00:34:20.997 --> 00:34:23.580
How many of you, at some point,
were offered a public speaking

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.770
course?

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.659
Most of you.

00:34:26.659 --> 00:34:29.800
How many of you were
offered a listening course?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.699
Right.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:32.860
So the thing of it is,
is that we actually have

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.752
to be trained in how to listen.

00:34:34.752 --> 00:34:37.210
There's this great research
coming out of Australia and New

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.912
Zealand in their
school system there

00:34:38.912 --> 00:34:40.870
in which what they
discovered is that, in order

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:42.730
to improve your
listening skills,

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:44.350
you can't learn it
through osmosis.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:46.719
You don't learn to listen
during history class.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.659
You only learn to listen
when somebody tells you now

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:52.052
we're going to learn
how to listen better,

00:34:52.052 --> 00:34:54.010
and then you actually
get training specifically

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:54.551
in listening.

00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:56.050
And if anyone's
had an infant, you

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:58.360
know we're not born
knowing how to listen.

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.460
We're born knowing
how to scream.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.720
We talk really well.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.150
We don't listen very well.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:06.109
And the reason I say this
is because you're not

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:07.691
going to leave this
room and say like,

00:35:07.691 --> 00:35:09.790
oh, I'm going to be a
great listener from now on.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:10.860
You are not.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.970
It's going to take
discipline and practice,

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.000
and sometimes you're not going
to have the energy for it,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.390
and that's OK.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:18.910
It's OK to walk
away at that point.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.370
I am not about
more conversation.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.700
I'm about better conversations
when you have them.

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.052
So, I mean, one of the
reasons that we don't listen

00:35:29.052 --> 00:35:30.260
is because we get distracted.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.960
And one of the reasons
we get distracted

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:33.490
is because the
average person talks

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:35.950
at about 150 words per minute.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:36.730
I'm from LA.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.690
I talk considerably
faster than that.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.200
But you listen at up to
450 words per minute.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.870
So there's an extra
300 words in there

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.090
that our brains are filling in.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:48.910
And we are inherently
interesting to ourselves.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:51.890
So, what we're thinking is
sometimes more interesting

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.100
that what the other
person is saying.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.120
That's why letting stuff go out
of your brain is so important.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.310
Because you have to be
able to let those 300 words

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.090
go by and still return to what
that other person is saying.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.910
As Stephen Covey
said, most of us

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.770
don't listen with the
intent to understand,

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:12.630
we listen with the
intent to reply.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.590
And almost all of us
do that, worldwide.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.410
Worldwide, the amount of time
between one person ending

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.050
a sentence and the
other person responding,

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:27.060
is less than half a
second, worldwide,

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.666
which means nobody
is actually listening

00:36:29.666 --> 00:36:31.040
to everything
somebody has to say

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.830
before they think about what
it is they need to say next.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:35.630
And I highly recommend
you get in the habit

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.400
of taking a breath.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.440
Up that average.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.660
Take a breath to absorb
what someone else has said,

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.320
and really think about
it, before you respond.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.650
OK the last one,
number 10, is be brief.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.870
So you probably already know
that our attention spans

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.760
are shrinking.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.804
Microsoft has done incredible
work on our attention spans.

00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:01.470
I don't know who the
poor researcher was

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.620
that had to watch the fish
all day, but at this point

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.720
our attention spans,
especially on the internet,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.270
is eight seconds at a time
before we're distracted,

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.500
and that's one second less
than that of a goldfish.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.884
We get distracted really easily.

00:37:13.884 --> 00:37:15.300
I'm not saying
that's a bad thing.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.620
It may not be.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.720
Who knows, maybe
evolutionarily there's

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.370
a real advantage to that.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.630
But I will say that if you talk
for several minutes at a time

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.940
without allowing the
other person to respond,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.530
you're going to lose them.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.600
That's just the
fact of the matter.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.090
I try to use a game
of catch as an example

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.990
of a good, healthy conversation.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.690
Because in a game of catch, if
it's friendly and you're both

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.380
trying to have fun, you cannot
throw more times than you

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.900
catch.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.319
It's an even split
between the two.

00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:49.110
Not only that, you
don't hold onto the ball

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.090
for minutes at a time.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.830
You throw it back immediately.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.900
And you throw it in
a way where you're

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.960
trying to let them catch it.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:59.370
If it's a fun
game, right, you're

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:01.800
not pegging it off 500 yards.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.500
Yeah, well, 500
yards, nice throw,

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.180
but you're not pegging
it off the other way

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.770
so they can't catch it.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.060
You're setting each
other up for success.

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.540
And you're sharing the space.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.060
I gave a speech to ESPN,
and now one of their CEOs

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.100
keeps a ball on his
desk at all times,

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.040
just to remind him to let
the other person talk.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.550
And I would say the same to you.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.730
The last thing I want to talk
to you about is neural coupling.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.540
And this is also pretty recent
research out of Princeton.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.030
So what they discovered,
this gets me all geeked out,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:38.022
so what they discovered is
that when one person is telling

00:38:38.022 --> 00:38:39.480
a personal story,
like in this case

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.690
they used a girl telling a
story about a disastrous prom

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.740
she had, and then they
hooked them all up to FMRIs

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.420
and they let other people
listen to her story.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.110
What they found was that
when people were listening

00:38:52.110 --> 00:39:00.260
in an engaged way, their brains'
waves synced up almost exactly.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:05.210
In fact so exactly that,
at times, the listener

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.480
would anticipate changes
in the speaker's brain

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.820
by a fraction of a second.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.520
Like they call it neural
coupling, but it's mind meld,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.180
right.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.710
That's mind meld.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.014
It's amazing, right.

00:39:18.014 --> 00:39:19.430
If Gene Roddenberry
had written it

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.013
in Star Trek we'd be like, well,
that's never going to happen.

00:39:22.013 --> 00:39:24.410
It's totally real.

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.110
And this is what we
give up when we text.

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.810
This is what you give up
when you use an emoji.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.870
This is inherently human.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.880
We are able to
connect on a level

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.210
that no emoji or
digital device is ever

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:40.110
going to be able to replicate.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.140
So keep your technology.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.420
Use your technology for
all the things it does well

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:49.040
but reclaim this.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:49.753
OK.

00:39:49.753 --> 00:39:53.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.605
SPEAKER 1: My first question is
when did you have the epiphany

00:39:56.605 --> 00:39:57.730
to start writing this book?

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.063
CELESTE HEADLEE: So that's
really, you've read the book,

00:40:00.063 --> 00:40:02.320
so you already read-- that's
where the book starts,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.730
is that I was doing research
for a story on flight safety.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:10.020
And I read, part
of my research, I

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.670
read the transcript of the black
box recording of a plane that

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:19.840
went down outside of
D.C. And it was snowy,

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.290
the pilot hadn't had a lot of
experience with cold weather,

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.920
he chose to take off before
de-icing the plane engine one

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.140
more time, and they
crashed within minutes

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:31.830
and just about everybody died,
only two people survived.

00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:33.580
But when you read the
black box recording,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.992
the co-pilot repeatedly tries
to say something's wrong,

00:40:36.992 --> 00:40:38.950
keeps tapping the
instruments saying, you know,

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:39.950
that doesn't look right.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.520
Buh buh buh buh bah, and the
pilot says no, it's all fine.

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.565
And there was a lot of
different developments

00:40:46.565 --> 00:40:48.190
that came out of that
particular crash.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.390
We learned a lot from it.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.750
But one of the things that
the FAA investigators thought

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.250
was, well we need
to teach co-pilots

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.080
how to be more assertive.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.210
And my thought was, why
can't we teach pilots

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.920
how to listen better?

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.292
You know, I mean
granted, most of us

00:41:02.292 --> 00:41:04.000
aren't going to have
a conversation where

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.500
there's lives in the balance.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.040
But frankly, in hospitals,
thousands of people

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.570
die every year because of
miscommunications in hospitals.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.160
That's just the truth.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.642
And that's, those
numbers are small,

00:41:15.642 --> 00:41:17.350
because the only ones
we're able to track

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.710
are the ones in which there
was a malpractice suit filed.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.430
So it's more than that.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.550
I mean, there are lives
at stake over the fact

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.780
that we can't communicate.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:27.700
And in the business
world, I'm not

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.950
trying to compare
human life to money,

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.040
but we lose trillions of dollars
every year to miscommunication,

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.960
a lot of it caused
by email, frankly.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.650
Email is the devil when
it comes to communication.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.450
There's only-- there's very few
things that email does better

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.570
than a phone call, very few.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.520
But that was sort of
the epiphany for me,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.080
was like, we're looking at
communication all wrong.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.440
It's not about the talker,
it's about the listener.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.690
SPEAKER 1: Why do
you think we focus

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:58.670
so much time on becoming
better communicators,

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.979
and not listeners?

00:42:00.979 --> 00:42:02.520
CELESTE HEADLEE:
Well, right, because

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.170
like the cult of personality.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.212
I mean, when people are
talking about Steve Jobs,

00:42:06.212 --> 00:42:08.753
they're talking about the guy
standing in front of the screen

00:42:08.753 --> 00:42:09.750
and being so inspiring.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.880
And TED talks, you
know, somebody up

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:14.430
there blowing your
mind because they're

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.650
such an incredible speaker.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.780
And we've also gotten to
this place in social media

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.240
where everyone's getting
these personal brands,

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.740
and everyone has a blog.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.540
And you could argue
that Faceblog is sort--

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.090
Facebook is kind of a
living blog for everybody

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.260
at all times.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.730
Like, it's always about
creating your own identity.

00:42:35.116 --> 00:42:36.990
And we're trying to do
it in a vacuum, right.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:39.840
We want to create our own
identity without anybody

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.150
getting in our way.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:46.120
And so we also want
to stay in control,

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.460
like we don't want to hear
things that we don't like.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.070
We don't want to talk about
stuff that we don't like.

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.550
We want to customize
the human experience.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.940
We want to be able to
unfriend people, like,

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.090
as they're talking to us.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.980
Unfriend, go away.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.310
You know, we have
created this reality

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:07.690
in which we think we can avoid
inconvenience and things that

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:09.050
bother us.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.920
But the truth of it is, is
that that mess and that chaos

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.590
is actually, that's
the good stuff.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.200
I mean that's the good stuff.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.720
You're going to have to
sift through some crap.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.000
But in the end,
the true epiphanies

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.220
and inspiration and
imagination, that's

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.676
going to come through that
chaos, not outside of it.

00:43:28.676 --> 00:43:31.300
SPEAKER 1: So kind of like going
through the suffering process,

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.710
surviving it, enduring it.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.300
CELESTE HEADLEE: The
crucible of your character.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.640
SPEAKER 1: Now does that
connect to your other point

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.600
about how you said
younger generations are

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.394
showing an empathy gap?

00:43:41.394 --> 00:43:42.310
CELESTE HEADLEE: Yeah.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.370
Well, you know,
digital communication

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.830
allows us to be the
worst possible iteration

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:48.927
of ourselves.

00:43:48.927 --> 00:43:51.010
They've done a lot of
stories on our personalities

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.340
in email, for example, and we
tend to be less cooperative,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.050
we're more insulting,
we're ruder,

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.552
and we're less likely
to negotiate in email.

00:43:59.552 --> 00:44:00.760
And there's other things too.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.950
For example, an apology
that's written down

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:07.210
has no effect on the brain.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.180
Like in order for you to
reach closure and forgiveness

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:13.420
after a slight has
occurred, there's

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.310
a biological and
neurological process

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.050
that has to process
that has to happen,

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.610
and the first step of that is
the compassion center, right.

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.930
That the person has to
have compassion for you

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.390
before they can begin
all that other stuff.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:30.850
So if you text someone, or
even email them, I'm sorry,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.320
nothing happens.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.880
It absolutely never touches
the compassion center,

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.420
which means that entire process
of forgiveness and letting

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.910
go never even begins.

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.980
The thing of it is,
the reason why we email

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.340
and text instead of calling is
because it's hard to apologize.

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:48.176
It's difficult. And we'd
rather avoid it if we could.

00:44:48.176 --> 00:44:49.550
But the fact of
the matter is, is

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:53.440
it's the struggle that actually
makes the apology worth it.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.830
So the other person either hears
us struggling to apologize,

00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:00.520
or they see us struggling,
and suddenly bing,

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:02.896
the compassion center lights up.

00:45:02.896 --> 00:45:04.270
And that begins
that whole thing.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:07.750
So it's basically useless
to apologize over email.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.276
It's a complete waste of time.

00:45:10.276 --> 00:45:11.650
The other person
may smile at you

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.010
and pretend like they let
it go, but the chances are,

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:15.760
it's going to stay
there forever and ever.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.230
You'll never reach closure.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.860
So that's, when you talk
about young people, that's

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.916
not some kind of flaw in a
young person's character.

00:45:23.916 --> 00:45:26.290
It's just that they're living
in a world in which they've

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:29.230
been able to avoid
difficult conversations,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.450
or outsource all of the
pain of these interactions.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.110
And that has effects.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:40.210
And one of the effects is that
they're not as empathetic.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.730
They're less likely to be
empathetic than their parents

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.480
and grandparents.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:47.880
Now, smartphone use at
this point is widespread.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.700
In fact according to the UN,
more people at this point

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.090
have access to a cell
phone than working toilet.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.190
So that's not just a
millennial problem.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:02.012
That's just a modern human
being problem at this point.

00:46:02.012 --> 00:46:03.720
SPEAKER 1: You talked
about the breakdown

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:07.360
of communication between groups
with different viewpoints.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.550
What do you think
we can do to improve

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.520
those lines of communication?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.103
CELESTE HEADLEE:
Well, we have to stop

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:16.170
thinking that there are some
people that you can't talk to.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:17.980
That's not a thing.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.590
And there is no such
thing as somebody

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.840
you have zero in
common with, also.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.690
If you think that, you're wrong.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.350
That The problem is, is
that we have to move out

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.620
of our ideological bubbles.

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.350
And I think that
phrase has been used

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:33.690
so much that it's kind of
been vacated of meaning,

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.740
but it's absolutely true.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.990
Pew has done some of the best
research on this of anyone.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.510
And we are all living
in ideological bubbles.

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:47.340
White people, especially, tend
to only have white friends.

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.106
And if they do
interact with somebody

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:50.730
who is a person of
color at work that's

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.470
not the person that they go
home and interact with at home.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:55.847
Does that mean that
people of color

00:46:55.847 --> 00:46:58.180
are going to have different
political opinions with you?

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.360
No, but they probably have
a different experience

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.410
than you do.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.750
And the research on
diversity, in terms

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:07.050
of how much it helps us
grow, is just definitive.

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.450
But there's also this
incredible research on how much

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:11.700
it helps us actually
problem solve at work.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.796
So it's really fascinating.

00:47:13.796 --> 00:47:15.420
I get very geeked
out by these numbers.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:17.910
But, OK, so when
you study people's

00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.560
problem-solving problems.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.690
Just the chance that you're
going to bring somebody

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:24.840
in the group that has,
possibly, a different opinion,

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:26.980
makes everybody work better.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.420
The chance that there might
be pushback and argument

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.090
makes the quality of
everybody's work go up,

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.104
just that opportunity.

00:47:34.104 --> 00:47:36.270
So when you're only surrounding
yourself with people

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.910
that you think are
going to agree with you,

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.490
you know, you're not growing.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.399
You're not evolving.

00:47:43.399 --> 00:47:44.940
SPEAKER 1: That kind
of ties into how

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.080
we're cognitive misers.

00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.330
And we like to be in
comfortable situations.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:52.420
So, how do we actively
tell ourselves like--

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.160
well, how you remind yourself
about these 10 conversations

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:55.660
tips.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.060
Do you have any
cues that you use?

00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:57.690
CELESTE HEADLEE:
Well, it's easy for me

00:47:57.690 --> 00:47:59.400
because that's what
I do all day, right.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.680
And not only that, but I
have reminders constantly

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.860
that I'm not the smart--

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.490
I have zero illusions
that I'm the smartest

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:06.330
person in the world.

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.280
Like, that's one of the best
things about a TED conference,

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:08.780
right.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.530
Like, there is no
competition on my part

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.446
to be the smartest person
at a TED conference.

00:48:12.446 --> 00:48:14.220
Like, the pressure is off.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.340
But if I'm also, like if
I'm interviewing some CDC

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:22.650
person who's out risking her
life in Africa to fight Ebola,

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:27.960
my problems with my Galaxy phone
pretty much pale in comparison.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.350
Like, it is very easy for
me to keep myself in context

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:33.430
and stay humble.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:35.820
You know, if I'm talking
to Salman Rushdie,

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.470
I'm not the smartest person
in the studio at that point.

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:41.140
So it's very easy for me to do.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:43.560
But I think that for all of
us, the most important thing

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.800
is just to force yourself
to start the conversation.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.760
That's it.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:50.290
Don't try to keep the rest
of it in your mind at all.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:54.990
Just A, ask more questions, and
B, just have the conversation.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:56.340
Force yourself to do it.

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.410
Your Uber driver's there.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:01.140
My Uber driver had "I
Voted" stickers all over.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.020
And I was like, looks like
you don't miss an election.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:05.910
And he went into
this long description

00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.280
of how he got to America,
and the day that he

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.830
got his citizenship,
and, you know,

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.330
how frustrated he
gets and ba ba ba.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:12.496
I didn't have to say a word.

00:49:12.496 --> 00:49:14.130
Like, again, pressure was off.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.380
I didn't have to say anything.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.440
I landed on something that
he was incredibly proud of,

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.644
and I just sat back and
listened to his stories.

00:49:21.644 --> 00:49:24.060
And I would encourage everybody
just to do the same thing.

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.900
You know, people are
amazing, even the--

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.010
can I swear?

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:31.840
Even the shitty
ones are amazing.

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:32.340
They are.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.080
I mean, I'm a mixed-race person.

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.360
I've had plenty of
conversations with Sons

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.150
of Confederate Veterans
and former KKK members.

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:40.950
I've had conversations
with people

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:43.140
who I would find
detestable in regular life.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.960
That's my job, is I'm the one
that has to go and have those

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.030
respectful conversations
with those people.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.950
And you know what,
I'm better for it.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.050
I am so much better for it.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.030
And they were good
conversations.

00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.110
I learned stuff
from those people.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.400
So I would just say, just
have the conversation.

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.550
You're not-- they don't
get money or any benefit

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:03.860
from you listening to them.

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:07.050
You're not helping
them by listening.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.700
You're just having a human
interaction with them.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.290
And you know there's this great,
this guy named Darrell Davis.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.750
There's a PBS
documentary about him.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:19.800
He's a jazz musician by night,
but his hobby during the day

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.910
is talking KKK members
into leaving the group.

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.940
And he's so successful,
he's a black guy by the way,

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.980
he's so successful at it that
he almost individually, alone,

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:35.850
disabled the KKK operation
in the state of Maryland

00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:37.200
by himself.

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.700
And the way that
he does that is he

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.250
doesn't try to convince
them not to be racists.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.100
He says, I just listen
to them, and sometimes

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.610
people just want to be heard.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.840
And I think just being
heard, giving someone

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.140
the gift of being heard
is one of the simplest,

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.620
least expensive, best
things you can possibly do,

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.810
even if they're shitty.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:01.680
SPEAKER 1: You talked
about the person

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:03.596
who had the stickers in
the back of their car.

00:51:03.596 --> 00:51:05.347
Are those kind of like
conversation hooks?

00:51:05.347 --> 00:51:07.762
CELESTE HEADLEE: Everything
is a conversation hook, right.

00:51:07.762 --> 00:51:10.220
Like someone's going to wear
a particular hat, or I mean,

00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.719
you can find something
that somebody

00:51:11.719 --> 00:51:13.010
has that they care about.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.677
You know, like your Fitbit.

00:51:14.677 --> 00:51:16.010
I can ask you about your Fitbit.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.010
You're going to explain.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:17.690
And you did.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.616
Actually, when Ashley
asked you about it,

00:51:19.616 --> 00:51:21.490
you said well, I dee
dee dee duh dee dee duh,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:22.730
and you started
talking about it.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:25.313
You ask questions they know the
answer to about something they

00:51:25.313 --> 00:51:26.470
care about.

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:28.040
It's really simple.

00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:29.684
They're always,
there's always going

00:51:29.684 --> 00:51:31.100
to be something
about that person.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.380
And if it's not,
sometimes it's something

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:34.840
that really annoys them.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.590
Like, I asked somebody
about their haircut

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.780
and she goes, oh my god, I
had to get it chopped off

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.280
because she ruined
my hair, ba ba ba

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.110
but she was still
talking, you know.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.630
I could still just sit
back and listen to her

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:46.880
rather than put in a huge
amount of effort on my part.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.629
SPEAKER 1: Right, and
gave her validation,

00:51:48.629 --> 00:51:49.831
like she's being heard.

00:51:49.831 --> 00:51:51.830
CELESTE HEADLEE: And
remember the Harvard study.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.750
Don't forget the
2014 Harvard study.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.180
Talking about yourself
gives you the same pleasure

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.980
as sex and cocaine.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.230
OK, so if you're giving
someone the opportunity

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:01.700
to talk about
themselves, they're

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.980
going to feel great, right?

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.650
You have, with
very little effort,

00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:07.976
made them feel fantastic.

00:52:07.976 --> 00:52:10.542
It totally works with your boss.

00:52:10.542 --> 00:52:12.500
SPEAKER 1: So regarding
that feeling of failure

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.990
about not talking to somebody.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.170
How do you-- how can
people overcome that?

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:17.170
Are there simple tricks?

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.200
CELESTE HEADLEE:
The fear of failure?

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:18.920
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
Yeah, like people

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.180
don't want to reach
out and say something

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:22.451
because they want to say the
best thing to this person

00:52:22.451 --> 00:52:24.450
and they don't know how
to start a conversation.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.420
How do you overcome
that fear of failure?

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.800
CELESTE HEADLEE: I don't
actually know that.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.216
I would just say that the best
thing to do is just try it.

00:52:30.216 --> 00:52:32.000
And if it doesn't
go well, walk away.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.800
Say excuse me, and walk off.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.420
I mean, I've done
it a million times.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.049
I don't find an excuse.

00:52:37.049 --> 00:52:38.840
One of the biggest
problems is that we try,

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.381
sometimes we try to explain why
we're leaving a conversation.

00:52:41.381 --> 00:52:45.080
We're like I have to go
and well, clean out my car.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.170
I dropped whatever, you
know, you just say, excuse me

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:49.692
for a moment, and you walk off.

00:52:49.692 --> 00:52:50.400
It's very simple.

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.700
If it's not going
well, walk away

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.300
and try it with someone else.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.050
You know, if you say
something stupid,

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:58.190
and I say stupid
things all the time,

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:01.820
just say, excuse me for a
moment, and you walk off.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.100
And then you can moan about how
dumb that thing was in private

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.895
and start with somebody else.

00:53:07.895 --> 00:53:09.075
SPEAKER 1: That's excellent.

00:53:09.075 --> 00:53:11.101
Do we have any
audience questions?

00:53:16.873 --> 00:53:19.650
We'll get you a mic in a second.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.400
Thank you Allison.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.665
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:53:25.665 --> 00:53:28.550
I love the TED talk and
this was great, too.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.247
I'm already breaking
be brief, because I

00:53:30.247 --> 00:53:32.580
haven't asked my question
yet, but I'm going to ask you.

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:34.860
So much great stuff,
you mentioned the lack

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.470
of empathy being a
problem with, you know,

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:41.250
proliferation of cell phones,
technology, and all that.

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:42.637
I agree 100%.

00:53:42.637 --> 00:53:44.970
I'm wondering if you have any
thoughts besides modeling,

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:47.880
maybe, of how we can get
especially the younger

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.250
generation to maybe put down
the phone once in a while

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:51.327
and have a conversation.

00:53:51.327 --> 00:53:53.160
CELESTE HEADLEE: So
other than forcing them,

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.110
which I can only
do with my own kid,

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.869
I don't actually know
the answer to that.

00:53:57.869 --> 00:53:59.160
And it's a really big question.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.472
Like I know that in
my house, not even

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.930
adults are allowed to bring
their cell phones to the table.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:05.850
That's just the rule.

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:07.849
And if you want to keep
cell phone, that's fine,

00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:10.770
but you're not eating,
in my place anyway.

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:12.870
So, you just kind of
have to set limitations

00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:15.840
for yourself, and not in a jerky
asshole way, but just like,

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.430
this is how I do it.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.449
So, you know, that's
the way that goes.

00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:21.240
You know, it's funny,
and people are trying

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.490
all kinds of different things.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.959
Chick-Fil-A, the
chicken place, they now

00:54:25.959 --> 00:54:27.750
have this thing in a
lot of the restaurants

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.310
where there is bucket in
the middle of the table,

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.750
and if you throw your
cell phones in there

00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:33.041
and don't touch them, they'll
give you a free ice cream

00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:34.050
at the end of your meal.

00:54:34.050 --> 00:54:36.510
And the ice creams
are only $1.25,

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:38.740
but if you multiply that
by the number of people

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:41.430
that eat in Chick-Fil-A,
that's a pretty huge investment

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.440
in trying to encourage
people to talk.

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:45.372
I have no idea if it's
going to work or not.

00:54:45.372 --> 00:54:46.830
But I think that
this is the moment

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:48.900
right now when we have
to start thinking about,

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.780
how do we do this?

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.810
So, you know, cell phone
addiction is, it's a thing.

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.320
Like it's a real problem.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.640
It's as bad, if not worse, than
gambling or food addiction.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.430
And, especially
if you're in tech,

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.520
and you're a
responsible tech person,

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:06.670
this is something that
should be on your mind.

00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:11.367
How do we make it so that tech
does not ruin our humanity?

00:55:11.367 --> 00:55:13.200
I mean that's kind of
where we are right now

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.866
and mine is not the best mind to
kind of think of that solution.

00:55:15.866 --> 00:55:16.950
But maybe yours is.

00:55:24.786 --> 00:55:26.410
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a lot about how

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.110
crummy email and text are.

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:31.840
At Google, we are in multiple
countries, multiple offices,

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.300
work with people
all over the world.

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:37.360
Are there tips and
tricks for conversations

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.080
that are, perhaps not email,
but phone or video conference?

00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.510
And are those better modes of--

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:45.926
CELESTE HEADLEE: Yes, video
conferences are totally legit.

00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:48.140
Phone conversation
is totally legit.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.140
And now, one of the things
that email does well,

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:52.306
remember I said that it
only does a few things well.

00:55:52.306 --> 00:55:54.490
One of them is that time
lapse, handling time lapse.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:57.120
It also, you know, it's one
of the best ways to, you know,

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.200
send an attachment.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.107
It's also the best way to recap
a meeting or a phone call.

00:56:02.107 --> 00:56:03.565
So for example, if
I have something

00:56:03.565 --> 00:56:05.560
where I need a
nuance, or we need

00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:08.680
to sort of hash something out,
I will always do that by phone.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:10.282
And I make people
do it by phone.

00:56:10.282 --> 00:56:11.740
Like, they'll try
to do it in email

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.360
and I'll say, I don't think
this is the kind of thing we're

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.830
going to be able to
handle over email,

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.060
give me a time when
you have five or 10

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.230
minutes on the phone, right.

00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:18.813
And then I will call
him on the phone.

00:56:18.813 --> 00:56:21.160
And then when the phone
conversation is done,

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.610
then I send an email
saying, here's what I heard.

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:26.020
This is what we talked about.

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.820
Is this what you heard also?

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.300
That's where you can use email
really, really productively.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:33.400
But to have any
kind of discussion

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.380
over email, every
bit of research

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.020
that we have shows the
email makes it worse.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.780
It's It's a productivity killer.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.929
It's an innovation killer.

00:56:42.929 --> 00:56:44.470
It's much better to
have it by phone.

00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:46.780
Now, a video
conference, absolutely.

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.670
Your phone call, absolutely.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:50.315
Absolutely.

00:56:50.315 --> 00:56:51.940
Remember, you know,
there's three parts

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:55.060
to successful
communication, right.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.790
There's the words that you use,
the vocabulary, what they mean.

00:56:57.790 --> 00:56:59.180
Then there's your body language.

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.710
And then there's
your tone of voice.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:03.920
So there's a reason why we
make jokes about sarcasm font,

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.420
right.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:07.777
It's because me, if I
say (tentative) maybe

00:57:07.777 --> 00:57:10.360
that's really different me going
(cheerful affirmative) maybe,

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.859
right.

00:57:10.859 --> 00:57:13.000
One of them means no.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.480
And that is not translated
through your printed word.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.270
This is why we have
Damn You Auto Correct!

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.580
This is why we have all those
things making fun of how

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:25.150
bad texting communication is.

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:27.520
When you are just
emailing or texting,

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.250
you're removing
2/3 of the meaning

00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:31.780
from what it is
that you're saying.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.660
So it's not at all surprising
that miscommunications

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:35.650
happen all the time.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:45.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:45.310 --> 00:57:46.560
Thanks so much for coming.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:48.160
Super geeking out
about everything

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.451
that you are geeking out about.

00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:50.891
It's fantastic.

00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:53.140
Are you familiar with, I'm
sorry I forget the speaker,

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.750
but it's another TED talk called
"The Power of Vulnerability."

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.990
CELESTE HEADLEE: Yes.

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.820
AUDIENCE: Does that
sound familiar?

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.340
So I'm curious
about how that fits

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.340
into what you're talking
about, because it seems

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.290
to be a thing that opens
up good conversation,

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:06.285
but is more about talking
instead of listening.

00:58:06.285 --> 00:58:07.160
CELESTE HEADLEE: Yes.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.160
OK, so I think
that is a great TED

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.120
talk, and wonderful,
wonderful area of research.

00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.480
It's a little different
than what I talk about.

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.430
Related, but a little different.

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.230
In my world, you
show vulnerability

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:25.730
by giving up control,
by allowing someone else

00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:28.070
to share the platform with you.

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:31.010
In a conversation,
there's a thing

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:33.500
called conversational
narcissism, which

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.790
is what most of us
practice, including myself.

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:38.330
I do not except myself
from that at all.

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:41.892
But we're basically maintaining
control of a conversation,

00:58:41.892 --> 00:58:43.850
and it allows us to keep
the focus on ourselves

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.740
and what we like to talk about.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.540
Now if you're going to
truly be vulnerable,

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.290
that's when you hand over some
of that control to someone

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:52.580
else.

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.110
The vulnerability
is really essential.

00:58:55.110 --> 00:58:57.740
But in this particular case,
it's not self-disclosure.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:01.190
Self-disclosure, you're
already primed to do.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.170
Self-disclosure is
just the scientific way

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:04.610
of saying talking
about yourself.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:08.700
And, as I mentioned,
it feels great.

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.310
So I'm never really
all that worried

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:14.220
about people and
self-disclosure.

00:59:14.220 --> 00:59:17.580
I'm worried about them allowing
other people to self-disclose.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.620
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank you
so much for joining us.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.202
We really enjoyed this talk,
and I look forward to hearing

00:59:28.202 --> 00:59:30.160
more about what you're
doing with your research

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:30.650
and everything.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:31.570
So thank you for joining us.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:32.490
CELESTE HEADLEE: Thank
you, my pleasure.

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:33.390
Thank you.

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:36.740
