Do you know the anatomy of an internet troll?
It's a little uglier than you might think.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.930
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews. It's
admittedly my favorite scientific field of

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.160
all: internet trollology. I grew up on AND
work on the internet in many capacities, so

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.130
trolls have always been a point of fascination
for me. Who are these a-holes who seem to

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.429
take pleasure in saying and doing hurtful
things to others on the web -- these "trolls"

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.610
who derail interesting discussion in favor
of an epic (but meaningless) flame war?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.130
A new study published in the Journal of Personality
and Individual Differences finds there's more....or

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.720
maybe just as much...to trolls as meets the
eye. They found that the people who engage

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.330
in this behavior online have some striking
personality traits in common. Particularly,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.960
traits that are found in the "Dark Tetrad":
Machiavellian tendencies, psychopathy, sadism,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.340
and narcissism. Those who fall in the Dark
Tetrad may appear charming at first, but they

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.180
are ultimately self concerned, callous, and
lack empathy for others. The cherry on the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.430
sundae is the sadism -- sadistic personality
types truly enjoy seeing others in distress.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.450
The Dark Tetrad is the perfect villain.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.060
Compared to the general population, study
participants who reported that they enjoy

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.240
trolling have much higher rates of these Dark
Tetrad traits - most notably is their unusually

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.390
high rates of sadism. The study was conducted
by evaluating the personality traits of participants

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.190
against what they use the internet for. Those
who engage in purposefully inflammatory behavior

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.270
make up a very small percentage of internet
users on the whole, though -- only 5%. Compare

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.870
that to the 41% of users who don't comment
at all, period.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.770
What does this mean? Well, first off: the
sadistic group is the smallest, but the loudest.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.740
The researchers believe that the anonymity
and social acceptance of "trolling" creates

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.170
a safe space for real life sadists to indulge
themselves. Offline, there are more consequences.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.600
It also means that there's more to a troll
than simple mischief. Internet trolling could

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.790
be an indicator of disturbing behavior offline.
And...it also calls to question the effectiveness

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.889
of "not feeding the trolls". Sadists find
their behavior intrinsically motivating, so

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.749
even if they never get a response -- simply
acting on the nasty impulse is pleasurable

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:14.540
in and of itself.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.159
What I've noticed in the past 5, 10 years
is that there is a change slowly coming over

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.859
the internet. As the web becomes more intertwined
with our REAL lives and identities -- and

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.060
less of the anarchistic playground it used
to be in the olden golden days, it will be

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.639
harder for people to indulge in everyday sadism
on the web. YouTube itself has contributed

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:36.379
to the movement toward internet civility by
forcing many users to have their comments

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.489
connected with their name. You know, with
that G+ revamp we were all so fond of...

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.099
So guys, what do you make of internet trolls?
Share your thoughts down below, and we'll

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.099
