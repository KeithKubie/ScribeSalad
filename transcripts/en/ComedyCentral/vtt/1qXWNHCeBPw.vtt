00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.534
(upbeat music)

00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:02.569
- Happy Saturday bi-otches.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.441
- Oh I cannot believe
we're already rallying.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.944 align:start size:84% position:16%
We were out til
like 5AM yesterday.

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:12.178
- [Woman] Last call.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.582
- Oh last call, you
know what that means.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.550
- You're gonna drunk text Brian.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.385
- Yep.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.855
Oh my god.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.756
- [Woman] What?

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:23.590
- I texted him.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.724
I texted Brian.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:25.959
- When?

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.028
- Earlier today
when I was sober.

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:28.895
(gasps)

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.163
I sober texted him.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.632
This is really embarrassing.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.434
- What did you say?

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.236
- It's pretty articulate.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.837
Should I text him again and say

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.305
that's not who I am at all?

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.607
- Okay no.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.710
I think you should send
him a super drunk selfie

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.445
and a wink face.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.147
It'll balance everything out

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.883
and maybe he'll forget
about that other text.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:50.750
- That's so smart.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.154
- That's good.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:54.988
Yes.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.456
- Okay.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.257
Sent.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.160
Cool.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.894
That's done.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.064
- So Jessie, how have you been

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.966
since finding out
you were adopted?

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.001
- Not good.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:09.669
- Oh my god, Brian texted.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.204
- [Both] Oh.

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:13.773
- Thank god, it's a drunk
booty call text. (laughs)

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:15.208
We're okay.

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.744 align:start size:94% position:6%
He said to ditch my
underpamts and come over.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.613 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I can only assume he
meant underpants (laughs).

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.582
- Okay ladies I'm out.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.819
- Oh hey, wait, you said you
were gonna get this round.

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.020
- What?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.223
I can't, I'm sorry
it's so loud in here.

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:31.324
I can't hear ...

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:36.596
- She left us just like
your parents left you.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:41.234
(toilet flushes)

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.675
- Okay let's take
off our clothes.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:50.110
- Wait.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.512
Can we just talk about
that text you sent me?

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:55.381
- Wait, wait, no, Brian,

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.749
just forget about the text.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.053
I was just rested and awake

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.654
and it just kind of came out.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.523
- I know, I mean I get that

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.458 align:start size:81% position:19%
but some of the
stuff you said ...

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.061
I'm never gonna forget it.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.062
It was wild.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.797
I mean look at this.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.899
I respect you.

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:14.834
Why would you say that to me?

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.603
I would like to get
to know you better

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.605
in a new context

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:23.343 align:start size:94% position:6%
if that's something you'd
be comfortable with.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.979 align:start size:88% position:13%
That is the longest
sentence I've ever read.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:30.116
- Listen, I promise that was
just my crazy sober brain.

00:02:30.116 --> 00:02:33.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was just reacting to
the existential loneliness

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:35.288
that kicks in when you're not

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:38.358
totally numbing all of your
feelings with substance.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.927
So it didn't mean anything.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.495
- It doesn't mean anything.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.863
- It doesn't mean anything.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.365
- I don't know.

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.236
I just see you now as this
three dimensional person

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:54.107 align:start size:88% position:13%
with thoughts, feelings,
and parents ...

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
Oh my god you
probably have parents.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.011
- Brian, no, stop, stop.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.113
Don't ruin what we have.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:05.018
Look, I see you as
just a reliably safe

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:09.489
and reasonably enjoyable penis.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.424
You're basically a
piece of meat to me.

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:14.861
- I'm just a piece of meat?

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.095
Do you really mean that?

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:16.930
- Yeah.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.902
So I want you to hear me
and believe me when I say

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:29.008
I don't like you enough to
ever ever actually date you.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:31.311
(soft piano music)

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:32.145
- Aw.

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:35.248
Same.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:39.319 align:start size:84% position:16%
Yeah let's just go
have some mediocre sex

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.221
and then I'll fall
asleep immediately.

00:03:42.088 --> 00:03:43.623
- I would really like that.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.494
- Oh wait,

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.763
you really do like my
paintings though right?
