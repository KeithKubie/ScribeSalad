00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.861
 For thousands of years, man has been practicing meditation, for the health of the soul, the soul and the body 

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.871
 But from a scientific perspective, how does meditation affect your body exactly? 

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:11.761
 Is it really effective? 

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.310
 It all starts inside the brain! During meditation, brain tests show high activity areas 

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:25.371
 The virtual system network in particular, is activated when the brain is in rest 

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:29.531
 And is not focused on the outside world, and has been found to improve memory and self-awareness 

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:33.671
 And setting goals, do you want to be more considerate to your friends and family? When compare the worlds 

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:37.961
 The brains of Buddhists with the brains of new meditators, they found that the area associated with 

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:42.281
 Patience is more intense among Buddhists, literally changed 

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:47.520
 Your brain waves, we can also measure these frequencies. Pupils have high levels of alpha waves 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.031
 Which showed a decrease in the feeling of negative mood, tension, sadness and anger 

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:56.351
 And if that is not enough, meditation automatically changes the size and state of our brain 

00:00:56.351 --> 00:01:01.250
 Studies have shown that after 8 weeks of a meditation program, the gray matter becomes more dense in related areas 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.091
 Learning, and memory analysis, but the amygdala, which deals 

00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:08.971
 With stress, blood pressure and fear, it has a low gray matter! 

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:13.251
 When we look at our whole body, we not only notice low blood pressure, but 

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:17.421
 It can also increase heart rate change, while this may appear to be harmful, 

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:21.591
 It actually plays a critical role in transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout 

00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:26.021
 Body, do you think you'll get sick? In a study, given to meditators and non-meditators 

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.991
 Influenza virus, and meditators were able to produce significant numbers of antibodies 

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:32.131
 Thus raising the immune function 

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.201
 If we dive a little deeper, we can see changes at the cell level 

00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:41.150
 Chromosomes contain a protective protein called telomer, which helps to reduce DNA damage and reduce 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.040
 The number of dead cells has been linked to the telomere length by several epidemics 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.311
 Cardiovascular depression, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer, and, surprisingly, survivors of cancer 

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:55.061
 When they complete a meditation program, their bodies show a remarkable rise in telomere length 

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:59.631
 Psychological intervention, especially stress reduction, is believed to have an effect 

00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:03.951
 Directly on the telomerase enzyme, which showed a counteract of default by adding 

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.690
 DNA to shrinked telomer 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.341
 And, of course, meditation is not to substitute for other medical advice or a healthy lifestyle 

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:14.211
 We do not want you to come out of here believing that he will treat cancer, but like to go out 

00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:18.220
 A health club can strengthen your muscles and enhance your whole health, it seems to be meditation 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.190
