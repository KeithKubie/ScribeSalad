00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.270
x is greater than or equal to -1.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.610
So let's solve this the way
we would with an equation.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.653
Distributing the -4 to the 3x and
the -1, we get 3- 12x + 4,

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:18.574
remember, negative times a negative is
positive, is less then or equal to 19.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:26.178
We'll simplify a bit and we get -12x + 7
because 3 and 4 is 7, is less than 19.

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:30.310
We'll subtract the 7 from both sides,
and

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.790
we get -12x is less than or
equal to, 19- 7 is 12.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.210
Let's divide both sides by -12.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.227
So we have x on one side and
we divide by a negative number,

00:00:43.227 --> 00:00:47.244
so we should flip the sign,
x is greater than or equal to,

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:51.044
12 divided by -12 is -1,
and there we have it.

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:53.410
12 is greater than or equal to -1.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.620
And this is what our solution
set looks like on a number line.
