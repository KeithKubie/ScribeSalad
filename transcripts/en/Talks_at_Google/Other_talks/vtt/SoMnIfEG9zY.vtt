00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:03.490
ANDREW BACEVICH: The
aim of the book is

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.450
really quite simple.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.630
It invites Americans to consider
the possibility that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710
we have, as a nation, fallen
prey to a set of attitudes

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.230
toward war, soldiers, and
military institutions that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.770
constitute a variant
of militarism.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.680
The book explains the origins
of this new American

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.720
militarism, new in the sense
that these attitudes emerged

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.560
relatively recently in the
decades following Vietnam.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.170
And it suggests that this
emphasis on force is at odds

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.830
both with our interests and with
our founding traditions.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.370
And it offers some ideas for
how to restore a sense of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.410
balance and realism to
US military policy.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.570
This the second time today
I gave this talk.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.970
I gave it this morning at the
Carnegie Council, where the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.120
average age was at least 70,
and everybody wore a tie.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.880
And I notice that I'm the only
person here who wears a tie.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.870
And, I dare say, I'm the oldest
person in the room.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.700
And the other thing I
was struck by as I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.630
was waiting to start.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.640
You're all sitting there
looking at some kind of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.100
electronic sort of gizmo.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.270
And I realized to myself, even
you are using your smartphone

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.530
to do the introduction,
and here I am reading

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.790
my text off of paper.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.640
And how that just must mark me
as such a Neanderthal from a

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.620
different universe,
so bear with me.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.390
But let me make a point, early
on, emphasizing some of the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.292
things that my book is not.

00:01:39.292 --> 00:01:42.620
It's not an expression
of anti-Americanism.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.330
It's not an attack
on soldiers.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.130
I hold the American soldier
in very high regard.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.320
As Will suggested, I was once
myself an American soldier.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.400
And the book certainly is
not a pacifist tract.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.620
Humankind, I believe, is
condemned to live in a world

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.070
in which political competition
will never end, and in which

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.280
force will always have
a place, whether

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.300
we like it or not.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.580
And indeed, to some degree, our
hopes of achieving even a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.710
modicum of stability and justice
probably will require

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.490
us to employ force from
time to time.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.580
But my key point of the book is
this, that somewhere, right

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.570
around the end of the Cold War,
Americans generally said

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.210
yes to military power.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.830
If you want to pick a very
specific moment when this

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.160
occurred, that moment might be
early in 1991, when Operation

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.340
Desert Storm ended, in what
appeared at the time to be a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.790
historic victory.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.150
Right then, in 1991, the
skepticism about arms and

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.020
armies that had informed the
American experiment from its

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.310
founding pretty much vanished.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.570
Political leaders, liberals and
conservatives alike became

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.500
enamored with military might.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.880
And American military leaders,
who ought to have known

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.610
better, became complicit in
marketing alluring visions of

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.310
future warfare that had no
basis in history and that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.670
events soon revealed
as fraudulent.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.280
The ensuing affair has been
a passion pursued in utter

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.420
disregard of the consequences
that have ensued.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.770
Few of those wielding authority
in Washington or

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.330
influencing opinion in the
mainstream media have

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.420
critically evaluated the
implications of valuing

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.890
military power for
its own sake.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.700
Fewer still have considered
the possibility that

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.320
cultivating permanent global
military superiority might be

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.800
at odds both with American
principles and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.480
with American interests.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.220
Now how does this new American
militarism, defined as

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.970
outsized expectations regarding
the efficacy of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.100
force, a tendency to see
military power as the truest

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.510
measure of national greatness,
and a romanticized view of

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.600
soldiers, how does
this new American

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.690
militarism manifest itself?

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.410
Well, it does so, first of all,
in the scope, cost, and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.810
configuration of America's
present day military

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.050
establishment.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.190
Recall that through the first
two decades of US history,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.340
political leaders in Washington
gauged the size and

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.000
capabilities of America's armed
forces according to the

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.100
security tasks immediately
at hand.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.510
A grave and proximate threat
to the nation's well-being

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.520
might require a large and
powerful military

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.290
establishment.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.410
But, in the absence of such a
threat, policymakers scaled

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.500
down that establishment
accordingly.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.450
With the passing of crisis, in
other words, the army raised

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.560
up for the crisis immediately
went away.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.215
This had been the
case in 1865.

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:09.590
It was the case in 1918.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.060
It was the case again in 1945.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.740
The general principle was to
maintain the minimum force

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.260
required and no more.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.540
Since the end of the Cold War,
however, having come to value

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.060
military power for its own sake,
the United States has

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.490
abandoned this principle and is
committed, as a matter of

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.350
policy, to maintaining military
capabilities far in

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.600
excess of those of any would
be adversary or even

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.540
combination of adversaries.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.150
This commitment finds both
qualitative and quantitative

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.150
expression with the US Armed
Forces dwarfing those of even

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.210
America's closest ally.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.860
Thus, whereas the United States
Navy maintains and

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.360
operates about a dozen large
attack aircraft carriers, the

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.060
ones flaunted Royal
Navy has none.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.520
Indeed, there is, in all the
battle fleets of the world, no

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.120
ship even remotely comparable
to a Nimitz class carrier.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.650
Today, the United States Marine
Corps possesses more

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.220
attack aircraft then does the
entire Royal Air Force.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.800
And the United States has two
other even larger air forces,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.120
one an integral part of the
Navy, and the other officially

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.990
designated as the United
States Air Force.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.360
Indeed, in terms of numbers of
men and women in uniform, the

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.890
United States Marine Corps is
half again as large as the

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.290
entire British army.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.250
And the Pentagon has a second
even larger army, actually

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.010
called the United States Army,
which, by the way, operates

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.550
its own air force of several
thousand aircraft.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.230
All of these massive
and redundant

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.570
capabilities cost money.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.940
Prior to 9/11, American military
spending exceeded, by

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.000
a factor of 25 the combined
military budgets of the seven

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.510
rogue states then comprising
the roster of US enemies.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.100
Indeed, by some calculations,
the United States was then

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.760
spending more on its armed
forces than every other nation

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.950
in the world combined.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.725
This was a circumstance without
historical precedent.

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:24.110
The effect of 9/11 was to
increase Pentagon spending by

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.880
leaps and bounds.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.100
In 2001, the base defense budget
totalled $287 billion.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.840
The budget request released by
the Pentagon last week, styled

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:43.270
as an austerity measure, comes
in at a tidy $527 billion, not

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.740
quite double what
it was in 2001.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.060
And oh, did I not mention that
the base budget excludes the

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.715
cost of actually waging
ongoing wars.

00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:58.420
That was $159 billion
last year.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.540
And it also excludes
veterans benefits.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.370
That was $127 billion
last year.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.700
Add those to the tab and annual
US military outlays at

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:14.056
present reach somewhere
around $750 billion.

00:08:14.056 --> 00:08:18.570
In constant dollars, the
Pentagon today, spending is

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:21.600
considerably higher than
it was at any time

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.940
during the Cold War.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.390
That is to say, back when we
worried about having to fight

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.040
the communist hordes.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.840
More astonishingly still, after
the war in Afghanistan

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.159
ends, if it ends at the end of
2014, projected Pentagon

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:42.860
spending will still remain at
levels higher than reached at

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.660
any time during the Cold War.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.340
On a day-to-day basis, what are
these forces exist to do?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.890
Well, simply put, for the
Department of Defense,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.970
defense, per se, figures
as little more than an

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.710
afterthought.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.060
The primary mission of America's
far flung military

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.990
establishment is global power
projection, a reality tacitly

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.130
understood in all corners
of American society.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.800
That well over a decade after
the collapse of the Soviet

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.950
Union, the United States
continues to maintain bases

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.590
and military forces in several
dozen countries--

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.510
by some counts well over
100 countries--

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.180
rouses minimal controversy
despite the fact that many of

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.260
these countries are perfectly
capable of providing for their

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.730
own security needs.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:36.590
That even apart from fighting
wars and pursuing terrorists,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.100
US forces--

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.460
these days augmented by
CIA paramilitaries and

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.136
profit-minded private security
contractors--

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.310
are constantly prowling around
the globe, training,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.620
exercising, planning, posturing,
and liquidating

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.460
whoever the White House
decides needs to be

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.700
liquidated, this elicits no more
notice from the average

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:05.510
American then the presence of a
cop on a city street corner.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.930
Even before the Pentagon
officially assigned itself the

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.190
mission of quote unquote
"shaping" the international

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.590
environment, members of the
political elite-- and again I

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.630
would emphasize liberals and
conservatives alike--

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.320
had reached a common
understanding that scattering

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:26.120
US forces around the globe to
restrain, inspire, influence,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.350
persuade, or cajole
paid dividends.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.790
The indisputable fact of global
US military preeminence

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.670
also affects the collective
mindset of the officer corps.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.580
For the armed services,
dominance constitutes a

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.460
baseline or a point of departure
from which to scale

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.100
the heights of ever greater
capabilities.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.680
Indeed, the services have come
to view outright supremacy as

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.940
merely adequate and any
hesitation in efforts to

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.640
increase the margin of supremacy
as evidence of

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.800
falling behind.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.420
The new American militarism also
manifests itself through

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.030
an increased propensity to use
force, leading in effect to

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.930
the normalization of war.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.830
As a consequence, self-restraint
regarding the

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.660
use of force has all
but disappeared.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.160
Whereas, during the entire Cold
War era, several decades,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.560
large-scale US military actions
abroad totalled a

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.540
scant six in number.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.940
Since the fall of the Berlin
Wall, they have become almost

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.870
annual events.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.620
The brief period extending
from 1989's

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.280
Operation Just Cause--

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.675
that was the overthrow of
Panama's Manuel Noriega--

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.980
to the invasion of Iraq in
2003, featured nine major

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.820
military interventions.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.350
And that count of nine does not
include innumerable lesser

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.390
actions, such as Bill Clinton's
signature cruise

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.010
missile attacks against obscure
targets in obscure

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:09.680
places, the almost daily bombing
of Iraq throughout the

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.440
late 1990s, or the quasi-combat
missions that

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.300
have seen GIs dispatched, in
recent years, to Rwanda,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.870
Columbia, East Timor, the
Philippines, Pakistan, Libya,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.750
and, most recently, in
various countries

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.430
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.210
As crisis has become a seemingly
permanent condition,

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.090
so too did war.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.990
The George W. Bush
administration tacitly

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.550
acknowledged as much in
describing the global campaign

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.820
against terror as a conflict
likely to last decades and

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.270
then promulgating a doctrine
of preventive war.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.850
The Obama administration has
abandoned the phrase "global

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.070
war on terrorism." But it has
sustained the expectation of

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.570
open-ended conflict.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.440
The Iraq war has ended.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.020
The Afghanistan war
is winding down.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.440
But the pursuit of violent
Islamists continues with no

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.500
end in sight.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.200
After the Cold War, policy
makers increasingly came to

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.690
see coercion as a sort
of all-purpose tool.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.980
Among American War planners, the
assumption has now taken

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.450
root that whenever and wherever
US forces next engage

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.550
in hostilities, it will be the
result of the United States

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.170
consciously choosing
to launch a war.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.440
I was struck the other day.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.010
I think it was either
Saturday or Sunday.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.590
It was an op-ed published in
the New York Times by a

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.960
historian at the University of
Texas by the name of Jeremi

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:43.930
Suri calling for preventive
war against North Korea.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.290
And I was struck by that,
because I was puzzled by who

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.680
it is, at the Times op-ed pages,
that is sitting there

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.810
reviewing manuscripts and
saying, yes indeed, this is

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.850
what the American people
need to hear today.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:59.670
Let's opt for yet another
war before the last

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.920
one has wound down.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.990
As President George W. Bush
remarked, the big lesson of

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.930
9/11 was that quote, "This
country must go on the offense

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.190
and stay on the offense." The
American public's ready

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.800
acceptance of the prospect of
war without foreseeable end

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.190
and of a policy that abandons
even the pretense of the

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.430
United States fighting
defensively or viewing war as

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.340
a last resort shows clearly
how far the process of

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.562
militarization has advanced.

00:14:34.562 --> 00:14:37.110
Now reinforcing this heightened
predilection for

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.570
arms was the appearance in the
latter part of the 20th

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.600
century of a new aesthetic
of war.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:49.660
This was the third indication
of advancing militarism.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.820
The old 20th century aesthetic
of armed conflict is

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.050
barbarism, brutality, ugliness,
and sheer waste.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.210
It grew out of World War I. It
was depicted by writers such

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.490
as Ernest Hemingway
and Robert Graves.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:10.060
World War II, Korea, and
Vietnam reaffirmed that

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:12.970
aesthetic, in the latter case
with films like Apocalypse

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.010
Now, Platoon, and Full
Metal Jacket.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.860
The intersection of art
and war gave birth

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.190
to two large truths.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.090
The first was that the modern
battlefield was a

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.120
slaughterhouse and modern war,
an orgy of destruction that

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.180
devoured the guilty and
the innocent alike.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.560
The second truth, stemming
from the first, was that

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.250
military service was an
inherently degrading

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.870
experience and military
institutions, by their very

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.446
nature, repressive
and inhumane.

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:49.620
But by the turn of the 21st
century, a new image of war

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.030
had emerged.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.790
According to many observers,
the era of mass armies and

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.900
mechanized warfare had ended .

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.460
A new era of high tech warfare
waged by highly skilled

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.180
professionals equipped with
smart weapons, as they were

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.730
called, had supposedly
commenced.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.080
Describing the result
inspired a new

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.000
lexicon of military terms.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.990
War was becoming surgical,
frictionless, postmodern, and

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.010
even abstract or virtual.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.330
It was now called coercive
diplomacy.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.530
The object of the exercise
no longer

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.790
to kill but to persuade.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.580
According to Michael Ignatieff,
fighting no longer

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:38.000
implied the prospect of dying
for some abstract cause since,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.120
quoting Ignatieff it now, "The
very notion of sacrifice in

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.880
battle has become implausible
or ironic." This is what

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.150
people are writing back
in the 1990s.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:56.570
In war as spectacle, force had
acquired a symbolic value.

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.090
The aim was no longer anything
so crude as laying waste to

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.910
the enemy, merely demonstrating
that one

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.130
possessed the ability
to do so was

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.170
itself expected to suffice.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.859
To use force was to strike
a posture, to manipulate

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:15.470
perceptions, or to
send a message.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:19.720
This image of war transformed
derived from but also seem to

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.760
validate, in some senses,
I think what

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.740
Google exists to do.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.970
That is to say, it seemed to
validate a technology hyped

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.570
mood that prevailed during the
last decade of the 20th

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.100
century and persists into
the 21st century.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.170
By common consent, the defining
characteristics of

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.640
this new age were speed,
control, and choice.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.600
Information was, is empowering
the individual.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.290
Information reduces the
prevalence of chance and

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.860
surprise and random
occurrences.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.070
Henceforth, everything relevant
could be known and,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.380
if known, could be taken
into account.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.160
The expected result was to
lessen if not eliminate

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.970
uncertainty, risk, waste, and
error, and to produce quantum

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.400
improvements in efficiency
and effectiveness.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.510
The potential for applying
information technology to

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.780
armed conflict, long viewed as
an area of human endeavor

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.160
especially fraught with
uncertainty, risk, waste, and

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:30.250
error, appeared particularly
promising.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.150
Given access to sufficient
information, man could regain

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.090
control of war, arresting
its former

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.640
tendency to become total.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.520
Henceforth, the theory went
swiftness, stealth, agility,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.420
and precision would characterize
the operation of

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.060
major armies.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.050
Economy, predictability, and
political relevance would

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:58.730
constitute the hallmarks of war
in the information age.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.870
In short, by the dawn of the
21st century, the reigning

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:05.960
postulates of technology as
panacea had knocked away much

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:12.610
of the accumulated blood rust
sullying war's reputation.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.600
Thus reimagined, armed conflict
regained an aesthetic

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.860
respectability that the
literary and artistic

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.980
interpreters of 20th century
military cataclysms were

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.120
thought to have demolished
once and for all.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.350
In the right circumstances, for
the right cause, it now

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.810
turned out, war could actually
offer an attractive option,

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:40.480
cost effective, humane,
even thrilling.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.860
This new aesthetic made it as
far as Baghdad in the spring

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:50.250
of 2003, and that
was about it.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:54.890
The war inaugurated with
expectations of shock and awe

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.240
delivering a clean and quick
victory turned out to be not

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.790
all that different from any
other war worthy of the name,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.950
ugly and dehumanizing.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.520
Well what lessons did Americans
take from all that

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.610
our troops suffered and
inflicted on others in Iraq?

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.840
That war was irredeemably
brutal and a risky

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.380
proposition?

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.100
Not at all.

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.750
Instead, we persuaded ourselves
that missile firing

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.960
drones and skilled commandos
could soften the brutality and

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.160
mitigate the risk.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.390
This new aesthetic contributed,
in turn, to an

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.550
appreciable boost in the
status of military

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:35.840
institutions and soldiers
themselves.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.990
This is the fourth manifestation
of this new

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.680
American militarism.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.120
Since the end of the Cold War,
opinion polls surveying public

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.330
attitudes towards national
institutions have regularly

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.200
ranked the armed forces first.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.280
Americans fearful that the
rest of society may be

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.480
teetering on the brink of
moral collapse console

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.030
themselves with the thought that
the armed services remain

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.930
a repository of traditional
values, old fashioned virtue,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.310
and competence.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.530
Confidence in the military has
found expression in a tendency

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.370
to elevate the soldier to the
status of national icon, the

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:19.170
apotheosis of all that is
great and good about

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.770
contemporary America.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.890
As a consequence, in public,
today, homage to those in

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.040
uniform has become obligatory.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:34.160
The one unforgivable sin in our
politics is to be found

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.780
guilty of failing to
support the troops.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.720
In the realm of partisan
politics, the political right

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:44.210
has shown considerable skill
in exploiting this dynamic,

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.820
shamelessly pandering to the
military and to those members

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.780
of the public laboring under
the misconception that the

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.820
armed services are under
siege from a rabidly

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.570
anti-military left.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.660
In fact, the Democrat mainstream
has long since

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.680
purged itself of any dove-ish
inclinations.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.550
"What's the point of having
this superb military that

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.270
you're always talking about,"
Madeleine Albright famously

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:16.770
demanded of General Colin
Powell, "if we can't use it?"

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.700
As Albright's question attests
and as Barack Obama's

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.520
inclination to use force has
affirmed, when it comes to

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.540
advocating the use of
force, Democrats can

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.360
be positively gung-ho.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.120
Even among left-liberal
activists, the reflexive

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.220
anti-militarism of the 1960s
has given way to a more

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.160
nuanced view.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.940
Progressives have come to
appreciate the potential for

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:45.210
using the armed services to
advance their own agenda.

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.880
Thus, the most persistent calls
for US intervention

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.430
abroad to relieve the plight
of the abused and the

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.750
persecuted tend to come
from the left.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.460
Oblivious to the implications
of this creeping militarism,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.400
Americans have, for the most
part, simply accepted it.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.180
Indeed, in unexpected quarters,
they have embraced

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.080
it with an enthusiasm that is
nothing short of inexplicable.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.070
If only by default, the nation's
status, as the

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.920
greatest military power the
world has ever seen, has come

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.440
to signify a cosmic verdict
of sorts, a compelling

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.660
affirmation of American
exceptionalism.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.160
In fact, however, our present
day military ascendancy

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.970
represents something
quite different.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.510
For all this, seeing armed
force at the preeminent

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:37.060
expression of state power and
military institutions as the

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:41.100
chief repositories of civic
virtue, the expectation that

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.850
revolutionary advances in
military technology might

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.720
offer a tidy solution to complex
problems, all of this

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.890
distorts, if it does not
altogether forfeit, important

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.810
elements of the American
birthright.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:00.010
Recall that at the outset,
the New World--

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.250
as it was called back
when I was a kid--

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.870
was intended to be radically
and profoundly new.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.780
The vision of freedom animating
the founders of 17th

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:15.470
century Anglo-America and of
the 18th century American

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.610
Republic distinguished their
purpose from that of the Old

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:24.730
World, which was constantly
embroiled in bloody disputes

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.880
over privilege and power.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.510
Princes, armies, and perpetual
war defined Europe.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.290
The absence of these things
was to provide a point of

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.860
departure for defining
America.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.310
Determined to preserve their
freedom and their experiment

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:47.540
in popular self-government,
Americans knew instinctively

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.150
that militarism numbered as
perhaps the foremost threat to

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.590
their prospect of doing so.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:58.910
Military power was poison, one
not without occasional

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.560
utility, but a poison all
the same and never

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.350
to be regarded otherwise.

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:09.070
In our time, oblivious to the
potential consequences, we

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.600
have lost sight of that truth.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.800
We have chosen to marry the
means of the Old World to the

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.430
ends of the New, relying on
force and the threat of force

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:22.860
to spread the American
way of life.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:28.140
Or, as my favorite writer, Max
Boot, has put it, quoting,

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.820
"Imposing the rule of law,
property rights, and other

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:37.040
guarantees at gunpoint, if
need be," end of quote.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.470
Thus has the condition that
worried the sociologist C.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:45.360
Wright Mills, back in the mid
'50s, come to pass in our day.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.000
Whereas in earlier times,
Mills wrote, Americans

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.040
enviewed history as, quote, "a
peaceful continuum interrupted

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.190
by war," today, planning
and preparing and

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:58.930
waging war has become--

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.450
again, quoting Mills--

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:04.060
"The normal state and seemingly
permanent condition

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.280
of the United States."

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.970
And as Mills observed, nearly
half a century ago, the only

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.060
accepted plan for peace
is the loaded pistol.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:16.970
And with that, I'll conclude.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.220
And I look forward to any
comments or questions

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:19.980
that you may have.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.690
Thank you very much.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:26.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.022
ANDREW BACEVICH: Yes, sir.

00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:30.850
AUDIENCE: I agree with every
single thing you just said.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.095
But I suspect you may be
preaching to the choir.

00:26:34.095 --> 00:26:39.230
What I'm really curious about
is what you encountered in

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:44.240
terms of an opposing viewpoint
to your book.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.440
So, I listen to what you
say, and I'm like--

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.580
ANDREW BACEVICH: You mean, if
I were a critic of myself,

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.570
what would be the criticism
I would advance?

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.680
AUDIENCE: No, what have you
bumped into, in terms of

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.440
people saying your wrong?

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.120
Because I listened to everything
you've said.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.810
And this makes perfect sense.

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:01.524
But clearly, not everyone
agrees.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.880
ANDREW BACEVICH: I think the
people who disagree would say

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.130
the following.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:26.640
This is a disguised call for
a return to isolationism.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.570
This is somebody who believes
that the United States can

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:36.820
turn its back on the world and
still provide for the nation's

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.790
security and the well being
of the American people.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.750
This is somebody who has not
learned the self-evident

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:55.450
lessons of World War II that
unless the United States

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.500
seizes the imperative of
exercising global leadership,

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:03.430
the rest of the world goes
to hell in a handbasket.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.256
I think that would
be the response.

00:28:05.256 --> 00:28:13.270
Now, my interpretation
of US history--

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:22.830
I think an unsentimental
interpretation of US history

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.690
and, in particular, of
US foreign policy--

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.070
would go like this.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.500
We've never practiced
isolationism.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.590
From the founding of the
Republic, from the moment that

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.200
we secured independence from
Great Britain, successive

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.470
generations of American leaders
have been engaged in

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:48.260
an effort to expand American
power and to increase American

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.310
prosperity.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.120
And from time of achieving
independence until roughly

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.080
around the Vietnam
War, that effort

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.280
achieved monumental success.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.620
When I was a kid, back in the
1950s, and I was taught about,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:13.270
let's say, the incorporation
of North America into the

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.480
Republic, everything beyond the
initial 13 colonies, 13

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.120
states, I was basically taught
that that was part of a

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.036
domestic story.

00:29:22.036 --> 00:29:25.110
It wasn't part of a
domestic story.

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:29.040
US foreign policy in the 19th
century was substantially

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.870
about acquiring additional
territory, which we did by

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:34.940
means fair and foul.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.440
We bought it.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.571
We took it.

00:29:37.571 --> 00:29:41.870
We negotiated for it, whatever
was necessary.

00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:45.390
If you look at what occurred
between, roughly, 1800 and

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:48.550
1945, we have a story whereby
the United States of America,

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.540
in this presumably mostly
isolationist period of time,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.090
emerged as the most powerful and
the wealthiest country on

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.080
the face of the Earth, probably
the wealthiest

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:00.310
country in all of history.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:05.560
A tribute to the success
achieved by a policy of

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.560
expansionism, not
of isolationism.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.770
If you look at what's occurred
since 1945, we have attempted

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.800
to further expand this American
imperium and to

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.810
continue to enhance the
security, well being, and

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.330
prosperity of the
American people.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.160
The difference between the
pre-1945 story and the

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.520
post-1945 story is in the
outcomes we have achieved,

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.800
and, in particular, the outcomes
that we have achieved

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.980
in this period of time where,
I am arguing, that we have

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.265
fallen victim of militarism.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.960
If you look at the story of US
foreign policy since the end

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.290
of the Cold War, an effort at
least to preserve, if not to

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:53.650
continue to expand, the
American imperium.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.490
It's a story, it seems to me, in
which there is no question

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.460
that we've expended
extraordinary resources.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.660
Some people estimate that the
Iraq war, itself, will

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.820
ultimately cost something
like $4 to 6 trillion.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:07.100
We've expended enormous
resources.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.510
Our soldiers have made very
considerable sacrifices.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.100
Well, I ask you, is the country
becoming more secure?

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.585
Is the world becoming
more stable?

00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:26.070
Are the American people able
to share in ever greater

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:31.480
prosperity as a consequence
of our military exertions?

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.730
It seems to me to be patently
obvious that the answer is no.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.680
So again, I'm setting aside,
actually, moral

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.100
considerations.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.030
The Mexican war was a war of
aggression, but that's how we

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.890
got California.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.950
I'm not keen to give
California back.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.510
So setting aside moral
considerations, an expansion,

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.030
this strategy pursued over a
period of roughly a century

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:02.750
and a half, was manifestly
successful.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:06.670
Perpetuating that strategy over
the past several decades

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.980
is producing quite different
and adverse results.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.570
And so we ought to
think differently

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.750
about the way forward.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.452
Yes, sir.

00:32:19.452 --> 00:32:23.810
AUDIENCE: Actually, much of what
you said, as he said, it

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.620
sounds very sensible.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:29.205
But two questions that I think
are really important, if you

00:32:29.205 --> 00:32:30.203
have an answer.

00:32:30.203 --> 00:32:32.032
First, let me give you some
background so you know where

00:32:32.032 --> 00:32:35.193
I'm coming from in asking
these questions.

00:32:35.193 --> 00:32:39.442
I was born in Germany, when
my family was living in

00:32:39.442 --> 00:32:41.980
Dusseldorf, a city that my
father, while he was in the

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.884
artillery in World War II, had
been largely responsible for

00:32:44.884 --> 00:32:47.626
destroying and then, as an
American diplomat, had been

00:32:47.626 --> 00:32:49.373
assigned the task
of rebuilding.

00:32:49.373 --> 00:32:53.030
And he always said he was just
as proud of having rebuilt it

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.765
as he was of having
destroyed it--

00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:57.720
and for good reason.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.010
We later lived in Berlin,
in the free part of

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:03.680
Berlin, West Berlin.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.812
And West Berlin was free only
because there were British,

00:33:06.812 --> 00:33:11.780
American, and French troops
sitting there, not necessarily

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.900
fighting, but willing to fight
if the Russians would come

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.150
through that wall.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.430
Later, we moved to Ethiopia.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.322
And as the Navy moved out of
[INAUDIBLE] and the Military

00:33:25.322 --> 00:33:28.190
Assistance Corp came out of
the Ogaden and went other

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.020
places, the Cubans came in.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.801
Everybody in the neighborhood
in which we lived, with the

00:33:34.801 --> 00:33:38.712
exception of a few houses, were
slaughtered, were killed.

00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:41.928
At the time, there were those
who argued that an American

00:33:41.928 --> 00:33:44.601
force might have saved
hundreds of

00:33:44.601 --> 00:33:45.816
thousands if not millions.

00:33:45.816 --> 00:33:47.760
And if nothing else, it
would have kept the

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.732
Cubans out of there.

00:33:48.732 --> 00:33:55.400
So the two questions I would
ask, given that background, if

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.340
we accept what you've
said, the first

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.950
question is, so what?

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.870
And the second one is, what
should we be doing instead?

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.820
ANDREW BACEVICH: Well, again,
we could argue about this.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.989
The so what is--

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:13.239
my argument would be that an
over emphasis on military

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:16.170
power, exaggerated expectations
of what military

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:25.010
power can achieve are harming
the well being of our nation.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:29.790
We are spending a lot
and getting little.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.810
And I would argue that that's
been the case since the end of

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.340
the Cold War.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.409
I hope nothing I said in my
presentation somehow suggested

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:41.090
that I'm sort of opposed to
the basic US posture,

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.320
post-1945, vis-a-vis
the Soviet Union.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.600
I spent seven years of my living
in Germany, in the

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.670
United States Army.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:52.520
I think that the strategy of
containment was basically a

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:56.420
sound strategy, that the policy
of containing the

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.090
Soviet Union, in the aftermath
of World War II was probably a

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.450
necessary mission.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:07.220
But note that the only people
who proposed preventive war

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.700
against the Soviet Union,
we would view, in

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.300
retrospect, as lunatics.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.670
Whereas we now live in
a time in which--

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.000
to my knowledge, I may
be wrong here--

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.960
nobody in the Obama
Administration has explicitly

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.030
abrogated the Bush Doctrine.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.470
I think that's a big, big
deal, big change.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:31.490
So that would be point
number one.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:37.020
The unrealistic expectations of
what military power can do

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.940
and the recklessness with which
we use it don't serve

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.630
the nation's interest, don't
serve the interests, I think,

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:47.630
of stability more broadly.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.150
Now with regard to the Cuba, I
don't know that much about.

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.420
I mean, I know the Cubans were
mucking around in Africa for a

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.530
period of time.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.690
I have to say, at the present
moment, I'm not particularly

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.630
concerned about the aspirations
of the Cuban

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.990
regime, which seems to me that
the revolution is largely

00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:09.010
failed and does not represent a
threat to anybody, as far as

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.260
I can tell.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.710
There was one other point you
wanted me to make, and I can't

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:15.480
remember what it was.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.090
AUDIENCE: What should we do?

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.543
It sounds almost like
what you said, it's

00:36:20.543 --> 00:36:23.025
really the Bush Doctrine.

00:36:23.025 --> 00:36:24.794
Let me go back to when
I was a kid.

00:36:24.794 --> 00:36:26.702
When I was a kid in Berlin,
they used to tell us that,

00:36:26.702 --> 00:36:28.670
even though we were kids,
we were important to the

00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:29.573
protection of the city.

00:36:29.573 --> 00:36:34.320
Because the problem was that
the Americans would never

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.047
fight over Berlin until the
Russians came in and shot us.

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:42.860
And as soon as the shot
us, that would be

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.690
the reason to fight.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.780
ANDREW BACEVICH:
That's correct.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.680
To some degree, the families
of service members or other

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.160
Americans serving the government
in Western Germany,

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.295
not simply West Berlin, were
basically hostages.

00:36:56.295 --> 00:36:57.500
AUDIENCE: We there to be shot.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.477
ANDREW BACEVICH: Well, you're
overstating it.

00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:04.020
AUDIENCE: Overstating, but the
point was, in those days, the

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.770
statement was very clear.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.550
We will not fight until
they shoot at you.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.080
ANDREW BACEVICH: Thank you.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.926
AUDIENCE: Whereas today, after
the Bush Doctrine-- which is

00:37:11.926 --> 00:37:14.680
something I think is just
absolutely bizarre-- is we

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.220
will fight when we're in the
mood or when we're afraid that

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.180
they might shoot you.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.740
ANDREW BACEVICH: Yeah, I think
you're making my case, here,

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.910
for part of the problem.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.890
AUDIENCE: Is that the core?

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:24.960
ANDREW BACEVICH: Well, I
think it's part of it.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.510
It's not the whole thing.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.000
What should we do?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.590
What's the problem?

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.640
I think another element of the
problem has to do with the

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.960
creation of the all volunteer
force in the wake of Vietnam,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.840
which had the consequence of,
for all practical purposes,

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.750
abandoning a tradition of
the citizen soldier.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:52.130
The most important wars in our
history, the most successful

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:55.645
wars in our history, were wars
fought by citizen soldiers,

00:37:55.645 --> 00:37:57.560
not professional soldiers.

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.070
Citizen soldiers preserved
the Union.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.330
Citizen soldiers constituted
the forces that went and

00:38:02.330 --> 00:38:05.320
fought against Nazi
Germany and Japan.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.120
Citizen soldiers constituted
the the war in Korea, which

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:15.880
was a war fought pursuant to
that strategy of containment,

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.770
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.420
After Vietnam, we abandoned
that tradition.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.190
And we embraced the idea of
an all volunteer force.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:28.520
And I think that, to me, it
becomes increasingly evident

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:33.310
that that produced deeply
unfortunate and, indeed,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.710
pernicious consequences.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:41.520
Certainly, we have forces today
that are enormously

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:49.230
competent, well-disciplined,
well-motivated units that

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.160
display real cohesion.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.450
But they don't win.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.370
We didn't win in Iraq.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.920
We're not going to win in
Afghanistan by any sort of

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.650
traditional definition
of what victory is.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:08.710
But because they exist at such
a distance to the rest of

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:12.590
American society, because the
American people are no longer

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:18.200
engaged in, seriously engaged
in, no longer have a stake in

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.710
the well being of US forces,
in essence, the state has

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.640
exerted control over
US forces.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.920
And I think employs them
recklessly and foolishly.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.230
And the state gets
away with it.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.590
So what should be done?

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.550
We should examine whether
there's some possibility of

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.230
reconstituting the tradition
of the citizen soldier, in

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.710
some aspect, where our
definition of citizenship, in

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.900
some way, entails recognition
of an obligation of citizens

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.140
to contribute to the defense
of the country.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.000
We can have a debate
on how to do that.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.870
Does that mean we should draft
every 18-year-old male and

00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:58.700
female in this country?

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.130
I don't think so, because we
don't need a military anywhere

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.710
near that large.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:07.270
Should we perhaps continue to
consider the possibility of a

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:11.260
program of national service,
where every 18-year-old male

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.320
and female would be expected
to contribute some form of

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:21.800
service to nation, to community,
with some number of

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.750
them serving in the military?

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.720
Perhaps we could do that.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.080
So I think part of the issue
here is to reconstitute a

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.900
definition of citizenship that
entails collective obligation.

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.860
We used to have that,
at least in theory.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.115
Now we no longer have
that even in theory.

00:40:42.115 --> 00:40:44.830
Is that a fair answer?

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.196
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:46.196 --> 00:40:51.333
AUDIENCE: How do you think that
some new aspects of war,

00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:55.162
asymmetrical warfare, non-state
actors, ideology's

00:40:55.162 --> 00:40:57.480
role in conflict now.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.990
How do you think that that
might be affecting our

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.580
mentality about war and, in some
ways, because we're maybe

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.120
still learning exactly how
to fight these conflicts?

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.656
What constitutes
a win in Iraq?

00:41:09.656 --> 00:41:11.930
What would constitute a
win in Afghanistan?

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.583
Because we're not really sure
what a win is that we're just

00:41:14.583 --> 00:41:17.205
throwing money at the
problem, maybe?

00:41:17.205 --> 00:41:20.520
ANDREW BACEVICH: I'm no sure I
fully understand the question.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.242
Go ahead.

00:41:21.242 --> 00:41:24.900
AUDIENCE: What role do you think
how war has changed?

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.130
ANDREW BACEVICH: That's the way
I was going to interpret

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:26.520
the question.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.460
And my answer would be,
it really hasn't.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.750
The nature of war
is immutable.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:39.810
Where, I would argue, we went
wrong-- and I was trying to

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:43.360
insert this notion
into the talk--

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.450
is, in the wake of the Cold War,
in the wake of Operation

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:50.610
Desert Storm, at a moment when
the country was deeply

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.780
enamored with the potential
of technology--

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.480
you're all in the technology
business, I understand that--

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:02.250
that at this particular moment,
Americans who were

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:07.360
interested in national security,
in war, people who

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.780
are very smart but should have
known better, they persuaded

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:17.520
themselves that technology had
the capability to change

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.680
fundamentally warfare.

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.790
And it was that expectation, I
think, that helped to lay the

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:29.710
foundation for the misguided
approach we took to

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.740
responding to 9/11.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.290
It what was their expectations,
the expectations

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.710
of people like Donald Rumsfeld,
specifically, who

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:44.000
thought that invading Iraq would
produce a quick, easy,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.450
cheap, decisive victory, but
instead embedded us in a

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:55.060
protracted, ugly, inconclusive
war against a nation that,

00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.490
guess what, had no involvement
in the 9/11 attacks.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:05.650
So I really don't think that war
has changed all that much.

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:12.090
I think one of the great
mistakes that we made was

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.260
thinking that technology had
changed it or was changing it

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.280
or could change it.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.480
And this is not an argument
that says that, somehow,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.060
technology is irrelevant to
the conduct of warfare.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.660
Given the choice between going
to war with a muzzle loading

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:34.130
musket and an M-4 assault
rifle, I'll

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:35.945
take the M-4 any day.

00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:39.140
I just think we need to be very
wary of the notion that

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.200
technology has a transformative
impact because

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.510
it doesn't.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:51.190
I mean it's really worth
contemplating that our

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.350
adversaries in Iraq and, to some
degree, our adversaries

00:43:53.350 --> 00:44:01.020
in Afghanistan have absolutely
given us fits in employing a

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:07.340
weapon that we choose to call
the improvised explosive

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.840
device, the IED, which is,
basically, a crudely

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.630
constructed, home-made mine
that some people have

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:23.170
calculated you can make for
about the cost of a pizza pie.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:26.900
And yet we have spent billions
of dollars trying to figure

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.900
out how to respond to the
threat posed by the IED.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:37.590
And the IED has inflicted
unspeakable casualties on our

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:43.490
soldiers, despite the fact that
they have, presumably, a

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:48.780
great technological advantage.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.004
Yes, sir.

00:44:50.004 --> 00:44:54.610
AUDIENCE: So as of right now,
the US represents about 20% of

00:44:54.610 --> 00:45:01.180
the world's GDP, over half
of the military spending.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.660
We are in serious debt.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:07.000
And considering the history of
the Roman Empire, the Soviet

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.521
Union, how does go unnoticed
by the top generals?

00:45:10.521 --> 00:45:14.390
I cannot imagine how they sit
there, look at this, and they

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:16.650
think, you know what, this
is the right strategy.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.020
We do need 12 carriers.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.130
We do need stealth bombers.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:22.030
How does that logic work?

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:23.650
How do they internalize it?

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.370
ANDREW BACEVICH: How
the hell do I know?

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.430
ANDREW BACEVICH: Seriously,
Admiral Mullen, who was the

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.900
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff once removed, said,

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.390
while he was still on active
duty, that the greatest threat

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.360
to US national security
was the debt.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.480
He said that publicly
in a speech.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.030
Attracted a certain amount
of press attention.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.261
And then, I think, basically
let that thought drop.

00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:01.640
He didn't come back, two weeks
later and say, and here's what

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.640
we in the military propose
to do about that debt.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.840
And my point there would be,
I think, at least in some

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.620
quarters in the senior military
leadership, there's

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:14.320
some awareness that this fiscal

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.020
overextension is a big deal.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.870
And yet, one senses that--

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.520
and I'm just speculating now--

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.280
at the end of the day,
bureaucratic interests end up

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.590
trumping those insights.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.820
The Pentagon itself, as a
powerful entity within the

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:45.510
federal government, the services
as a sub-set of the

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:50.190
Pentagon, for bureaucratic
reasons, they're all committed

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.660
to the proposition that they
want to sustain and, if

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.160
possible, not only increase
the size of the pie but

00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.960
increase their chunk
of the pie.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.370
Right now, my old service, the
United States Army, my sense

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:08.170
is, at least, that the Army is
deeply concerned that the

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.090
Obama administration's so-called
pivot towards

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.040
East-Asia--

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:14.150
whatever that means--

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:18.460
probably means that the Air
Force and the Navy are going

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:22.410
to be in a position to argue for
more money than the Army

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:23.300
is going to get.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.900
Or to put it another way, after
Iraq and Afghanistan, if

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.000
somebody says, please explain
to me why the United States

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.400
Army exists?

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.430
The Army has a hard time
answering the question.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.530
So I don't think you can
underestimate the importance

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:44.148
of bureaucratic politics would
be one of my answers.

00:47:44.148 --> 00:47:45.291
Yes, sir.

00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:47.881
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned a
little bit about bringing back

00:47:47.881 --> 00:47:50.707
the concept of the citizen
soldier and having national

00:47:50.707 --> 00:47:54.054
service for all, some military,
some non-military.

00:47:54.054 --> 00:47:56.710
I think after that, I'd like
to hear a little bit more

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.536
about how you think that
could be implemented.

00:47:58.536 --> 00:48:03.516
And one other question is, you
mentioned and cited some stats

00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:06.504
around how we have a larger
and more powerful standing

00:48:06.504 --> 00:48:10.239
army relative to threats that we
have today than at any time

00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:11.484
in our history.

00:48:11.484 --> 00:48:15.482
But when World War II came
around and the Vietnam War, we

00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:17.783
were putting out a flying
fortress every 100 minutes

00:48:17.783 --> 00:48:20.430
from the factory.

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:22.784
With today's technology and the
training that's required

00:48:22.784 --> 00:48:26.700
today of our soldiers, do you
think that it's feasible to

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:32.110
have fewer troops and less
machinery and to be able to

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:34.760
scale up as we [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.040
ANDREW BACEVICH: I think that's
a great question.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.790
So let's pretend we have a
force that is a citizen

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.190
soldier force in which,
presumably, young people would

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:46.300
come on active duty for
something like a couple of

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.240
years and that's it, right?

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.010
Then they have to go back.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.770
They want to go to school.

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:51.230
They want to go on
to their career.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:58.810
Can we train somebody to fly an
F-35, train them and then

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.980
commit them to the force such
that, given a two year period

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.990
of service, we're kind of
getting our money's worth?

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:07.890
And the answer is probably no.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:12.200
There would certainly be certain
specialized functions

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.430
where you would want to recruit
long service people.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:23.100
That said, I think service in
the infantry, crewing an

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:30.670
armored vehicle, being an
artillery man, crewing various

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:38.100
specialties, and crewing
warships, driving trucks,

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.720
maintenance functions, you
probably could train people

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.700
within a period of four, six,
eight months and, therefore,

00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:52.590
still get a pretty substantial
amount of benefit after they

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.260
leave their training
and are serving in

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.700
the field as it were.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.740
So you have to discriminate,
it seems to me.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:04.070
And those things where
the citizen soldier

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.400
would be a good fit.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.730
And other more complex, more
specialized functions where

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.230
you wouldn't.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:12.500
And I think you could
figure that out.

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.700
But your first question,
how would you

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:15.800
sell national service?

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:19.680
I think it would be
a tough sell.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:27.360
Because you're going to have
to be able to persuade the

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.380
nation's 18-year-olds and the
parents of the nation's

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:38.870
18-year-olds to participate in
this program to generate

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:44.240
sufficient grassroots political
support that the

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.470
necessary legislation could
be passed and implemented.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.300
And I wouldn't for a second,
want to tell you I think that

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.970
would be easy.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.220
I don't think it would be.

00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.260
And the way to get it, I think,
would be to identify

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:02.350
someone in Washington in a
position of significant

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:08.880
influence who could champion
this kind of a cause.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.830
I don't know who
that would be.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:16.750
I, myself, when Senator Webb was
elected to the Senate from

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:25.020
Virginia, I kind of fancied for
a time that he might be a

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.020
strong, independent, critical
voice who would be able to

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.880
raise first order issues about
national security policy and

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.190
perhaps promote a debate.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.640
It turned out, he
didn't do that.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.950
And after a single term,
he left office.

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.030
I don't know what he's doing.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.460
But we need a champion.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.260
And maybe the comparison would
be the way Senator Ted Kennedy

00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:51.330
was the champion for health
care reform for decades.

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:56.820
Indeed, he didn't even live
to see the success of his

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.290
enterprise.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:01.920
But he promoted an idea
and stuck with it.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.780
And eventually, the idea jelled
and gained enough

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:07.000
support that it became
reality.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.400
Something of the same
would have to occur.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.450
And I don't want
to minimize the

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.020
likelihood of that happening.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:14.710
It's probably not very great.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:15.765
Yes, sir.

00:52:15.765 --> 00:52:18.950
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on the existence of

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.630
what's been called a deep state
that essentially drives

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:27.403
the military industrial complex
forward and leads us

00:52:27.403 --> 00:52:29.017
to these neverending wars?

00:52:29.017 --> 00:52:33.830
Something like Operation Gladio,
as we saw in Italy and

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:40.114
Turkey in the '60s and '70s,
where this strategy of tension

00:52:40.114 --> 00:52:43.018
has transformed into
a war of terror.

00:52:43.018 --> 00:52:45.922
Do you believe that something
like that may be going on?

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:50.840
ANDREW BACEVICH: My view's
probably not as dark as I

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.870
think yours is.

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.830
But there are structural
explanations.

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.580
We don't have to go as
far as deep state.

00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:01.110
All we have to do is look at
President Eisenhower's

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.740
farewell address in which he
warned of the dangers of a

00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.990
military industrial complex.

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:06.320
There is a military industrial
complex.

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.420
As I suggested a couple of
minutes ago, there is a

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.640
national security apparatus that
is large and is powerful

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:19.550
and has interests that may not
necessarily coincide with the

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.880
interests of the
nation itself.

00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:24.690
So I think there are structural
explanations that

00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:27.270
need to be taken into account.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:32.240
I don't think that somehow it is
that these structures, the

00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:35.640
national security state,
provide an adequate, a

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.480
complete understanding of why we
do what we do and why we've

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.930
come to have the view
of military power

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:43.030
that we come to have.

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:48.650
I think you have to take into
account ideology, our

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:52.880
self-identity, our sense of the
role that we are called

00:53:52.880 --> 00:54:00.440
upon to play in the world that
makes us as citizens

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:07.270
susceptible to manipulation by
people or institutions that

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:10.780
may have a self-interested
agenda.

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.010
So I'm not willing to simply
blame it all on the military

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:15.590
industrial complex.

00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:17.610
I blame some of it on them.

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:18.260
Yes, sir.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.140
AUDIENCE: Could you talk
somewhat about--

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.735
there's been a tendency over
the last decade by people

00:54:24.735 --> 00:54:28.800
whose primary concern is
humanitarian, to want

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.866
intervention to effectively
rescue people.

00:54:31.866 --> 00:54:36.540
We find ourselves taking sides
in Somalia or being told that

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:40.031
we should have intervened in
Rwanda, and that it's a

00:54:40.031 --> 00:54:41.420
disgrace that we didn't.

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:43.895
You have the Mali situation.

00:54:43.895 --> 00:54:48.267
So do you think that gives any
momentum to militarism?

00:54:48.267 --> 00:54:50.780
ANDREW BACEVICH: Yeah, I tried
to suggest that in the talk.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:51.400
I think it is.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:53.830
I think that there are people,
who style themselves as

00:54:53.830 --> 00:55:00.030
progressives or left-liberals
who, back in the 1960s, would

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:04.780
have viewed the military as the
opposition to some degree

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:08.870
now view military power as an
instrument that we, the

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:14.450
nation, can put to work
to do good deeds or

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:16.540
to rescue the oppressed.

00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:19.030
There's a considerable debate
on right now suggesting that

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.110
the United States should,
somehow or other, intervene in

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:25.090
the Syrian civil war, not
necessarily directly by

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:28.090
putting US forces on the ground,
but by establishing,

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.200
for example, no fly zones.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.470
That's part of the equation.

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.398
AUDIENCE: So what would
be your take on this?

00:55:33.398 --> 00:55:36.772
That war is so destructive and
chaotic that that's not

00:55:36.772 --> 00:55:37.260
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.410
ANDREW BACEVICH: No, my
take would be the

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:41.600
following, I think.

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.910
Let's take the Syria case.

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.610
There is a civil war.

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:54.250
The civil war is leading to a
very substantial number of

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:57.540
Syrian non-combatants fleeing
their country.

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.420
They're going to Turkey.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:02.830
They're going to Jordan,
primarily.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:05.180
I think some are going
to Iraq, even.

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.280
And so the argument would be,
well, how can we stand by and

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.750
let that happen?

00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:12.900
And my first question would be,
OK, well, let's take the

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.460
obligation to respond to
their plight seriously.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:19.150
Why does it follow that the
appropriate way to respond to

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:21.765
their plight is to intervene
militarily?

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.040
I don't know what
the numbers are.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.820
Let us imagine there is 100,000
Syrians living in

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.280
terrible refugee camps
in Turkey.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.920
Why don't we bring
them to America.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.610
And we'll offer them refuge.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.510
That would certainly take
them out of harm's way.

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:44.760
So I don't know that necessarily
the appropriate

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:48.640
response to a humanitarian
problem is sending US forces.

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.170
Maybe there are non-military
ways to express the plight of

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.470
the people.

00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:57.230
If we would say, no, no, no,
no, we need to intervene

00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:01.950
militarily, we need to involve
ourselves militarily in the

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.410
Syrian civil war, then I think
I would say to the people who

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:08.240
propose that, how much are
you willing to pay?

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.780
Because it ain't free.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.480
Are you willing to
raise your taxes?

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.090
Are you willing to accept the
reduction in the entitlements

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:19.050
you get from the government?

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:21.210
Are you willing to send your
kid down to the local

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:24.890
recruiter to go sign up
to fight on behalf

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:25.970
of the Syrian people?

00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:30.760
Or to people who propose this,
are you simply asking the

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.950
American military to do
something so that you can

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.200
sleep better at night?

00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:37.680
And if they say,
well, yes, yes.

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.930
I'm willing to raise my taxes.

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.540
I'm willing to reduce
my Medicare.

00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:42.790
I'm willing to send my
kid to go fight.

00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:44.360
Then I think the other question
I'd say to the

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.090
advocate of humanitarian
intervention is, tell me what

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.330
you think you're going
to get done.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:53.470
Let's be realistic about
what we can achieve.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:57.470
I dare say it is possible for us
to use our forces to put an

00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:59.060
end to the civil war in Syria.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:02.890
There's no question in my mind
that we can overthrow the

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:04.225
Assad regime.

00:58:04.225 --> 00:58:07.080
But what are you going
to get then?

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:09.010
How long are you
going to stay?

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:11.760
Because there's some
considerable likelihood that

00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:15.180
we won't like what follows the
Assad regime anymore than we

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.170
like the Assad regime.

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:21.070
And, in that sense, what
did you achieve?

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:27.340
So truly, it's not that I am
hard and fast against using US

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.040
forces for humanitarian
purposes.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:35.050
I just think that, when that
subject comes up, there are a

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:39.990
whole host of questions that
ought to be addressed candidly

00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:44.310
and honestly before we decide
that it's time to dispatch the

00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:50.260
82nd Airborne to some distant
country and involve itself in

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.130
some complex situation.

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:54.600
Yes, ma'am.

00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.058
AUDIENCE: I wonder from the
perspective of those who are

00:58:58.058 --> 00:59:01.560
still active duty, how
they would respond to

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.693
hearing your comments.

00:59:02.693 --> 00:59:05.471
And so I have a two
part question.

00:59:05.471 --> 00:59:09.153
One is, when did you start
thinking about these types of

00:59:09.153 --> 00:59:13.386
issues and did you think about
them as far back as when you

00:59:13.386 --> 00:59:16.890
were starting out
as an officer?

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.266
Did people talk about
it back then?

00:59:19.266 --> 00:59:24.160
And how do we have this
intelligent, thoughtful

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.190
discussion about where our
country goes from here, which

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:29.970
you are leading the charge
on, without demotivating

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:33.630
especially our enlisted, those
who are coming on board with

00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:37.489
these high hopes of representing
their country on

00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:38.170
the front lines?

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:41.740
ANDREW BACEVICH: Well, the
generation when I was raised

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:49.660
as a young soldier, it was made
clear to me that soldiers

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:51.730
are instruments of the state.

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:55.790
Soldiers don't have politics,
shouldn't have politics.

00:59:55.790 --> 01:00:00.820
And again, I was commissioned at
a time when the Vietnam War

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.360
was an ongoing proposition and
had deeply divided the

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:09.260
country, when many Americans,
as a consequence of Vietnam

01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:14.520
and other things going in the
country, had very strong

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.340
political opinions on one
side or the other.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:23.740
I was educated to understand
that that wasn't my business.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:28.150
And I continue to believe that,
as difficult as it may

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.540
be, that that's the proper
position for

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.290
a soldier to take.

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:39.430
The principle of civilian
control means that people up

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:45.060
top, civilians, the civilian
leaders that citizens elect,

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:47.990
they are the ones who have to
deal with these very difficult

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.750
policy issues.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.610
The obligation of the soldier
is to simply implement those

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:56.160
decisions once they are made.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.490
If a soldier cannot in good
conscience do that, then the

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.870
soldier is in the wrong
line of work.

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:05.900
For example, at BU we got--

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.730
there aren't too many
universities that have Army

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.130
ROTC, Navy ROTC, and
Air Force ROTC.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.580
We got all three services.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.480
And I get a considerable
number of ROTC

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.260
cadets in my courses.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:25.620
And I think about the difficulty
that they have.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.040
Because in their ROTC training,
they are basically

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.080
being told that they are
instruments of the state and

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.760
that their job is to implement
orders, not question orders.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.240
On the other hand, they come
into my classroom and I don't

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.790
view them as ROTC cadets.

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:43.320
I view them as young Boston
University undergraduates,

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:47.270
people who are becoming mature
adults and citizens.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.190
And I want them to be able
to think critically.

01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:54.390
And I sort of recognize that I
might be putting them in a

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:55.760
tough spot.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.260
On the one hand, they're being
told that their job is to

01:01:58.260 --> 01:01:59.330
follow orders.

01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.760
And the other hand, I'm
telling them that

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.070
their job is to think.

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:07.390
So I think it's a problematic
thing.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.970
And well, I'll just
leave it at that.

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.770
But it's funny when you say,
what do they think?

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:18.870
I have been struck and, indeed,
frankly heartened by

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:24.640
the number of emails, mostly,
that I'm getting from serving

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.510
military people, usually young
officers, people I've never

01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:33.740
met, who tell me that they read
some things that I write

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:40.660
and that it helps them think
about their profession, think

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.080
about the role that the United
States plays, think about the

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.496
wars in which they themselves
have participated.

01:02:49.496 --> 01:02:51.640
Now, it's a self-selected
group.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.330
There's probably a much larger
number of people

01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.670
who think I'm a jerk.

01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.480
And fortunately, not too many
of them send me emails.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.500
But I find it heartening that,
at least, there is some

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.720
audience in the active duty
community that seems to be

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.050
somewhat interested.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.350
Yes, sir.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:13.040
AUDIENCE: So I commend you for
your views and the way you

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.600
look at a problem.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.860
But having read Lawrence
Lessig's book on the influence

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:26.042
of money in Washington and the
effects that it has on the

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:32.190
society thereof, isn't the
problem that you described

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:36.230
actually easier to solve not
by, I don't know, doing a

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:40.736
general draft or something,
but really to solving the

01:03:40.736 --> 01:03:47.598
issue of how money influences
the decisions that are done in

01:03:47.598 --> 01:03:48.848
Washington?

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:56.090
ANDREW BACEVICH: I agree
with the notion that

01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:58.440
money plays a big role.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.680
We alluded a little
while ago to the

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.870
military industrial complex.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.880
And many of you know that, I
think, Eisenhower considered

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.280
actually referring in his
speech to the military

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:11.300
industrial congressional complex
because the money

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:13.970
lubricates politics.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:17.360
But I'll be darned if I can
tell you how to fix that.

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.816
How do we get money out of?

01:04:20.816 --> 01:04:22.220
You're not going
to get it out.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.870
But how do we reduce the

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:26.510
significance of money in politics?

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:28.330
That's way beyond my brief.

01:04:28.330 --> 01:04:31.560
And I'd love to see somebody
come up with an idea

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:32.580
about how to do it.

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.760
But, boy, I don't know.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.402
How would you do it?

01:04:35.402 --> 01:04:38.290
AUDIENCE: Well, Lawrence
Lessig [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:39.515
ANDREW BACEVICH: I haven't read
that book, by the way.

01:04:39.515 --> 01:04:42.366
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's Republic
Lost, I believe is the the

01:04:42.366 --> 01:04:43.074
title of the book.

01:04:43.074 --> 01:04:49.960
He has some actually practical
advice on how to move there.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.450
ANDREW BACEVICH: I'll
look at it.

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:53.574
Yes, sir.

01:04:53.574 --> 01:04:56.304
AUDIENCE: You preempted a lot
of the questions I was going

01:04:56.304 --> 01:04:58.876
to ask about our voluntary
military force.

01:04:58.876 --> 01:05:02.250
So let me ask you a slightly
different question.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.960
So I'm sure I'm not the only
one that holds this view.

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.680
But it certainly seemed like, in
the run-up to the invasion

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:16.650
of Iraq, that the game was a
little bit ginned, in the

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:23.100
sense that the press didn't
fulfill its role as being

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:26.090
objective about what
the merits were.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:29.490
And I'm wondering, in the
current debate, about

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:32.930
situations that are in front of
us now like, for example,

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.702
Iran, whether you think
that there's been any

01:05:35.702 --> 01:05:37.076
improvement at all?

01:05:37.076 --> 01:05:40.495
And whether the debate now and
what's said in the press and

01:05:40.495 --> 01:05:43.585
the questions that are being
asked are better or more

01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:45.921
penetrating or lead
to a more open

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:46.562
debate then what happened?

01:05:46.562 --> 01:05:47.760
ANDREW BACEVICH: Yeah,
not particularly.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:53.400
I mean I share your view of the
overall tone of reporting

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.570
in the run-up to the
invasion of Iraq.

01:05:55.570 --> 01:06:03.930
And from my perspective, part
of the problem was that

01:06:03.930 --> 01:06:08.590
mainstream media had fallen prey
to this false notion of

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.690
what war had become.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:15.430
They bought into the shock
and awe notion.

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.350
I do think that the
reporting during--

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.460
we're talking about
Iraq here--

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:26.180
parts of the insurgency
was much better.

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:33.700
It was more balanced, more
critical, appropriately so.

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.950
But to tell you the truth, I
think that the press then fell

01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:42.620
for the whole Petraeus, surge,
counter insurgency, turn the

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:47.960
war around, greatest general
since Patton argument in ways

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:53.790
that, in a sense, replicated
their failure in the first

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:59.340
stages, that now COIN, as they
called it, became the new

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.790
American way of war.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:10.960
So at best, I think the
reporting has been mixed.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.683
And it's not clear to me that
they learned a lot.

01:07:14.683 --> 01:07:16.530
AUDIENCE: We've got room for
one more [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:17.490
ANDREW BACEVICH: Well, you've
been raising your hand.

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:19.302
So why don't you do
the last question?

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.325
AUDIENCE: My question would be,
what do you think about

01:07:21.325 --> 01:07:24.630
Bill Lynn's hypothesis that what
we really need to worry

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:26.166
about is order.

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:29.623
And if we're not careful, we
make the world a lot worse

01:07:29.623 --> 01:07:31.700
place rather than a lot better
place by throwing around

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.520
power, because we can create
more terrorists than we can

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.992
possibly kill.

01:07:36.992 --> 01:07:39.050
ANDREW BACEVICH: I
think he's right.

01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.300
Again, I think that's
self-evident.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.650
Justine is going to get tired
of hearing me say this,

01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:48.280
because I said it in
the breakfast talk.

01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:56.630
If I were telling the story of
US military history, over the

01:07:56.630 --> 01:08:00.170
past 30 or so years, now, I
would begin it with the

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:03.980
promulgation of the Carter
Doctrine in January of 1980.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.810
That was when President Carter
said, the Persian Gulf is a

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:08.730
vital national security interest
of the United States.

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.210
We'll use all means necessary,
to include military force, to

01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:13.545
prevent bad guys from
taking it over.

01:08:13.545 --> 01:08:16.930
And I think what Carter
inadvertently did was to set

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:21.479
in motion a project, a project
that has grown in scope and,

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:26.109
in many respects, has grown in
intensity over time, in which

01:08:26.109 --> 01:08:30.729
US policymakers have acted on
the presumption that the

01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:33.420
application of American hard
power to that region of the

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:37.899
world is going to
bring stability.

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:39.770
Now when Carter was talking,
he was talking about the

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.920
rather specific Persian Gulf.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.410
I think that, over the course
of 30 years, the

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:46.899
implementation has been over
what we now call the greater

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:48.151
Middle East.

01:08:48.151 --> 01:08:52.560
If we simply try hard enough,
we're going to be able to

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.890
stabilize that region.

01:08:54.890 --> 01:09:00.040
And then the benefits
will be great.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.525
Well if you step back at 2013
and now look at all the things

01:09:04.525 --> 01:09:08.420
that we've done since 1980, from
a military perspective,

01:09:08.420 --> 01:09:12.200
in the greater Middle East, ask
yourself if that region of

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:14.670
the world is becoming
more stable?

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.940
And the answer is
no, it's not.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.740
It's becoming less stable.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:24.950
Now, I'm not sure it's become
less stable because of the way

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:27.560
we have used our forces,
although that's possible.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.050
It could be it's become less
stable for reasons that

01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:33.600
basically we have
no control over.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:37.470
But regardless, simply trying
harder, simply trying to

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:40.319
devise new ways of using
American hard power-- that's

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:44.330
what Obama's been doing with
these drone strikes--

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:47.590
I see no indication that trying
harder is going to give

01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:49.420
us a different result.

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.410
And that, therefore, it's time
to ask some very difficult,

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:59.260
uncomfortable questions about
US policy in the region.

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:02.330
And that's a debate that I think
few people in Washington

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.810
are willing to undertake.

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:10.100
And it's a debate that people
who favor this emphasis on

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:14.530
military power are absolutely
opposed to.

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:15.390
Hey, this has been
a lot of fun.

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:17.500
I really appreciate you
turning out and

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.100
listening to this.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:22.827
