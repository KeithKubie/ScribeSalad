[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.587 --> 00:00:07.170
LIZA MUNDY: Thank
you for inviting me.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.610
It's a thrill to be here on
the Cambridge campus of Google.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.980
And as I'm sure all
of you well know,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.090
we are-- for the
past year and a half,

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.350
we've been in a sort of
renewed discussion of inclusion

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.960
of women in the tech
sector, the experience

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.250
of women in the tech sector.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.550
This is a conversation that
we periodically seem to have

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.000
and I'm here to remind you that
women helped create and found

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.520
the tech sector,
so much of which

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.490
was created and pioneered
during World War II.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.550
My book, "Code Girls," is
not about coding so much

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.030
as it is about code breaking
during World War II.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.390
Our code breaking force
was actually larger

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.570
than the British force at
Bletchley Park and more

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.910
than half of it was female.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.190
And this is an untold story.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.470
I think of it as a
mash-up of "The Imitation

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.020
Game" and "The
Greatest Generation,"

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.682
actually, because these
women were the hidden figures

00:00:59.682 --> 00:01:00.890
of "The Greatest Generation."

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.170
So a mash-up of
all three of those.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.160
And I like to start my
talks with this slide, which

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.160
sort of depicts the plight of
the educated woman in 1942.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340
This shows the May
court at Goucher College

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.530
in the spring of 1942.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320
A May court, as far
as I could tell,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.840
it was a very common thing for
colleges to have at the time.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.520
It was sort of a
vestige, I think,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.630
of a Pagan fertility ritual,
in which young female college

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.890
seniors are dressed in virginal
white and symbolically ushered

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.370
into the marriage market.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.080
And Goucher College
at that time was

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.120
what they call a girls' school.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.850
The women who went there
were called Goucher girls.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.960
It was an all-female college
in urban Baltimore, Maryland.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.870
It's now coeducational
in suburban Towson.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.090
But at the time,
it was all female.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.420
It had been founded, like
most women's colleges,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.510
in the late 19th century at
a time when people generally

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.940
believed that higher
education was not

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.530
only unnecessary for women but
not necessarily good for women.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.889
That it sort of made women
over-educated, obnoxious,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.370
difficult to live with.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.110
There was actually a
Harvard physician--

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.150
this is no kidding--

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.860
who argued that
higher education made

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.800
women infertile because
it swelled their brains

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.990
at the expense of their wombs.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.220
And people accepted that, or
some version of that viewpoint,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.800
about the pointlessness,
really, of giving women

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.060
too much education.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.450
And so schools like Goucher
and the Seven Sisters schools,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.340
many of which are
here in Massachusetts,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.130
were founded to tilt
against that viewpoint.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.290
To show that women
deserved an education

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.750
and that women could succeed
in a difficult learning

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.450
environment.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.360
So these were very
academically ambitious schools

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.610
that were founded to
educate young women.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.280
And the women on this
platform were more unusual

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.140
than they would
even have realized,

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.190
in the sense that, at this
time, only 4% of American women

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.010
achieved a four-year
college degree.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.640
And one reason for that was
because of this attitude

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.350
that it wasn't
necessarily good for women

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.390
to become over-educated,
and of course

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.870
because so many campuses in that
day were still closed to women.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.300
The Ivy League was
largely closed to women.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.030
My home state of Virginia--
the University of Virginia

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.630
actually held out for as long as
it could, into the late 1960s,

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.580
before it would award a full
four-year degree to women.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.540
And so there were many campuses
that were closed to women

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.030
and there were many
families, particularly

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.500
coming out of the
Depression, that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.020
were reluctant to pay
the tuition for a girl

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.920
to go to college.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.410
Because even if a young
woman was very motivated

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.260
and did very well,
in terms of jobs

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.980
that were available after
graduation, really the only job

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.260
a woman could count
on upon graduating

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.960
from a fine institution
was teaching school.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.540
And that's great if you
want to be a school teacher,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.240
but if you want to be an
engineer or an architect

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.030
or a lawyer or a physician,
if you're a woman,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.060
you would largely be shut
out of those graduate schools

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.650
and those business networks.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.290
So many families would
do the calculation

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.470
and conclude that it wasn't
worthwhile to educate

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.970
a daughter.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.370
But one reason
that a family might

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.940
decide to send a girl to a
girl's school like Goucher

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.089
would be so she could get
the proverbial MRS degree.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.150
So that she could date
and hopefully marry

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.550
a young man attending a
neighboring men's school,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.160
like, in this case, Johns
Hopkins or Annapolis,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.300
the Naval Academy, which was
20 miles away from Goucher.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.970
And so I've interviewed
many of the young women

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.340
on this platform, or
some of them at least,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.590
and they recall a lot of dating
and also enormous pressure

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.770
to get married.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.450
And so they experienced
sort of the twin pressures

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.840
of wanting to do well and
prove that women deserve

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.540
to be educated but
knowing that they

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.290
were under a lot of pressure
to get married by graduation.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.360
And so, just to show
you, for example,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.570
how strong this pressure
was, at Wellesley College

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.950
in Massachusetts, the
yearbook in the class of '42

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.390
actually had a section
naming all of the young women

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.360
who were engaged to be married
and who they were engaged

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.240
to be married to,
as well as names

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.850
of women who had left
before graduation in order

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.160
to get married and
who they had married.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.930
So that's how intense the
pressure was to get married.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.500
That's why they had
rituals like the May court

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.260
to symbolize that they were
being ushered into the marriage

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.902
market.

00:05:28.902 --> 00:05:30.360
Wellesley at the
time had something

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.280
called the senior
class hoop role,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.720
and the lore around
the hoop role

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.130
was that the winner
of that would

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.200
be the class' first bride.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.540
What I love about
this particular photo,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.540
though, is it shows how
the world was changing

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.060
and how the trajectory
of these women's lives

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.070
was about to change enormously.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.130
So if you look at this young
woman where the cursor is,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.160
her name was Jacqueline Jenkins.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.950
Later on, after she
married, after the war,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.950
her married name would be
Jacqueline Jenkins Nye,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.860
mother of Bill Nye,
the Science Guy,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.100
so you can get a sense of
her intellectual chops.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.040
And this was her good
friend, Gwynneth Gminder.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.900
And these two young
women had already

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.110
been secretly tapped
by the US Navy

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.720
to learn how to
become code breakers.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.650
So they were being ushered
into an arcane field

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.200
that nobody in the
United States would

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.170
have heard of at that time.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.120
Code making and code
breaking, as you may know--

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.110
many people in this room might
have indulged in it at some

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.240
point in your lives or now--

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.520
it's an impulse that
goes back really

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.650
to the beginning of
human communication,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.690
as long as we've been
able to write and speak.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.520
We have, at some point, had the
urge to communicate secretly

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.370
with somebody using
a code or cipher

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.780
that nobody else can break.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.670
And if you don't believe
that this is true,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.460
when I speak to elementary
school audiences

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.100
and I ask those kids
how many people in that

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.290
classroom have
made a secret code

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.210
or cipher at some
point in their lives,

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:05.490
every hand goes up because it's
also a really universal impulse

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.010
that children feel to
communicate without adults

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.080
being able to listen in.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.435
So Julius Caesar had a cipher.

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:13.560
You might have heard of it.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.260
You would move a letter four
spaces ahead in the alphabet

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.760
and substitute that
letter-- that's

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.470
called a substitution cipher.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.260
As you may know, the mark
of a good code and cipher

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.750
is that ease of use
between the people

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.060
who know the system
and unbreakability

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.310
by the rest of the world.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.180
So the cipher that Caesar used
would satisfy the ease of use

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.300
but not the unbreakability in
terms of the rest of the world.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.300
That's a pretty easy
cipher, actually, to break.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.420
So these young women
were being ushered

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.850
into a field that has
existed since the dawn

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:48.990
of communication.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.750
That was very familiar
in Europe for centuries

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.840
before this time because
of diplomatic intrigue,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.050
because of wars between
European countries and kingdoms.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:59.520
But in the United
States, we were

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.000
more naive about what was
called listening in or reading

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.950
other gentlemen's mail.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.290
We were reluctant
before the war to do it,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.300
but we were having to learn
to do it pretty quickly.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.020
And so these young women--
these two young women,

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.330
along with about a dozen
other Goucher classmates,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.300
were being secretly trained
in a locked classroom

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.760
at the top of Goucher Hall,
taught by a Naval officer

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.810
as well as an English
professor named Ola Winslow.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.780
Nobody on this
platform knew that they

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.750
were being prepared for a
completely different future

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.250
than the one that had
been envisioned for them.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.565
Their families didn't know,
their brothers didn't know,

00:08:35.565 --> 00:08:37.440
their boyfriends didn't
know, their roommates

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.419
didn't know that they
were secretly training

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.358
to become Naval code breakers.

00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:42.900
And the reason that
those young women

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.730
had been tapped to learn how
to do this work of course

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.900
was because on
December 7, 1941, we

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.910
were attacked at Pearl Harbor.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.890
It was a surprise attack.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.780
Our fleet was anchored
in Pearl Harbor.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.760
The goal of the Japanese was
to destroy our Pacific fleet

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.830
and to drive us to our knees.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.560
It had the opposite
effect, of course.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.820
It galvanized the
American public.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.880
Every young man wanted
to sign up to fight.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.270
And so the attack
at Pearl Harbor

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:16.530
was the galvanizing event that
propelled us into World War II.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.140
We declared war on
Japan the next day.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.390
Germany declares war on
us several days later.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.390
And all of a sudden,
we were in what was

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.790
called at the time total war.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.140
Global war.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.730
All of a sudden,
men are shipping out

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.340
on aircraft carriers
in the Pacific Ocean,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.620
on convoys going across
the Atlantic Ocean

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.780
to Europe and to North
Africa, and so we are suddenly

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.530
at war at exactly the time
when we understand just how

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.560
unprepared we are in terms
of our intelligence gathering

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.800
abilities, because the other
thing that Pearl Harbor was

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.270
was a massive
intelligence failure.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.300
So I'm from the
Washington DC area.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.390
We take for granted that
we have 17 intelligence

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.310
agencies in Washington now.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.210
We had none of that at the
beginning of World War II,

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.420
when we are suddenly sending
so many young American men

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.740
into harm's way.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.890
We have been reminded or we
have been sort of woken up

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:15.950
to our inability to anticipate
what the enemy is going to do.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.530
Pearl Harbor was a terrible
surprise, particularly

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.680
to the US military,
particularly to the US Navy,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.630
and heads are going
to roll as a result

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.950
of that terrible surprise.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.220
And so what will
happen in Washington DC

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.780
is that we will
start to very try

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.450
to quickly build up our
intelligence gathering

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.500
operation.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.050
The Office of Strategic
Services will be formed.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.100
Our first really spy network,
which will become the CIA,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.210
but it takes time to build a spy
network in foreign countries.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.140
And what we could learn
how to do much more quickly

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:53.180
was intercept enemy signals and
learn how to break the enemy

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.630
code systems.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.260
So if you've seen
"The Imitation Game,"

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.700
you're familiar
with at least one

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.280
of these code systems,
which is the cipher that's

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.380
being generated by
the Enigma machine

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.700
that the Germans are using.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.000
All of the German
military services,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.380
particularly the U Boats,
we are concerned about.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.470
Admiral Donitz is communicating
with every U Boat,

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.480
using enciphered
communications that

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.670
have been scrambled by
the Enigma machine that

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.680
is in every U Boat.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.110
And so that's just an
example of one system that's

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.820
being used during the war.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.900
And just to give you a sense of
how many enciphered and encoded

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.390
systems are now racing
through the airwaves,

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.850
if you think of how
many communications

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.790
you send through
the air every day--

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.097
emails, tweets, Instagrams,
Facebook updates,

00:11:38.097 --> 00:11:39.680
everything that you
send all day long.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.930
You might be sending them now.

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.380
If you are, it's fine.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.990
But you can imagine, you
know, if you individually

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.960
are sending this many messages,
think about during World War

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:53.390
II, this far-flung war in which
enemy commanders are having

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.000
to communicate over thousands
of miles with the people

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.140
that they command.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.313
Admiral Donitz is communicating
with every U Boat.

00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:00.980
Some of the boats are
thousands of-- you

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.760
know, 100,000 miles
away from his command.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.030
And so all of these enciphered
and encoded communication

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.700
systems are traveling
through the airwaves.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.760
Radio waves.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.850
They are being encoded
and enciphered,

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.750
sent generally using
Morse code, and that

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.180
is what we have to learn how
to snatch out of the airwaves

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.320
and decipher in order that there
not be another Pearl Harbor

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.860
attack as we are sending our
young men into harm's way.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.800
So the US Navy knows
that it has to ramp up

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.825
practically overnight.

00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:33.200
It has to, as we
would say today,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.910
scale up its code-breaking
force practically overnight.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.340
And it has to do this at
exactly the moment when

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.740
the young men it
would normally recruit

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.630
to learn how to do
this work are suddenly

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:47.120
unavailable because
they're fighting.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.400
And so the Navy
before World War II

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.470
had a very small
code-breaking bureau.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.500
It was not a prestigious
occupation in the US Navy.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.840
You can imagine, if you're
a career Naval officer,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.430
you want to be
commanding a ship.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.210
You want to be out
there on the ocean.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:02.180
So there was a very
small code-breaking force

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.590
and there were
monthly memos that

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.640
were generated to say where they
were getting the sort of minds

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.410
that they needed in order to
learn how to do this work.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:12.980
So this was-- when I was doing
my research at the National

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.950
Archives, I looked through
these monthly memos.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.930
And normally, before
the war, the Navy

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.517
would have turned to MIT.

00:13:19.517 --> 00:13:20.850
It would have turned to Harvard.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.892
It would turn to places--

00:13:21.892 --> 00:13:23.960
the Ivy League-- to
find young men who

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.040
were trainable to do this work.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.870
And you can see in this memo,
the light bulb moment going on

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.210
over some Naval
bureaucrat's head.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.860
Since the young men
are unavailable to us,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.150
let's see what these
educated young women can do.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.080
So you see, I've circled "new
source, women's colleges."

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.480
The light bulb moment goes on.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.720
Let us try these educated and
trained young women who have

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.890
been at these great schools.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.307
They've had Latin, they've had
Greek, they've had physics,

00:13:51.307 --> 00:13:53.230
they've had math,
they've had English.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.570
You know, they had this really
great liberal arts education.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.110
So let's see if they
can serve the nation.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.930
And so young women at
Goucher, as well as

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.120
all of the Seven
Sisters colleges--

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.480
Wellesley, Smith,
Radcliffe, Bryn Mawr--

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.180
young women would be secretly
identified by their math

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.440
and astronomy professors.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.040
They were being invited in one
by one to secret conferences.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.780
It was like a Harry Potter
moment for these young women,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.600
when you get the letter.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.040
And so they would be invited in.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.750
They would be asked
two questions--

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.940
do you like crossword
puzzles and are

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.880
you engaged to be married.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.840
And if they answered yes to
the first and no to the second,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.170
then they would be invited to
take a secret correspondence

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.840
course that the US
Navy had developed

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.670
to train its cryptographers.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.730
To train its cryptanalysts
and code breakers.

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:45.830
And they would come
to Washington DC--

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.823
this first cohort of
women who would train all

00:14:48.823 --> 00:14:50.990
during their senior year,
at the same time that they

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.180
were doing all the academic
work they need to graduate.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.630
They would come to Washington
at exactly the moment when

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.810
we understand in a major way
how important code breaking is

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.850
going to be to the
outcome of this war.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.680
And keep in mind
that in 1942, it

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.680
was not foreordained that we
were going to win World War II.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.900
That the Allies were
going to win World War II.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.370
It looked very bleak, right?

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.240
All of Europe now is occupied
or is an Axis country.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.870
Japan is a very, very
formidable foe in the Pacific.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.750
So we do not anticipate that
we're going to win this war.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.820
It's a very, very scary moment.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.260
And so the women, after they
graduate in June of 1942,

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.720
they are exhorted by the US
Navy to come to Washington

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.927
as soon as they can.

00:15:31.927 --> 00:15:33.510
There are so many
of them that they're

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.240
sitting on upturned
waste baskets in the very

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.670
crowded central Naval facility.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.710
And in June of '42,
if you've heard

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.620
of any battle in World
War II, any sea battle,

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.780
you probably heard of
the Battle of Midway.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.480
And that was a very important
battle in the Pacific

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.780
that turned on our ability to
break the Japanese naval fleet

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.690
code.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.380
And the reason that we knew
how that fleet code worked

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.970
was because a woman named Agnes
Driscoll, a math and music

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.660
teacher from Texas, had been a
civilian working in the Navy's

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.600
code-breaking bureau
and she had diagnosed

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.990
that the Japanese naval
fleet code consisted

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.630
of five-digit code groups.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.250
Might stand for,
let's say, destroyer.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.220
Five digits.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.540
And then they would add--

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.570
to encipher that
code group, they

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:25.410
would add five digits
to that code group

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.300
to encipher each digit, right?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.280
To change each digit
using something

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.380
called non-carrying addition.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.950
Agnes Driscoll had spent
the 1930s figuring out

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.870
how the Japanese system worked.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:39.330
The reason that we weren't
able to read those messages

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.910
right before Pearl Harbor
was because the Japanese had

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.360
changed their code books,
as they did periodically,

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.860
and then we would have to start
all over again, figuring out

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:48.330
what the code group stood for.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.150
But we were back
in by June of 1942.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.360
The Japanese had
set out to ambush us

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.840
on the island of Midway and
finish off our Pacific fleet.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.250
We read those messages.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:02.040
We were waiting to
ambush the ambushers.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.047
We defeated the Japanese
in the three-day sea

00:17:04.047 --> 00:17:05.880
battle that's now one
of the most famous sea

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.290
battles of all time.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.000
And all of a sudden,
it's understood

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.540
that code breaking is no longer
an obscure, unprestigious

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.300
occupation.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.240
It's going to be
central to victory

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.900
in both theaters of war.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.319
And so the women are
pouring into Washington

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.079
at exactly the moment when
we understand how important

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.579
their work is going to be.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.119
So just to give you a sense
of the division of labor

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.940
when we enter the war, if you've
seen "The Imitation Game,"

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.410
you know that the
British, thanks

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.070
to Alan Turing and a
large code-breaking force,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.400
have diagnosed how the
German Enigma system works.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.680
So the British are going
to be the lead code

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.040
breakers for the Atlantic
Ocean and the European theater,

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.360
at least at the outset.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.940
But we are going to be
a junior partner working

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.100
with them because we
are now at risk, right?

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.800
We're sending all these young
men across the Atlantic.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.490
The convoys are being terribly
menaced by the wolf packs--

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.090
that the U Boats are
sinking our convoys.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.500
But we're going to let the
British take the lead on that,

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.340
at least at first, but we
have lead code-breaking

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.250
responsibility for the
massive Pacific Ocean

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.190
where we have just been terribly
surprised not that long ago.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.070
And so the US Navy
is going to be

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.900
primarily responsible
for breaking

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.638
the Japanese naval fleet code.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:19.680
So that's what those young
women are going to do.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:22.770
But meanwhile, our US
Army has responsibility

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.960
for a completely different
set of codes and ciphers

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.910
being used by the
Japanese Army, which

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.590
is now spread out on all these
islands around the Pacific,

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:30.090
right?

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.620
The Japanese have
taken the Philippines.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:32.430
They've taken Guam.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:33.803
They've taken Wake Island.

00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:35.220
They've taken the
Malay Peninsula.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.290
They've taken all
of these land masses

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.200
and the Japanese Army is
communicating back with Tokyo.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.370
And so our US Army
is ultimately going

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:46.270
to need thousands of code
breakers to break these systems

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.150
and it also needs women.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.990
And so World War II is this
wonderful, terrible moment

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.360
where there is
unparalleled competition

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.960
for the first time for
smart, educated women,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.620
to show what they can do.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.790
So the private sector is going
to start competing for women.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.920
MIT is going to
start taking women

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.950
into its graduate programs
to run its analog computers.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.020
And the US Navy
and the US Army are

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.590
going to start a hot
competition for educated women.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.180
When I was doing my
research, I found

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.490
memos in which the
Navy was pissed off

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.460
because the Army got to Wheaton
College or Connecticut College

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.960
before it got there.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.410
And it argued that the army
was poaching its girls.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.140
So when the US Army
had to figure out

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.450
where it's going to
get its educated women,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.520
it decides to turn to
teachers colleges as well.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.630
These are humbler institutions
where women are being trained

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.070
to become school teachers.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.570
So I'll just show
you because you'll

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.090
hear from her at the
very end, Dorothy Ramale

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:44.550
was training to be a math
teacher at Indiana State

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.800
Teachers College
in Pennsylvania.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.460
To be a math teacher was a
high aspiration for a woman

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.800
because a lot of departments
wouldn't hire women

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.180
as math professors.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.910
This is my central
character, Dot Braden.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.870
She's still alive.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.450
She'll be 99 this June.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.390
So back in 1942, she
was a school teacher

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.280
in Chatham, Virginia.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.910
And what I love about the Army's
recruiting strategy, which

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.730
is different from
the Navy's, the Army

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:15.330
decided that recruiting
secretly at teachers colleges

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.230
wouldn't be enough
for its needs.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.770
So it decided to
massively recruit

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.370
in public, trying to get women
to sign up to do secret war

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.880
work in Washington.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.000
So it decided to recruit
school teachers--

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.170
actual school teachers.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.050
Young, overworked,
underpaid young women

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.600
who by definition
were single, because

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.068
in almost any occupation at
the time, if you were a woman

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:38.610
and you got married, you were
expected to quit and stay home.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.568
And that was certainly
true of school teachers.

00:20:40.568 --> 00:20:42.360
So these women were
the ideal workers.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.193
That's the way we would
think of them today.

00:20:44.193 --> 00:20:46.017
Underpaid, overworked, single.

00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:47.100
They could work full-time.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.660
They could work in the middle
of the night, which they

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.280
would be called upon to do.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.680
And the Army's strategy
to recruit these women

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.250
was to send its handsomest
young Army officers out

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.070
to lurk in post
offices and hotels.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:01.410
Initially, it was confined
to the Southern states

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.600
to a particular
bureaucratic division

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.640
because it was
recruiting civilians.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.680
And so the thinking on
the part of the Army

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.680
was that these young women
would be induced to sign up.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.008
Would be lured to
Washington, hoping

00:21:13.008 --> 00:21:15.300
that they would make a marriage
to a handsome young man

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.520
like the officer who
was recruiting them.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.720
And what I love about
Dot is she shows how

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.200
wrongheaded this strategy was.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:25.380
In fact, in 1942,
Dot was a graduate

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.480
of Randolph Macon
Women's College, which

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:31.150
was a fine women's college in
downtown Lynchburg, Virginia,

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.520
which is where she grew up.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.800
She was the oldest daughter
in a family of four.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.990
Her mother was supporting
the whole family

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.920
as a secretary at
a uniform factory.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.540
Her parents were separated.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.430
Her mom was
supporting the family.

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:47.310
Dot was now working
as a school teacher.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.220
Her income was very important
to the family upkeep.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.130
She had two younger brothers
who were now in the fighting.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.870
Like every young
American woman, she

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.300
wanted to do her part
to bring the boys home.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.760
She also wanted to
get out of a marriage

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.630
that she had been sort of
pressured into entering into.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.140
Her college boyfriend had sent
her a ring-- an engagement ring

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.330
from training camp
in California.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.710
She didn't want to marry him.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.450
She liked him, but
she didn't want

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.783
to spend the rest of
her life with him.

00:22:14.783 --> 00:22:16.200
But she didn't
know how to get out

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.390
of it because women at
the time were told to not

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.250
upset the morale of the troops.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.600
That was a big deal.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.320
Women were entrusted with the
morale of the fighting force

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.870
and so she didn't feel like
she could send the ring back.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.000
But the chance to
go to Washington

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.540
and do unspecified
secret war work

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.607
was a way to get
out of a marriage.

00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:38.190
She wouldn't have to follow him
to training camp in California

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.750
the way that he
was pressuring her.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.540
So I just love the fact
that the recruiting strategy

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.180
was exactly wrongheaded.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.320
Even as she was very
inclined to take this job,

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.660
to sign on the dotted line
and come to Washington,

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.390
her other motivation was
to come to Washington.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.390
Lynchburg, Virginia is three
hours away from Washington DC.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.580
She had never been to
the nation's capital.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:01.350
She grew up during
the Depression.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.730
Her family didn't have a car.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:04.530
She had never seen the big city.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.660
And Washington now is
really the beating heart

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.770
of the free world.

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.750
Along with London,
England, you know,

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.090
it's the major
capital of free city.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.250
So much of Europe
is occupied now.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.370
It would really become the
heart of the Allied war effort,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.870
and the chance to
come to Washington

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.990
and serve that effort was an
enormous opportunity for her

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:24.420
to help bring her
brothers home and also

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.510
to make twice as much money as
she could as a school teacher.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.620
She was making $900 a year
teaching school in Chatham.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.820
She would make $1,600 a year
working as a code breaker.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.870
So in the fall of 1943, she
found herself in Union Station.

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.870
She took a cab to a place
called Arlington Hall.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.290
Before the war, it had been what
they called a junior college,

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.120
which was a thing
back then, again when

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.162
it was thought that it
was best not to give women

00:23:50.162 --> 00:23:51.118
too much education.

00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:53.160
A junior college was a
place where a family could

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.750
send its daughter to board.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:57.270
She could get high
school classes as well as

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.970
a couple years of maybe
college English and French,

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.850
as well as sort of typing and
horseback riding and deportment

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.300
and the kind of skills that
were thought sort of right

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.100
for an upscale young woman.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.640
The US military needed
secure facilities

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.020
for its massive
code-breaking forces,

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.860
so it kicked those girls
out of Arlington Hall.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.450
It moved the code breakers in.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.590
Built temporary buildings.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:24.570
You can see here the school
teachers now being trained.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.910
Here they're learning
the geography of Asia.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:30.420
You can them receiving
intercepted messages

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.440
from the Pacific.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.990
And you can see how
big these rooms were.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.590
Former school teachers coming
now to work for the war effort.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.030
And what Dot still has a hard
time getting her mind around

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.180
is that she became part
of one of the three most

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.940
important code-breaking
successes of World War II.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.400
And she didn't even understand
the importance of the work

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.750
that she was doing.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.790
So two of them, you've
already heard of.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.560
Our breaking of the
German Enigma cipher

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.875
was one of the most important
code-breaking triumphs.

00:24:57.875 --> 00:25:00.000
We've heard of that because
of "The Imitation Game"

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.560
and because of places like
Bletchley Park that exist now

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.240
as museums.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.100
The Battle of Midway
and our breaking

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.280
of the Japanese naval
fleet code was number two.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.290
But number three, which you
don't hear as much about,

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:15.610
was our breaking of the
super-enciphered system being

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.550
used by the Japanese Army to
communicate with its supply

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.430
ships.

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.120
So the Japanese Army
spread out on these islands

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.500
around the Pacific.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.460
Everything that's brought
to them-- food, fuel,

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.770
reinforcement
troops, replacement

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.310
parts for aircraft-- it all
has to be brought by ship.

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.990
These are former
commercial ships

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:37.540
that have been now commandeered
by the Japanese Army.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.280
They're called [? marus. ?]

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.670
They are traveling around
the Pacific and other bodies

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.170
of water.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:43.990
They're communicating
with their Central

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.810
Command what they're carrying,
where they're headed for.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.290
We are intercepting
all of those messages.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.000
They're being sent back
to the school teachers.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.470
So it's 242 school
teachers, including

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:59.080
Dot Braden, who are
breaking those messages

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.420
systems as fast as they could.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.450
Dot remembers running to the
Overlapper station, which

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.910
was the next station of what
was basically an assembly line.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.370
The women would
break the message

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.160
as fast as they could so that
the contents could be radioed

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.200
to an American
submarine commander who

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.100
would be waiting on the horizon
when the supply ship appeared.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.790
As a result of how fast and
well the school teachers worked

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.700
and how well the submarine
commanders did their job,

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.520
we sank thousands and
thousands of supply ships

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.040
to the point where most
Japanese Army deaths were

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.230
the result of
starvation and disease

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.820
because they weren't getting
the supplies that they needed.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.820
So that's how
important the messages

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.340
were that Dot was breaking.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.170
Again, these slides
just give you

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.290
a sense of how massive
the operation was.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:46.150
I'll just talk very
quickly about one

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:50.410
more system to give you a sense
of how many systems there were.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.970
This group of
women were breaking

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.575
the cipher system being
used by Japanese diplomats.

00:26:55.575 --> 00:26:56.950
They were using
a machine that we

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:01.090
called Purple to scramble
the romanized letters

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.290
of a Japanese transmission.

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.050
So this might seem
counterintuitive,

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.110
but Japanese diplomats are
stationed in Europe, right?

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.360
They're stationed in Germany,
they're in Vichy France,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.210
they're in occupied
France, they're in Italy.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.560
They're all over Europe.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.350
They're communicating with
Hitler and with Mussolini

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.290
and with all of the Axis
leaders and they're reporting it

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.590
all back to Tokyo in
very, very detailed,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.360
wordy diplomatic messages.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.990
We were reading every single
one of those messages thanks

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.810
to a woman named Genevieve
Grotjan, a graduate

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.780
of the University of
Buffalo, who before the war

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.270
had the key insight
that enabled us to break

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.490
that machine-generated cipher.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.520
She had been unable to find
any university willing to hire

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.380
a female math
teacher, so she had

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.600
been hired by the
Army's very small

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.730
pre-war code-breaking
bureau and had

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:51.220
the central insight
that allowed us

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.900
to break that machine cipher.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.690
And just to give you a sense of
how valuable this intelligence

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:58.360
was, when the Japanese
diplomats were invited

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.980
to tour the coast of France--

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.160
they were invited to see
Hitler's Atlantic wall.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.610
His fortifications along
the coast of France.

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.860
They reported back where
it was well-fortified,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.230
where it wasn't, so that when
we were planning the D-Day

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.500
landings, we knew that Normandy
would be a better place

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.840
to invade than a better
fortified spotlight

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.090
like Calais.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.270
So again, that's the
quality of the intelligence

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.030
that was being produced by
these code encipher systems.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:27.010
Again, you can
see how many women

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:32.200
and how exclusively female
many of these rooms were.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.510
There was also an
African-American code-breaking

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.830
unit for the Army.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.010
So the US Army was segregated
during World War II.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.370
So was the Army's civilian
code-breaking force.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.670
But there was a group of
African-American code breakers,

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.260
again, who had
achieved their college

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:51.550
education despite enormous
barriers in a segregated school

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.550
system.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.310
And they were working
the codes enciphered

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:55.270
to the private sector.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.400
So that will be familiar
to you at Google,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.640
familiar to everybody who does
any kind of transaction online.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.850
Just today as we hope that
our financial transactions are

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.970
enciphered after we
make them and encrypted,

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.276
which is our modern
word for encipherment,

00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:13.540
so too were banks and companies
encrypting their communications

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.630
during the war.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:19.062
And so this group was assigned
to the codes enciphered

00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.770
to the private sector
to make sure nobody

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:22.990
was doing business with
Hitler or doing business

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.150
with Japanese companies
like Mitsubishi.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.370
So that was very
important work as well.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.950
So, just quickly,
the Navy women.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.170
So the women on that
platform, graduating

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.050
from Goucher in their
frilly white dresses,

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.710
are now working for the US
Navy and they are actually

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.850
in the US Navy.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.250
So this is another
tipping point for women.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.040
World War II sees the
creation of the WAVES,

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.520
Women Accepted for
Volunteer Emergency Service.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.810
Other branches of the military
will create female divisions

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:53.600
as well.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.500
And so the Navy decides that it
wants its female code-breakers

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.210
to actually be in
uniform and to be

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.200
subject to military hierarchy.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.537
So the women are sent back.

00:30:01.537 --> 00:30:03.120
They're actually
sent to Smith College

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.000
to Officers Training Camp and
they will return to Washington

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.560
as full Naval officers.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.350
And also this is a great
moment because women

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.590
who haven't had the benefit
of a college education

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.080
can enlist in the US Navy.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.440
And if they test high for
aptitude, their math abilities,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.060
or their language
abilities, then they

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:25.210
will also be routed into
the code-breaking operation.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:30.020
So ultimately the US Navy
will have 4,000 women working.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.730
This is a facility that is on
Nebraska Avenue in Washington

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:34.930
DC.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:37.540
It was also a girls' school
and they kicked the women out.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.570
They built barracks.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.660
They moved the female
naval code-breakers in.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.650
You can see again how female
these code-breaking offices are

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.340
and you can see the camaraderie
of the women working

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.070
in these offices.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.690
And just a quick
anecdote because it's

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.948
one of my favorite
anecdotes, to give you

00:30:54.948 --> 00:30:56.740
a sense of what it was
like for these women

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.210
to come together from
all over the country,

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:05.350
ultimately, one of the women
in my book, Jane Case Tuttle,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.020
remembers enlisting
in the US Navy.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.950
And she was actually
the daughter

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.440
of a very affluent family.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.170
Her dad was a physicist,
Theodore Case,

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.800
and she thought when she
enlisted in the US Navy

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.930
that she would be made a
Naval officer because she

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.180
came from such an elite family.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.100
Her family didn't want
her to join the Navy.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.620
It was considered somewhat
scandalous for young women

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.030
to go into the
military at first.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.800
Some people thought
they were bad girls.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.630
But she very much wanted
to join the war effort

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:35.410
and so she took the
subway from the Upper East

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.960
Side of Manhattan down to
a Naval recruiting station

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.390
around Wall Street.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.430
And she knew that
going in as an officer,

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.230
she would have to
take an eye exam,

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.690
and she was very
nearsighted, and so she

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.990
had memorized the eye chart
and she slipped her spectacles

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.840
into her pocket and she
passed the eye exam.

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.340
But then she had
to go around to all

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.100
of these other medical
stations to sort of get

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.870
basically the equivalent
of a physical,

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.745
and she got to the place
where the women were

00:32:00.745 --> 00:32:04.420
told to strip down and disrobe
because men joining the US Navy

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.510
had to undergo a
group naked physical

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.830
and so the women had to as well.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.040
And so Jane had gone
to a very fancy women's

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.500
boarding school-- girl's
school on the Upper East Side.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.380
She had never seen another
woman without her clothes on.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.263
The word "breast" was never
uttered at her fancy school.

00:32:22.263 --> 00:32:23.680
So she had to take
her clothes off

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.853
and then a petty
officer came up and drew

00:32:25.853 --> 00:32:27.520
a number between her
breasts, the number

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.367
nine in red marker
between her breasts.

00:32:29.367 --> 00:32:31.450
And said, all right, now
go stand between 8 and 10

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.440
for your physical.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.650
And Jane was so nearsighted
that she not only

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.450
had to really look
at the other women

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.883
but she had to really get
up close and peer in order

00:32:39.883 --> 00:32:41.800
to figure out where she
was supposed to stand.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.720
So that was her
welcome to the US Navy.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.670
She's never forgotten it.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.710
And her other
welcome was that she

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.630
thought she would
go in as an officer,

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.090
but because she
was a graduate of--

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.270
I believe it's called the Longy
Music School here, actually,

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.690
in the Boston area, that was
not considered by the Navy

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:00.500
the equivalent of
a college degree,

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.250
so she went in as what was
called an ordinary seaman.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:05.060
As an enlisted woman.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.930
So she had to actually live
in the barracks along with all

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.160
of the other enlisted
women and she loved it.

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.130
It was the great
moment of her life.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.200
Getting out of sort
of debutante society

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.280
and being able to live alongside
and work alongside women

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.710
from all over the country.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.480
It was an incredibly
important moment for her.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.810
She recalls working
in these rooms

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.830
with incredible pride, which
was true of all of these women.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.810
In fact, this is
a quote from Jane,

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.210
"We could tell what was
happening in the Pacific

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.050
because the stack
would get larger."

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.550
So you can see the Japanese
naval messages piled up

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.180
on these women's desks.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.850
They are breaking
these naval messages

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:45.910
as fast as they can because they
know that we are pushing back

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.200
across the Pacific.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.720
Of course the ultimate goal
is to retake the Philippines

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.380
and then possibly attack
the Japanese mainland.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.780
And so the women know that
their brothers and boyfriends

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:56.440
are out there.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.740
In some cases, they're breaking
messages that foretell the fate

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.140
of their brothers' and
boyfriends' ships and they want

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.680
to do everything they can.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.610
They have to do a lot
of triage to determine

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.650
which are the most
important messages

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.110
and then move them along
as fast as they can.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.659
You can see-- this is just
a worksheet that I found

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.159
in the National Archives--

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:17.230
you can see that they're
working this five-digit

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.850
super-enciphered system.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.100
So they're doing the
brain work in order

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.219
to subtract out
the encipherment,

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.290
reversing the false math--

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.920
the non-carrying addition
that's been used.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.067
They're having to
reverse-engineer that in order

00:34:33.067 --> 00:34:35.484
to get down to the code group
and then tell what that code

00:34:35.484 --> 00:34:37.942
group stands for in order to
know what the ship is carrying

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:39.080
and where it's going to be.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.480
And so these are
just some worksheets

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.310
that I found in the
National Archives that

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:43.750
show the brain work.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.480
And again, just very
briefly, we will eventually

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.159
take over the Atlantic
breaking of the Enigma cipher

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.840
from the British.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.420
So the Germans get suspicious
that we have broken the Enigma

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:02.710
cipher, as we have, and the
German Navy makes its Enigma

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.750
machines more complicated.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:06.130
It adds a rotor.

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.600
There were three
rotors originally

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.250
to scramble the German messages.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.930
They add a fourth rotor.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:14.470
And so the British machines
that Alan Turing helped design

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.040
no longer work well enough
to break those systems.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.380
So we build these
faster, bigger machines

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.400
at a factory in Dayton, Ohio.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.430
They're secretly transported
to Washington DC, where

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.580
we take over Atlantic
Ocean code breaking,

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.530
and it's pretty much
exclusively being

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.750
done by women, who
were designing really

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:37.430
the equivalent of
early computer menus.

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.330
They're looking at a
scrambled German message,

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:44.290
they are conjecturing where in
that message a German phrase

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.180
like [? "Biskaya ?]
[? wetter," ?] "weather

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.610
in the Bay of
Biscay," might appear.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.400
And then they're doing
the mental brain work

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.190
to think, all right,
what loop would

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.480
turn this letter into this
letter and then this letter

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.960
into this letter, and so
they're designing basically

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.430
early computer
menus that will then

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.830
be plugged into
those machines to see

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.250
if they are a plausible
what's called key setting.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.290
And then, if it is
plausible, they'll

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.780
plug the message into a smaller
machine that's basically

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:12.820
the equivalent of the Enigma.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.770
If it produces an
actual German messages,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.090
they know they've got it right.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:18.940
That will be translated by
women who will then take it

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.960
to the room where another group
of women, mostly the Goucher

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.610
women, are maintaining
these huge wall

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.700
maps showing all of the U
Boats and their locations.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.440
They'll write up
intelligence reports

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.630
for naval headquarters,
generating intelligence

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:33.293
reports, and as
a result of that,

00:36:33.293 --> 00:36:35.710
and of course the work that
was being done on the Atlantic

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.170
Ocean by submarine
commanders, we

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:40.960
clear the Atlantic
Ocean of the U Boats

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.810
so that we can send the mass
of thousands and thousands

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:47.080
of convoy ships necessary
to mount the D-Day invasion

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.550
and begin to liberate Europe.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.980
And this group of women
actually were reading the U Boat

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.120
messages as the Germans were
looking out on the English

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.870
Channel on the morning
of June 6, 1944

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:01.510
and they're seeing the
Allied invasion as it starts.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:04.540
And the women experienced
the landing that way.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.290
And so, again, that shows
you how crucially important

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.660
the women's contribution
was to the war effort.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.210
The kind of intelligence that
they were generating that

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.040
was used by our military.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.250
These are just some photos
of their brief free time

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:18.930
in Washington.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:22.810
That's my central character,
Dot, behind a pole there.

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.090
The women were writing
letters incessantly

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.340
to keep up morale to
the men whose lives they

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.630
were trying to save.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.240
My central character, Dot,
would disentangle herself

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.160
from her college boyfriend.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.070
And she was writing at one
point about a half-dozen men.

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.870
She was more
reluctant to have that

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.378
go into the book than the fact
of her secret code-breaking.

00:37:40.378 --> 00:37:41.920
She was a little
embarrassed that she

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.040
was writing so many guys.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.485
But in fact, that was really
quite common at the time.

00:37:46.485 --> 00:37:48.610
And the women were sending
a lot of photos as well.

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:50.320
Sort of the
equivalent of selfies

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.530
they were sending, again to keep
up morale to the men overseas.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:56.080
She would make a best friend,
a former school teacher

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.490
from Bourbon, Mississippi.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.860
Remember, this was
top secret work.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.350
The women were told they
would be shot if they told

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.890
anybody what they were doing.

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.320
So even though
both of these women

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:07.570
were working on the Japanese
supply ship code-breaking

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.910
effort, they never talked
about it to each other.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.410
They didn't even
know that they were

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:13.210
part of the same
code-breaking effort.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.210
But their friendship was
so strong after the war

00:38:16.210 --> 00:38:18.340
that they remained
close friends.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.350
You can see Dot in
the striped shirt.

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.070
Her husband, the soldier
she was writing, Jim Bruce.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.030
And that's her friend, Ruth
Weston from Mississippi.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.970
Ruth would go on to work for
the NSA as a mathematician.

00:38:30.970 --> 00:38:34.060
So the National Security
Agency is our descendant agency

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:36.910
of our successful World
War II code breaking.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.460
Ruth would work as a
mathematician for NSA

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.960
until she became pregnant.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.140
And then I found her
hand-written resignation note

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:46.653
from the 1950s, "I
resign my position

00:38:46.653 --> 00:38:48.820
as a mathematician with the
NSA because I'm expected

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.750
to be home with my children."

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.260
And so after the war,
basically the women

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.630
were told, in secret
letters, thanks very much

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.590
for your service.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.560
Now get back home
to the kitchen.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:04.240
And most of them did leave
and go back to private life,

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.140
either immediately
or eventually.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:08.260
When they had children,
they were expected

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.070
to leave the workforce again.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:13.870
But their friendships
remained so powerfully strong

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.770
that actually, when Ruth Weston
was engaged to her husband who

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.100
you saw in that photo,
she invited Dot up to--

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.600
and her husband
basically to vet him

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.520
because she wouldn't
agree to marry him

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.440
until Dot had given the OK.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.450
And this is a group of
naval enlisted women

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.320
who remained such close
friends after the war

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.680
that they had a chain letter
going between their friendship

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.340
group.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.510
And that chain letter
kept going for 75 years.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.220
Till, when I was
doing my reporting,

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.920
the woman in the
front, Ruth Mirsky,

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.260
was ultimately the
only one of them left.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.750
And her email sign-on
is Ruth the Wave.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.320
So even though she could
never talk about her service

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.350
and never got credit
for it anywhere,

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.830
her identity as a
naval enlisted woman

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.210
and as a naval code breaker
remained that important to her

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:05.890
that her email sign-on
would be Ruth the Wave.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:07.850
And so I want to leave
time for questions

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.770
so I'm just going to show
two videos that will just

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.470
let you hear the voices
of the women themselves.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.270
And I have others that
are on my website.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:16.603
They're actually all on YouTube.

00:40:16.603 --> 00:40:19.650
So you all can easily enough
listen to the other women

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.200
as well.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.566
So this is Dot talking about
her train ride to Washington.

00:40:23.566 --> 00:40:25.340
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:32.300
- With my two suitcases, my
umbrella, and my raincoat,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.640
I went down to the train.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.690
Now my uncle had to
take me down there.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.310
No car.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:44.300
And my mother and her
sister were standing there

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.610
crying when I got on the train.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.640
I was very secure
that everything

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.250
was going to be just fine.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.512
Washington would receive
me with open arms.

00:40:57.512 --> 00:40:58.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:00.100
LIZA MUNDY: And of course
her welcome to Washington

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.642
was being told that
she would be shot

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:04.120
if she disclosed the nature of
the work that she was doing.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.620
And so I just want to
finish and let you hear

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.120
the voice of Dorothy Ramale.

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.250
You saw her photo earlier
in the presentation.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.230
She was the aspiring
math teacher.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.080
She was called in by the Dean
of Women at her Teachers College

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.540
and asked to take the Army's
correspondence course.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.790
And she gives you the
sense of why the women were

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.470
so motivated to do this work.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:23.200
She remembers seeing
all the men in her math

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.630
class rounded up and put on
a bus to go off to fight.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:32.942
And she recalls sort of
the emotion of that moment.

00:41:32.942 --> 00:41:34.280
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.035
- A bus came and it was at
2 o'clock in the morning

00:41:40.035 --> 00:41:45.312
that the Army sent
a bus to get these--

00:41:45.312 --> 00:41:47.760
oh, I don't know.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.440
It seemed to me it
was all the men.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:58.060
That there were no men left
in the college at that time.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:02.430
They all had to go, I
think to Pittsburgh.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:06.840
You see, since I was
taking mathematics,

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:13.010
I thought at the time I
was one of maybe two girls

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.250
were in the classes, you see.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:22.292
So I knew so many of the fellows
that were going on that bus.

00:42:26.912 --> 00:42:28.720
I'll never forget it.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.620
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:31.390
LIZA MUNDY: And what I also
love about Dorothy Ramale

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.830
is that she became
a math teacher

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:35.810
after the war at the public
middle school in Arlington,

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.380
Virginia that my own
children would later attend.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.290
And so that's an example of
how these women continued

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.000
to walk among us,
without getting

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.800
any credit for what they did.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.260
And I love the thought of
all of these middle-schoolers

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.710
taking Ms. Ramale's Algebra
1 or algebra 2 class

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.747
and having no idea that
this sweet, kind woman, who

00:42:53.747 --> 00:42:56.080
many of them remember as the
best math teacher they ever

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.800
had, had been a badass code
breaker during World War II.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.620
She was so good at what she did
that the US Navy poached her

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:05.890
from the US Army by offering
an officer's housing allowance.

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:07.900
So she went from the
Japanese supply ship code

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.608
to working the Japanese
naval fleet code.

00:43:09.608 --> 00:43:11.270
That's how good she was.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.900
And so it has really been
the honor of my career

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.425
to get to spend
time and interview

00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:17.050
these women about
their work and to try

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:18.880
to get some
attention to the work

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:22.210
that they did because it was
pioneering code-breaking,

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.420
hacking, and computer
work that they were doing.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:27.280
Cybersecurity,
cyberintelligence.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.750
This is what they were doing.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:31.120
And again, I think of
them as the hidden figures

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.970
of "The Greatest Generation,"
and their contribution

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:36.525
was remarkable.

00:43:36.525 --> 00:43:37.900
I mean, it helped
us win the war.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:41.920
After the war, the estimates
was that code-breaking shortened

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.410
the war by at least a
year, probably more,

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.345
and save thousands of
lives on all sides.

00:43:46.345 --> 00:43:50.000
You know, Axis and Allied lives
because the war was shortened.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
And so I have time to
take a couple of questions

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.292
if you have time before you
go back to your workplaces.

00:43:54.292 --> 00:43:57.010
I'd be happy to field any
questions that you have.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.224
Thanks for listening.

00:43:58.224 --> 00:44:00.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:02.398 --> 00:44:04.190
AUDIENCE: Given that
their work was secret,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.202
I'm curious, at what point were
they allowed to speak about it?

00:44:07.202 --> 00:44:09.660
And did you have any trouble
getting them to talk about it?

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.440
LIZA MUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.430
Thank you for asking.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:14.000
So this story of wartime
World War II code-breaking

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.120
began to leak out as memoirs and
histories began to be written.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.990
And so at a certain
point in the early 1990s,

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.570
the story was
officially declassified,

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.640
but nobody tracked
down the women

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.430
and told them that
it was OK to talk.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.880
So there were more than 10,000
women who did this work.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.640
Most of them carried the
secret to their graves.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:38.780
When I was trying to talk
Dot Braden into telling me

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.220
her story, it took
me about a half

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.550
an hour to persuade
her that it was finally

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.550
OK to talk because nobody
had given them the go-ahead.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:48.485
So that's why they
didn't get credit.

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:51.710
But she wanted to tell her
story, because after the war,

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.960
both of her brothers survived
the war and both of them

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.450
had top-secret security
clearances in their work

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:57.140
after the war.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:59.607
And they would get together
and brag about their clearances

00:44:59.607 --> 00:45:01.190
and Dot could never
tell them that she

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.870
had a top-secret security
clearance as well.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.018
So that's how frustrating
it sometimes was.

00:45:06.018 --> 00:45:08.060
AUDIENCE: I assume most
of the messages that they

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.060
were decoding would be
in German or Japanese

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:11.960
or another language.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.210
Were they also then
having to take language

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.510
training so they could recognize
words when they came up?

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.260
LIZA MUNDY: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:23.910
So the code systems that you
saw that were number groups.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:25.435
So let's say it stood for rice.

00:45:25.435 --> 00:45:27.310
Let's say the code group
stood for, you know,

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:28.010
we're carrying rice.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.840
You didn't have to
necessarily even think

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.010
the Japanese word for rice.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.810
You could think the
English word for rice.

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.685
So some of the systems,
you didn't really

00:45:34.685 --> 00:45:35.810
have to know much Japanese.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:38.230
And the military-- you
know, these supply ships,

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.390
there was a pretty limited
vocabulary that the supply

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.430
ships would be using.

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.120
So they could be taught a
little bit of Japanese--

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.100
the names of islands
and things like that--

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.290
and work with those
numerical code systems.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:51.050
But if it was the
Enigma machine, which

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.660
was scrambling German
messages, or if it

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.170
was the Japanese Purple machine,
which was taking romanized--

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.330
that's essentially
phonetic spelling

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:03.150
of Japanese that is then
scrambled by the machine--

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:06.040
and then what you get at the end
is, again, phonetically spelled

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.920
Japanese.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:08.840
They did need translators.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.850
So if a young woman
from the Seven Sisters

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:13.250
had majored in German,
she would be snatched up

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:14.720
to work at the Enigma unit.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.780
And similarly, there weren't
many people who knew Japanese,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.790
but some people who
did were missionaries.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:21.710
And so graduates
of Bible colleges

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:25.400
would actually be recruited to
work as Japanese translators.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.560
And in fact, the Japanese
surrender message,

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.110
the first person who read
that was a young woman

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:32.640
who was a graduate of Bethany
College in West Virginia.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.190
She had been a
missionary and so she

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.360
was being used as a translator.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.818
So she was the first person
who read the Japanese surrender

00:46:37.818 --> 00:46:39.050
message.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.380
AUDIENCE: I'm curious, what made
you interested in this subject

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:42.890
area?

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.613
Why did you start
to research it?

00:46:44.613 --> 00:46:47.030
LIZA MUNDY: I happened to have
a conversation with a group

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:49.280
of historians at the NSA.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.400
Most of our federal agencies
have wonderful historians

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.970
offices, like the FBI does,
the CIA does, the NSA does.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:47:00.120
And I was speaking to a woman
historian there and a woman who

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.030
is a curator at the--

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:04.950
we have a little cryptography
museum in Fort Meade, Maryland

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.920
that is our equivalent
of Bletchley Park,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.460
and they told me this story
based on some documents

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.720
that I had come across.

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.840
I was talking to them and they
spent several hours with me

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.970
and laid out this
story at a time

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.040
when I didn't know anything
about code breaking.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.082
I look back at some of
the questions I asked them

00:47:21.082 --> 00:47:24.950
and sort of my level of
ignorance is embarrassing.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:26.750
So the minute I
heard the story, I

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.750
thought it would be an
incredible story to tell,

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.970
and this is a time period when
"Hidden Figures" had not yet

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:33.320
been published.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.570
There's a great book called
"Rise of the Rocket Girls"

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:36.350
that wasn't out yet.

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:37.850
So there were a
number of books that

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:41.240
were percolating along kind of
simultaneously about women's

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.170
contributions to the STEM
field and to American history.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:45.920
And so the minute they
told me this story,

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.080
I knew that I would
like to try to tell it,

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.090
and I just had to
ascertain whether or not

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:53.903
I could find any women who
would be in their mid-90s

00:47:53.903 --> 00:47:55.820
who could tell me about
the work and whether I

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.610
could find documentation to
support their recollections.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:00.800
Because of course I couldn't
use their recollections

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:02.150
unless I could document it.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.890
And I was surprised at how--

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:05.767
I had to have a lot of
records declassified.

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:07.100
It took about a year and a half.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.720
But there was a
lot of information

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.080
already in the archives
at the National Archives

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.270
that had just really been
neglected by historians,

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.255
I must say.

00:48:15.255 --> 00:48:16.880
AUDIENCE: Does the
cryptographic museum

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.088
now have copies of your book?

00:48:18.088 --> 00:48:19.963
LIZA MUNDY: I think--
that's a good question.

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.400
I think it does, yes.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.940
I'll have to check.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.308
Thank you for asking.

00:48:24.308 --> 00:48:25.850
AUDIENCE: So this
sounds like a story

00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:27.200
that more people need to hear.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.325
Will there be a movie?

00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:32.700
LIZA MUNDY: It has been optioned
and it's working its way

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.575
through that process.

00:48:33.575 --> 00:48:34.120
So I agree.

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:37.230
I mean, that really
is how many people

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.490
come to stories like this.

00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:39.510
So fingers crossed.

00:48:41.863 --> 00:48:44.030
AUDIENCE: Did you find any
records in the colleges--

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.865
like in all of the
Seven Sisters colleges,

00:48:45.865 --> 00:48:47.990
did they keep their own
records about the women who

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.050
left during the war?

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:49.910
LIZA MUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:52.160
Oh, I'm sorry, women who left
during the war to do this work?

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:53.437
LIZA MUNDY: Yes.

00:48:53.437 --> 00:48:55.340
So Wellesley College
in particular

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.060
has done a really good job
of maintaining those archives

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.357
and Goucher has as well.

00:49:00.357 --> 00:49:02.690
Some of the other schools
really didn't even necessarily

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.060
know that it had happened
because very few records were

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:05.780
kept.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.330
And the only reason that
Wellesley-- one of the reasons

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.200
is a member of the
class of 1942 decided

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.810
to send surveys to all
of her female classmates

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:16.640
to find out what they
did during the war.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.930
And a number of them wrote to
say, well I was a code breaker.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.700
And this was the
first inkling, really,

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.345
that any of their classmates
had done what they had done.

00:49:25.345 --> 00:49:26.970
And I went and looked
at those archives

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.300
and it's fascinating, though,
to see what the other women were

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.050
doing as well.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.200
You really get a sense of
how women were being suddenly

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.240
recruited by Armstrong Cork, by
all of the defense contractors.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.920
They're all out there
reading blueprints

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.020
and using their math
and language educations

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:47.270
in so many different capacities.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:49.970
So that was a wonderful
trove of documents.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:51.223
It really gave me a sense of--

00:49:51.223 --> 00:49:52.640
and the women
themselves remember.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.280
They said, you know, we had
so few recruiters on campus

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.845
in 1941 and everything
changed by 1942.

00:49:58.845 --> 00:50:00.720
Thank you for spending
your work day with me.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.870
