00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to take it later until 2008 then
they<00:42:25.160><c> changed</c><00:42:25.640><c> that</c><00:42:25.790><c> rule</c><00:42:25.900><c> but</c><00:42:27.820><c> so</c><00:42:28.820><c> one</c><00:42:29.750><c> of</c><00:42:29.840><c> the</c>

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:29.930 align:start position:0%
they changed that rule but so one of the
 

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.590 align:start position:0%
they changed that rule but so one of the

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
question is those guys who were nudged

question is those guys who were nudged
to<00:42:33.590><c> be</c><00:42:34.450><c> individualistic</c><00:42:35.620><c> did</c><00:42:36.620><c> they</c><00:42:36.800><c> stay</c><00:42:37.070><c> that</c>

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
to be individualistic did they stay that
 

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.660 align:start position:0%
to be individualistic did they stay that
way<00:42:37.720><c> and</c><00:42:38.770><c> if</c><00:42:39.770><c> so</c><00:42:40.130><c> that'd</c><00:42:40.340><c> be</c><00:42:40.460><c> interesting</c>

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:40.670 align:start position:0%

00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:43.490 align:start position:0%
because almost no one has chosen to do
 

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:50.770 align:start position:0%
because almost no one has chosen to do
that<00:42:43.520><c> since</c><00:42:46.870><c> so</c><00:42:48.430><c> 27</c><00:42:49.430><c> percent</c><00:42:49.880><c> of</c><00:42:50.240><c> the</c><00:42:50.450><c> people</c>

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.740 align:start position:0%

that if the market went up 10% the fund
 

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.010 align:start position:0%
that if the market went up 10% the fund

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%

would go up 12 then they switch to 50%
leverage<00:44:04.710><c> so</c><00:44:06.410><c> 50</c><00:44:07.410><c> percent</c><00:44:07.530><c> leverage</c><00:44:07.950><c> means</c>

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:08.670 align:start position:0%
leverage so 50 percent leverage means
 

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
leverage so 50 percent leverage means
that<00:44:09.570><c> if</c><00:44:09.720><c> the</c><00:44:09.840><c> market</c><00:44:09.870><c> goes</c><00:44:10.290><c> up</c><00:44:10.590><c> 10%</c><00:44:10.860><c> you</c><00:44:11.400><c> go</c><00:44:11.610><c> up</c>

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
that if the market goes up 10% you go up
 

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.330 align:start position:0%
that if the market goes up 10% you go up

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:17.340 align:start position:0%

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%

took these but we can ask what would

crisis so what would this fund have done
 

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:44.540 align:start position:0%
crisis so what would this fund have done
in<00:44:39.990><c> the</c><00:44:40.620><c> period</c><00:44:41.040><c> 2006</c><00:44:41.880><c> to</c><00:44:42.090><c> 2008</c><00:44:42.980><c> the</c><00:44:43.980><c> answer</c><00:44:44.340><c> is</c>

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:44.550 align:start position:0%
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
 

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:52.010 align:start position:0%
in the period 2006 to 2008 the answer is
down<00:44:45.470><c> 82%</c><00:44:48.020><c> so</c><00:44:50.000><c> you</c><00:44:51.000><c> know</c><00:44:51.150><c> this</c><00:44:51.510><c> is</c><00:44:51.690><c> a</c><00:44:51.720><c> pretty</c>

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
 

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
down 82% so you know this is a pretty
big<00:44:52.230><c> change</c><00:44:52.520><c> and</c><00:44:54.200><c> so</c><00:44:55.200><c> a</c><00:44:55.230><c> question</c><00:44:55.560><c> that</c><00:44:55.890><c> Frank</c>

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:56.490 align:start position:0%
big change and so a question that Frank
 

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
big change and so a question that Frank

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:02.690 align:start position:0%
and Henrik and I have been exploring is
