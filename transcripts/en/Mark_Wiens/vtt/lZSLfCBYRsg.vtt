00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:02.749
- I think you can fold,
I think the fold method,

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:04.916
because they are so thin.

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:13.284
It's been a long time since
I've had New York pizza.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.534
(light rhythmic music)

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:19.150
Good morning everyone.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.336
It's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Lisbon, Portugal.

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.207
It's about 6:30 am.

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.874
Ying and I are packing up everything,

00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:29.067
and we are about to go catch

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.343
the metro heading to the airport.

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:34.481
We have a flight at about
10 a.m. this morning

00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:36.814
to New York City, so this is

00:00:38.128 --> 00:00:40.555
our final goodbye to Lisbon.

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:43.479
Thank you very much to Fontecruz Lisboa,

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.044
which is a Marriott hotel.

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:49.930
Maybe the dark theme is
not my personal preference,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.079
but this hotel is in an
amazing location in Lisbon,

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.345
right along Avenida, which is
a beautiful, beautiful street

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:00.621
and very close to some plazas,

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:02.111
good restaurants around here,

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.215
great location, great service.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:06.132
Thank you for the stay.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:10.239
(fare box beeps)

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.567
(Mark mumbles)

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:17.090
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.340
(light rhythmic music)

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:36.713
- We made it to the airport.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.953
That was about a 35-minute
ride on the metro.

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:43.430
So if you take the metro from the airport

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.511
to Lisbon City center,

00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.024
give yourself about 35 to 45 minutes.

00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:48.826
We got all checked in to our flight,

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:50.897
now walking to our gate.

00:01:50.897 --> 00:01:52.494
I think I will turn off the camera now

00:01:52.494 --> 00:01:56.210
because security is gonna
be pretty, pretty tight,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.274
so I will see you in the airplane.

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:00.009
We are on our way to New York City.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.259
(light rhythmic music)

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.768
The short flights that
Ying and I have taken

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.500
on this trip so far with Star Alliance

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.571
is the one or two-hour flights.

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.580
The planes, they've been
okay for business class.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.519
But finally, Ying and I have

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.421
a long flight on business class.

00:02:25.421 --> 00:02:26.539
This is fantastic.

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:28.576
Ying, what do you think?

00:02:28.576 --> 00:02:31.541
Ying? (chuckles)

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.650
Look at the size of the seat

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.343
and the reclining ability.

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:38.990
And I think it's gonna be
about an eight-hour flight.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.638
We're flying into Newark Liberty Airport.

00:02:42.638 --> 00:02:45.138
And, oh, I'm gonna sleep well,

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:48.127
oh, and eat well too.

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:49.691
Ying has her seat.

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:50.836
- What happened?

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:52.275
(Mark chuckles)

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:53.592
Ying, try.

00:02:53.592 --> 00:02:54.501
- [Ying] Hmm?

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.828
- [Mark] Try to bring
your feet over there.

00:02:55.828 --> 00:02:58.552
Oh, Ying can't even reach the end.

00:02:58.552 --> 00:03:01.568
I just wanted to catch you
up in case you are joining me

00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:03.441
on this video series right here.

00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:05.793
But right now, my wife Ying and I...

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:08.398
How's that apple juice?

00:03:08.398 --> 00:03:12.726
Are on a round-the-world
trip with Star Alliance,

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:16.476
and so we are traveling to
nine, or 10 different cities,

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:19.524
if you count our home in Bangkok,

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:20.357
10 different cities,

00:03:20.357 --> 00:03:22.498
we're going around in 10 different cities

00:03:22.498 --> 00:03:24.831
and traveling for the food.

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:29.333
Let me give you a quick
tour of this booth.

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.918
Got the TV here in the
front, a good size TV.

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:34.734
There is a shelfing unit here.

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.984
There is a added foot rest below here.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.171
Right in my back here,
the full size pillow,

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:43.623
very squishy indeed.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:46.140
And then if you take a look
behind the seat over here,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.251
but I'll show you on this side

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.492
just because it's more convenient,

00:03:49.492 --> 00:03:52.825
I've got all the plugs, USB, headphones.

00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:56.104
I'm not sure what this is.

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:56.937
What is this?

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:57.770
- [Ying] Open it.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.129
- [Mark] Oh, this is like a little...

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.093
Here, here.

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:02.426
Oh, here we go.

00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.888
Oh, how fancy,

00:04:07.277 --> 00:04:12.058
the socks, the eye pad (chuckles),

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:14.641
the eye pad, the eye, what is it called?

00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:18.856
The eye blocker and
toothpaste, toothbrush,

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:20.797
oh, fantastic,

00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:23.562
all the essentials within this little tin.

00:04:23.562 --> 00:04:26.812
And this is the Olympic edition, 2016.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.745
Ying is already taking
advantage of her seat

00:04:31.745 --> 00:04:33.182
and taking a nap.

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:34.459
We're gonna be taking off soon,

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.523
so I will turn off the camera,

00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:38.667
and I will turn it back on

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.276
to show you the first meal.

00:04:40.276 --> 00:04:42.460
Oh, and this is the menu.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.710
(light rhythmic music)

00:04:56.344 --> 00:04:57.865
We are somewhere in the
middle of the air now

00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:00.371
over the Atlantic, and they just served us

00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:02.272
some nuts as well as a drink,

00:05:02.272 --> 00:05:04.916
and now starting with lunch.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:08.249
I got the brown piece of bread, butter.

00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.619
Actually, let me tear
off a piece of the bread,

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:15.202
the warm roll with some butter.

00:05:21.615 --> 00:05:24.462
And now this is the appetizer,

00:05:24.462 --> 00:05:27.545
shrimp and salmon and lemon, shrimp.

00:05:32.152 --> 00:05:35.396
Mmm, it has a gingery taste to it.

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:39.563
Then the piece of salmon,
oh, I think it's stuffed.

00:05:46.244 --> 00:05:48.727
The smoked salmon, maybe it's stuffed with

00:05:48.727 --> 00:05:51.871
a little bit of cream
cheese and a lot of dill.

00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:52.788
Thank you.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.716
She served me a nice salad next,

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:04.474
and I went for the balsamic
vinaigrette dressing,

00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:07.641
got this little micro plastic pepper.

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:13.903
Okay, and that should be good.

00:06:23.824 --> 00:06:25.991
Nice to have a full salad.

00:06:27.156 --> 00:06:28.573
- Some nice fish.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.633
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:06:30.633 --> 00:06:31.466
- Enjoy.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.401
- I just opened up the window.

00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.246
The light is much better
now to show you the food,

00:06:41.246 --> 00:06:43.892
but I'm gonna have to kind of selfie it.

00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:45.431
On the menu, they had a choice

00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:47.142
of a couple of different things,

00:06:47.142 --> 00:06:50.352
including a steak, but I
decided to go for the salmon,

00:06:50.352 --> 00:06:52.016
and then the salmon came
with a shrimp on top,

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:54.735
some vegetables, and then
couscous on the bottom

00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:56.565
with some kind of a gravy,

00:06:56.565 --> 00:06:58.885
and it looks like, is that pumpkin?

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.792
I think a spoon would
be in order for this.

00:07:01.792 --> 00:07:04.886
That is a wonderful piece of salmon.

00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:08.136
Get some of the gravy to go with that.

00:07:12.484 --> 00:07:13.317
Mmm.

00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:16.873
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.873
Salmon, the couscous is very fluffy,

00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:23.828
and then that gravy is like a,

00:07:23.828 --> 00:07:26.265
I think it's kind of a tomato-y,

00:07:26.265 --> 00:07:29.076
lightly sweet gravy all over it,

00:07:29.076 --> 00:07:31.803
even though it's already
delicious with the lemon on it,

00:07:31.803 --> 00:07:35.970
and gotta sprinkle on the
rest of that little pepper.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.985
That gravy is awesome,

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:41.985
and then with that
couscous, that is fantastic.

00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:49.479
This is an amazing meal.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:55.722
I like it with that squeeze of lemon.

00:07:55.722 --> 00:07:58.972
(light rhythmic music)

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:13.560
That entree of salmon was delicious.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.727
And now they rolled around a
cart with cheese and grapes.

00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:26.311
Follow that with a grape.

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:32.744
The combination of
cheese, the salty cheese

00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:34.586
with juicy sweet grapes,

00:08:34.586 --> 00:08:36.836
and follow that yet again.

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:42.600
And that concludes lunch on this flight.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.032
That was a full-on gourmet
fine dining experience.

00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:49.438
And the food was actually really good.

00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:52.521
I think just with fudge and almonds.

00:08:53.582 --> 00:08:55.210
- [Flight attendant] One
spoon is okay with ice cream?

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.068
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.389
I actually thought the meal was over,

00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:00.462
but one more dessert course,

00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:04.250
and she drizzled on
some fresh fudge sauce,

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.333
and then I added on almonds as well.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.418
That is good quality and
good chocolate sauce,

00:09:12.418 --> 00:09:14.860
and I like it with those
slivers of almonds.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.200
What a way to end a
gourmet meal in the sky.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.413
I have not seen Ying this
happy in a long time.

00:09:21.413 --> 00:09:24.988
She is hanging out, eating ice cream

00:09:24.988 --> 00:09:26.942
while watching a movie.

00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:30.762
There's absolutely nothing
better than eating a good meal

00:09:30.762 --> 00:09:34.381
and then being in the
chair to just recline.

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.631
(light rhythmic music)

00:09:54.758 --> 00:09:58.619
It has been about two
hours since our last lunch.

00:09:58.619 --> 00:10:02.077
And I'm not really sure
what time of the day it is

00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:03.741
in the world where we are flying,

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.747
but I think this is lunch number two.

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:09.267
You could have either
gotten the cheese plate,

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:11.095
but I decided to go for salmon again.

00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:14.554
So this is salmon lunch
number two with noodles

00:10:14.554 --> 00:10:17.304
and then also a fruit bowl here.

00:10:21.024 --> 00:10:23.691
Let me take some of this sauce.

00:10:31.353 --> 00:10:32.858
Mmm.

00:10:32.858 --> 00:10:34.941
Oh, it's teriyaki sauce.

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:36.950
Cool.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.146
And that same wonderful salmon.

00:10:39.146 --> 00:10:41.979
Let me try some of these noodles.

00:10:44.682 --> 00:10:45.515
Mmm.

00:10:46.473 --> 00:10:48.059
Maybe there is soba,

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:49.523
buckwheat, possibly.

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:52.773
(light rhythmic music)

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:10.397
We just landed at Newark
Liberty International Airport.

00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:13.261
Thank you very much to
United and Star Alliance.

00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:16.458
That was an awesome
flight, good food as well,

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:20.316
and I did not want that
flight to end, actually,

00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:22.931
but we are here, New York City.

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:26.152
And they just warned us to not take out

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.624
any cellphones or cameras
in customs and immigration

00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:31.338
or they will confiscate them,

00:11:31.338 --> 00:11:32.609
so I'm not gonna take the risk.

00:11:32.609 --> 00:11:35.095
I'm about to put the
camera away into my bag,

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:38.823
and I will see you guys on
the other side of immigration.

00:11:38.823 --> 00:11:41.683
That all went smoothly, got our bag.

00:11:41.683 --> 00:11:44.007
We are now walking through the airport

00:11:44.007 --> 00:11:45.372
heading to ground transportation.

00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.189
We're gonna try to take
the train from Newark

00:11:48.189 --> 00:11:50.852
straight to Manhattan Penn Station.

00:11:50.852 --> 00:11:53.590
And our hotel is right in
the middle of Manhattan.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.018
We're on the little airport shuttle.

00:11:55.018 --> 00:11:56.856
We landed at Terminal B,

00:11:56.856 --> 00:11:59.884
and we are on our way to
the airport train station.

00:11:59.884 --> 00:12:03.134
(light rhythmic music)

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.940
New Jersey Transit Rail, I
think that's what we want.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.523
And we are going to New York Penn Station.

00:12:18.473 --> 00:12:21.033
There are so many options (chuckles)

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:22.616
one-way adult, add,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.396
then we pay too?

00:12:26.396 --> 00:12:27.229
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:12:27.229 --> 00:12:29.576
- [Mark] Multi-Pay.

00:12:29.576 --> 00:12:30.409
No, back.

00:12:37.203 --> 00:12:38.465
Hey, that was $13.
- You don't have receipt.

00:12:38.465 --> 00:12:39.382
- Oh yeah.

00:12:40.678 --> 00:12:43.130
$13 for the tickets.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.423
There were so many options.

00:12:45.423 --> 00:12:46.401
(train bell ringing)

00:12:46.401 --> 00:12:47.484
Here we are.

00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:51.612
(light rhythmic music)

00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.609
This would be about a
20-minute ride, I think.

00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:00.859
(light rhythmic music)

00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:06.159
Let's exit Madison Square Garden.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:08.521
We got lost a little bit in Penn Station,

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:09.788
wandered around for a little while,

00:13:09.788 --> 00:13:13.955
but I think we are emerging
in the right exit on 7th Ave.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.083
Okay, welcome to New York City.

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:25.795
It has been about 10 years
since I've been here.

00:13:25.795 --> 00:13:29.045
(light rhythmic music)

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.853
We are walking over to
the Courtyard Marriott,

00:13:35.853 --> 00:13:37.655
the Chelsea branch,

00:13:37.655 --> 00:13:41.492
and it's just about a five-minute
walk from Penn Station.

00:13:41.492 --> 00:13:43.576
Great location.

00:13:43.576 --> 00:13:45.576
Push, push, push, push.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.194
Hello.
- Hi guys, how are you?

00:13:51.194 --> 00:13:52.027
- [Mark] Good, thank you.

00:13:52.027 --> 00:13:53.972
Check-in for Mark Wiens.

00:13:53.972 --> 00:13:54.805
- [Receptionist] What's the last name?

00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:56.972
- [Mark] Wiens, W-I-E-N-S.

00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:00.124
Two, zero, zero, one.

00:14:01.598 --> 00:14:04.212
Okay, zero, zero, two.

00:14:04.212 --> 00:14:06.642
Oh I see, on the end here (mumbles)

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:09.245
the end room, oh yeah.

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:10.589
- [Ying] Exit (chuckles).

00:14:10.589 --> 00:14:13.256
- [Mark] Right next to the exit.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.907
Whoa, it's a huge room (chuckles).

00:14:19.907 --> 00:14:20.990
- [Ying] Wow.

00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:22.928
- Wow.

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.999
This is the entire, there's
an entire living room,

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.750
dining room, and desk here.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:33.550
And we drop the bags off and
quick tour of this place.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:36.609
Oh wait, let's go look
out the window real fast.

00:14:36.609 --> 00:14:37.442
Oh yeah.

00:14:38.448 --> 00:14:42.031
20th floor, look at that view of New York.

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:44.614
Actually, we see a lot of rooftops,

00:14:44.614 --> 00:14:46.616
but it's an amazing view still.

00:14:46.616 --> 00:14:50.003
And then bedroom all the way
on the other side of the hall.

00:14:50.003 --> 00:14:53.086
Opposite side view of New York City.

00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:57.539
(light rhythmic music)

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:05.808
No real plan, just gonna
kinda meander around,

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:07.404
walk around slowly,

00:15:07.404 --> 00:15:09.752
and maybe try to find
something small to eat.

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:13.002
(light rhythmic music)

00:15:33.139 --> 00:15:34.691
We took a walk down the street

00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:36.658
probably for about 30 minutes

00:15:36.658 --> 00:15:38.331
and didn't really know what to eat,

00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:40.084
so I thought it would be fitting

00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:42.867
to have my first meal in New York City

00:15:42.867 --> 00:15:46.250
at this legendary pizza place.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.310
And pizza is one of the
iconic foods of New York City,

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.310
so I'm gonna go inside
and get a couple slices.

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:03.389
- Slice number one?

00:16:05.727 --> 00:16:06.560
Next please.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.060
- [Man] I'll have a slice one.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.663
- Next?

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:23.830
- [Mark] One pepperoni and one cheese.

00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:36.016
You walk inside, they have
all the pizzas at the front.

00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:40.179
You wait in line, then you
choose your slices of pizza.

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:42.257
I think most of what almost
everybody was getting

00:16:42.257 --> 00:16:44.668
was just either cheese or pepperoni,

00:16:44.668 --> 00:16:46.997
just the normal pizza slices.

00:16:46.997 --> 00:16:49.166
I got two slices, just a
cheese and a pepperoni,

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:52.537
and then I immediately
put on some chili flakes.

00:16:52.537 --> 00:16:55.356
And I'm gonna start with this just cheese

00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:56.831
because this was right out of the oven

00:16:56.831 --> 00:16:58.328
right as I ordered.

00:16:58.328 --> 00:17:00.323
And I think you can fold,

00:17:00.323 --> 00:17:04.490
I think the fold method,
because they are so thin.

00:17:09.415 --> 00:17:10.248
Mmm.

00:17:12.517 --> 00:17:16.406
It's been a long time since
I've had New York pizza.

00:17:16.406 --> 00:17:18.451
The crust is crispy.

00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:23.074
But where the sauce meets
the dough, it's gooey,

00:17:23.074 --> 00:17:25.317
and then that's a nice tart tomato sauce

00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:27.567
and then the salty cheese.

00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.012
Mmm.

00:17:32.668 --> 00:17:35.947
I like the amount of
sauce ratio in this pizza.

00:17:35.947 --> 00:17:39.915
It gives the pizza a very
nice tart tomato flavor.

00:17:39.915 --> 00:17:42.341
And those chili flakes on
there are very good as well.

00:17:42.341 --> 00:17:43.604
That does give it some nice spice.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:47.354
They are, that chili
flakes are pretty good.

00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:51.145
Let me try the pepperoni.

00:17:51.145 --> 00:17:53.109
And at the top there, you
can see how much pepperoni.

00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:57.186
That's almost like a whole
entire covering of pepperoni.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:17:58.535
Let me pour on the rest
of those chili flakes

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:02.165
which have fallen off
onto the plate, all right.

00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.858
In order to get the
pepperoni on my first bite,

00:18:04.858 --> 00:18:08.025
I'm gonna have to make it a big bite.

00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:18.437
Mmm.

00:18:21.689 --> 00:18:23.074
Successful.

00:18:23.074 --> 00:18:25.566
I definitely like the
pepperoni one better.

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:28.705
That gives it the extra
salty meaty dimension

00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:30.989
that goes so well
together with the cheese,

00:18:30.989 --> 00:18:34.239
the tomato sauce, and that thin crust.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.733
Mmm.

00:18:39.733 --> 00:18:42.070
Great way to start this
trip to New York City.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.716
From here, Ying and I
are getting very sleepy,

00:18:44.716 --> 00:18:47.373
so we're just gonna walk very
slowly back to the hotel,

00:18:47.373 --> 00:18:49.451
so I'm gonna end the
blog for today right now.

00:18:49.451 --> 00:18:51.709
Thank you all very much
for watching today's video.

00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:54.357

thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

00:18:54.357 --> 00:18:56.113

Good night from New York City.
