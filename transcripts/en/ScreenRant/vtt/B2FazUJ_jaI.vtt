00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.711
Some Easter Eggs are so well hidden that we
feel the animators at Disney don’t want

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:07.711
us to see them.

00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.960
Then there are some that are so blatant that
we can hardly call them Easter Egg because

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.340
it’s not really mysterious.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.430
When a hidden gem is hard to spot but creative
we know that we have stumbled across a great

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.640
Disney Easter Egg, especially when we have
to pause the film to spot it.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.340

Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Paused
Movie Moments Disney Wants You 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
To See.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.270
Finding Dory

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.410
Remember Nemo’s fellow captives at the dentist
office in Finding Nemo, well Nemo wasn’t

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.990
the only one to escape his niece’s grip
of death.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.730
At the end of Finding Nemo they make their
escape too and if you’re a diehard Disney

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.990
fan you know they showed up again at the end
of Finding Dory.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.750
Pause the scene and take a look at Jocks bag;
his is the only one that is not lined with

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.750
algae.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.810
Don’t forget that he was the one who was
obsessed with a clean tank, looks like his

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.670
OCD paid off because we can only wonder how
long they have been in those bags.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.670
Monsters, Inc.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.670
The details placed on characters are important
to animators, just take a look at Sully and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.670
his 2.3 million strands of individual hair
that were animated for Monsters, Inc..

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.670
On the scare floor is a character that runs
the entire floor and when there is a code

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.670
2319 it’s his job to alert the CDA.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.670
He’s got a stressful job so it is fitting
for him to have the lines of an EKG on his

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
skin.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.670
An awesome and appropriate design on an over
worked character.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
Cars

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.670
Anyone who is a fan of Screen Rant and all
of you should be, knows that we love to talk

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.400
about the Pixar Luxo ball as much as Disney
loves to show it.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.880
Sometimes they display the ball blatantly
like in Toy Story and other times they like

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.200
to tuck it away in a corner like Inside Out.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.729
In the film Cars they had to get creative
because the characters in this film can’t

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:29.909
grab or kick the ball around.

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.160
When the town of Radiator Springs turns on
at night with all thier neon glory, look at

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.690
Sarge’s Surplus Hut sign.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.690
It’s hidden right there.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.300
Do you know which year the Luxo Ball made
its first appearance?

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.420
Was it 1983, 1986 or 1991?

00:01:42.420 --> 00:02:20.750
Stay tuned to the end of our video to find
out.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.750
Inside Out

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.410
The memory orbs in the movie Inside Out have
many hidden Easter Eggs in them but only one

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.859
when it comes to pizza.

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.680
No, not bad pizza covered in broccoli but
the famous Pizza Planet Truck.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.069
The Pizza Planet truck has been in almost
every Pixar film and Inside Out is no exception.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.489
When Joy, Sadness and Bing Bong are driving
on the Train of Thought take a look at the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.950
Memory Orb in the crate.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.389
Maybe that’s why Riley was upset about the
broccoli pizza; she wanted her usual slice

00:02:44.389 --> 00:03:14.549
from Pizza Planet.

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.549
The Good Dinosaur

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.239
The Good Dinosaur is an adorable film about
a young dinosaur named Arlo and a cave boy

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.239
named Spot.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.840
During their adventure Arlo is spooked and
falls back into a lake, as he splashes down

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.670
you can see Hank from Finding Dory.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.319
Now we know why Hank doesn’t want to go
back into the ocean, if we saw a dinosaur

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.120
we would probably keep our distance too.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.549
True or False, Anna Paquin refused a role
in The Good Dinosaur due to scheduling conflicts

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.299
with her HBO show True Blood?

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.389
Stick around to the end of our video to find
out the answer.

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.389
A Bug’s Life

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.389
P.T.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.949
Fleas Circus goes from show to show on a train
but did you realize that train pays homage

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:44.949
to Disney’s 1941 animated film Dumbo?

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:45.949
The train is partly made out of a box from
a product called Casey Jr. Cookies and the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:46.949
train from Dumbo is called Casey Jr.

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:47.949
When you see the side of the box, pause the
film and look at the top left corner.

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:48.949
It says this is a product from the company,
“J. Grant Bakery” and J Grant stands for

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:49.949
Disney legend Joe Grant, who was the co-writer
of Dumbo.

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:50.949
Beauty and the Beast

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:51.949
When Belle’s father, Maurice gets lost in
the forest he tries to use old signs to help

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:52.949
his way back home.

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.319
Even though the paint is wearing off, we are
sure that he is able to still read the sign,

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.459
which explains why he is still lost.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.629
The sign says Valencia and Anaheim.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.159
Almost everyone knows that Anaheim is the
city where Disneyland is located but what

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.700
is the significance of Valencia?

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:38.980
Valencia where the famous Cal Arts School
is located and taught numerous animators.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.500
Toy Story

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.831
Tim Allen wasn’t the first choice to play
Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story and it’s hard

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:47.070
to imagine anyone else in that role but we’ll
get back to that in a moment.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.950
Tim Allen rose to stardom from the TV show
Home Improvement where he played a TV show

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.530
host of a tool time show sponsored by Binford
Tools.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.010
When Buzz helps to free Woody by removing
a toolbox from on top of his prison, take

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.630
a look at the company that made the toolbox.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.090
That’s right, looks like Tool Time’s sponsorship
paid off.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.040
Fill in the blank, Billy blank was asked to
play Buzz Light Year in Toy Story before Tim

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.190
Allen accepted the role.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.810
We’ll reveal the answer in just a moment.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.810
Cars 2

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.810
Not all Easter Eggs show up during the movie
itself, they can also show up during the end

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.810
credits.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.810
This is one of the reasons to stick around
to the end of the movie, even if that movie

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.810
isn’t a superhero film.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.810
In Cars 2 as the credits roll by you can see
Luxo Jr. lamp sitting on top of the world.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.810
Maybe this is symbolism to Pixar/Disney being
the number one animation company out there.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.810
World Domination!

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.810
The Incredibles

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.810
When Mr. Incredible shows up to his wedding
a little behind schedule, Elastigirl is already

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.810
ready for him at the alter.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.810
She’s not the only one who has been waiting
for him though, if you pause the screen when

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.780
they show the wedding guests you might recall
a few friends that received cape crusader

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.780
mishaps.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.230
Check out Thunder Head, the charmer who accidentally
takes a flight with a missile.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.050
Or Stratogirl who got a little too close to
a jet turbine, or Metoman and his ill-fated

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.210
elevator ride and let us not forget Dinoguy.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.700
We guess Edna is right, no capes.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.930
There you have it ten Paused Movie Moments
Disney Wants You To See.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.670
Here are the answers to our trivia questions:

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.860
The Luxo Ball made its first appearance in
1986’s Luxo Jr.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.770
Anna Paquin was in The Good Dinosaur as Ramsey
the T-rex so the answer is false.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.720
Lastly, Billy Crystal was asked to play Buzz
Light Year in Toy Story before Tim Allen accepted

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.720
the role.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720
