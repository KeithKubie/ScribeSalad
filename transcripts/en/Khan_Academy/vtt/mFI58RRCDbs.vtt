00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.770
- [Instructor] Let's say that you agree

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.330
to lend me some money.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.300
Say, you agree to lend me $100.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.000
And I ask you, all right,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.690
do I just have to pay you back $100?

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.360
And you say, no, no,
you want some interest.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.080
And I say, how much interest?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.090
And you say that you
are going to charge me

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.990
5% per year interest.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.357
So one way to think
about it is if I borrow

00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:27.120
$100 today, so $100 today,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.917
in a year I'm going to
have to pay you back

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:34.130
$100 times, I'm gonna
have to grow it by 5%,

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.030
so that's the same thing
as multiplying it by 1.05.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.700
This is how much I'm
going to have to pay back.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.533
Let me write this down.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.160
This is borrow.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.970
This is what I'm going
to have to pay back.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.370
And so this interest rate,
that just the face value

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.460
of how much more I'm
gonna have to pay back,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.260
this is known as the
nominal interest rate.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.180
Nominal interest rate.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.393
And we can compare this
to the real interest rate.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.460
And you might say, why do we need

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.700
some other type of interest rate?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.330
Well, even though on the face value

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600
I'm paying you back 5% more,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.840
that doesn't necessarily mean

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.050
that you're going to be able to buy

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.980
5% more with the money
that you get paid back.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.200
And you might guess why that is the case.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.227
Because of inflation.

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:25.080
$105 will not necessarily
buy you in a year

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.770
what it might buy you today.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.620
And so that's what the real interest

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.710
rate is trying to get at.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.800
And to do that, to calculate
our real interest rate,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.440
we are going to have to
think about inflation.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.793
So let me put inflation right over here.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.650
And so let's say that we are in a world

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.640
that has 2% inflation.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.200
So an indicative, a basket of
goods that cost $100 today,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.500
if this is the inflation rate,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.090
would cost $102 in a year.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.810
So there's two ways folks

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.730
will calculate the real interest rate,

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.750
given the nominal interest
rate and the inflation rate.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.610
The first way is an approximation,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.600
but it's very simple and
you can do it in your head.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.790
And that's why it's often the
first way that it's taught,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.200
but it's not exactly
mathematically correct.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.410
So the first way you'd say, well,

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.570
this could approximately be equal to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.210
the nominal interest rate
minus the inflation rate.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.560
So you could say this could
be approximately equal to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.560
5% minus, minus 2%,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.430
which would be equal to 3%.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.260
And this is a decent approximation.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.820
But the actual way that you
would want to calculate this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.810
if you wanted to be more
mathematically precise

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.450
is that your nominal interest rate

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.190
multiplies things by 1.05, so 1.05.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.860
But then things are getting more expensive

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.090
at a rate of 2% per year.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.150
Or another way to think about it,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.420
costs are being multiplied
by 1.02 every year.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.710
So we divide by that
amount, 1.2 every year.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.710
And so this was going to give us 1.05

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.740
divided by 1.02 is equal to 1.0294.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:09.720
1.0294.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.810
And another way to think about it,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.820
we just got a much better sense

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.240
of what the real interest rate is.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.260
It's actually much closer, 2.94% interest.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.230
And this is a very small difference,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.210
and so that's why people like this method.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.090
You can do it in your head
and it got pretty close.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.680
But keep in mind, even very small changes

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.330
in interest can make a big deal

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.330
when we compound over many years.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.853
And in other videos we've
talked about compounding.
