00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.500
In the last video,
we figured out

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.875
that given a takeoff velocity
of 280 kilometers per hour--

00:00:06.875 --> 00:00:09.250
and if we have a positive
value for any of these vectors,

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.580
we assume it's in the forward
direction for the runway--

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.860
given this takeoff velocity,
and a constant acceleration of 1

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.260
meter per second per second,
or 1 meter per second squared,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.380
we figured out that it
would take an Airbus

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.240
A380 about 78
seconds to take off.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.020
What I want to figure
out in this video

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.110
is, given all of these
numbers, how long of a runaway

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.080
does it need, which is a very
important question if you want

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.020
to build a runway that
can at least allow

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.699
Airbus A380s to take off.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.990
And you probably want it to
be a little bit longer than

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.300
that just in case it takes a
little bit longer than expected

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.890
to take off.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.350
But what is the minimum
length of the runway

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.450
given these numbers?

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.870
So we want to figure
out the displacement,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.230
or how far does
this plane travel

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.220
as it is accelerating at
1 meter per second squared

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.150
to 280 kilometers per
hour, or to 78-- or where

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.630
did I write it
over here-- to 78.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.840
I converted it right over here.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.410
As it accelerates to
78 meters per second,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.430
how much land does
this thing cover?

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.940
So let's call this,
the displacement

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.760
is going to be equal
to-- So displacement

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.760
is equal to-- You could view
it as velocity times time.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.490
But the velocity
here is changing.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.110
If we just had a constant
velocity for this entire time,

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.230
we could just multiply
that times however

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.710
long it's traveling, and it
would give us the displacement.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.000
But here our
velocity is changing.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.740
But lucky for us,
we learned-- and I

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.880
encourage you to watch the video
on why distance, or actually

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.370
the video on average velocity
for constant acceleration--

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.510
but if you have
constant acceleration,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.600
and that is what we are
assuming in this example--

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.572
so if you assume that your
acceleration is constant,

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:08.030
then you can come
up with something

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.030
called an average velocity.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.210
And the average velocity, if
your acceleration is constant,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.420
if and only if your
acceleration is constant, then

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.020
your average velocity
will be the average

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.740
of your final velocity
and your initial velocity.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.234
And so in this situation,
what is our average velocity?

00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:28.650
Well, our average
velocity-- let's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.320
do it in meters per
second-- is going

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.880
to be our final velocity,
which is-- let me calculate it

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.450
down here.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.814
So our average velocity
in this example

00:02:38.814 --> 00:02:40.480
is going to be our
final velocity, which

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.444
is 78 meters per second,
plus our initial velocity.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:46.860
Well, what's our
initial velocity?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.870
We're assuming we're
starting at a standstill.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.330
Plus 0, all of that over 2.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.180
So our average velocity in this
situation, 78 divided by 2,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480
is 39 meters per second.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.780
And the value of an average
velocity in this situation--

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.590
actually, average velocity
in any situation--

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.800
but in this situation, we
can calculate it this way.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.300
But the value of
an average velocity

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.400
is we can figure
out our displacement

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:21.020
by multiplying our average
velocity times the time that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.340
goes by, times the
change in time.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.190
So we know the change
in time is 78 seconds.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.260
We know our average
velocity here

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.100
is 39 meters per second,
just the average of 0 and 78,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.770
39 meters per second.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.020
Another way to think
about it, if you want

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.580
think about the
distance traveled,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.590
this plane is
constantly accelerating.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.350
So let me draw a
little graph here.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.370
This plane's velocity time graph
would look something like this.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.480
So if this is time and this
is velocity right over here,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.280
this plane has a
constant acceleration

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.510
starting with 0 velocity.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.540
It has a constant acceleration.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.962
This slope right here is
constant acceleration.

00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:05.420
It should actually
be a slope of 1,

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.260
given the numbers
in this example.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.180
And the distance traveled
is the distance that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.300
is the area under this
curve up to 78 seconds,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.170
because that's how long it
takes for it to take off.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.700
So the distance traveled is
this area right over here, which

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.630
we cover in another video, or
we give you the intuition of why

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.640
that works and why distance is
area under a velocity timeline.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.350
But what an average velocity
is, is some velocity,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.930
and in this case, it's exactly
right in between our final

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.700
and our initial
velocities, that if you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.520
take that average velocity
for the same amount of time,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.540
you would get the exact
same area under the curve,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.060
or you would get the
exact same distance.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.980
So our average
velocity is 39 meters

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.290
per second times 78 seconds.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.640
And let's just get our
calculator out for this.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:04.220
We have 39 times
78 gives us 3,042.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.600
So this gives us 3,042.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.010
And then meters per second
times second just leaves us

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.580
with meters.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.030
So you need a runway
of over 3,000 meters

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.000
for one of these
suckers to take off,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.030
or over 3 kilometers, which is
like about 1.8 or 1.9 miles,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.990
just for this guy
to take off, which

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.525
I think is pretty fascinating.
