00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.949
Hello I'm Simon Whistler you're watching the
TodayIFoundout youtube channel and in the

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.760
video today we've got something very different
for you this is a special bonus episode.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.510
If you're watching this right now that means
we've very recently passed the 1 Million subscriber

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.510
mark.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.460
And we just wanted to make this video, you'll
notice it is incredibly lengthy, because we

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520
wanted to do something special for the 1 million
subscriber mark.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.270
I've been working on this video for many days,
I know Daven's been working on this for many

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.500
days, so we're quite excited to present to
you, this is how we make our videos.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.430
We've been asked a lot of times how exactly
it works behind the scenes.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.190
So, basically, in this video we lay everything
out for you from, the first half is Daven

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.390
talking about the writing and the research
process, and the second half is me talking

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.170
about the production process so I really hope
you enjoy all of that.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.409
Kind of before we get into it, I also wanted
to say a huge thank you to everyone who has

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.010
subscribed whether you subscribed all the
way back in the beginning or if you just saw

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.720
this video and you subscribed right now whatever
the case, I'd love to thank you.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.220
It took us a long time to get here.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.580
It may seem like we grew super fast, but it
was last November, we'd been doing this for

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.980
about 18 months, we'd made 500 videos and
we had 40,000 subscribers.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.790
In the last 8 months we've grown from 40,000
subscribers to 1 million and hopefully beyond.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.890
So thank you so much to everyone who has been
there, like I say whether you subscribed right

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.730
now or two years ago.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.860
We really appreciate you being here and we
really hope the future is bright for this

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.860
channel.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.020
And whatever the next milestone is, I'll look
forward to doing another video like this,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.520
maybe on a different topic then.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:58.453
Anyway, let's roll right into it, and I'll
hand things over to Daven to kick us off.

00:01:58.453 --> 00:01:59.453
Thanks.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:02.160
So the first thing here in the creation process
is the initial topic idea.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.450
Given how much content we churn out, a lot
of people seem to assume this is one of the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.569
hard parts, but it’s actually one of the
easiest as the process is more than self-sustaining.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.340
For example, when we’re researching a given
topic, we’ll usually come across other interesting

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.090
topics, or when reading something, it will
cause us to wonder about something else not

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.870
really relevant to what we’re writing about
at the time, but that would be a good topic

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.870
in and of itself.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.890
Beyond that, given this is what we do for
a living, even when not working, ideas for

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.010
potential interesting topics pop into our
heads all the time where we’ll wonder about

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.260
something, and then, for instance, I’ll
just send myself a quick email when I think

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.569
of something I think might be interesting.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.480
And as for TodayIFoundOut authors, they can
either email me when they have ideas or come

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.450
across something or put them in a shared potential
topics spreadsheet for me to review.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.709
Karl Smallwood particularly submits tons of
great topic ideas all the time, particularly

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.360
good at coming up with some of the more zany
ones you’ll see on the channel and website.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.840
Beyond that, TodayIFoundOut fans send us potential
topic ideas from things they’ll come across

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.290
or something they’re wondering about all
the time.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.990
This happens in website, youtube, and social
media comments, as well as in direct emails

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.030
or in replies to our email newsletter.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.580
These are all collected and put into a spreadsheet
for me to review for approval or not.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080
Once a topic idea gets approved by me, it
then ends up in this spreadsheet, with me

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.849
writing a very brief description on what the
focus should be.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.900
All regular TodayIFoundOut authors have access
to this, and can pick and choose what topics

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.250
they want simply by putting their name next
to it, though I do request they only select

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.010
a few at a time.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.599
Regular authors are free to pivot a little
here in focusing on a different aspect of

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.959
the thing if they discover something more
interesting when researching, but this at

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.760
least gives them a general outline to start
with.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.940
The main point of this is to remove as much
administrative overhead as possible and allow

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.150
the authors to pick topics they’re interested
in covering, as assigning a topic a given

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.000
author isn’t interested in his a great way
to get a sub-par final product in my experience.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.720
That’s not to say I never assign topics,
like if someone has a particular expertise,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.250
like Melissa is a lawyer and Scott is a medical
expert, so if a topic in one of those categories

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.260
I think might be a particularly difficult
one to cover, I might send it directly to

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.870
them instead of adding it to the general list.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.760
But even then, they’re always free to reject
working on a topic if they just aren’t interested

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.760
in it.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.540
Again, I think it’s really key that the
person working on a topic needs to be very

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.049
interested in it in order for the final product
to end up being good.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.690
As for the “Do Trees Poop” topic you’ll
be watching us create today, this was originally

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.940
a fan question and is actually one of the
rare assigned ones, as a topic like covering

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.850
tree poop is right up Karl’s alley and I
particularly wanted to pick the topic for

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.570
the behind the scenes video today, as I wanted
to try to find something that would have a

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:40.240
high probability of more or less being a typical
TodayIFoundOut article to give a good representation

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.430
of what the normal process is for us.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.780
Obviously given the topics vary wildly, the
work that goes into them can likewise vary

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.070
considerably, both in time and what needs
done to do it.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.530
But I figured this one seemed like it was
a good fit to be more typical, which indeed

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.350
mostly turned out to be correct, other than
the fact that it was assigned and not selected

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.440
out by Karl and there were a couple more hours
than normal thrown in there due to a certain

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.880
amount of uncertainty on aspects of the topic
among experts in the field, which required

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:16.050
a little extra digging to sort out.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.229
As for what each author does once they select
an article, this actually varies a bit from

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.380
topic to topic and author to author.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.340
For this topic, Karl notes he started by referencing
“a number of textbooks on the basic biology

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.350
of plants so I could confidently write about
the processes involved and get a feel for

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.970
the language used when addressing a person
maybe unfamiliar with the topic.”

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.960
Then, he notes, “Once I feel comfortable
I have a basic understanding of the concept

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.250
I will then delve into more dense literature,
usually consulting Google books and scholar…

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.630
to gain a deeper understanding of what exactly
is going on and then do more general searches

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.760
to follow up on stuff I’ve learned and to
clarify different things…”

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.210
“Once I have all the research in place,
I will then "write" the article in my head…

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.139
Usually I will take a brief break and do something
mundane like go for a jog, make a cup of tea

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.900
or simply listen to some music.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.100
This usually takes about 30 minutes and in
that time I formulate the basic structure

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.120
of the article, how it will flow and the main
talking points.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.960
“
“I then write the introduction… [which]

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.120
is one of the most time intensive parts of
the entire process.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.810
The introduction will go through anywhere
upwards of a dozen drafts as I try to find

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.560
the right voice for the article.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.300
I try to make sure every introduction introduces
the topic at hand, asks a question the reader

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.199
will want to know the answer to (to provide
an incentive to keep reading) and usually

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.199
contain a joke…”

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.210
“The actual writing of the article itself
takes a couple hours.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.410
The first draft takes about an hour, I then
read the entire thing out loud to look for

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.000
awkward wordings or sentences...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.330
I then change the font size and put the whole
thing in bold (a technique I read about that

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.419
helps with proofreading) to look for mistakes.

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.639
I will then go through the whole article again
to see if there are any "dull" paragraphs,

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.639
basically any paragraph that doesn't contain
at least a few new pieces of information for

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.090
a reader and correct that by further researching
the topic being discussed within it to see

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.060
if there are any more things I can mention
that are interesting.”

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.300
“I then submit the whole thing to the site's
wordpress (I write everything in Google Docs)

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.690
and give it one last look over for mistakes.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.370
“
As Karl notes there, once an author is done

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.229
with a piece, it ends up on the site marked
as pending, with currently there being over

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.400
670 pending articles waiting for me to my
part on…

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400
You might at this point be wondering why there
are so many…

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.930
Mainly because since bringing others onboard
about 4 or 5 years ago, everything has very

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.280
much been a collaborative effort, which I’ve
found is the best way to produce the best

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.660
content, but doesn’t exactly scale well
with only 1 editor.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.060
But bottom line, when I write the pieces myself
completely or one of TodayIFoundOut’s authors

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.199
does, it rarely turns out as good as if multiple
minds were leveled on the subject.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:39.191
So once something goes up as Pending, I then
at some point will review it… occasionally

00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:43.690
even years later… though usually much more
promptly, particularly tending to be biased

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.860
towards recently submitted things just from
regularly checking what’s coming in.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.320
As the topic of Why Trees Poop was assigned
for this very video, I reviewed it immediately,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:59.020
and recorded my process for your viewing pleasure.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:07.630
My first step here is to simply read the article
to see what, in this case, Karl, dug up and

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.390
the narrative he took and all that.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.160
This also functions to familiarize myself
very well with the given topic, as regular

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.400
TIFO authors like Karl tend to do a really
good job at explaining things.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.600
Once I’ve done that and usually then have
a very good sense of the subject, I’ll completely

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.490
re-research the thing, first using the listed
sources, and then expanding beyond that just

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.270
to make sure, as of course the listed sources
are going to reflect what the author wrote

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.719
as far as the facts and details and all that.

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:37.789
It’s important to note here that the listed
sources are not actually the complete list

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:43.140
of sources; we typically omit redundant sources
that we use for verification purposes.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.510
The reasons for this are two-fold.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:49.330
First, from a strictly practical standpoint,
the Google gods require regular sacrifices

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.540
upon their alter, one of which being it wouldn’t
be a good idea to put many dozens of links

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:58.340
to random sites on every page on TodayIFoundOut,
and even in YouTube, where we don’t care

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.060
so much about that, we occasionally have run
into the issue of having too many sources

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.360
even with the way we do it, so the description
ends up being too long and YouTube complains

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.730
at us about it and we have to trim things
down.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.580
The second reason is just that the sources
are not just meant to give credit where credit

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:18.220
is due, but also to give readers and viewers
a way to read more on a given topic if they

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.640
so choose.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.470
Having dozens of redundant sources ends up
not being as good as simply picking the best

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:28.050
source for a given piece of information that
also hopefully expands on stuff we don’t

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.770
cover related to the topic.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.360
Of course, sometimes a given source might
just talk about some snippet of information

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.900
we include in the article, but they’re the
best one who mentions that snippet, so even

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.540
though that one doesn’t include extra information,
it will get included.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.709
But when looking at many sources saying the
same thing, we’ll usually try to pick the

00:09:44.709 --> 00:09:49.000
one that also says other interesting stuff
we don’t mention to attempt to make the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.520
references section somewhat useful to people.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.709
In any event, while re-researching the topic,
if I come across any other potentially interesting

00:09:55.709 --> 00:10:00.090
topics that would make a good full article,
I’ll note those, usually just in notepad

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.040
at first and later processing them for the
main topics file later.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.660
Or if the thing is just an interesting snippet
that may fit in the article and hasn’t already

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:12.010
been included by the author, noting it to
see if it can be worked in naturally, or if

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.630
not used as a Bonus Fact.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.180
My main strategy, however, is not just to
try to find stuff a given author might have

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:21.529
missed or just decided not to include; usually
TodayIFoundOut’s authors are really good

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:22.860
at picking out interesting tidbits.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.380
What I’m really looking to do here is to
attempt to ensure extreme accuracy, which

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.680
is harder than a lot of people seem to think.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.000
No matter how good one is at researching,
separating fact from fiction, and spotting

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.090
inconsistencies from otherwise reputable sources,
everyone is going to get stuff wrong some

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.090
times.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.220
So it’s not just looking something up in
the Oxford English Dictionary or Encyclopedia

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.370
Britannica, or reading something some expert
in the field is saying and then parroting

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.370
that.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.399
Again, everybody gets details wrong quite
often, even the most accurate of sources.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:57.720
For instance a study published in Nature in
2005 demonstrated Britannica had 2.92 errors

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.950
per science article at that point.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.440
Most of these were minor, but mistakes none
the less.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:07.580
(For reference, they found Wikipedia at that
time almost matched that at 3.86 errors per

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.580
science article.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:13.350
This provides the dual lesson of never trusting
any single source, no matter how prestigious,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.860
and not committing the popular mistake of
thinking Wikipedia is not, at least, a reasonably

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.730
good source, though again double checking
always needs done.)

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.700
In any event, I’ve personally found many
errors in the OED over the last near decade

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.760
I’ve been doing this, arguably one of the
most accurate etymological sources in the

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.250
history of humanity.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.320
Again, nobody bats a thousand.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.880
It’s simply impossible to be perfectly accurate
in every little detail no matter how hard

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.880
you try.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.200
But by completely re-researching the topics,
I can at least up the accuracy a little beyond

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.700
what the already very accurate Today I Found
Out authors have done.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.790
And as for my strategy of ensuring what I’m
coming up with is accurate, similar to what

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.471
the authors do, beyond a healthy level of
skepticism in everything we read, I’m mainly

00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:01.250
looking to consult a ton of good sources on
a subject, noting discrepancies between them

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.390
(and potentially any discrepancy with what
a given source is saying vs. what the TodayIFoundOut

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.110
author wrote) and of course looking at where
they all agree, then trying to track down

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:15.329
the truth between the discrepancies, if possible,
or if not probably then mentioning the conflict

00:12:15.329 --> 00:12:17.279
explicitly in the article.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:21.570
On that, I might emphasize one idea that seems
the most plausible given all the data at hand

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.950
and only briefly mention the alternates, or
if it’s not clear at all which is right,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.520
give them equal coverage.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.800
Or if one is very clearly correct, but nonetheless
something else is often touted as correct

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:36.339
by otherwise reputable sources, we want to
be sure and debunk that and thoroughly explain

00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:40.490
why this other thing is actually correct and
not something else you might have otherwise

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.490
heard.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.300
Occasionally we’ll also come across something
where everybody is saying the same thing,

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.000
but it just doesn’t seem right, which is
where the skepticism element comes in to play

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.460
as a useful tool in one’s accuracy toolbox.

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:57.050
For example, a few months back we did an article
on Pelorus Jack, the dolphin who supposedly

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.209
used to guide ships through parts of the sometimes
dangerous Cook Strait in the late 19th and

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:04.070
early 20th centuries.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:08.570
Every single modern source we could find discussing
the dolphin stated this, even occasionally

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.420
citing early 20th century news stories stating
the dolphin did this.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:16.600
It all seemed very credible given the sources…
but it had all the earmarks of something that’s

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.399
been exaggerated over time.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:22.250
I was particularly thinking what ship captain
is actually going to trust that some random

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.899
dolphin understands his ship’s capabilities
and going to trust it to guide said ship through

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:28.310
dangerous seas.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:33.040
On top of that, this was at the time supposedly
a highly trafficked area- with just one dolphin

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.190
to guide ships, that’s going to result in
quite the traffic jam.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.339
And dolphins love to play in the wake of boats
and ships, so might that just have been what

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:44.690
was happening and it’s just been exaggerated
in the century since and originally by news

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.170
reports which are prone to sensationalize
things as long as there have been news reports?

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.149
I mean, there must have been some reason this
dolphin was once so newsworthy, but the whole

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:55.660
thing just seemed fishy.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.459
So despite the many, many reputable sources
saying this, I didn’t really feel comfortable

00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:04.690
publishing it without a first hand account
of a ship captain or sailor or the like who’d

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.370
actually seen the dolphin in action and corroborated
the story.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.370
No modern source I read had this.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.660
Many hours of trolling through old newspaper
archives from the region and time period in

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.190
question and I finally came across some first
hand accounts of the dolphin in action.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.320
And, indeed, given these accounts, this was
just a dolphin that liked to play in the ship’s

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.500
wakes in the area.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.920
As to why he was newsworthy at the time, this
was to do with his consistency in appearing,

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.700
usually briefly, in the wake of most ships
traveling through a section of the strait,

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.140
before switching to a different ship, day
or night.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.660
He achieved this as, while dolphins do need
approximately eight hours a sleep per 24 hour

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:41.560
cycle, dolphins don’t actually ever go into
a full sleep state, in terms of becoming completely

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.560
unconscious.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.529
They can’t do this, in fact, because they
don’t breathe automatically, meaning to

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:49.779
become fully unconscious under water would
mean their death.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:53.010
How dolphins handle this is to essentially
put one hemisphere of their brain to sleep

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.040
at a time, while the other is still functioning
as it would when conscious.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.339
They then alternate which side of their brain
is sleeping periodically.

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:04.110
Doing this for about eight hours per day,
usually sporadically, rather than eight straight

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.620
hours like a human, allows them to be conscious
enough to remain aware of their environment

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.360
and periodically swim to the surface for air,
while still getting sleep.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.130
Thus, Jack's widely reported consistency in
making an appearance alongside just about

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.620
every ship that passed through the section
of the strait he called home, at least for

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.760
a few minutes at a time, may well have been
helped by the fact that he was always aware

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.750
when ships were around, and could wake up
and go hop around in their bow waves for a

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.150
bit, if he chose.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:33.950
As for why he did it, it’s thought he was
the only Risso dolphin in the region for the

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.810
two to three decades he swam the strait, so
was probably just lonely and bored, Risso

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.269
dolphins normally being very social animals
traveling in large groups.

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:46.310
He became something of a tourist attraction,
with even the likes of Mark Twain traveling

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:47.959
to see him firsthand.

00:15:47.959 --> 00:15:51.430
As far as I could find, the idea of him not
just appearing in the wakes of ships, but

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:59.350
guiding them goes all to 1917, only a few
years after the dolphin disappeared, so perhaps

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:04.829
why so many otherwise reputable sources today
say the Pelorus Jack used to guide ships,

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:07.040
even though this is unequivocally false.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.850
Despite at that point having spent a few days
on this topic, normally I’d not publish

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:15.139
it at all as a topic like “Did a Dolphin
Really Guide All Ships Through Cook Strait

00:16:15.139 --> 00:16:20.389
in the Early 20th Century” and the answer
ending up being 3,412 words that essentially

00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:24.690
just sum up to “No” isn’t on the surface
terribly interesting.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.529
Although, I actually think that one ended
up being moderately interesting even so, peppered

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:32.760
with some good dolphin facts and an interesting
section on one of the deadliest maritime disasters

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.060
in New Zealand history, the demise of the
SS Penguin, a ship Pelorus Jack purportedly

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.990
avoided after an incident in 1904, giving
rise to the legend that it only sunk because

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.700
Pelorus Jack wouldn’t guide it through the
strait as he did other ships.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.149
But overall, the piece was not really up to
par with our normal work on “interesting”

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:51.149
front.

00:16:51.149 --> 00:16:55.449
I only ended up publishing it all because
everyone else was saying one thing, and we,

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:59.410
at least at that point, were the only modern
source that had the real, full story.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.059
So not so much published for the general fan
of the site, but more just to put it out there

00:17:04.059 --> 00:17:06.069
as a reference for others covering the dolphin.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:09.939
So you see the point in all of this being
that it’s not just ridiculously hard to

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:14.159
be perfectly accurate given the current state
of human knowledge on a subject, but very

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:16.890
much impossible no matter how hard one tries.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.399
That’s not to mention that the current state
of human knowledge on a subject can sometimes

00:17:20.399 --> 00:17:23.309
change over time, further throwing a wrench
in things.

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:28.529
:-) So everybody gets stuff wrong sometimes;
there are no exceptions to this.

00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:33.429
My job in all of this is to give it my best
college try to ensure none of TIFO’s authors,

00:17:33.429 --> 00:17:36.690
who are an extremely skilled bunch, got something
wrong.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.159
This sort of collaborative researching and
writing helps facilitate this better than

00:17:40.159 --> 00:17:44.809
if, say, I just continued to write and research
things myself as I used to do (with nobody

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:50.309
double checking me), or just published what
my authors came up with without doing my part.

00:17:50.309 --> 00:17:54.309
Even then, it’s still impossible to catch
everything of course, but the effort’s there.

00:17:54.309 --> 00:17:56.029
;-)
Beyond slightly better accuracy, one major

00:17:56.029 --> 00:18:00.340
bonus in at least making the attempt to be
perfectly accurate is that both the original

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.369
author and myself in doing a deeper dive than
most, not once, but twice, will inevitably

00:18:05.369 --> 00:18:10.100
find interesting details and tidbits others
covering the same topic probably didn’t

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.100
find.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.769
So back to article creation- after I take
notes, which I always place in notepad on

00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:19.389
my right screen, I read through the article
again and begin to add any additional tidbits

00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:24.239
I think should be included, from memory, putting
XYZ where I can’t remember the specific

00:18:24.239 --> 00:18:27.019
details or the like, as a sort of placeholder.

00:18:27.019 --> 00:18:31.049
If re-arranging stuff or removing something
the original author wrote for some reason,

00:18:31.049 --> 00:18:34.029
I’ll copy that to a notepad file on the
left screen.

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:37.629
This keeps it as something I can refer back
to if the reason I removed it is I want to

00:18:37.629 --> 00:18:42.999
do a wholesale re-wording to perhaps integrate
some other related interesting bit of information.

00:18:42.999 --> 00:18:47.049
I may also later simply copy it back into
the main article somewhere else.

00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:50.779
By always keeping it on the left screen and
the notes always on the right screen, it ensures

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:54.950
I don’t mix that text up with the notes
file contents, as obviously that would be

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:00.570
amazingly bad if I accidentally copied and
pasted something a non-TIFO author wrote into

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:01.720
the article.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.289
After I’ve done all that, I’ll start to
process the notes file, reading over every

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:09.590
note taken and filling out the details in
the article from them or just deleting them

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:14.179
if the note was just for verification purposes
or not something I end up wanting to include,

00:19:14.179 --> 00:19:18.269
as it’s not interesting or too much of a
tangent or whatever upon further review.

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:21.799
(Although, as previously mentioned, if the
tangent is super interesting and I can’t

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:26.340
work it into the main article in a natural
way, I’ll put it in the Bonus Facts or even

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.639
potentially make it into an article of its
own if it’s sufficiently worthy of such.)

00:19:30.639 --> 00:19:35.279
During this whole process I’m looking to
craft the final narrative or flow of the article,

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:39.320
which is usually roughly what the original
author came up with, if not exactly what they

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.649
came up with if they’ve been writing for
TIFO for long enough and get the style I’m

00:19:43.649 --> 00:19:46.979
wanting here, like someone like Karl whose
been writing for TodayIFoundOut for about

00:19:46.979 --> 00:19:48.210
four years now.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.340
But mainly here I’m looking to ensure the
final product is fairly consistent with TIFO’s

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.809
normal voice and style, including being very
densely information packed, giving you more

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:00.109
than you expected just from the title.

00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:03.519
Like in an article about the origin of the
expression “piss like a racehorse” you’re

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:07.470
not just going to learn the origin of the
expression, you’re going to learn some interesting

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.309
things about horse racing or in one about
why Yankee Doodle called the feather in his

00:20:11.309 --> 00:20:15.580
hat macaroni, you’re going to learn about
some interesting related stuff, like the interesting

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.600
origin of the expression “dude”.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.460
On that note, I’m also looking to weed out
uninteresting bits, which is quite subjective

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.600
on the latter, but as I’m the creator of
the site and a big fan of this type of content,

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.609
I just kind of go with what I think is interesting-
which as I’ve learned is a great way to

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:34.320
ensure a steady stream of complaint emails
about how boring TIFO’s contents is….

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.950
:-)
On that note, in all topics we’re trying

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:40.480
to balance entertaining you while simultaneously
teaching you or broadening your knowledge

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.249
on something, to really hit that edutainment
mark well, though generally trying to err

00:20:44.249 --> 00:20:47.919
slightly more on the side of educating than
many in the genre do.

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:53.059
It’s a fine line between something being
entertaining vs. seemingly like being in school,

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:57.419
and I will never claim that we manage to hit
the mark perfectly on every piece created.

00:20:57.419 --> 00:20:59.709
But, again, at least the effort’s there.

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:01.749
:-)
The point of all this is to really make a

00:21:01.749 --> 00:21:04.109
given topic our own, so to speak.

00:21:04.109 --> 00:21:07.820
Everything has been covered by somebody somewhere,
so what we’re really trying to do here is

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.239
make sure TIFO’s version is unique in some
way.

00:21:11.239 --> 00:21:15.090
To accomplish this, as previously alluded
to, we’re first looking to make it ultra-accurate

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.029
down to the tiniest details, which right there
separates it from many in the genre.

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:23.129
This is super important, not just because
it (figuratively) kills me every time we get

00:21:23.129 --> 00:21:28.249
some tidbit wrong, but because that is a huge
part of why TIFO was created in the first

00:21:28.249 --> 00:21:32.700
place- along with being a byproduct of my
productive procrastination philosophy, which,

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.400
in a nutshell is the idea that if you find
yourself procrastinating a lot doing something,

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.609
try to make that something productive in some
way- in this case it’s productive both in

00:21:41.609 --> 00:21:45.659
learning new things, which is always good,
as well as attempting to make a living out

00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:47.570
of doing just that.

00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:51.379
In any event, at the time in 2009 when I created
the site, there really weren’t a lot of

00:21:51.379 --> 00:21:54.880
good interesting fact sites our channels out
there.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:01.429
This was before CGP Grey, Vsauce, MinutePhysics,
Sci-Show, CrashCourse, Numberphile, etc.

00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:05.210
Technically Destin of SmarterEveryDay had
started posting occasional awesome educational

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:10.259
videos going back to 2008, but it didn’t
become the focus of his channel until 2011.

00:22:10.259 --> 00:22:15.720
Reddit’s TIL, which of course is more of
an aggregate of other people’s work rather

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.479
than creating something somewhat unique as
these other people do, tended to be sensationalized

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:25.080
for effect with a lot of subtle inaccuracies
or outright incorrect stuff as a result.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.049
That’s not to say there weren’t a few
good ones out there, like Mental_Floss, Snopes,

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:33.929
World Wise Words, or sort of The Godfather,
the mysterious individual or individuals known

00:22:33.929 --> 00:22:39.929
only as Cecil Adams of The Straight Dope which
was being published all the way back in 1973,

00:22:39.929 --> 00:22:41.090
just it was rare.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.690
So what I was really looking to do was create
an ultra-accurate source of interesting facts.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.909
And I thought that as an OK writer fresh out
of a master’s level course on how to properly

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:54.250
research stuff, combined with my inherent
nature of just naturally being super anal

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.840
about being accurate on things, this was something
I could do.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.249
Of course, in reality looking back I wasn’t
actually good at this sort of research, was

00:23:01.249 --> 00:23:06.840
an absolute horrible interesting fact article
writer in so, so many ways, and just generally

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.269
sucked at this whole thing for quite some
time.

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:13.479
:-) But with many thousands of hours of practice,
one improves a little, and that process continues

00:23:13.479 --> 00:23:14.909
many years later.

00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:18.499
Beyond improving my own work over time, when
I was able to start bringing other team members

00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:22.989
onboard after a few years, things improved
dramatically on all fronts thanks to the sort

00:23:22.989 --> 00:23:26.460
of collaborative researching and writing process
that has been honed since.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.609
But in any event, the main point here is that
while it’s still impossible to be perfectly

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:36.599
accurate all the time, in making the attempt
in both deep and broad research, we simultaneously

00:23:36.599 --> 00:23:41.120
separate our content somewhat from certain
others in the genre, while also finding bits

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.190
of information others aren’t including in
their coverage of the topic, more or less

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.019
all putting our stamp on the thing.

00:23:47.019 --> 00:23:51.119
Alright, back to the editing- as I’m going
through the notes and polishing up the article,

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:55.429
I sometimes wonder about something or am unsure
about some little tidbit, and so will usually

00:23:55.429 --> 00:23:59.009
still have a little bit of researching to
do, similar to what Karl was mentioning.

00:23:59.009 --> 00:24:02.769
Essentially, I’m looking to make sure that
I understand fully everything being said and

00:24:02.769 --> 00:24:07.139
every word being used, which is another key
part in ensuring accuracy and catching little

00:24:07.139 --> 00:24:09.849
mistakes from otherwise reputable sources.

00:24:09.849 --> 00:24:13.590
After rinsing and repeating on all this, I’ll
ultimately get through all the notes and at

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.769
this point the article is mostly done.

00:24:15.769 --> 00:24:20.419
From here I’ll just read through it over
and over again, polishing up the writing given

00:24:20.419 --> 00:24:24.090
any changes I’ve made to the original piece,
particularly including making sure anything

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.869
I’ve added hasn’t screwed with the original
text from the author.

00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:30.529
This is also the final check in removing parts
I think that aren’t interesting enough,

00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:35.840
or move them to Bonus Facts if they are interesting
but don’t quite fit, or do some final re-arranging,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.740
or the like, similar to what’s been going
on the whole time.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.960
At this stage it’s all about strictly editing
and not adding anything new.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.659
As I progressively get closer to the end,
I also start trying to focus more and more

00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:51.299
on trying to see the thing from the end consumer’s
perspective, whose just coming across the

00:24:51.299 --> 00:24:55.639
topic for the first time, trying to make sure
everything is crystal clear, which is actually

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:59.960
a surprisingly hard part of all this just
owing to how much outside information on the

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.700
topic we’ve read and how many times we read
through the article itself.

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.549
This is one of the reasons it’s important
on the final read through not to make much

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:11.830
in the way of any change, as once one starts
getting sidetracked on modifying some bit

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.950
too heavily, the rest of the article and narrative
to a certain extent kind of go out of your

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:20.399
head a bit and you really need to start over
from the beginning to again try to see the

00:25:20.399 --> 00:25:24.441
whole thing from the perspective of someone
who knows nothing about the topic and make

00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.460
sure everything relevant is included to make
things clear.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.749
Once I do get through the whole thing with
only making minimal modifications, maybe tweaking

00:25:31.749 --> 00:25:36.600
a bit of grammar here or there or changing
the wording of something very slightly, I’ll

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.099
give it one last read-through and then it’s
finally done.

00:25:40.099 --> 00:25:43.760
As for how many full read-throughs it takes
to achieve all this, this varies considerably

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:47.440
from topic to topic and I’ve never really
bothered to keep track of this to really know

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.549
a definitive average, though I’d imagine
it probably ranges from about a minimum of

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:55.359
maybe around 5 times through the article and
a maximum of maybe a couple dozen times or

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:59.830
so for me, and then however many times the
original author goes through it before I even

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.830
see it.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.100
That’s not to mention the many times an
individual section of the whole must be read

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.439
through in the process of all that.

00:26:06.439 --> 00:26:08.190
:-)
For reference on this Tree Poop article, I

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.280
counted 10 times for myself reading through
the article from start to finish, with many

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.049
more times read-through on the individual
paragraphs and sections.

00:26:16.049 --> 00:26:20.149
Alright, so now the article’s done and we
now definitively know the answer to the question

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:22.429
of whether trees pee and poop.

00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:23.659
What happens from here?

00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:28.309
This depends, *usually*, but not always, it
will get published on the website first and

00:26:28.309 --> 00:26:32.219
if it’s particularly good, sent out to TIFO’s
email newsletter.

00:26:32.219 --> 00:26:36.259
This is another key way to ensure accuracy
before something gets to YouTube outside of

00:26:36.259 --> 00:26:37.679
all our other efforts.

00:26:37.679 --> 00:26:41.080
As Cunningham’s Law notes, “The best way
to get the right answer on the Internet is

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.710
not to ask a question, but to post the wrong
answer.”

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.460
Between the website and the newsletter, on
average about 20K-30K people will have read

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.289
the thing within the first week.

00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:55.571
Helpfully, at least according to the various
analytics I have available, TIFO’s core

00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:58.260
crowed tends to be a pretty highly educated
bunch.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.179
That’s not to mention potentially hundreds
of thousands of people read a given article

00:27:02.179 --> 00:27:03.419
over the coming years.

00:27:03.419 --> 00:27:08.989
(At present there are about 2,700 full articles
on TIFO, and said content has been read about

00:27:08.989 --> 00:27:14.629
200 million times, so an average of 74,000
times per article, though of course there

00:27:14.629 --> 00:27:16.759
are outliers on each side of that.)

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:19.509
So if we get some detail wrong, we’ll probably
hear about it.

00:27:19.509 --> 00:27:22.900
This doesn’t happen very often, usually
just things like maybe we typoed a date, like

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:28.539
writing 1982 when we meant 1882 or something,
which as an aside that particular swapping

00:27:28.539 --> 00:27:34.200
of the 19th century for the 20th in writing
a year is something every single author, including

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.999
myself, that writes for TIFO does occasionally
and as I’m no exception to this rule even

00:27:38.999 --> 00:27:41.559
in editing things, I don’t always catch
it.

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:45.379
Funny enough, even Simon does this every now
and then when reading a script, so not just

00:27:45.379 --> 00:27:46.789
a problem in writing and editing.

00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:52.259
Kind of an interesting phenomenon that doesn’t
occur when, say writing 1682.

00:27:52.259 --> 00:27:56.840
Something about the muscle memory of writing
19XY seems to kick in when attempting to reach

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.179
for that eight on the keyboard.

00:27:58.179 --> 00:28:02.950
It will be interesting if that phenomenon
disappears once TIFO authors start to be born

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:08.289
in the 21st century or at least late 20th
century and thus having never probably developed

00:28:08.289 --> 00:28:11.879
the muscle memory of writing 19XY all the
time.

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:15.460
In any event, even though these sorts of mistakes
are quite rare and even then, typically just

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.140
something little like that- I don’t think
we’ve ever gotten a main point wrong given

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.059
the current state of human knowledge at the
time of the writing (though we have a handful

00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:26.539
of times had to modify something when the
current state of human knowledge changed in

00:28:26.539 --> 00:28:31.229
the interim from the writing to the present),
I still prefer to publish things in this order

00:28:31.229 --> 00:28:36.039
very much because once something goes up on
YouTube, any mistakes can’t really be edited,

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:37.089
unlike on the website.

00:28:37.089 --> 00:28:41.389
And beyond potential mistakes, another advantage
is that readers give feedback on some part

00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:44.609
of the article that maybe wasn’t really
clear or something, like they might comment

00:28:44.609 --> 00:28:49.039
that they’re confused about XYZ, which again
allows me to fix it before it gets published

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:52.759
in a somewhat permanent form on an expensive
to produce video.

00:28:52.759 --> 00:28:57.659
This used to happen more in the early days
of TIFO, but still every now and then occurs.

00:28:57.659 --> 00:29:01.210
But even if rare, it’s a nice little way
to help improve the content that little bit

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.210
more when needed.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:07.789
This is also a method that’s not available
to a lot of creators on YouTube, giving us

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:11.500
a tiny advantage there.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:18.320
Alright, so now the article’s potentially
published to a decent sized audience for at

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.089
least a short time, if not occasionally years.

00:29:21.089 --> 00:29:24.499
So how does it end up on YouTube and how do
we decide what goes there?

00:29:24.499 --> 00:29:28.960
To begin with, it’s got to be super interesting,
at least in Simon and my opinion- obviously

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.990
not everybody’s going to be interested in
everything we put up given the extremely diverse

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:34.100
topics we cover.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.659
But even with that caveat, not all TIFO content
is worthy of spending the time and money to

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:42.620
put it in video form and we’re very cognoscente
of the fact that subscribers don’t stay

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.700
such if not given a steady stream of great
content.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.869
And as subscribers are the lifeblood of a
channel, in this case we do definitively go

00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:54.849
outside of my normal “Well, I find it interesting,
so other people like me probably will too”

00:29:54.849 --> 00:29:58.799
strategy on the website, and try to use metrics
of what sort of things end up being liked

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:02.499
the most by our subscribers and that sort
of thing, to ensure we’re delivering what

00:30:02.499 --> 00:30:04.739
people want, and not just what I think is
interesting.

00:30:04.739 --> 00:30:09.260
So, once a piece of content’s been identified,
whether by Simon trolling through the archives,

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:13.039
perhaps looking for something relevant to
something coming up or to find something that’s

00:30:13.039 --> 00:30:17.559
similar to other stuff you guys all seemed
to really like based on our various metrics,

00:30:17.559 --> 00:30:21.309
or me just coming across something in the
archives over the course of my normal duties

00:30:21.309 --> 00:30:25.479
or publishing something I think is particularly
good so want to get up on YouTube quickly,

00:30:25.479 --> 00:30:29.719
I’ll take look over the article yet again
to process for youtube form.

00:30:29.719 --> 00:30:33.739
In the case of a piece of content that’s
quite old, this might mean re-editing it,

00:30:33.739 --> 00:30:38.119
and even sometimes re-researching it to get
it up to the present quality of content on

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:42.419
TIFO or make sure everything’s still true
given the current state of human knowledge.

00:30:42.419 --> 00:30:46.889
And in any case, at the least making sure
everything in what becomes the script is relevant

00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:51.429
to YouTube, like changing words like “reader”
to “viewer” or if some author wrote “as

00:30:51.429 --> 00:30:55.379
noted above” changing it to “as noted
previously” or maybe if the article said

00:30:55.379 --> 00:31:00.500
something like “vice president of research
XYZ” perhaps needing to change that to “former

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:05.529
vice president of research XYZ” if the person
is no longer in that position, or a bunch

00:31:05.529 --> 00:31:06.619
of little things like that.

00:31:06.619 --> 00:31:10.429
I’ll also sometimes trim out bits that I
think, while interesting in text, might drag

00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:15.581
down a video a bit or be too much of a tangent
or whatever - again being cognoscente of the

00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:20.349
fact that YouTube subscribers very definitively
have slightly different tastes than TodayIFoundOut

00:31:20.349 --> 00:31:23.119
website and newsletter subscribers.

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:26.879
In the end, every minute of video production
costs that much more, and subscribers getting

00:31:26.879 --> 00:31:31.489
bored mean subscribers who cease to be so
and don’t watch the videos all the way through.

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:35.940
So I’m really trying to tighten up the content
a titch where I think needed for video form.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:40.019
Once I’ve done that, I then place it in
a shared scripts folder Simon and I use.

00:31:40.019 --> 00:31:43.649
In order to make sure we don’t slip up and
cover the same thing, once we’re going to

00:31:43.649 --> 00:31:48.589
cover something, we take it out of the general
folder and place it into the Simon or Daven

00:31:48.589 --> 00:31:49.589
folders.

00:31:49.589 --> 00:31:52.261
As I’m putting the scripts in the general
folder in the first place, I’ll usually

00:31:52.261 --> 00:31:56.829
just take the ones I want right then, which
is a perk of my half of running this channel.

00:31:56.829 --> 00:32:00.869
:-) However, as Simon’s the much stronger
presenter, I try to only take the ones I think

00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:05.690
are simultaneously most interesting, but that
have little chance of being popular on YouTube

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.529
outside of our own subscribers.

00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:11.999
Once the script’s then in the shared folder,
the video production side is Simon’s domain,

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:15.629
along with running the administrative side
of things for the channel, which in and of

00:32:15.629 --> 00:32:19.899
itself is shockingly time consuming, filled
with tedious, mostly thankless work.

00:32:19.899 --> 00:32:21.610
:-)
So that’s more or less where my work on

00:32:21.610 --> 00:33:54.859
the videos end in most cases.

00:33:54.859 --> 00:36:58.849
For 

00:36:58.849 --> 01:27:41.540
the rest, here’s Simon.
