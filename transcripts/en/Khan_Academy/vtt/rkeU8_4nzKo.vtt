00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.790
I've been asked to do some
more limit problems.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.430
So let's do some more.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.860
So let's see.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.150
What's the first
problem I have?

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:19.330
It says the limit as x
approaches 0 of x minus 2 times

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.970
the absolute value of x over
the absolute value of x.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.730
Now what immediately confuses
most people is this

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.780
absolute value thing.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.960
Because how do you
deal with it?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.490
Because you can't
just subtract.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.410
If this was an x, it would
be a simple problem.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.560
Because then you could
just simplify it.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.490
You could subtract this 2x from
this x and then divide by x.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.550
And you'd get an answer.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.740
But this has an absolute
value, so you can't just

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.540
directly manipulate it.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.630
Well what if we're able to get
rid of this absolute value?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.620
How do we do that?

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
Well, in order for this limit
to exist-- in order for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.250
this limit-- I don't know.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.870
Let's say it equals l, right?

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.820
And l is what we
have to solve for.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.390
In order for that limit to
exist, then the limit to x

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.230
approaches 0 also has to
exist from the positive

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.180
and the negative sides.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.040
What do I mean?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.380
Well that means that
this must also be true.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.570
The limit as x approaches 0
from the right-hand side, from

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.300
positive numbers, of x minus 2
times the absolute value of x

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.210
over the absolute value of
x has to be equal to l.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.240
And then we also know that the
limit as x approaches 0 from

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.060
the negative side of the same
function, 2 times absolute

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.680
value of x over the absolute
value of x, is also going

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.830
to be equal to l, right?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.360
If this-- If we-- As we
approach 0 from the left,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.255
we get some number.

00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:51.790
And as we approach 0 from the
right, we get the same number,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.540
then we know that no matter
what direction we approach 0

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.140
from, which is this situation,
we approach that number.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.385
So let's figure out
these two limits.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.250
And if they have the same
answer, then we have the answer

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.100
to our original problem.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.990
So how can we simplify this
as x approaches 0 from

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.180
the positive side?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.590
Well that's the same thing as
the limit as x approaches

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.840
0 from the positive side.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.750
Well if we know we're
approaching 0 from the positive

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.210
side, what do we know about x?

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.500
We know that x is
positive, right?

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.530
It's approaching
from the right.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440
So if x is positive, we
can get rid of these

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.450
absolute value signs.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.470
So we just get x
minus 2x over x.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.070
And so that equals the limit
as x approaches 0 from

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.270
the positive side.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.590
Let's see.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.760
That's x minus 2x.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.310
This is minus x, right?

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.150
x minus x.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.430
And then minus x divided
by x is minus 1.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.590
So the limit as x approaches
0 from the positive

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.420
side of minus 1.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.120
Well that's just going
to equal minus 1.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.480
OK.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.970
Now let's take this case down
here when we're approaching

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.700
from the negative side.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.400
So how can we think about this?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.240
What is the absolute value of
x if x is a negative number?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.930
Well the absolute value of x,
if x is a negative number,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.440
is going to be the
negative of x, right?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.490
If x-- Think of it this way: if
x is negative 1, when we take

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.680
the absolute value of x, we're
essentially just multiplying

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.610
x times negative 1 again.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.160
So another way to rewrite this
is: this is equal to the limit

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.060
as x approaches 0 from
the negative side of

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.670
x minus 2 times what?

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.650
The absolute value of x is the
same thing as negative x.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.000
Hopefully that makes
sense to you, right?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.070
If we're dealing with negative
numbers, then taking the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.160
absolute value of a negative
number is the same thing as

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.710
multiplying that negative
number times the negative to

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.690
essentially make it into a
positive number, right?

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.626
And then, of course, the
absolute value of x in the

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:21.450
denominator, since we're
dealing with a negative number,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.260
is also equal to negative x.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.040
And let's see if we
can simplify that.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.800
So that means that the limit
as x approaches 0 from the

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.380
negative side-- Let's see.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.600
I get x minus 2
times negative x.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.230
So these negatives cancel out.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.380
So I get x plus 2x, right?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.495
So I get 3x over minus x.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.450
That equals minus 3.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.100
So this is interesting.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.200
I am approaching a different
number when I approach it

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.950
from the left-hand side.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.500
When I approached this function
from the left-hand side or

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.850
from the right-hand side.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.160
So it looks like this
limit doesn't exist.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.880
Let's confirm that.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.680
Let me actually-- Let me see if
I can-- Let me get the graphing

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.250
calculator and confirm.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.640
Let me type it in.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.636
So x minus-- I'll show you
what I'm doing --x-- so you

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:38.110
don't get bored --minus
absolute value of x.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.080
And what am I-- Divided by
the absolute value of x.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.130
Let's see.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.770
Graph.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.570
And what does it have here?

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.170
Zoom out.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.530
So this is-- Is this right?

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.250
x minus the absolute
value of x-- Oh, sorry.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.390
It's x minus 2 times the
absolute value of x.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.170
Graph.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.190
There you go.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.100
Even the-- oh.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.690
I don't think you
can see it yet.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.060
--the graphing calculator
confirms the work we did.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.900
Although it connects them and
it makes you think the it

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.710
somehow approaches here.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.490
But that's just because
it picks points and

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.880
just plots them.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.220
So as you see, as you approach
from the right-hand side, you

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.020
approach negative 1, right?

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.790
Well actually you're at
negative 1 the whole time

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:38.770
on the right-hand side.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.210
And as you approach from
the left-hand side, you

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.410
approach negative 3.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.090
So the limit does not
exist at x is equal 0.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.290
You would say l is undefined.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.700
You know, there's a little
dirty secret about limits.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.270
It's not a dirty secret, but
in theory you should never

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.260
get a limit problem wrong.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.170
And why?

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.510
Well you should be able to
solve it analytically.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.860
But if you don't know how to
solve it analytically, just

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.080
put it really really
small numbers here.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.810
Try out-- If you put
in-- Try 0.0001.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.870
Try numbers that are just
slightly larger then whatever

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.210
your limit number is.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.410
And then slightly smaller.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.630
And then, just numerically, if
you have a calculator, see

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.370
what it's approaching.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.370
And sometimes you don't
even need a calculator.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.740
You could probably calculate
this in your head with 0.01

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.160
or something like that.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.875
Anyway, let's do
another problem.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.390
Invert colors.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.140
OK.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:43.900
So let's do the limit
as x approaches 0 of

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:50.800
sine of 5x over 2x.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.000
Now this looks a lot
like sine of x over x.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.750
And we know sine of x over x.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.280
What is that?

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.630
And if you don't believe me,
watch the videos where we prove

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.520
it using the squeeze theorem.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.130
We proved that the limit as
x approaches 0 of sine of

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.440
x over x is equal to 1.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.065
Now this looks
almost like that.

00:08:11.065 --> 00:08:13.165
It would be great if we
could get it into that form

00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:14.040
and then we'd be done.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.350
So how can we do that?

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.000
Well let's try to substitute.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.413
Let's try to get a single
variable here instead of

00:08:20.413 --> 00:08:21.560
a 5 times a variable.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.610
So let's make a
substitution in magenta.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.880
And say that a is equal to 5x.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.440
And then that also means that--
So divide both sides by 5 and

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.640
we get x is equal to a over 5.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.050
So let's make that
substitution and do this.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.500
So this-- The limit as x
approaches 0 would be

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.050
the same thing as what?

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:50.080
If approaches-- As x approaches
0 here, a is also going

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.720
to approach 0, right?

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.450
So this is the same thing as
the limit as a approaches 0.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.675
Or you could view it this
way: as a approaches 0, x

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:58.720
is still approaching 0.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.490
Maybe at 1/5 the pace,
but it's the same thing.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:09.730
[SIDE COMMENTS]

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.150
OK.

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:16.510
Anyway, this should say the
limit is a approaches 0, right?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.920
And hopefully you're satisfied
that the limit as a approaches

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.790
0 is the same-- That x is
still approaching 0, right?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.180
Because if a approaches
0 here, that's going

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.610
to make x approach 0.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.680
So it's the limit as a
approaches 0 of sine

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:34.080
of a over 2 times x.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.770
But x is a over 5.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.490
So it's 2 times a over 5.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:49.000
And so that is equal to the
limit as a approaches 0

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:56.600
of sine of a over 2/5 a.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.660
Well that's the same thing.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.730
We could take this out.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.870
We could take this 1 over
2/5-- right, it's in

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.810
the denominator --out.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.240
This is just a constant
term, so we can take

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.910
it out of the limit.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.410
And obviously if we're taking
it out of the denominator,

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.190
it flips, right?

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.970
Because this is just
1 over 2/5 or 5/2.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:16.520
So that equals 5/2-- right, I
just took this out of the

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.230
denominator and it flips,
right, because it's 1 over 2/5

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:26.040
--times the limit as
a approaches 0 of

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.840
sine of a over a.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.980
And now that looks an
awful lot like this.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.810
It's just we have an a instead
of an x, but that doesn't

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.730
make a difference.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.670
So this is equal to 1.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:45.570
So this whole thing, since this
is equal to 1, is equal to 5/2.

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.430
And, once again, if you get
this answer and you're not so

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.180
sure, take your calculator
out and try-- calculate.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.750
What is the sine
of 5 times 0.001?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:04.190
So sine of 0.005 divided by
2 times 0.001, so 0.002.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.290
If you take that, you're going
to get a number that's awfully

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.360
close to this number.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.800
This is approximate.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.180
This is exactly 2.5.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.490
You're probably going
to get like 2.49999 or

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.690
something like that.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.600
So let's do another one.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.440
OK.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:30.970
So I have the limit as x
approaches 0-- this one looks a

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.590
lot like the previous one,
although we have some exponents

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:40.820
here --of sine squared
of x over x squared.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.040
And that almost looks like
sine of x over x, but I

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.060
have these squared terms.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.720
What can I do?

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.740
Well this is the same thing.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.620
This is sine of x
squared over x squared.

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.720
So this is the same thing as
the limit as x approaches 0

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:03.380
of sine of x over
x squared, right?

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.230
If you were to take this out,
you'd square the numerator,

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.480
square the denominator,
and you'd get this.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:10.050
If you took-- If you
wanted to change this.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.950
I won't say simplify.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.770
Well now this is interesting.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.180
Well this 2 is-- This
is a constant term.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.770
This isn't going to
change with the limit.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.130
So essentially, we can say,
well this is going to be equal

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:30.050
to the limit as x approaches 0
of sine of x over x, the

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.240
whole thing squared.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.770
And how is that?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.280
I couldn't have done this if
there was an x here, right,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.000
because that would have
changed the limit.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.790
But this is a constant term.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.790
So this-- The base is the only
thing that's going to change as

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.610
I take-- as x approaches 0.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.870
So I can take the limit
within the base, I guess you

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.040
could say, and get here.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.300
And now we're back to what we
proved in a previous video.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.280
What is the limit as
x approaches 0 of

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.430
sine of x over x?

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.950
Right.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.000
It's 1.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.810
So what's 1 squared?

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.350
It is 1.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.740
There you go.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.820
And I've taken 13
minutes of your time.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.330
Hopefully you've found
it vaguely Useful.
