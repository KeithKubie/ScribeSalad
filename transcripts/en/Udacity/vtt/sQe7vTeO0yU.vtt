00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.320
Now, let's make some more adjustments to our plot. This time we're

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.490
going to use a transformation on the y-axis, so we change the friend count.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.830
We're going to do this so that we can get a better visualization

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.780
of the data. Let's see if you can figure this out on your

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.800
own. I want you to look at the documentation for coord_trans

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.840
and add it as a layer to this plot. The function you're going to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.510
use to transform friend count will be the square root function. See

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.550
if you can make the plot and think about any observations you have,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.090
once you've made it. Now here again is an instance where we haven't given

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.270
you all the knowledge upfront, but I think you can figure this one out.
