but the thing is I just that was such a

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 align:start position:0%
huge plot point in the other films I
 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.310 align:start position:0%
huge plot point in the other films I
would<00:06:24.920><c> have</c><00:06:25.010><c> liked</c><00:06:25.220><c> more</c><00:06:25.610><c> time</c><00:06:26.030><c> to</c><00:06:26.480><c> show</c><00:06:26.720><c> what</c>

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 align:start position:0%
would have liked more time to show what
 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.780 align:start position:0%
would have liked more time to show what
exactly<00:06:28.160><c> that</c><00:06:28.430><c> was</c><00:06:29.060><c> all</c><00:06:29.210><c> about</c>

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 align:start position:0%
exactly that was all about
 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.490 align:start position:0%
exactly that was all about
I<00:06:29.820><c> mean</c><00:06:30.210><c> the</c><00:06:30.360><c> procedure</c><00:06:30.750><c> a</c><00:06:30.900><c> little</c><00:06:31.260><c> bit</c><00:06:31.350><c> more</c>

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
I mean the procedure a little bit more
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.900 align:start position:0%
I mean the procedure a little bit more
in<00:06:31.620><c> depth</c><00:06:31.830><c> with</c><00:06:31.980><c> that</c><00:06:32.130><c> all</c><00:06:32.340><c> I'm</c><00:06:32.430><c> saying</c><00:06:32.670><c> is</c><00:06:32.790><c> it</c>

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:32.910 align:start position:0%
in depth with that all I'm saying is it
 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.580 align:start position:0%
in depth with that all I'm saying is it
was<00:06:33.000><c> such</c><00:06:33.150><c> a</c><00:06:33.180><c> big</c><00:06:33.390><c> plot</c><00:06:33.720><c> point</c><00:06:34.050><c> yeah</c><00:06:34.230><c> yeah</c><00:06:34.440><c> they</c>

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 align:start position:0%
was such a big plot point yeah yeah they
 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.590 align:start position:0%
was such a big plot point yeah yeah they
should<00:06:35.040><c> have</c><00:06:35.130><c> like</c><00:06:35.340><c> maybe</c><00:06:35.670><c> did</c><00:06:36.120><c> more</c><00:06:36.450><c> than</c>

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
should have like maybe did more than
 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.330 align:start position:0%
should have like maybe did more than
just<00:06:36.750><c> one</c><00:06:36.900><c> little</c><00:06:37.080><c> shot</c><00:06:37.350><c> where</c><00:06:37.530><c> whoa</c><00:06:37.590><c> I</c><00:06:38.010><c> guess</c>

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 align:start position:0%
just one little shot where whoa I guess
 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.830 align:start position:0%
just one little shot where whoa I guess
he's<00:06:38.490><c> opening</c><00:06:38.730><c> that</c><00:06:38.880><c> there</c><00:06:39.060><c> was</c><00:06:39.180><c> a</c><00:06:39.210><c> section</c><00:06:39.690><c> in</c>

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
he's opening that there was a section in
 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
he's opening that there was a section in
the<00:06:39.930><c> middle</c><00:06:39.960><c> where</c><00:06:40.590><c> like</c><00:06:40.830><c> there</c><00:06:41.070><c> wasn't</c><00:06:41.370><c> too</c>

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the middle where like there wasn't too
 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
the middle where like there wasn't too
much<00:06:41.670><c> action</c><00:06:42.210><c> it</c><00:06:42.360><c> was</c><00:06:42.450><c> just</c><00:06:42.690><c> kind</c><00:06:42.870><c> of</c><00:06:42.900><c> Tony</c>

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 align:start position:0%
much action it was just kind of Tony
 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.630 align:start position:0%
much action it was just kind of Tony
doing<00:06:43.410><c> his</c><00:06:43.590><c> thing</c><00:06:43.800><c> but</c><00:06:44.010><c> the</c><00:06:44.130><c> reason</c><00:06:44.400><c> I</c><00:06:44.460><c> like</c>

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
doing his thing but the reason I like
 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.410 align:start position:0%
doing his thing but the reason I like
that<00:06:44.670><c> is</c><00:06:44.850><c> because</c><00:06:45.390><c> the</c><00:06:46.350><c> whole</c><00:06:46.700><c> theme</c><00:06:47.700><c> kind</c><00:06:48.270><c> of</c>

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
that is because the whole theme kind of
 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
that is because the whole theme kind of
of<00:06:48.510><c> the</c><00:06:48.600><c> movie</c><00:06:48.870><c> is</c><00:06:49.020><c> that</c><00:06:49.200><c> you</c><00:06:49.290><c> can</c><00:06:49.440><c> take</c><00:06:49.680><c> away</c>

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 align:start position:0%
of the movie is that you can take away
 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.860 align:start position:0%
of the movie is that you can take away
the<00:06:50.250><c> parts</c><00:06:50.640><c> you</c><00:06:50.790><c> can</c><00:06:50.940><c> take</c><00:06:51.090><c> away</c><00:06:51.330><c> the</c><00:06:51.450><c> pieces</c>

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 align:start position:0%
