00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.980
 My God, we've had so many Disney prosecutions that Disney couldn't give them full numbers. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.500
 This is "Lion King 1½". 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.940
 So how does that work? 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.180
 This film is a prequel. Uh, sort of. 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.420
 It focuses more on Timon and Pumbaa and where they came from, 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.280
 and all the funny ways in which they were part of the original film, without us realizing it. 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.560
 A nice concept, if you like Timon and Pumbaa, and I ... 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.580
 ... ehhh, I don't hate them, but I don't know if I want to watch a whole movie about them. 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.680
 The story is, without surprise, as ordinary as it can be. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.960
 Timon is an outsider in his group and one day he gets the lead to make sure the hyenas don't attack. 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.100
 Of course he is distracted, and the hyenas attack, 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.920
 He feels terrible, and he has to find his own way. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.160
 He leaves and meets a companion on the way, named Pumbaa, 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.620
 They form a bond, since they are both outsiders, 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.040
 And yes, you see how Timon and Pumbaa join in random clips. 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.460
 Sometimes it's funny, like when you can see how the "Can't Wait to be King" song actually ended. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940
 But the majority is pretty useless, 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.220
 You are pointing at the image and you say, "Hi hi, oh, so that's how it really went, ha-ha." 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.340
 And for half the time there isn't even a real story attached to it. 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.440
 When the story returns, it's ... okay. 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.120
 I mean, there's a nice connection between Timon and his mother. 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.040
 Occasionally you can sometimes smile. 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.640
 But it's so strange to see such a good animation in something that is just a prequel for in between. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.260
 Like I said, they called it "1 ½". 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.700
 Why does a movie called "1 ½" have such good animation? 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.460
 The only reason I can think of is because it's Lion Kin guess, and that's one of their biggest properties. 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.240
 It makes sense to give it such a nice animation, 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.560
 especially since it must be connected to the original movie. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.980
 But, * sigh *, it's Timon and Pumbaa. 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.180
 Why are such beautiful backgrounds used for Timon and Pumbaa? 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.700
 And if there was a good story attached to it, a great story that would surprise you, 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.380
 like Kung Fu Panda, or the Lego Film, something you wouldn't think would be great, 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.140
 THEN I would understand. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.240
 But it is just Timon and Pumbaa that insert themselves into random parts, and it is not going well. 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 And I don't know, it's kind of a mess. 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.280
 Not terrible, it still looks good. 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.640
 The only thing I can really say about this is, if you like Timon and Pumbaa, you will like this too. 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.760
 It is actually just the Timon and Pumbaa movie. 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.840
 I don't hate Timon and Pumbaa, I just don't want to watch a whole movie about them. 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.000
 But if you want to, maybe you think it's a great movie. 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.540
 One or two of the songs are quite catchy, surprisingly enough. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.240
 That melody about digging always stays in my head. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.140
 And ... that's about it. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.820
 Like I said, I don't think it wanted to be more than it is, 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.340
 I don't know if it was meant as a great movie or a great comedy, 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.560
 It's just Timon and Pumbaa who are themselves. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.760
 If you like that, you like this too. 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.320
 Myself? I think I like the cartoon series a bit more, 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.240
 but if you are looking for better animation, then you should try this film. 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.060
 Look at it, and maybe it's slimy, but still good.
