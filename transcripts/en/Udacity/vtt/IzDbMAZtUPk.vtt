00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.900
Execution contexts or in memory
scopes differ from lexical scopes.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.650
In that, they are built as
the code runs, not as it's typed.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.730
The rules govern which variables
a program has access to at

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.250
different points during the execution.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.170
Let's explore how variables
will be available at runtime

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.350
within in different contexts.
