00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.339
So what can that hacker still do?

00:00:02.339 --> 00:00:04.043
So this brute force guessing,

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:07.140
they'll have to get hold of
the shadow password files.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.660
They'll learn the hash values.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.050
So let's say there is
a compromise of the system and

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.110
that file is exfiltrated or
something like that.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.473
In fact in the past year or

00:00:15.473 --> 00:00:19.730
two, there have been several examples
where LinkedIn and Adobe and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.480
others had these password,
derived values from password files,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.180
those were stolen by hackers and
actually made widely available.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.729
So if you have these hash values,
let's say if you get a hold of them,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.740
you're doing brute force
guessing of passwords.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.340
How hard is this task?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.732
One thing we can do is we have
some hardware software and

00:00:40.732 --> 00:00:44.066
whatever hash function here,
we're talking MD5.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.550
That's one of the hash
functions that is used.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.690
Publicly available
software that we have, and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.022
certain kind of hardware that is
common and quite popular for graphics.

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:56.617
GPUs are graphics processing unit, and

00:00:56.617 --> 00:01:00.740
they're particularly well suited for
doing password kind of calculations or

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.030
brute force kind of attacks
we're talking about.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.013
So a GPU with available software
can do 10 to the power 8.

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:14.710
So that's 100 million hashes it
can compute and check per second.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.332
Okay, so if the password is only,
let's say six random upper or

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:24.297
lowercase, okay, 26 lowercase,
26 uppercase, all digits,

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:27.993
that will give us 62 total
number of characters.

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:32.702
If you have 62 possibilities,
and it's 6 characters long,

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:36.680
the first character, there's 62 choices.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.692
The second character,
there's 62 choices, the 6th character,

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:42.120
there's 62 choices.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.220
So total number of possible passwords
we can have is 62 times 62,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.490
6 times, or 62 to the power of 6.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.350
If you actually do your calculation,
you see how much that is.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.807
Divide that number by 10 to the power 8,

00:01:57.807 --> 00:02:00.483
because that's how many
we can do per second.

00:02:00.483 --> 00:02:04.291
If you try to find that out,
you'll see that this calculation, or

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.098
this brute force attack,
guessing attack we're talking about,

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.600
can be carried out in about 10 minutes.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.640
One thing we do is we increase
the size of the password.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.370
We ask people to pick longer passwords.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
So from six if we go to eight,
of course, the effort for

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.300
that hacker is going to go up.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.416
It's going to go up
from minutes to days.

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:29.472
But if you take eight random characters
of the same kind, you would actually

00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:34.170
get 62 to the power of 8,
because there are 62 choices for each.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.460
If you add special characters, the
calculation would change a little bit,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.670
but if you calculate this number, again
divide this by 10 to the power of 8,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.170
it's going to give you 6 days.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.586
You don't have to limit yourself
if you're the attacker to one GPU.

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:50.338
If you add GPU, this kind of
computation can be done in parallel and

00:02:50.338 --> 00:02:52.702
you can reduce the time
if it's too long.

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:56.850
But the idea here is that brute force
guessing of passwords, even when

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.510
they're reasonable respectable length,
is certainly doable for an attacker.
