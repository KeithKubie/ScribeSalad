00:00:00.321 --> 00:00:03.988
(gentle instrumental music)

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.460
- Congratulations on your pregnancy.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.280
When it comes time to choose where

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.450
you'll get your prenatal care
you have wonderful options.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.180
The provider types we will discuss today

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
include obstetrician,
certified nurse-midwife,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.080
family medicine physician,
and maternal fetal

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.560
medicine or perinatology specialist.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.900
At the end we'll review helpful questions

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.210
to ask when choosing a healthcare

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.600
provider for your pregnancy and birth.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.340
Let's meet the team.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.020
- I'm Gina Frugoni and
I'm an obstetrician.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.810
An obstetrician is a medical doctor

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.040
who has completed a
four-year residency training

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.520
after medical school in
obstetrics and gynecology.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.740
An obstetrician or OB-GYN cares
for women during pregnancy,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.140
birth, post-partum and often continues

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.360
gynecologic care after delivery.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.740
Obstetricians care for women
with low- and high-risk

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.870
pregnancies and they're trained to be able

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.910
to perform a vacuum or
forceps assisted delivery,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.770
as well as a cesarean
delivery if necessary.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.710
Here at UC San Diego
Health, medical students,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.740
nursing students and residents

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.000
may be part of your treatment team.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.690
Residents are medical doctors who are

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.620
pursuing further training
in their chosen field.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.070
They are supervised by
attending physicians,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.970
but also have considerable experience

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.930
in obstetrics and may be working

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.823
collaboratively with your provider.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.320
- I am Janna Ekholm and I'm
a certified nurse-midwife.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.590
A certified nurse-midwife has
completed a Master's degree

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.370
and is certified and licensed
in both nursing and midwifery.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.740
We have expertise in
providing pre-natal care

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.950
to women with normal, healthy pregnancies,

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.770
as well as care during labor and birth.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.410
If concerns arise, we work
together with our physicians

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.160
to ensure the health of mother and baby.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.620
At UC San Diego midwives care for women

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.150
in both a traditional
labor and delivery unit,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.763
as well as a unique spa-like birth center.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.530
- Hello, my name is Rebecca Rosen

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.960
and I'm a family medicine doctor.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.410
A family medicine physician
is a medical doctor

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.340
who is trained to care for
all members of the family,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.900
including babies, children,
parents and grandparents.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.190
Some family medicine physicians
provide obstetrical care

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.240
and perform vaginal deliveries,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.410
and some even perform caesarian sections.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.780
Family medicine provides
a comprehensive approach

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740
for the whole family and
allows for continuity of care.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.520
Most often the same doctor
will be able to follow you

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.240
through your prenatal care, your delivery,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.113
your post-partum care,
and your newborn's care.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.100
Family medicine physicians typically work

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.160
with low-risk pregnancies, but we are

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.920
also able to address
common medical problems

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.830
that affect many pregnant
women such as asthma,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.600
diabetes, allergies and
headaches, to name a few.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.273
We thrive on helping you and
your growing family thrive.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.650
- I'm Sandy Ramos and I'm
perinatologist here at UC SD.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.360
A perinatologist is also
known as a maternal-fetal

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.260
medicine physician or a
high-risk obstetrician

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.270
and it's a specialist obstetrician

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.370
who cares for women with
very high-risk pregnancies.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.050
Typically you are referred
to a perinatologist

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.980
by your pregnancy provider if
your pregnancy is high-risk

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.071
enough to warrant this
type of specialized care.

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.880
A perinatologist can also be assessed

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.290
at any point during pregnancy
if medical complications arise

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.320
and some of us also have our specialty

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.900
clinics where we see
high-risk pregnancies.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.050
Perinatologists have
special training in fetal

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.870
ultrasonography and here
at UC San Diego Health,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.640
all our patients are offered
an anatomy ultrasound

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.550
where a perinatologist is evaluating

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.053
the fetus between 18 to 22
weeks of gestational age.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.080
- Now that you know your options

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.000
here are some helpful questions to ask

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.890
when considering which provider to choose.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.620
Who is likely to be delivering my baby?

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.360
Many providers form a call
pool with other providers

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.750
in their group who may
actually be the ones

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.460
to deliver you if you go into labor

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.283
when your provider is not on call.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.110
Where do you deliver your patients?

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.370
It's important to find
out about the hospital

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.120
or birthing center where you
will be delivering your baby.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.180
Some questions to considers include

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.470
how close the hospital is to your home,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.230
if they offer on-site lactation support,

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.490
if there are private post-partum rooms,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.440
and if they offer vaginal
birth after cesarean section.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.530
For midwives and family
practice physicians

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.470
it's also helpful to ask if
my labor becomes complicated

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.113
who will you consult if I
need a cesarean section?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.150
Most importantly, make sure you feel

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.670
comfortable with your provider.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.640
You deserve to be cared for by someone

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.391
you trust during your pregnancy.

00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:48.058
