00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How did we search before we had computers?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Mark Weber:] People with clay tablet's, which have writing on them, would sometimes have

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
cross-references to other clay tablet's.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's kind of the origin of Bing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Telegraphy--you could send in a query, like to a search engine, as a telegram

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and get it back by post.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There were a lot of people that were thinking about how to use technology to search.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The search engine is basically where you're looking through every word in every document

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that might be up on the web that's accessible to find a match.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's really just the same as if you went into a library ad you spent, in this case,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it would take days to sit there and go through every page of book,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
looking for all the occurrences of--I don't know--the word "aardvark."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Obviously, that's something that's really painful to do in the real world,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but powerful computers can make that so fast

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that it actually becomes a reasonable way to search for information.
