00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.180
Hello, welcome, everyone.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.610
My name's Matias Duarte, and I'm
here to tell you a little bit

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.580
about Material now--
right here, right now.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.940
So happy birthday, Material.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.890
It's kind of a cheat.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.550
We haven't actually
reached a full year.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.370
We're one month
shy, but it's still

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.775
a pretty amazing milestone,
a pretty exciting milestone.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.300
Last year at I/O, we
introduced Material Design.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.040
We wanted to make a system
for designing across platforms

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.030
and across screen sizes.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.700
We wanted to combine the
best of modern graphic design

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.820
with the real utility and
usability of surfaces.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.340
And most of all,
we wanted to create

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.380
a system that put motion
at the heart of design

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.610
and didn't slap it on
as an afterthought.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.350
And, believe it or
not, when we did this,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.780
and we brought it to
you all last year,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.354
we didn't actually know
how it would be received.

00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:26.395
We were a little nervous.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.640
And it turns out, we actually
got some love for it.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.140
Right on the first
day, we started

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.980
seeing some pretty nice quotes.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.890
The tech press was able
to see and understand

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.270
what Material was about.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.220
Developers started
responding immediately

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.480
with real appreciation for
what Material was about.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.020
And, of course, most
importantly, designers

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.250
seemed to really
understand what we

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.540
were trying to do
with Material-- trying

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.990
to create a system that
would help and support them

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.580
in the challenges that
they have designing

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.070
for all the interactive
platforms that we have.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.200
So, phew, like, yeah, we could
all leave the I/O keynote,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.785
go to the bar, have
a drink, relax.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.010
So this made us
feel really good,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.140
at least maybe, for
that first week.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.760
But the real question
that we have,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.470
and I'm sure a question that
a lot of you have as well,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.610
is, how useful is Material?

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.230
And because we're
Google, we like numbers,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.140
so we're going to take a look at
Material Design by the numbers

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.350
to start off this session.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.150
Let's start looking
at our guidelines,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.060
the Material Design guidelines,
what we affectionately call

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.390
the 'spec.' Over the last year,
a little less than a year,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.470
it had 2.5 million
unique visitors.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.740
I think that's pretty good.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.573
I mean, maybe if you're
a YouTube celebrity,

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:07.480
or you're doing cat
videos, that's not so good.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.670
But for a design guideline, we
thought that was pretty good.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.210
In fact, even more importantly
that that, more than half

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:23.760
of you, in fact, over 60% of
you are returning visitors.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.870
And that means Material
Design wasn't just

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.870
something you checked out
once, but it was actually

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.260
a recurring, useful reference.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.070
And we see tremendous
activity in the color section,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.010
in the typography section,
in the iconography section,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.610
and, of course, in the
component section, like the FAB

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.670
and other specifications
like that.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.100
So not just designers
seem to be getting

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.750
some use out of Material,
but developers as well.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.580
If we look at Polymer, which
is Google's system for bringing

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.320
Material components
to the web, we

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.840
see that developers have
looked at Polymer's paper

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.700
elements also 2 and
1/2 million times--

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.186
the specifications for how to
use Polymer paper elements.

00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:23.560
And more importantly than how
many times they've actually

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.100
referenced these is
how many paper elements

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.480
are actually integrated
into products,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.000
which has been 100,000
paper elements out there

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.540
on the web, which is really
good for a framework that

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.490
wasn't even out of beta
until Jason announced it

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.120
this morning.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:45.950
Now, of course,
you're all wondering

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.100
about Android--
Material on Android.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.580
Now, it has been pretty exciting
to see Material apps come out

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.870
on Android.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.890
And if we look at
them by the numbers,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.000
we see nearly a quarter
million material apps

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.710
in the Play Store, apps that
are taking advantage of Material

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.370
Design by either targeting
Lollipop or using

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.350
appcompat libraries.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.810
Now, maybe that number doesn't
seem big enough for you.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.700
Your thinking, oh,
my gosh, there's

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.060
like a billion Android
devices out there,

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.130
or how many did
gajillion Android

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.230
apps have been in the Play
Store over the last seven years.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.130
But if we put that
number in perspective,

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.570
and we think about Lollipop
being released in October

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.470
of last year, and we look at
how many new apps, new Android

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.260
apps, entered the Play Store
since Lollipop was released,

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.920
we see that the materialized
apps account for more than 40%

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.590
of those apps.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.570
More than 40% of the new
apps in the Play Store

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:55.540
are materialized.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.290
And when you think
about how many of those

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.870
apps happen to be
games, that number

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.020
starts looking really good.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.790
That means that basically more
than one in three new apps

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.809
are taking advantage
of Material.

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.100
Yeah, you can applaud for that.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.680
That's OK.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.000
No, it is actually a
really exciting start.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.280
But we want to make
that number even bigger.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.310
Design is never
done, so we're going

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.860
to spend a little
bit of time now

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.780
talking about how we can
make those numbers bigger,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.330
how we can make those
numbers grow faster,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.630
how we can make it easier for
all of you to bring Material

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.600
into your apps and
into your designs.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.230
We've been continuously updating
the Material Design guidelines

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.780
to be better and
more comprehensive

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.980
since we launched.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.710
And since we launched it,
we've updated the guidelines

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.580
two times already.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.340
The first time, in
November of last year,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:05.310
we gave you all sorts of new
sections on organizing objects,

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.690
navigation drawers,
scrolling techniques,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.410
as well as swipe to
refresh product icons.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.800
In April, we gave you
another update, more guidance

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.070
around app structured,
data tables.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.450
We give you writing
guidelines for Material,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.500
a whole bunch of other things.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.580
Today, we're giving you the
biggest update to the Material

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.542
guidelines since
we launched them--

00:07:30.542 --> 00:07:33.380
a whole bunch of new stuff.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.190
So it includes refinements
to design patterns that you

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.260
know and love, like the FAB.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.420
Turns out, a lot of you
really liked using the FAB.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.730
When we launched the spec, we
only provided limited guidance

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.710
on how you could use
the floating action

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.890
button and the different
ways it could transform.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.397
But many of you thought that
the FAB could be more flexible

00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:59.480
and that you could use it
to trigger a whole bunch

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.620
of new things, and we agree.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.960
So today, we've expanded
the number of patterns

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.660
at the FAB supports
and trying to give you

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.870
a little bit more
flexibility in how

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.810
you can integrate the floating
action button into your apps.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.550
Since so many of you are
visiting the guidelines

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.480
for help with icons, we
decided to invest in a brand

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.630
new dedicated resource for that.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.210
So today, we're
expanding the spec

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.049
to include the
Material Icon Library.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:40.500
This site basically contains
750 icons, more than 750 icons,

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.520
for you to use in your projects,
in an easily organized way

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.660
that you can browse through and
that you can search through,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.220
and that gives you one click
easy downloads for icons,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.580
for integration
into your projects.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.330
App developers can
just find exactly what

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.590
you need in all the
screen resolutions and all

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.140
the densities that
you need in one place.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.500
More than that,
for web developers,

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.920
we're actually releasing all
of the icons as a web font.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.150
Yeah, it's very cool, and
it has a super cool feature

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.100
that makes it very
easy to integrate icons

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.250
whereby using the ligature's
features of modern type

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.530
systems, you're actually
able to type the icon name

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.602
and have it ligature
itself into the icon.

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.060
If you're a type
geek, you'll think

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.430
this is the coolest thing ever.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.040
We have a whole talk tomorrow
about Material Design icons--

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.140
Material Design Icons
Made Easy at 10:30 AM,

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.330
if you want to learn more
about how to use the site,

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:53.250
how to use the font, all
the extra fun stuff there.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.240
Now, one of your biggest
requests about Material Design

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.820
was help in adapting designs
and layouts to different screen

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.260
sizes.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.140
So today, we're adding
a major new section

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.770
to the guidelines
specifically focused

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.580
on adapting Material layouts.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.535
We're providing
detailed guidance

00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:19.910
on break points between layouts,
a scalable consistent grid,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.290
surface behaviors
and relationships

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.790
across those break points.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.730
So these adaptive guidelines and
examples, these new patterns,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.670
are going to help you
create apps that gracefully

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.560
adapt to any context.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.610
We have a talk on
understanding the details

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.390
of these new patterns,
also tomorrow

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.490
at 9:00 AM and later at 1:30
PM, if the party tonight

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.170
is a little too good for you.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.690
Now, combined with these new
patterns for adaptive design,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.680
we're releasing another section
of the site-- a device metrics

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.400
reference.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.730
Now, this reference
is going to help

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.930
you get all the
types of information

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.360
you might want for designing
for arbitrary devices,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.920
whether they're wearables,
whether they're phones,

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.090
whether they're tablets,
whether they're laptops.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.670
You're going to be able to
get key dimensions, densities,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.400
and all those other metrics.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.070
But, most importantly,
this reference

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.980
helps you understand for the
screen size is that you're

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.950
interested in how
to plug those values

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.670
in to the adaptive templates.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.670
This means you're going
to be able to understand

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.130
which template and which
pattern in these new adaptive

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.300
templates you should be
using for which devices,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.240
which orientation.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.890
These two resources
together are going

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.770
to take all of the uncertainty
that you have right now out

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:50.250
of creating layouts that scale
across different screen sizes

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.660
and orientations.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.040
And we hope it'll be really,
really useful for you.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.280
Well, you guys kept asking
for it, so I hope you like it.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.710
And, of course, there's
a lot more updates

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.270
in the guidelines themselves.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.610
We have a new
section on describing

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.940
motion in meaningful
ways, sections

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.960
on launch screens, empty
states, and a ton more updates

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.990
and refinements.

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.790
Now, as Material
Design has evolved,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:27.090
more and more
products across Google

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.300
are also implementing the
guidelines into their systems

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.630
and platforms.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.740
So today, we're also
releasing new guidelines

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.390
that specifically
target television, auto,

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.820
and VR in the form
of Google Cardboard.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.310
We have a talk on
designing for VR tomorrow

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.530
at 11 AM and a talk on
Designing for Driving

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:56.550
tomorrow at 12:30 that'll dive
deeper into these guidelines.

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.590
Together, all of this really
makes it our biggest update

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.230
to material Design, the
specification, the guideline,

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.290
the system that
helps you design.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:11.120
We hope you'll like
that, and we hope

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.640
you'll continue to
give us feedback,

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.930
so we can continue to give you
even more updates in the months

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:17.860
and years to come.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.470
We wanted to do something
a little more though.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.870
We wanted to go beyond
just guidelines, tools,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.080
and references that
are perhaps static,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:37.410
dry, authoritative,
fixed in those ways.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:43.410
So today, we've refreshed the
official Google Design site

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.470
to be a place where our
designers can connect directly

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.500
with the community of
designers and developers.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.842
We want to have a place where
we can share why we're thinking

00:13:53.842 --> 00:13:55.550
about things the way
that we're thinking,

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.390
how we go about designing,
a place where we can host

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.880
practical articles, for example,
articles and videos addressing

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.630
common concerns for designers
and developers that are working

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.430
in Material, like, "How Can I
Go Material Without Losing My

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.040
Brand Identity?"

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.730
This article's gone live
today, and we have a talk

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.280
also complementing it tomorrow
on Expressing Your Brand

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.900
Material, also at 12:30.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.310
Or articles with tips
on designing easily

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.680
between different platforms,
whether you're starting on iOS

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.580
or starting on Android
or starting on the web,

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.025
we want you to be comfortable
using Material everywhere.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.760
And, of course, more tutorials
and, what I personally

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.660
enjoy the most, some
behind-the-scenes videos,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.310
footage, and lots
more things like that.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.900
So I hope you'll check that
out, and I hope that will also

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.120
be useful for you.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.330
Now, all these things
are great for designers

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:07.080
when you're thinking
about what you

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.550
want to express in Material.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.020
But the other thing
you kept asking us for

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.780
was more help in actually
implementing material.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.774
And since this is a
developer conference,

00:15:18.774 --> 00:15:20.190
you know it seems
like a good time

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.035
to talk about what we've
done there as well.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.350
So, of course, we want
to start with Polymer.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:30.180
Last year we announced Polymer,
and, as we've said today,

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.670
as Jason announced
today, Polymer

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.010
has gone into 1.0 out
of developer preview,

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.870
out of beta today.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.310
What that means is that Polymer
is far more performant, far

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:46.100
more stable, and has a
fixed set of APIs now.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.140
And Polymer has
really been scoped

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:51.830
across all modern web
platforms, including

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.140
modern mobile platforms.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.700
So if you're designing
with Polymer,

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.270
you're building
with Polymer, you

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.480
have something that can
really scale to all the places

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.580
that the web wants to go.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.210
They tell me that
they've rewritten

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.300
every single line of code
in Polymer for speed,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.940
and it is blazing fast.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.220
And what this means,
if you're using

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.730
Material Design with Polymer,
is that all of those Material

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.940
paper elements that
you've been using so far,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.010
they are now ready
for production,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.890
letting you build high quality
app-like experiences anywhere

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.850
on the web.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.060
In addition to that, there's
a new Polymer starter kit

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.840
and a catalog that is going
to allow you to learn and play

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.010
with all of these
new paper elements

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.040
another Polymer elements
before you even get started

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.120
building a materialized app.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.140
It includes demos, samples,
very easy browsing,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.240
and what they tell me is
a really cool shopping

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.600
cart so that you can just
download Polymer paper

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.740
elements without having
to open your command line.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.696
Of course, on Android,
Material is available in L,

00:17:00.696 --> 00:17:04.339
and you will notice it is
faster and more battery

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.020
efficient in the M
developer preview.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.910
But there are two
things that you're all

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.990
asking for out of
Material and Android;

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.880
you want more
turn-key components,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.460
and you want backwards
compatibility.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.310
So the Support Library
family has always

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.109
been our traditional answer
to backwards compatibility.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.170
It's a plug-and-play
system that makes

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:31.820
it possible to
implement features

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.420
from the newer
versions of Android

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:36.330
into apps deployed
on older versions.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.740
And when we launched
Material last year,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.500
we gave your appcompat
library, which

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.510
gave you some basic layout
support for Material

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.600
and some basic styling.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.450
Today, we're introducing
a new library

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:55.120
in the Support Library family,
the Android design Library.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.220
And this library enables
you to take both the core

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.540
elements of Material Design
to these previous versions

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.880
of Android, and,
most importantly,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.310
it gives you really turn-key
encapsulated implementations

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.040
of all of the major
Material Design elements

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.970
that you've been asking for.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.630
So let's look at some
of those elements.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.490
Before, even though the
FAB was a relatively simple

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.700
implementation, you still
have to stitch together

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.340
maybe five or six XML files.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.384
Today, you can just add a single
floating action button tag,

00:18:27.384 --> 00:18:28.050
and you're done.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.040
The new library includes
an easy off-the-shelf card

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:45.560
implementation with
shadows, side navigation,

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.360
which we know is
very complicated

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.540
to implement with all
the details in the spec.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:55.420
Now you can just drop in a
Navigation Drawer view and all

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.470
of the details,
metrics, behaviors

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.950
are taken care of for you.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.210
You Just put your Drawer items
in a menu tag, and that's it;

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.630
you're ready to go.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.860
Similarly, we're
making it just as easy

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.360
to build Material
tabs into your app.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.610
And one of my favorites is
the toolbar scrolling, also

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:24.700
a very complex nuanced
interactive spec,

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.770
and, today, every aspect
of the scrolling spec

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:32.140
is now baked into one component,
and you can just simply specify

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.000
which behaviors you want--
the pinning, the collapsing,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.200
the scrolling offscreen.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.170
It's all there.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.790
We introduced Palette last year.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:49.730
Palette is fantastic
for really integrating

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.470
your content and your apps.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.170
Today, we're giving you
an upgrade to Palette,

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.710
making it six times faster.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:02.700
And these are just some of
the highlights of the Material

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.980
capabilities that you get.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:09.580
Check out the developer
site for more details.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.400
And, as I mentioned before,
Support Lib doesn't just

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.920
get you complete
material components that

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.400
are easier to deploy, it lets
you deploy material to more

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.230
Android devices.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:26.100
Today, Lollipop represents
only 10% of Android devices.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.450
By using these newly released
Material components in Support

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:32.810
Lib, you can now
bring all of them

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:39.100
all the way back to Android 2.1.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.090
You can lose your
shit over that one.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:41.890
That's worth it.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.800
So we want to help
you embrace Material,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.690
and we want to evolve Material
in response to your needs.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:21:00.110
And material doesn't just evolve
through the things that we do,

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:03.110
but in the concert and
conversation with you.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.050
So over the last year
we've also launched

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:08.740
a number of different programs
to help keep us connected

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.190
and have this dialogue happen.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.840
And I want to highlight
a couple of those today.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.900
For starters, we've
launched a program

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.010
that we call Design
Sprints at Google.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.690
These are full-day
workshops in our design

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.830
space called The Garage
on Mountain View campus.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:32.060
And we bring companies and teams
of designers, program managers,

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.570
and engineers together to
tackle specific problems

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:40.350
in their product
development, helping them

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:42.970
not just with the
materialization of their app,

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.050
but with any aspect
of their app design.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:49.420
This has been just
a fantastic resource

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:55.430
for teaching and reaching out,
but also really understanding

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.610
what are the problems that
your teams are facing as you're

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.020
building applications.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:05.560
And it's been a really intense
process, but the response to it

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.260
has been absolutely fantastic.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.270
And, as you saw on
the previous slide,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.130
we've engaged with 17
companies, and we're

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.200
continuing to do that.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.340
It's been really,
really worthwhile.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:23.790
In addition to that, we've run
over 100 design reviews, which

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.630
are smaller, one- to two-hour
focused sessions, where we have

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.390
some of our designers
meet with some

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.590
of the designers on
your teams, walking

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:38.410
through specific aspects of
implementing Material Design.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.680
Again, this has just
been an amazing way

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.140
to help us stay connected as
we help you implement Material

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.340
Design both from a technical
and a design standpoint.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:54.690
Now, I was going to advertise
the fact that we're doing many

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.930
Designer . views here at I/O all
day today and all day tomorrow

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.400
in the Design Sandbox.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:05.080
But they tell me these are
actually sold out already.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.460
So if you've already booked
yourself for one of them,

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.660
don't miss your time
window, or it'll

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.620
be given away to somebody else.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.440
And if you couldn't make
it to those Designer Views,

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.240
please do reach out
to design@google.com.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.380
Both the Design Spring program
and the Designer View programs

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.370
are really an important
part of the process for us.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.900
They're something
we want to give

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.680
to the community as a service.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.880
We really want you all to
take advantage of them.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.820
And, of course, in addition
to the Designer Views

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.947
that we're doing here at
I/O, since you probably

00:23:44.947 --> 00:23:46.780
can't make it to them
if you haven't already

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.800
booked for them, we
do have a full slate

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.730
of Design Talks all
day tomorrow as well.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.780
Once again, showing
that design has

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.750
become really
important to Google

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.440
not just for our products,
but for our outreach

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.280
and our connection to you.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.780
Please, please come
check them out.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:13.490
Last, but certainly
not least, last year,

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:19.260
we hosted Google's first
design conference in Fort Mason

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.890
here in San Francisco.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:25.318
Let's take a quick look at
the video recap of that event.

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:27.274
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:28.252 --> 00:24:36.550
[MUSIC LUKE VIBERT, "WE HEAR
 YOU"]

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:27.370
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.640
That was an amazing event.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.600
I don't know how many of you
have a chance to go to it,

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.160
but it was an
incredible opportunity

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.850
to connect to the
design community,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.060
and we had visitors from
all over the planet,

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.140
actually, brought into the
San Francisco for that.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:43.970
We had talks.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:44.750
We have panels.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:50.050
We had hands-on workshops,
and we're planning an encore.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.080
So please stay tuned for
plans on what the next Form

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.450
conference will look like.

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:06.480
So, at the end of the
day, Material Design

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.460
is really just a
means to an end.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.350
The reason we did
this is because we

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:17.980
want to help you create more
beautiful, more immersive, more

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.490
intuitive experiences for your
users, for your customers.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.760
So it's only fitting that
we close out this session,

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:30.110
and we shift now to take
some time to talk about some

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.000
of the amazing things that
you've all done with Material

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.340
over the last year.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.940
We had a chance to talk to a
number of the companies that

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.970
have gone through this
process of going Material

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:42.890
and hear their stories.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.250
So now we'd like to share
a few details about some

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.125
of their experiences.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.940
First up, is Trello,
a productivity app

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.740
that helps you organize
and share various projects.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.040
And you can see Hamid here
found that the process

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.720
of materializing Trello
was useful in really

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.940
focusing the product itself
and focusing the design.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.840
Material served
as a filter, which

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.150
they found engaging
and satisfying for how

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.820
their app should evolve.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.640
But more than that, they also
saw some pretty significant

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.389
impact to some of the metrics
that they really cared about.

00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:30.055
That's the kind of
thing we like to see.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.680
Let's look at The Hunt, which is
an app that helps you discover

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.260
and share fashion styles.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.560
Again, Jenny really
appreciated how

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.720
Material was like
an augmentation

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.150
to the design team,
not something that

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.190
was in conflict or contrast
to the design expression

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.560
that they wanted to have,
but something that helped

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.490
accelerate them.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.670
And that also really
makes you feel good.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.790
That's exactly what
we were aiming for.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:01.730
And likewise, The
Hunt team told us

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:06.600
that they had some impact--
some material impact,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:12.340
pun intended-- as a result
of the materialization

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.740
of their app.

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:23.940
Finally, Pocket Casts,
podcast aggregator,

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.550
was similarly excited
about how Material

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.760
helped evolve their brand,
their look and feel,

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:34.390
really made their app beautiful,
and for them, a 30% increase

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:36.160
in sales.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.140
And that's fantastic.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.380
So stories like this are
a testament to why we made

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:42.950
Material.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:45.280
This is exactly what
we're going for.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.720
We're trying to help accelerate
and focus and add to the things

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.790
that you are already
trying to do.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:58.140
And if any of you are
trying to maybe weigh

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.730
the trade offs between the
investment in going Material

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.350
or not, or trying to convince
other people about the benefits

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.330
of going Material,
we hope stories

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:10.700
like this are useful
to you as well.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.040
In fact, there's more stories
than we could possibly

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.620
tell at this point in time.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.740
But we've been so
excited about the work

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.220
that we've seen coming out
of all these developers

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.740
over the last year
that we decided

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.790
to do something a little more to
share some of these highlights

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:35.300
with a slightly larger audience.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.130
It was very hard,
but we've worked

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.230
with the Play team
and the Dev team

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.510
to select 18 of the most
outstanding Material apps

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.872
we've seen and create a
special showcase collection,

00:29:51.872 --> 00:29:54.080
and we'd would like to share
that with you right now.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:55.650
So let's look at this video.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.622
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:58.622 --> 00:30:04.574
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:53.700
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.210
Those are beautiful.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.840
It's amazing to see that we can
create a demo reel like this,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.420
like the one we showed at
I/O last year, but instead

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.380
of having it be full
of fake conceptual apps

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.040
that we just dreamed
up as examples

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.740
for how you could use Material,
now it's full of real apps

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.840
that you have brought to
life, embracing Material.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.240
And it's super, super
exciting to see that.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.280
So today, we're creating and
releasing this Material Design

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.060
showcase on the Play
Store to highlight

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.320
some of these amazing apps.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.570
So additionally, we
want to recognize

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:39.090
some specific
executions of Material

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.690
that we thought
were particularly

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.730
excellent or noteworthy.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.310
So we created a
Material Design award.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.180
And this year we
decided to give it out

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.580
to six different categories.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.930
And we'd like to
right now, today,

00:31:57.930 --> 00:32:01.720
publicly acknowledge these
particular Material Design

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.500
pioneers.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.860
They're all actually
sitting here in front,

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.180
so I'd like ask them to
stand up right now and get

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.210
us a round of applause, please.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.170
Thank you.

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.110
The whole team and myself
personally are just so

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:35.040
thrilled to see you actually
bring Material Design to life,

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.480
because a system by
itself is just an idea.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.100
It requires your hard work, your
dedication, your innovation,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.280
your creativity,
the extra sparks

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.050
that you bring to your
implementations of Material

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:51.810
that make it actually real
and make it actually tangible.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:52.690
So thank you again.

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:03.690
Oh, wrong slide-- backwards.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:09.170
So, in summary, we're
just absolutely thrilled

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:14.490
by the success of Material
in this first year.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:17.350
We want to keep
talking to you all.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.770
We want to see and learn
more from you all about what

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:25.560
is working, what isn't working,
what more you'd like to see,

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.000
what crazy ideas and
innovations you build on top of,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.360
which ways you push a
new twist the system,

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.170
and you break the system,
and you do all the things

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:39.830
that real innovators,
designers, and developers do.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.260
I'm really looking forward
to another fantastic

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.070
year of Material, working
together and seeing

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.270
where it goes from here.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:54.640
I hope we'll be here
together again next I/O

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.300
to celebrate Material's
second birthday,

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.490
but so far it's been a
fantastic first year,

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.520
and there's lots more
exciting stuff to come.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.470
So thank you, again,
all for coming here.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:12.060
I hear that drinks are
going to be served next,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.080
so I don't want to
keep you waiting

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.050
any longer than I have to.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:20.650
But let's raise a toast
to Material's first year

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.790
and Material's
first birthday when

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.620
we get together at the party.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.900
Thanks again.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.850
[APPLAUSE]
