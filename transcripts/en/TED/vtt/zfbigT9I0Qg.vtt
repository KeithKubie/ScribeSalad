00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:16.696
"Five hospitals in Aleppo
have been bombed."

00:00:17.952 --> 00:00:22.964
That was a text message that I received
on a dark winter night in November 2016.

00:00:23.877 --> 00:00:26.543
One of them was a children's hospital

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:27.885
run by my Syrian colleagues

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.812
at the Independent
Doctors Association, IDA.

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:34.459
It was the sixth time it had been bombed.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:38.814
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage
of the head nurse, Malak,

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.431
in the aftermath of the bombing,

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.185
grabbing premature babies
out of their incubators,

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.751
desperate to get them to safety,

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.842
before she broke down in tears.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.449
And I felt devastated.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.076
Fellow humanitarians and I
have spent blood, sweat and tears

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.569
rebuilding hospitals

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.193
so that our patients may live, not die.

00:01:01.238 --> 00:01:04.145
And through this work, I made a discovery.

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:08.065
The reason that people survive in crisis

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:12.763
is because of the remarkable work
of the people in crisis themselves.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:17.313
People survive because of the local
doctors, nurses and aid workers

00:01:17.337 --> 00:01:20.465
who are from the very heart
of the affected community,

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.022
the people who dare to work
where others can't or won't.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.307
People survive because
of people like Malak,

00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:32.117
who, despite sustaining a severe
burns injury in the line of duty,

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.950
the first thing she did
when discharged from hospital

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:37.172
was to go back caring for small children.

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:41.213
From the rubble of death and devastation

00:01:41.237 --> 00:01:44.504
arise the most gallant
and noble human beings.

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:48.434
Local humanitarians
are the beacons of light

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:49.992
in the darkness of war.

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.822
Now, the data shows
that Syrian organizations carry out

00:01:54.846 --> 00:01:58.154
75 percent of the humanitarian
work in Syria.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:05.000
Yet, they receive 0.3 percent
of the Syria aid budget.

00:02:05.895 --> 00:02:10.321
And what's more, the same is happening
across the crises of the world.

00:02:11.204 --> 00:02:13.204
I have witnessed this reality.

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:16.337
It means those with the knowledge,
skill and ability

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:17.866
to respond on the front lines

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.128
have little of the necessary tools,
equipment and resources

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:22.581
they need to save lives.

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:27.487
It means groups like IDA don't have funds
to rebuild their hospital.

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:32.069
The humanitarian system is failing
the most vulnerable communities

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:33.627
in their darkest hours.

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.450
Now, at the time
of receiving that message,

00:02:37.474 --> 00:02:39.491
I was on sabbatical from my clinical work,

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:40.680
setting up CanDo,

00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:43.347
a start-up determined
to address this imbalance

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.862
and enable local responders
to provide health care

00:02:45.886 --> 00:02:48.155
to their war-devastated communities.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.470
We had devised a simple model:

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.172
source trusted and impactful local groups,

00:02:54.196 --> 00:02:57.182
support their development
through an accelerator program

00:02:57.206 --> 00:03:01.059
and connect them to you
via our crowdfunding platform,

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.426
where they can fund-raise
for their health needs.

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.744
So when IDA asked for help,

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:09.537
I decided to launch CanDo
seven months early,

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.156
with very little money,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.292
and many people, including myself,
thought I had finally gone mad.

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:22.164
I wanted to do something
that transformed our collective anger

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:24.196
into something beautiful.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.488
And that's how
the People's Convoy was born.

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.329
It was a global crowdfunding campaign

00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:32.940
to enable IDA to rebuild
a whole new children's hospital,

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:37.393
and, if successful, we the people
would take the medical equipment

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.443
all the way from London
to the Syria border.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:41.883
And we did it.

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:45.007
Thousands of people came together
from across the world

00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:47.166
to achieve a global first:

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.305
we built the first-ever
crowdfunded hospital.

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:54.482
The location was carefully chosen
by the local experts, IDA,

00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:56.196
where they knew it would be safe

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.370
and serve the greatest number
of displaced children.

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:02.957
IDA was so moved by people's response,

00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.044
they named it "Hope Hospital."

00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:07.754
It's been open for exactly one year,

00:04:07.778 --> 00:04:10.711
and they have treated
over 15,000 children.

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:16.801
(Applause)

00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:21.761
We can provide lifesaving assistance
in the most volatile places on earth.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.872
The system needs to change,

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:28.886
and change starts with us all
sharing a new humanitarian vision,

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:33.815
one where you, global citizens
with skills, expertise and resources,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:37.077
stand together with the local responders;

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:40.514
one where we are all humanitarians,

00:04:40.538 --> 00:04:44.291
putting the necessary resources
in the hands of those who need them most

00:04:44.315 --> 00:04:48.053
and are best placed to use them
effectively and efficiently.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.442
We need to support the people
who are not only saving lives now,

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:56.767
but it will also be them stitching
their wounded communities back together,

00:04:56.791 --> 00:04:59.224
once a conflict is over to help them heal.

00:05:00.392 --> 00:05:04.672
Local humanitarians
have the courage to persist,

00:05:04.696 --> 00:05:06.667
to dust themselves off from the wreckage

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.006
and to start again,
risking their lives to save others.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.942
And we can match their courage
by not looking away or turning our backs,

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.537
by helping those
who are helping themselves,

00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:20.997
and together, save more lives.

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:23.107
Thank you.

00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:24.326
(Applause)

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.510
(Cheers)

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:29.940
(Applause)

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:31.868
Shoham Arad: Come over here, please.

00:05:32.538 --> 00:05:34.379
Why are hospitals being bombed?

00:05:34.966 --> 00:05:36.568
Rola Hallam: Yeah, good question.

00:05:36.592 --> 00:05:39.578
So, Physicians for Human Rights
have documented

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:41.237
nearly 500 attacks on hospitals

00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:44.013
and over 800 medical personnel
who have been killed --

00:05:44.037 --> 00:05:47.505
over 90 percent of it
by the Syrian regime --

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.523
and they say this is part
of a systemic targeting

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:52.033
and destruction of health care,

00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:53.435
using it as a weapon of war.

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:56.935
And the thing with this is
that it's not just our problem,

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:58.490
it's yours, too, and everyone's,

00:05:58.514 --> 00:06:00.867
because A, it exacerbates
the refugee situation --

00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:03.019
when you have a decimated
health care system,

00:06:03.043 --> 00:06:07.143
it means the next Ebola-type
epicenter of disease is going to be Syria;

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:09.932
and unfortunately, it sets
a very dangerous precedent

00:06:09.956 --> 00:06:13.420
that makes all of our hospitals
anywhere in the world dangerous,

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.222
and that is not how it should be.

00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:17.699
SA: So this actually
isn't just about money, either,

00:06:17.723 --> 00:06:19.121
CanDo isn't just about money.

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:22.870
Tell me what it means to you
that 5,000 people all over the world

00:06:22.894 --> 00:06:27.113
contributed 350,000 dollars
to build Hope Hospital.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.704
RH: I think the answer
is in that word, it's in hope.

00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:36.168
I think everyone who donated,
they had their faith in humanity renewed,

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:38.863
knowing there are people like IDA
and those doctors,

00:06:38.887 --> 00:06:41.403
who are exhibiting
the absolute best of humanity,

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:43.641
and it was like an absolute reciprocation.

00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:47.212
IDA and these Syrians
and many people in places of conflict

00:06:47.236 --> 00:06:49.339
feel very unheard and unseen.

00:06:49.363 --> 00:06:50.720
And I think the fact that --

00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:53.181
and they see things
through the prism of government,

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.149
so when they see government's not acting,

00:06:55.173 --> 00:06:58.006
they assume everyone
who lives in those places doesn't care.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.682
So when they see that display,

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.308
it really does just renew
everyone's faith in humanity.

00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:03.842
SA: Thank you, Rola.

00:07:03.866 --> 00:07:05.944
RH: Thank you.
SA: Thank you for everything.

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:07.118
(Applause)
