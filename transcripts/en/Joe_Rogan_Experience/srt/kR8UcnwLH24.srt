1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,820
Three, two, one and we're back.
What's up? How are you are back.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,070
I love it. Good. Nice to be back
here. When you first came here,

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,070
you were thinking about running for
president and now you're out there.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,880
We're all in. It's happening.
Yes. Nervous. No. Is it
weird? No. No. Not at all.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,980
Do you feel like this is like destiny?
No, that was enough. Feel weird.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,090
I'm on a mission. I'm on a
mission. Uh, you know, there,

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,800
there's a lot of issues I think
we're going to talk about,

8
00:00:25,801 --> 00:00:28,630
about why I'm running for president,
uh,

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,890
but being out and connecting with
people all across this country,

10
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:36,570
bringing this message, um, really
of, of ending these wasteful,

11
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,400
destructive,

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,400
a foreign policies that have been so
costly on the American people for so long.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,950
Cost the, on our troops Casi on our
veterans, ending these wasteful regime,

14
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,790
change wars,

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:53,060
ending this new cold war and nuclear
arms race and taking the trillions of

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,960
dollars that we've been spending on these
programs and that we will continue to

17
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:02,910
spend if the status quo is allowed to
continue and investing those dollars back

18
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,750
into serving the people.
In our communities serving
the people of this country.

19
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:11,250
Things like health care,
education, infrastructure,
protecting our environment,

20
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,740
clean water.
There's so much that we need to do.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,350
We've got limited resources
to accomplish that.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,970
These are my favorite things
that you talk about. Um,

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,540
my question is always though,

24
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,690
why do we spend so much time and money
and at such a titanic human costs.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,960
Yeah.
For these rigid regime change wars,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,670
what do you think is the cause
like other than the obvious,

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,920
if we,
you have a dictator that's in place,

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,510
there's an obvious outcry like Saddam
Hussein post nine 11. Other than that,

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:43,751
what is,

30
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:48,751
what is the reason why we invest so much
time and energy into regime change war?

31
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:53,940
So much so that we've just accepted that
this is a part of our gross economy.

32
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:57,720
Like if you're going to take all the
money that the United States earns and all

33
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:58,770
the money that goes to taxes,

34
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
we just automatically put a gigantic
chunk of that into investing in these wars

35
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:08,800
in other countries blindly.
Why is that?

36
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:13,350
Almost without any kind of
traditional real accountability. Uh,

37
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,650
six to $8 trillion is what's estimated
that's been spent since nine 11 alone on

38
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:24,261
these regime change wars without even
taking into account what the cost will

39
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,280
continue to be to take care of our
veterans, those who have gone and,

40
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,110
and fought in these wars and have
come home dealing with, you know,

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,140
visible and invisible wounds that,
that they'll have to live with for,

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,930
for the rest of their lives. Let's start
back. You mentioned Saddam Hussein.

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,180
Uh, I don't think it was necessarily
an obvious outcry. Saddam Hussein,

44
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:50,400
uh, and the toppling of his
regime was done for oil, right?

45
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,350
It was done for financial reasons and
the architects of that Iraq war, uh,

46
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:59,500
sold it in the guise of, hey, Saddam
Hussein is working with al Qaeda,

47
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:01,600
those terrorists who
attacked us on nine 11,

48
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,690
and he's going to give them his
weapons of mass destruction,

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,160
both of which turned out to be false
false intelligence and lies that were sold

50
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,120
to the American people, sold to
soldiers. People like me, uh, who,

51
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,870
who believed what they said. You
know, I enlisted after nine 11,

52
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,860
like so many people in this country to
go after the terrorists who had attacked

53
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,861
us on that day killing thousands of
Americans and they sold this lie,

54
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,960
uh, for financial gain for oil. You,

55
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,750
you look at some of the architects of
that Iraq war, guys like John Bolton,

56
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,670
who today is president Trump's
national security council director.

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,100
And you look at what's
happening in Venezuela,

58
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,540
almost the very same playbook
being used or they're selling this,

59
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,910
this regime change effort,
uh,

60
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,500
threatening to use US military force
to go in and topple a regime under the

61
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,300
guise of humanitarianism.

62
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,380
When in fact in Bolton has said this
on national television that well,

63
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:03,040
we really want to make sure that American
oil companies are able to go in and

64
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:06,460
access that oil rich country in Venezuela.

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,630
So you think that's why there's so
much turmoil in the country right now.

66
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,980
This is this battle over regime change
because of the fuck they want to control

67
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:16,390
the oil.
I think the,

68
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:21,391
the u s coming in and trying to insert
itself into what is happening in

69
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:26,020
Venezuela is what is, what is the problem?
So they're doing that through a very,

70
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:27,880
very heavy sanctions.
Uh,

71
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,090
they're doing that through various means
and threatening to use our military to

72
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:35,440
go in and topple the regime there rather
than taking the approach that I would

73
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:39,700
take as president, which is to
recognize that the people of Venezuela,

74
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,010
like people in other countries in the
world need to be the ones to determine

75
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,330
their governance and their future.

76
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,530
Just like we wouldn't want any other
country to come in and threaten to use

77
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,190
their military to topple our government
or to tell us who should or shouldn't be

78
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,000
the leaders in our country. We shouldn't
be doing that in their country.

79
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:03,420
There are a serious issues that are
causing a lot of suffering for the

80
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,060
Venezuelan people.
If we really want to be helpful,

81
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
we should be a force to help move towards
reconciliation and peace rather than

82
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,880
what this administration
is doing, which is, uh,

83
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,980
throwing fuel on the
flames of a civil war.

84
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:23,170
That will be devastating.
Devastating.

85
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:27,340
When you say move towards reconciliation
now, well you see there's differences,

86
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:27,581
right?

87
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,600
There's the people who are
with the current government
in Venezuela and there is

88
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:36,370
the opposition. Clearly they have
differences on what kind of future,

89
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,390
what kind of governance and who
should lead that government, uh,

90
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,600
going forward rather than
threatening to use the United States,

91
00:05:43,601 --> 00:05:47,140
the United States coming in and trying
to act once again as the world's police.

92
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,670
Uh, which by the way, throughout
history has not had good results,

93
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,710
not for the people in those countries.
What to speak of the cost that, uh, we,

94
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,750
the American people pay. Okay.
Rather than saying, hey, let's,

95
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,160
let's work towards peace,

96
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,870
try to push for diplomacy and find what
are the conditions that would make some

97
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,130
form of reconciliation,

98
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,990
uh, going forward. Is
there an argument, and I'm,

99
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,650
I really don't know the answer to this,

100
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:17,160
but is there an argument that these
regime change wars, although terrible,

101
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,900
we would be way worse off

102
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,320
if those weren't in place.

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,750
I think that's an argument that proponents
for regime change wars try to make,

104
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,550
but history shows and proves
that the very opposite is true.

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,000
Look at Iraq. You can look at
Libya, you can look at Syria,

106
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,420
you can look at Guatemala and Ecuador.
You can look at other countries, uh,

107
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,343
Iran,

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,990
where in the past we have either
overtly or covertly through the CIA,

109
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,730
gone in and toppled, uh, leaders of
countries are dictators or regimes.

110
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,090
And the result has been more suffering
for the people in those countries.

111
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:56,990
Their lives have been made worse off,

112
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,730
not only in the short term but
in the long term. And the cost,

113
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:05,410
once again to the American people has
also taken a toll as we see more and more

114
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:09,060
of our hard earned taxpayer dollars
going to pay for these wars. Uh,

115
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,650
these regime change efforts
that are counter to our
national security interests,

116
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,240
counter to the interests of the American
people encountered the interest of the

117
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:17,410
people in those countries.

118
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,710
So is this one of those things is just
a counterintuitive thing where you would

119
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,630
think that getting rid of someone
like Kadafi would be a good idea?

120
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,780
He's a terrible evil person,
but they get rid of them. Now.

121
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,140
Libya is a failed state. It's,
it's horrible what is happening.

122
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:37,640
And Livia as a result of that, as you
said, watch slave auctions on youtube.

123
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,050
It's insane.
Exactly.

124
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,090
It's hard to imagine that
an era of Youtube and slave
auctions exists in a place

125
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,470
that,
you know,

126
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,471
at least some part of the blame has to
be on supporting the rebels that went in

127
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:54,000
and took out Kadafi like
it's not good to have. See,

128
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,430
it's one of those counterintuitive things,
right?

129
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,070
Where it's not good to have an evil
person in control of a country,

130
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,250
but it's also not good to kill
him. I think. Get rid of them.

131
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,200
And then this power vacuum,
right?

132
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,220
Yeah. It's that, um, it's,

133
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:10,430
it's hard to accept sometimes the reality
that there are bad people in the world.

134
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,510
Yeah. There are leaders of countries
who are doing bad things against,

135
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,110
there are people.
What the real question is,

136
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:20,080
is we recognize this is the
world that exists in reality,

137
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:23,140
not the world that we wish existed.

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,100
And then the question is for
the leaders of our country is

139
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,300
what role should the United States play?

140
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,320
Does it make sense to try to
act as the world's police?

141
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,210
As we have been for far too long,

142
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,840
both as we look at what is in the
best interest of the American people,

143
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:44,340
what's in the best interest of our
national security as well as, uh,

144
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,700
what impact will our actions have
on the people in these countries?

145
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,660
And with Libya, not only do we
see strengthened terrorist groups,

146
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:54,630
there are terrorist groups all
over Libya now failed state.

147
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,980
The Libyan are suffering, uh, now
far more than they were before.

148
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,280
But we see the ramifications of that in
countries like North Korea where again,

149
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:10,770
John Bolton in the Trump administration
is talking about using the Libya model

150
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,270
with North Korea as we work towards this
objective of denuclearize the Korean

151
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,450
peninsula.
Uh,

152
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,450
one of the leaders in the North Korean
government just said the other day,

153
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,690
the United States government is talking
about using the Libya model with North

154
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,000
Korea to get them to get rid
of their nuclear weapons.

155
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:34,540
They don't want to end up like Libya
or Iraq. Where in Libya is you?

156
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,480
Remember the United States
went in and told Gadhafi, Hey,

157
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:41,280
get rid of your nuclear weapons program
and we're not going to come after you.

158
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,400
And he did.
He got rid of it.

159
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,730
And what happened a very short time later
the United States and other countries

160
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:50,950
went in and took him out.
So that action in that decision,

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that policy is directly undermining our
national security and our efforts to

162
00:09:56,141 --> 00:10:00,550
make us and the world more safe to
denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

163
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,080
So would the argument for
regime change wars being that,

164
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:09,310
would it be that if we didn't go over
there and if we didn't have a military

165
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:12,040
presence and we didn't
make them fight against us,

166
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,130
that they would somehow or another
gain more power and they would,

167
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,690
we would deal with this
evil superpower is this,

168
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,760
there's this like the worst case scenario
for the pro interventionist foreign

169
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,430
policy.

170
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,230
I wouldn't even, I wouldn't
even go that far. I mean, the,

171
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:31,030
the argument that's made by people who
are advocating for these regime change

172
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:36,031
wars is we've got to do something
to help people who are suffering.

173
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,890
That's generally the
argument that's made a,

174
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,430
and they sell this to the American people
knowing that, hey, we, uh, we have,

175
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,580
we have good hearts and we
want to help people if we can.

176
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,980
But what they fail to do is to tell the
truth and be honest about what they are

177
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:58,850
hiding behind this guys of
humanitarianism, right? I mean,

178
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:00,920
if you look at Saudi Arabia for example,

179
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,620
and you look at the kinds of atrocities
that, that theocratic dictatorship, uh,

180
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,480
is conducting against its own people,

181
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:12,481
decapitating Lgbtq people
persecuting religious minorities,

182
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,530
uh,
being the biggest propagator of this,

183
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:21,300
this most extreme intolerant ideology
of Islam that is fueling terrorist

184
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:26,220
organizations like isis and al Qaeda
waging a genocidal war in Yemen killing

185
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:29,370
tens of thousands of people. Uh, you know,

186
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,570
that murder of the journalists in Turkey,
the list goes on and on and on.

187
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,050
Yet, what are we hearing from
leaders in our government,

188
00:11:37,051 --> 00:11:38,580
both Democrats and Republicans?

189
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,130
Saudi Arabia is a great
ally of the United States,

190
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,370
but then you look at what's happening in
Venezuela ready to launch our military

191
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:51,780
to go in and take out another dictator
ready to go in and launch our military

192
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,490
ready to and wage a war against Iran.
So this is,

193
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,110
this is evidence of the hypocrisy that
exists between those who are waging

194
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,360
regime change war in some countries,
by the way.

195
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:07,380
Usually countries that don't have nuclear
weapons and usually countries where

196
00:12:07,381 --> 00:12:11,620
they have some other underlying
interests and ulterior motive,

197
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,720
which is not helping the
people of those countries.

198
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,910
And then when it's convenient for them,

199
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:20,610
countries like Saudi Arabia sidling up
to a country whose leadership directly

200
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:25,611
and indirectly supports al-Qaida the very
terrorists who attacked us on nine 11

201
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:28,170
who we are trying to defeat.
W

202
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,620
your position on Syria is one the,
I think people have misconstrued.

203
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,050
Why don't, why don't you tell
me that's putting it nicely.

204
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,510
That's trying to put
as nicely as possible.

205
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,320
They've actually said that
you are an Assad supporter.

206
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,940
I know this is not correct.
Yeah.

207
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,290
But is that one of those things where
people just say that in order to sort of

208
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,310
diffuse you to categorize
you as a ridiculous person
right off the bat where no

209
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,050
one can take anything else
you say? Seriously? Yeah.

210
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,710
It's, it's the usual tactic of, uh,

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,620
trying to smear or vilify
me and my campaign and,

212
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,530
and what I'm advocating for,
uh,

213
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,820
because they don't want to engage on the
actual issue itself that I'm pointing

214
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:11,821
out about how devastating and costly
their policies are of continuing to wage

215
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:18,431
these wasteful regime change wars of
choosing to support terrorist groups like

216
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:24,121
al Qaeda in Syria directly
in Syria because they are
the most powerful force on

217
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:29,130
the ground who's fighting to take
out the regime Assad's government.

218
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,810
So they're so focused on toppling this
government in Syria that they're willing

219
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:38,811
to actually use taxpayer dollars to
provide direct and indirect support to al

220
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,770
Qaeda terrorists in Syria.

221
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,280
When you think about how
crazy this is, uh, it,

222
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,110
it makes me angry.
I think it makes most people angry.

223
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:53,180
It's why introduced legislation
called the stop arming terrorists act.

224
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,850
Why we would need to have
such legislation is beyond me,

225
00:13:56,851 --> 00:14:00,720
but it clearly we do to make it so that
we don't have any tax payer dollars

226
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,140
going directly to provide any
kind of arms or support or,

227
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:06,630
or anything to terrorist
groups like al Qaeda,

228
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:10,640
but also to make it so that we're not
providing support indirectly through

229
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:15,641
countries like Saudi Arabia
who are providing that
support to terrorist groups.

230
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,370
So what, what has been said
of you about Assad then your,

231
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,830
your position on Assad?
That's just been an outright lie?

232
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,920
Uh, virtually everything. I
mean, I'll just tell you what
happened. I went to Syria,

233
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,160
uh, to, to meet with Syrian people,

234
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,560
to hear for myself from them
about what was happening there.

235
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,270
A while there I was offered the invitation
to meet with the president of Syria

236
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:46,370
and I took it because I
think it's important for us
to have the courage to meet

237
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,460
with leaders,

238
00:14:48,461 --> 00:14:53,461
whether they be friends or adversaries
or potential adversaries if our focus is

239
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,910
on national security and on piece.

240
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,350
So I went and I had that meeting and
I asked some tough questions and uh,

241
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,980
heard from him his perspective on what
was happening and what he was doing in

242
00:15:07,981 --> 00:15:12,540
his country and took the opportunity while
there to meet with religious leaders,

243
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:17,490
college students, members of the political
opposition, small business owners,

244
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
um, you know, women who are working to,

245
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,080
to start their own business, to empower
other women, Shia, Sunni Muslims,

246
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:29,980
Christians, Catholics, people
of all different religions. Uh,

247
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:35,190
it is because of that and that meeting
and my staunch opposition to regime

248
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:41,481
change wars in Syria and
in other countries that
political opponents and others

249
00:15:41,911 --> 00:15:46,911
have chosen to try to smear me
my reputation and my campaign.

250
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,310
Uh, and to label me as you said, you know,
she's a supporter of this dictator. Well,

251
00:15:51,311 --> 00:15:52,270
if that's true,

252
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,900
then anyone who opposed the Iraq war
is a Saddam Hussein lover is a lover of

253
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,590
dictators and love Saddam Hussein.

254
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,770
If you challenge their logic,

255
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,910
you see how shallow it is and
there's really none there. And,

256
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,590
and what's exposed is,
um,

257
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,620
their refusal to engage on the facts
and to stand behind why they continue to

258
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:22,751
put the American people through these
costly regime change wars and why they

259
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:26,660
continue to wage these wars that are
causing incredible suffering for people in

260
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,530
different parts of the world.

261
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,530
Know it also, when you're having these
conversations, which are incredibly,

262
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,270
incredibly important globally,

263
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,470
when you choose to distort
people's positions like this,

264
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:41,540
you're not helping anybody.
No. You're making the whole
thing more confusing. Yeah.

265
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,580
So for someone like me who's
on the outside, excuse me,

266
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:47,920
and then has to watch all this go
down, I have to go, well, why, why,

267
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,350
why do you have reasonable people that
make inaccurate statements about someone?

268
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,600
Because they feel like if you do not,

269
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,820
yeah.

270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,180
If you don't refuse a meeting with Assad,
there's something wrong with you, right?

271
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:05,000
Yep. To not want to be in the
presence of this person. Yeah.

272
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,170
Yeah. I mean, the, the, um, there's so
much hypocrisy around this. You know,

273
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:13,440
a lot of these people are the same people
who applauded President Obama when he

274
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:18,400
first ran for president in 2008.
Uh, when he, I mean he did,

275
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,500
he caused some controversy
at that time saying yes,

276
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:25,501
he would meet with the leader of Iran
without preconditions that he would meet

277
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:30,530
with leaders of other countries in that
pursuit of national security and peace.

278
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,300
Yeah. So why the double
standard here? That, okay.

279
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:38,660
So in order to keep our country safe,
in order to achieve peace,

280
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,780
we're only gonna meet with our
friends and people who we agree with.

281
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,010
That's not how you
accomplish that mission.

282
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:47,950
That's not how you accomplish security
and peace. It doesn't make sense.

283
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,980
Circles, social version of running
the world, sadly, sadly. Now,

284
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,280
had you ever met anyone like Assad before?

285
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,680
Um, no. What was that like?
No, he was eager to meet.

286
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,540
He was eager to be heard,

287
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,080
frankly.
Does he speak English

288
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:08,510
very well? Really? Yeah. I think
he was educated in Europe, um,

289
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,330
at dentist, if I'm not mistaken.
Uh, it's in the middle.

290
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,500
Maybe he's an eye doctor is not in the
medical field. Hmm. MMM. And he was,

291
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:18,800
you know,
he was open to,

292
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,750
to any and all questions that I had
both about what was happening, uh,

293
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:25,880
in Syria, uh, you know,

294
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,300
serious relationship or the
lack thereof with Israel.

295
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,120
A lot of the,
um,

296
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,640
turmoil that we're seeing in
different parts of the Middle East of,

297
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:38,920
of Sunni versus Shia.
MMM.

298
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,490
Chemical weapons being used. Uh, you know,

299
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:48,370
criminal acts being conducted,
a whole host of these issues.
How do, how, how, uh,

300
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,820
the Syrian government is dealing with the,

301
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,570
the Kurdish population in the
northern part of the country.

302
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,920
What's going on in Turkey? There was,
there was a number of things that, uh,

303
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,370
you know, I, I asked and he answered
and he shared his view and perspective.

304
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,690
And really what came out of that was he's,
um,

305
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,130
he's very narrowly focused on his
country and doesn't want other people,

306
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,130
countries,
or other people coming in and,

307
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,910
and a meddling in their
country and what's, what,

308
00:19:16,911 --> 00:19:18,920
what there trying to accomplish,

309
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,060
which is actually the same thing that I
heard from his political opposition when

310
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:27,850
I met with them. These are some of the
leaders who, who led the protest that,

311
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,773
um,

312
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,810
that kind of began this whole conflict
in 2011 people who are deeply opposed to

313
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:36,550
the Syrian government,

314
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,580
some of whom have been held in
captivity by the Syrian government.

315
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,280
And they said there are constitutional
changes we want to make. Yes,

316
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:49,510
we would like to see Assad removed from
government that they don't want to see

317
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:54,511
it done through military means or through
other countries coming in and toppling

318
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,731
their government.

319
00:19:55,731 --> 00:20:00,731
What they want to see is that change
coming from the people of Syria saying,

320
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:04,160
hey, this is the kind of leadership
that we want for our future.

321
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,620
I can imagine there's not a single country
on earth that wants us to invade and

322
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:11,030
take over. I mean, it just seems
like a bad idea for everybody,

323
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,200
right? Nor nor would we
want that to happen to us.

324
00:20:14,201 --> 00:20:16,930
I think that's really what's
missing here is, you know,

325
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:21,550
for so long we've seen this
imperialistic mentality, um,

326
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,150
that still exists in our government
where some feel like, hey,

327
00:20:26,151 --> 00:20:30,900
well we should go and tell this country
who should lead their government and

328
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:32,970
tell them what kind of
policies they should have.

329
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:37,240
But no other country should dare
even attempt to do that to ours.

330
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, our position is that
we're the best and we're,

331
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:43,900
we're running this country the best way
and this is the best country that's ever

332
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:47,080
existed, ever has the most
freedoms. It's got the most,

333
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:52,180
it's got a lot of things going on. It's
not, they're not good, but yeah. Overall,

334
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,870
yeah, we, we feel like we're the
shining light of the world. Yeah.

335
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,740
Maybe that's not accurate. You know,
maybe it's accurate in a lot of ways.

336
00:20:58,741 --> 00:20:59,490
And Yeah,

337
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,181
I think the problem,

338
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:05,181
the problems begin when we go into other
countries and try to create little mini

339
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:09,870
America. Exactly. And impose it on the
people there, whether they like it or not,

340
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,320
whether they're ready
for it or not. Uh, and,

341
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:16,070
and we ended up seeing what we're
seeing across the Middle East.

342
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,020
Yeah. I think we just looked at
the rest of the world and go, well,

343
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,150
I wouldn't tolerate that. Yeah. Why are
they tolerating that? Who is that guy?

344
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,580
Why does he get the road thing,
say should kick his ass?

345
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,870
That's literally the American perspective.
But you know,

346
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,190
we don't want to send our sons and
daughters over there to go do that for the

347
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:31,950
[inaudible].

348
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,350
Do you know if I put my tin foil hat?
We don't, we, the American people don't.

349
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,400
But this is the problem,
and this is,

350
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:41,640
this is something that I realized very
quickly during my first deployment to

351
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,640
Iraq where I was seeing
firsthand the cost of war,

352
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:48,200
serving in that medical unit
every single day. And I,

353
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:52,850
I wondered how many politicians
in Washington who voted for,

354
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:55,550
advocated for champion that war in Iraq.

355
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:00,910
We're laying away at night awake at night
thinking about my brothers and sisters

356
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:04,160
who are getting killed in combat,

357
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:08,550
who were getting severely wounded
or getting blown up, eds and I, I,

358
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,170
I learned very quickly,
uh, that they were not,

359
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,640
they weren't thinking about the real
cost and the ramifications and the

360
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:18,170
consequences of their decisions.

361
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,230
Jimmy,
who are we talking with the other day?

362
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:24,870
We're trying to say that we think that
if you want to be the commander in chief,

363
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:26,490
that you should probably
have served who was a,

364
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,490
is the reason podcast CT Fletcher.
Yes. I believe that it was him. Yeah.

365
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,160
Who was a veteran as well. Hmm. MMM.

366
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,640
That's one thing that you have over them
for sure is that you understand from

367
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:44,870
firsthand experience and sacrifice what
it means to actually be in war and in,

368
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:45,830
to be in combat.
Yeah.

369
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,400
Yeah. I mean, over,

370
00:22:47,401 --> 00:22:50,820
I still serve in the army national
guard now over over 16 years.

371
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,420
I've deployed twice to the Middle East.
And, uh, coupled with my experience in,

372
00:22:56,421 --> 00:23:01,140
in Congress serving over six years on the
foreign affairs and the armed services

373
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:05,970
committees working intimately on these
issues related to national security and

374
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:10,400
our foreign policy meeting with leaders
of different countries in the world. Uh,

375
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,450
it is these experiences
and the understanding that
I've gained from them that

376
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,150
best equip me to walk in the door,
walk into the Oval Office on day one,

377
00:23:20,151 --> 00:23:23,690
ready to do the job of president. And
most importantly, commander in chief.

378
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,540
What hurdles are you encountering
that you didn't expect?

379
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,350
Uh, you know, a lot of what's
happening are things that, that,

380
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:40,270
that we kind of did expect, you
know, the, the smear campaigns, the,

381
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,730
the misinformation campaigns

382
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,050
that someone's doing on purpose or do
you think this is team mentality and

383
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,740
action where people are supporting a
particular candidate and they look at you

384
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,580
as being competition, that candidate?
Like what do you think is hot

385
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,730
combination? Um, you know, I'm,

386
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,950
I'm challenging the establishment,
challenging the status quo,

387
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,370
challenging the foreign
policy establishment, uh,

388
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,670
and challenging the political
establishment in calling things.

389
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:11,670
As I see them calling it straight and,
and speaking the truth,

390
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,620
whether that be calling out leaders within
my own party or leaders of the other

391
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,500
political party. And, um,

392
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,820
I think that that strikes fear in a lot
of people who are uncomfortable with it

393
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:29,770
at a minimum and who are
concerned. Because when, you know,

394
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,260
we, the people rise up and say, hey,
what's really going on here? We're,

395
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:38,010
we're calling out self serving politicians
in Washington from both political

396
00:24:38,011 --> 00:24:42,270
parties who are putting
their own political interests
or the interest of their

397
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:46,330
party ahead of the interest of the people
where they're putting the interests of,

398
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:46,990
you know,

399
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,440
whatever greedy corporation in their
lobbyists is writing the biggest checks to

400
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:53,610
there campaigns ahead of
the interests of the people.

401
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,550
So the more this awareness comes out,

402
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:59,670
the more people stand up and speak out
and say, hey, this is unacceptable.

403
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,040
This is unacceptable.

404
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:05,360
Then it's threatening that
very power base that they,

405
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,930
um, have, have thrived and
lived off of for far too long.

406
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,580
We should talk about how you're funded to,
to so people understand your position.

407
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,410
Yeah.

408
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,810
People powered campaign. We
take no, no PAC contributions,

409
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:18,520
no lobbyist contributions.

410
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,050
Every single dollar that comes to my
campaign for president is coming from

411
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,850
individuals,
people across this country,

412
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,950
whether it's a dollar or $1,000, people
who are giving whatever they can, uh,

413
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,510
and joining this movement.

414
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,930
There's a great joke.
I've,

415
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,510
I think it's from Dennis Miller hope
I'm not misquoting it, but it's,

416
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,690
he was talking about how politicians
where patches on their jackets,

417
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:46,520
like Nascar drivers that is like,
you should have to know seriously.

418
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,010
Yeah.
So what should housing claimers there?

419
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,050
What if I put my tinfoil hat on when
I talk about these interventionists,

420
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,270
foreign policy wars and and
regime change wars. The,

421
00:25:58,271 --> 00:26:01,510
the tinfoil hat thinks military
industrial complex. Yeah.

422
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,690
People being asked or forced into making
decisions that benefit these giant

423
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,990
corporations that makes,
make weapons and profit off of war.

424
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,370
This is the worst case scenario
in terms of conspiracy theories.

425
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,420
The idea that someone wants war so that
they can make money and they don't care

426
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:24,070
if people die even needlessly. This is
our number one conspiracy fear, right?

427
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:28,060
If you had to think about
of all the things that you
hope are not true about the

428
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:30,310
way the world works,
that would probably be number one.

429
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:30,941
Well,

430
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:35,941
you can take your tinfoil hat off because
the military industrial complex is a

431
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:39,870
real thing. This is something that, um,

432
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,280
President Eisenhower talked about,
which is an amazing, amazing speech.

433
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,760
Has his last speech. Yeah. As
president of United States,

434
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,200
all the things that he could talk about,

435
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,640
he chose to focus on the military
industrial complex. Should we,

436
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:55,380
how dangerous though it is.

437
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,260
I feel like we should play this just
cause it's literally play that clip.

438
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:00,810
It's so crazy in most people
have never heard it before.

439
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,530
And you hear about the term military
industrial complex and one thing that has

440
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:07,680
been done that's really, really
interesting is the word [inaudible].

441
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:12,890
Bureaucracy has become a dirty word
and that dirty word or a word that

442
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,480
[inaudible] it's, it's easy
to make something silly by
calling it a conspiracy.

443
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,860
Yeah. Even though there are times
where people conspire to do things.

444
00:27:21,861 --> 00:27:24,440
That's right. I mean that's
why that word exists, right?

445
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,920
It's not like people don't make plans
to do things that are illegal. Yeah,

446
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:31,210
of course they do it.
That's why the FBI's around and yeah,

447
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,190
but this is from the national archives
and this was Eisenhower's speech,

448
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:36,760
has he?

449
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,970
He was leaving office
leave taking and farewell

450
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,630
1961 not getting very much attention
when a new press was this Guy Jamie,

451
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:48,680
you picked up the wrong version.
Son of a bitch. I'm sure there's a,

452
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,170
an actual version of it. Yeah. Here we go.

453
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,840
Chill on January 17th,
1961

454
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,980
back when everything was black and white,
the president of the United States.

455
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,230
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

456
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:05,770
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint
of a century that has witnessed for and

457
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,870
made your wars among great nations.

458
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,920
[inaudible] this is a bad
one to Jami son of a bite.

459
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,750
While he's looking for the right clip.
What?

460
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:16,910
I think he's just going to
play music in the background.

461
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:17,900
That's all it's gonna do.

462
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,030
What most people don't know is that his,

463
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,340
his first draft of that speech said
Congressional Military Industrial Complex.

464
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,913
Whoa.

465
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,440
And somewhere between the draft
and the speech that was delivered.

466
00:28:33,441 --> 00:28:35,990
He took out that word congressional,

467
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,960
but he was directly connecting
those dots that some may say,

468
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,850
oh,
well that's just a conspiracy theory,

469
00:28:43,851 --> 00:28:47,660
but he was connecting those dots with the
influence that the military industrial

470
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:52,430
complex has on leaders in Congress who
are making decisions about how our money

471
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:56,540
is spent and where our troops are
sent off into battle. Gresham tunnel,

472
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,570
congressional military industrial complex.

473
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,770
Wow, I need extra foil. Get you a new box.

474
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,770
Well, I know it's crazy. Or they couldn't
keep the camera steady back then either

475
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,830
voice. Here it goes. Good. Are
you doing my brother one? Skip it.

476
00:29:14,831 --> 00:29:18,610
I had a couple of seconds. A vital element
in keeping the pieces are military.

477
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:23,320
Establish our arms must be
mighty ready for instant action.

478
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:28,510
Show that no potential aggressor may
be tempted to risk his own disruption.

479
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,830
Our military organization today bears
little relation to that known of any of my

480
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:40,531
predecessors in peace guy or indeed
by the fighting men of World War II or

481
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,580
until the latest of our world conflicts.

482
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,120
The United States had no armaments
industry American makers of ploughshares

483
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,860
could with time and as
required make sardines as well,

484
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,740
but we can no longer risking emergency
improvisation of national defense.

485
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,440
We have been compelled to create a
permanent armaments industry of basketball

486
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:10,780
portion had to do this.

487
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,180
Three and a half million men and women
are directly engaged in the defense

488
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,014
establishment.

489
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,920
We annually spend on military security
alone more than the net income of all

490
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:28,210
United States cooperation corporations.
Now,

491
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:32,800
this conjunction of an immense military
establishment and a large arms industry

492
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,620
is noon in the American experience.

493
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,270
The total influence, economic, political,

494
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,220
even spiritual is felt in every city,
every state house,

495
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,780
every office of the federal government.

496
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,010
We recognize the imperative
need for this development,

497
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,380
yet we must not fail to comprehend.
It's grave implications.

498
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,820
Our Toil, resources, and
livelihood are all involved,

499
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,550
so he's the very structure of our society.
In the councils of government.

500
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,560
We must guard against the
acquisition of unwarranted influence,

501
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,300
whether sought or unsought by
the military industrial complex.

502
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,180
The potential for the disastrous rise
of misplaced power exists and will

503
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,014
persist.

504
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,030
We must never let the weight of this
combination endanger our liberties or

505
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,210
democratic processes. Okay. We
should take nothing for [inaudible].

506
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,510
Right. You can listen to the rest
of the speech if you want to online.

507
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:36,220
But it's very chilling.
Yes.

508
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,520
Because this is the sitting president
leaving office and this is what he wants

509
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:43,750
to tell people. And a soldier, yes.
He's a guy who had military experience.

510
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,840
He's the guy who saw firsthand wearing
the uniform and then serving as commander

511
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,990
in chief. And this was his
final warning to the nation.

512
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,060
The military companies
are like most companies,

513
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,180
they always want to grow.
Companies seek infinite growth.

514
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,850
They're constantly seek
better quarters every year.

515
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:04,440
They want to make more
money than it did last year.

516
00:32:04,441 --> 00:32:06,660
That's what they're doing there.
They're in the business and making money.

517
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,000
They're not just in the business
of creating things. They,

518
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:14,450
they're creating things for profit and
they're gonna have a little wiggle room.

519
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,290
And especially with politicians,

520
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,380
politicians that are in their pocket
and they've spent millions of dollars

521
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,360
helping them along the way. Yeah.
Yeah. And you know, they're gonna,

522
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,920
they're gonna help each other. Yeah. And
this long history of helping each other.

523
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,510
That's right. That's um, I mean you, you,

524
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:35,150
you see that very directly through
contributions that are being made,

525
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,830
uh, to politicians by different
defense contractors, the

526
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,950
corresponding votes that are then taken.
Uh,

527
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:47,951
but you also see this corruption
that's happening before our very eyes,

528
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,670
uh, happening within places like the
Pentagon where you either have people in

529
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:57,020
uniform or civilians who are working in
contracting, for example, in the Pentagon,

530
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,890
laying the groundwork for
writing up these contracts,

531
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,810
major multimillion dollar contracts
with these big defense contractors,

532
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,140
and then lay down the uniform
or you retire from service
either as a civilian or

533
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:13,720
in the military,
and then you turn around,

534
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,840
leave that door and walk into another
door working for the very same contractor

535
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:20,910
that you just wrote the contract for two,

536
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,210
this is happening. This is what,
this is what we need to change.

537
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:29,990
And we're talking about both
campaign finance reform,

538
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,830
but also reforming this kind of
corruption in this revolving door that's

539
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:35,540
happening in different
parts of our government.

540
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:38,540
You see it happening in Wall
Street to the SCC regulators.

541
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,720
People are supposed to be regulating Wall
Street or coming from Wall Street and

542
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:45,200
then going back to Wall Street to work
for the very same companies that they

543
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:48,530
were supposedly just charged to regulate.

544
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,570
This is a big problem
that we've got to fix.

545
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,250
It was a fantastic documentary
on that called inside job. Yeah.

546
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,113
It's amazing.
Yeah.

547
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,150
You see when he's confronting these guys
who are professors who then go and take

548
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:05,480
these jobs and make millions of dollars
with the very regulations that they help

549
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:08,810
put into place. That's right. And it's
happening with foreign policy as well.

550
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:10,580
When you look at who,

551
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:14,060
who are the main people who go and
testify in front of Congress, uh,

552
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,920
coming from think tanks, very
well known, think tanks, uh,

553
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,320
global think tanks that
specialize in foreign policy. Uh,

554
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,880
they don't have a placard on,

555
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:26,690
on their desk when they're testifying
before Congress saying we receive funding

556
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,020
from Saudi Arabia, from cutter,
from United Arab Emirates,

557
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,970
from all these different countries who
are spending a lot of money funding these

558
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:38,270
thing takes that then come forward and uh,

559
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:43,390
push policies or push ideas to leaders
in Congress that not coincidentally

560
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:49,100
benefit the countries that
are funding them. What,

561
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:54,790
what could be done to stop that other
than someone like you getting into power?

562
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,660
Well and what could you do once you get in
there? I think, I think two, two things.

563
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,300
I mean obviously as as president
and commander in chief,

564
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:06,140
you set the tone for the
kind of leadership that we
have in this country that

565
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:10,860
will put service above self and this is
what what I will bring us present and

566
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:15,560
bring those soldiers values of
putting service above, self,

567
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:19,700
putting service to the American people
in your country first and foremost ahead

568
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:20,540
of everything else,

569
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:24,770
of head of the interest of a political
party or a corporation or or a foreign

570
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:29,771
country for that matter and work to
pass legislation in Congress that would

571
00:35:29,781 --> 00:35:34,781
close these revolving doors that
would require this transparency.

572
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:39,210
When you're talking about who is funding
and where is this money coming from,

573
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,480
I think members of Congress should
not be taking pat contributions,

574
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,140
should be relying solely on contributions
from people in this country so that

575
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,190
they know exactly who is funding their
campaigns don't really seems like a no

576
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,000
brainer.
Yeah.

577
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,760
That one seems like a no brainer and
it's something that the people want.

578
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,660
It's something that that's starting
to happen organically as more and more

579
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:01,470
people, uh, are calling for this
kind of reform and saying, Hey, look,

580
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:02,580
if you want my vote,

581
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:08,120
then I expect you to not accept those
contributions and to run a people powered

582
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:12,960
campaign. How many people
were doing upside to, uh,

583
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,000
there's a couple who are
running for president.

584
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,500
There is a slowly growing number of
people who have run for and got gotten

585
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,980
elected to Congress. Uh,
but look, it's, it's a,

586
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,040
it's in the margins compared
to where we need to be. Now.

587
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,550
One thing that exists now that really
didn't exist when Obama was running for

588
00:36:29,551 --> 00:36:33,810
president is the impact of social media.
It's just tenfold what it used to be.

589
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,200
But with that also comes this reality
that we're living in right now where

590
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,200
there's only a few companies that are
controlling the discourse in this country.

591
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,580
Yeah. I mean, you really have
essentially a Facebook, Google,

592
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:52,110
youtube, Twitter, and Facebook
owns Instagram. That's
right. And there's, you know,

593
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:56,040
a couple of other small ones, but
that's the bulk of our discourse. Yeah.

594
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,120
What concern do you have about these
private companies controlling the vast

595
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:07,720
majority of communication between
people on social media? Yeah,

596
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,760
it's extremely dangerous. It's extremely
dangerous when you think about it.

597
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:14,510
And there's a few things.
There's gosh with,

598
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:18,000
with Facebook and Google for
that matter. You know, they,

599
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:20,940
they can set their algorithms,
uh,

600
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,170
Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and said
his algorithm to control what information

601
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:27,420
is coming across our newsfeed in Facebook.

602
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,250
What are the stories that we're seeing?
Instagram, same thing with Google.

603
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,990
They can control when
you punch in something,

604
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:38,730
what are the first stories that you're
going to see a on the first page that

605
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:40,220
pops up?
Uh,

606
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,560
when you think about that kind of power
of influence that has on the American

607
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:51,741
people literally being held within the
hands of a couple of people unchecked and

608
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:55,440
without oversight or transparency,
it's incredibly dangerous.

609
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,780
Talk about free speech.

610
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,760
There's just been news recently about
Facebook banning certain individuals,

611
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:08,010
uh, from having Facebook
accounts because of their speech.

612
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:09,630
They disagree with the
speech that they're,

613
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,180
they're using are the things
that they're talking about,

614
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,830
ideas that they're pushing forward,

615
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:19,350
unchecked first amendment rights going
completely out the window and monument is

616
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:23,190
a don't apply because it's a
private company, right? Yes.

617
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:27,150
But they're trying to get
the best of both worlds. Um,

618
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,780
the fact that that, you know,
they're claiming to say, hey,

619
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:34,780
this is a free space for open
communication for everyone. Right.

620
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,110
While at the same

621
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,850
time going and saying,
actually, you know what Joe,

622
00:38:37,851 --> 00:38:40,460
I don't like what you're saying
about this. So we're going to ban you

623
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,810
and

624
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:46,690
whoever your friends are from, from
this conversation. Um, I think that's,

625
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,520
that's a big problem at undermines.

626
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,410
It undermines our first amendment
rights and you look at privacy,

627
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,280
the privacy concerns of all
the information that they're
collecting and Facebook

628
00:38:56,281 --> 00:38:59,760
from us, all the information that
they're collecting from us, uh,

629
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,530
with Google and how they're monetizing
that and selling or sharing that

630
00:39:04,531 --> 00:39:07,430
information with other people
with really without our,

631
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,550
our knowledge or agreement.
That's the part, right? The,

632
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:16,551
the agreement that most people didn't
understand that your data is a huge

633
00:39:16,681 --> 00:39:19,260
commodity. That's right. And
we signed up for these things.

634
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:22,620
And who reads terms of service
agreements? Have you ever read one? Yeah,

635
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,060
I've never read one of them.
I just say, okay. Yeah.

636
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,660
I started to get through like the
first two paragraphs. Like, okay,

637
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,910
I'm going to hope it's not ugly.
Nothing terrible.

638
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,130
You know what I think back to there
is a south park episode that that is

639
00:39:35,401 --> 00:39:39,890
specifically about the terms
and conditions. And uh, I just,

640
00:39:39,891 --> 00:39:41,130
I hadn't watched it a long time ago,

641
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:44,010
but every time I see one of those
things pop up signing the terms things,

642
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,270
I'm like, oh man. Yeah,
that was Carmen, right? Yes.

643
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,120
Yeah. You can't talk about it. Um,

644
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,950
okay. But there's, there's
a thing that they're doing.

645
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,270
There's a couple of things we're doing,

646
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,390
but one of the things they're doing
with this, um, with your data,

647
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,570
they find out what you're interested in
and they find out what you're interested

648
00:40:02,571 --> 00:40:06,790
in engaging on. Yeah. And for
many people, that's outrage.

649
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,940
So for many people it's the
things that piss you off the most.

650
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:14,380
Like if you have a real problem with
Catholic priests getting away with having

651
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,220
sex,
a little boys,

652
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,600
you will think that that's
happening every minute of every day,

653
00:40:18,601 --> 00:40:19,710
all across the world.

654
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,930
Because it's going to be in your news
feed constantly because they know that's

655
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:26,310
what makes you engage. Right. So your
algorithm, the algorithm is your,

656
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,500
your feet is going to be very
different than my feet. Yeah.

657
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,750
Cause I engage on different
things than you do.

658
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,960
And the problem with that is
even if they're not calculating,

659
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,250
if it's not on purpose, they're not
trying to get people outrageous.

660
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,970
Not only that, trying to rabble rouse,
but what they are doing is they,

661
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,860
because they have an ad supported model,
they gravitate towards the,

662
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,010
the outrageous. Because that's
what people get excited about.

663
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,990
And that's what people
make multiple posts about.

664
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,290
And that's how they make their revenue.
It gets a bad ad model.

665
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,800
It's an an ad model that
inadvertently supports outrage. Yeah.

666
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,520
And it makes people think the world's
worst planner and all of that. And this,

667
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,680
the tribal boundaries between the,

668
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:07,760
the two sides on these
issues are more tense.

669
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,810
And you would think that discourse and
the ability to freely communicate would

670
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:15,260
kind of open that up and people would
kind of understand each other better,

671
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:20,180
but it's not happening. It's like think
Twitter is a garbage fire all day long.

672
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,140
It's just fire.

673
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,740
Like you can't post anything
about anything and there's
people just jumping on

674
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,100
people and yeah,
it's,

675
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:31,600
it's a crazy thing that has happened
that we gravitate towards the outrageous

676
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:36,200
yeah. I don't think should be rewarded
financially. I think that's not,

677
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,100
if this is just what people go
to organically, that's one thing.

678
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,630
But when you're cultivating feeds,
so,

679
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,530
or at least your algorithm is cultivating
feeds so that people get pissed off,

680
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,600
you're making the country
a shittier place. Yeah.

681
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,800
Like you're literally like
making things worse. Yeah. Yeah.

682
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,650
I mean this is one of the reasons why,
um,

683
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,130
I think a couple of things
should happen. And, and uh,

684
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,850
I think his name is Chris Hughes who
cofounded Facebook with Zuckerberg.

685
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:09,000
Saw that. Do you see as article calling
for Facebook to be broken up? Yes.

686
00:42:09,001 --> 00:42:10,280
And which is crazy.

687
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,510
You hear about the person who founded it
and he's saying this is out of control.

688
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,430
And that's the point right
now is seeing how powerful,

689
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,410
as you said, guys like Mark
Zuckerberg have become and uh,

690
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,140
and how out of control things are. Well,
some of it just doesn't make sense.

691
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:32,030
Like here's one they just
banned Alex Jones. Yep. Not
only do they ban Alex Jones,

692
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,160
but you can't talk about Alex Jones.

693
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,670
If you wrote Alex Jones might be nuts,
but damn,

694
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:41,960
is he cute of you wrote that it would,
you would get a message that says,

695
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,940
only you can see this message.

696
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,360
This message is stopped at the border
from entering into the Facebook universe.

697
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,460
Like what?
The fuzzy,

698
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:54,320
you can't just like what have
you want to say something funny?

699
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,640
You can't say something funny.
No,

700
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,210
you can only say something if
you're criticizing him. Right.

701
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,630
This is what they've said.
It's telling you how to think,

702
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,970
which is fucking insane. It is insane.
Because that's not just Frisco.

703
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,140
That's not just like a
violation of free speech.

704
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:14,240
You're literally directing
speech. Yeah. Like that's insane.

705
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,133
So you're,
you're,

706
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,730
you're not even blocking people from
doing something hateful or evil.

707
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,450
You're blocking people from saying
something that you disagree with.

708
00:43:23,451 --> 00:43:26,750
That's right. Which is, people have
sent me messages that said, uh,

709
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,560
God bless Alex Jones and they say,
you can only see this message.

710
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:35,200
Facebook sends them a thing blocking
that message. Wow. That's fucking crazy.

711
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,230
Like the idea that you think you can do
that. Yeah. That is nuts. Yeah. I mean,

712
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:44,590
being able to ban anyone
arbitrarily without any just
violated terms of service.

713
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,890
There you go. What does that mean?
Yup. Okay. Be specific. And how come,

714
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,530
I mean they've, they took a
bunch of people out, right?

715
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:55,370
Like Louis Farrakhan was one, Alex
Jones, Paul Joseph Watson was like,

716
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:58,970
what did that guy ever do? I mean,
people don't agree with them.

717
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:03,971
Like I think what's happening is there
was some serious concern that Facebook

718
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:09,320
was used to influence the last election.
Again,

719
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,350
whether against their knowledge or in a
way where they were negligent about the

720
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:18,950
type of filtering they use that stops
people from posting propaganda and

721
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:22,820
particularly stops these
things like the IRA,

722
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:27,650
the Internet research agency in Russia
that literally creates thousands of

723
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:32,130
profiles and pages and they'll have
a black lives matter page that's

724
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,020
just designed to fuck with cops.

725
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,380
And then they'll have a procop page is
just designed to fuck with black lives

726
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:37,830
matter.

727
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:42,570
All they want to do is create anger
and they're doing this engineering,

728
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,710
these arguments. I mean this
is, this is 100% proven fact.

729
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,880
Renee de Resta,

730
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,300
who had been on my podcast went over the
details of how it's set up and how they

731
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:53,940
do it and the means and
the means that they create.

732
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:58,080
Like this is an organized effort that
they channeled through Facebook in

733
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,900
particular. And then Instagram and
a couple other social media sites.

734
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,730
You know what's interesting about Renee,
she worked for new knowledge, right?

735
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,100
I do not think she was the
director for new knowledge. MMM.

736
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,680
They this company new knowledge that
the DNC has tapped as one of their,

737
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:19,340
um,
I don't know,

738
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,400
disinformation campaign experts in cyber
experts was the very same company that

739
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,490
created false accounts and pretended to
be Russian bots in order to influence a

740
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,530
US Senate election

741
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:36,580
in Alabama. Yeah, I'd
heard of that. Right.

742
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,980
So something that she
was not a part of it.

743
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,120
Yeah, I know. I don't know her.
She's a director of research,

744
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:43,770
it says at new knowledge.
Right.

745
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,280
Okay. And that, but that's post
this happening. Correct. I don't,

746
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,250
she sent me an email about it cause I
questioned her about it after it happened.

747
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:53,090
Yeah.
And I don't think she's full of Shit.

748
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,150
Yeah. Well, I, yeah,
I, I've never met her,

749
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:58,940
but I know that that company is
one that is often cited as, as,

750
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:03,200
as a so called expert. And it
was a company that was cited, um,

751
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,570
uh, to try to smear my campaign
as somehow being a, uh,

752
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,350
an engine for the Russians or something
like that. Which, which to me again,

753
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:15,720
just points to, well, let's
look at, let's look at the x,

754
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,550
the so called experts that
you're citing in this company.

755
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:22,580
New Knowledge and the kinds of
actions that they've been taking,

756
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,510
the very same ones that they're
criticizing others for doing.

757
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,120
It's a dirty world out there for a
while. The last thing, the Internet,

758
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,780
it is a wild west in the sense that,

759
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:37,320
I mean I think there should
be regulation like, I mean,

760
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:39,180
I don't think you should be able
to put child porn everywhere.

761
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:40,650
I don't think she'd be able to dox people,

762
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,050
but it's like where does that border stop?
Yeah.

763
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,090
Where does that regulation border stop?
Yeah,

764
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,620
and I think it's a very good question.

765
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:50,570
Do you think that these
social media platforms,

766
00:46:50,571 --> 00:46:52,700
whether it's Google or
Twitter or whatever, Facebook,

767
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,080
do you think that they should be treated
as a public utility where everyone

768
00:46:57,081 --> 00:47:00,830
essentially has the right to use them.
You have the right to use water.

769
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:04,010
You don't have the right to take a hose
and smash your neighbor's window and

770
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:05,900
flood his house.
I do.

771
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,400
I do think that they should be regulated
like that and they should be subject to

772
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,430
the very same antitrust laws that have
been used to make sure that we don't have

773
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:20,660
other monopolies in other industries
or in other areas, uh, to,

774
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,900
to, to break them up. And I think
that was something that, uh,

775
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,000
that Chris Hughes outlined in his article,

776
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,670
the furry first step that could be taken
is just to say, hey, you've got a, uh,

777
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,400
you've got Facebook needs to let
go of Instagram and what's APP?

778
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:39,700
Because that was [inaudible] that that
acquisition created an even stronger

779
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:43,060
monopoly that really shouldn't have been
allowed to take place in the beginning.

780
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,220
And so there are, there are concerns
about the kind of power being, um,

781
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:52,240
you know, consolidated into the
hands of a very few people, uh,

782
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,080
as well as how that's impacting,
uh,

783
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,500
any kind of a competition and squashing
that competition from coming up and

784
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,120
saying, hey, you know, you've got Facebook
and then you've got this other new tech,

785
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:04,720
not social media technology.

786
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:09,380
They've got better privacy standards
and better service for the consumer than

787
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:13,500
Facebook. But anytime that that
tries to happen, uh, you know,

788
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,890
they're quickly squashed by companies
like Facebook or Google for that matter

789
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,290
are bought up. Exactly. Yeah.

790
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,190
That's the big concern.
So there's just not enough variety.

791
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:30,360
And there's also a big concern that I
have a big concern that there's a bunch of

792
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:34,180
people that don't seem to understand the
consequences of what they're calling d

793
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,530
platforming people,

794
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,420
which basically censoring
people did taking people out
of the public discussion.

795
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,710
And when you,

796
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,800
when you do that and you create a
bubble or you create a one party leaning

797
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:52,370
institution, one party leaning
conglomeration of human beings,

798
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:56,760
you're going to develop some real
anger on the other side. Yeah.

799
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,240
And it does the opposite
of what you wanted to do.

800
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,130
What you want to do is make
the world a better place.

801
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,360
Let's take some of these angry voices
out of the mix and let's make the world a

802
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,790
better place.
It just makes them more angry.

803
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,030
Then encourage,
encourage discourse.

804
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,210
Encourage these kinds of
conversations where you can,

805
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,840
you can engage with people who might have
a different view on an issue or might

806
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:20,050
have a different experience that they
bring to the conversation and to do so.

807
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:24,910
That actually helps increase the
knowledge and understanding that we have.

808
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,950
Yeah.
I think we have to reward

809
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,190
civil discourse as well.

810
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:31,410
I think we have to be kinder
to each other and we have to,

811
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:36,590
we have to be more upset at people that
are acting like shitheads online for no

812
00:49:37,071 --> 00:49:40,830
reason. Like you're just, you think
that it's just online, but it,

813
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,990
what it is is communication and if
you're interested in shitty communication

814
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:49,110
online, you're just a shitty
communicator. Okay. All this column,

815
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,900
it being a troll and all
those different things,

816
00:49:50,901 --> 00:49:55,010
all these different labels that people
put on to make it cuter and whitewash it.

817
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,900
It's not good. It's not
good for anybody. Yeah.

818
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:03,590
If people could figure out how to be
less angry and their online lives and wow

819
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,430
and communicate about issues,

820
00:50:07,431 --> 00:50:10,880
I think we'd find that we meet more
in the middle than we think we do.

821
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,550
I think there's also a problem that
people have where they become married to

822
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:16,270
their ideas and they dig
their heels in and they,

823
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:19,610
they support their ideology and
the very rigid about it. Yeah.

824
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,180
And that is only strengthened when
you silence people. Yeah. It's,

825
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,050
it does the opposite of what
you're hoping it's going to do.

826
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,130
It makes the world a worse

827
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,430
place. It makes look, if people are
saying things that you don't like,

828
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,630
you don't have to read that.

829
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,080
But if you tell people that no one can
read that though, they're going to go,

830
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,890
why do you get to decide who are you?
Who are you?

831
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:42,580
You are a regular person.
How wiser you. Yeah.

832
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,020
How many steps ahead of you
played this game. That's right.

833
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,800
Cause I'm looking at this game.
I'm looking at civil war. Yeah.

834
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,290
I'm looking at worst case scenario.
This goes to that. That goes to this,

835
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,650
this guy attacks that. That guy
attacks this. They can't talk anymore.

836
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,850
You got people fight in the streets. That
happens. That's a human characteristic.

837
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,900
That's right. That's right. And that's,
that is where this path ends up.

838
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,020
This path that we're on of this,
this hyper partisanship,

839
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,970
this extreme divisiveness where it's
either you're in my tribe or you're in the

840
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:15,650
other tribe and the arrows are pointed
at each other without any willingness to,

841
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:17,570
once again,
just let's just have a conversation.

842
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:19,820
Let me hear where you're coming from here,
where I'm coming from.

843
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,250
We can disagree without
being disagreeable.

844
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:24,560
We can even have a heated
conversation and a debate.

845
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,830
And I would at the end of it,

846
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,940
you're saying is patriotic.
Yeah. This is patriotic.

847
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:31,690
And I think it's unpatriotic
to be partisan. Yeah.

848
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,920
Cause I think we're supposed
to be on a team together. Yeah.

849
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:37,540
This is supposed to be team America.
Exactly. What do we do? We're,

850
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,130
we're fighting over
nonsense and missile mis,

851
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:43,770
characterizing people's positions just to
suit our own ideas. That's right. It's,

852
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,400
it's foolish. It's foolish. And as
you said, it's extremely dangerous.

853
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:53,230
And the American people are the ones who,
who ultimately lose in all of this.

854
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,010
Uh,

855
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,550
this has been one of the most frustrating
things that I've seen and experienced

856
00:51:57,551 --> 00:52:01,780
throughout my over six years in
Congress that really started,

857
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,830
um, like when I first went
up after I got elected, uh,

858
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,080
we're after every election happens
in new members of Congress.

859
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:12,100
They go and they have what's called new
member orientation and they give you

860
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:15,250
these books and here's the maps and
here's where your offices and you know,

861
00:52:15,251 --> 00:52:19,180
all the, all the administrative and
logistical stuff. But very quickly,

862
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:22,270
I would say within the first
few days, um, you know,

863
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,200
where we first come in together
as Democrats and Republicans,

864
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,960
Immediately Kate Democrats go this way.
Republicans go this way,

865
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:35,010
immediately separated.
And what were told right off the bat is,

866
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:40,280
look, this is about, uh, getting
wins for our political party.

867
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:45,420
And if you work with the Republican,
then that's going to hurt the party.

868
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,360
Especially if you work with a Republican
and the Democratic Party is trying to

869
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:51,960
take out, forget the substance of the
idea, forget the substance of the bill.

870
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:55,350
And this happens on the opposite side
is while Republicans with Democrats,

871
00:52:55,351 --> 00:52:58,820
both both political parties or dif or are,
I'm guilty of this,

872
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:02,960
where they're really putting the interest
of the political party ahead of the

873
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:06,780
people who just voted for
us to go and serve them.

874
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,700
And not just the Democrats who
voted for me, but yes, the,

875
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:13,320
the independence and the Republicans
both who voted for me or who didn't,

876
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,880
but who, uh, I serve as
part of my constituency.

877
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:22,190
And uh, you just, you continue to have
continued to see this where, you know,

878
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:26,620
you'll have a bill that, because
it's Democrat, Bill Republicans

879
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,301
vote against it.

880
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:31,860
Substance aside or Republican
Bill Democrats voted against
it just because it's

881
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:35,280
a republican bill. But then, hey,
if, if they come in and you know,

882
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:38,760
a month or a year later introduced
the same bill or a similar bill,

883
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,120
but now because it's a democratic
bill, okay everybody, hey, let's go,

884
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,730
let's go and support this legislation.

885
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,300
You can imagine why there is
so much gridlock in Washington,

886
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:52,200
why nothing really gets done.

887
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,530
And ultimately how this divisiveness in
this hyper partisanship is hurting the

888
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:02,490
ability for the needs of the
American people to be served.

889
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,530
When you talk about people at yourself
that are completely funded by the public

890
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:13,070
and you have this very logical and
objective way of discussing this gridlock,

891
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:19,550
do you think that the future is in young
people like yourself getting involved

892
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:24,120
in politics, that they, they're not
connected to this old world for 35,

893
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:28,380
45 years, this world? It sounds
like this is just what you do. Yeah.

894
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,910
I mean I watched house of cards.
I get kinda get it sort of what that,

895
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,180
that seems like chaos and it seems
like there's no way to fix that.

896
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:39,270
It's almost like these people
have to stop being politicians.

897
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,810
They have to be voted out
or die off when done well.

898
00:54:42,811 --> 00:54:47,280
I think it's evident where we see
those who are very entrenched in this,

899
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:48,143
um,

900
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,180
this broken system feel very threatened
by the rise of people powered campaigns,

901
00:54:55,531 --> 00:55:00,531
individual contributions coming in and
supplanting the big money that they get

902
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:05,440
from, um, you know, packs
and packs and lobbyists and,

903
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,010
and, and there's fear
there because they see, um,

904
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:14,150
their whole world being disrupted by
people like me or others who are coming in

905
00:55:14,461 --> 00:55:15,091
and saying,
no,

906
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:19,230
we're not buying into any of that and
we're coming in to actually fulfill the

907
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:23,790
mission that we've been charged with
by those who voted for us to serve the

908
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:28,170
people, all the people of this country.
And would you say that, would you,

909
00:55:28,171 --> 00:55:29,250
well this is my position.

910
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:32,790
I think that Trump plays a part of that
because I think he was the first guy to

911
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,361
camp the,

912
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:38,361
come to come in basically self funded or
being funded through his own means and

913
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,590
not listening to the rest of the
Republican Party saying, Hey,

914
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,320
I'm going to take over and
I'm going to do this my way.

915
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,470
And then knowing that he could do that
and knowing that there were so many

916
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,770
Republicans against him and knowing that
there's so many Democrats against him

917
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:55,470
as well, but yet he's still the
president. Yeah. People like Jesus,

918
00:55:55,471 --> 00:55:57,960
this is a fragile system or the system is,

919
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:02,790
it's what they've done to acquire
power is still very vulnerable.

920
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:06,720
Even though they have this deeply
entrenched system of weird little

921
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:11,520
relationships that it's not good enough
that if the people do rise up and they

922
00:56:11,521 --> 00:56:14,310
decide, hey, we want to
put Tulsi in as president,

923
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:16,430
you're going to have
a different situation.

924
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,560
A lot of you clowns going to
be out of work. Absolutely.
I mean, and that's really,

925
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:23,070
that's the message that we're carrying to,
to living rooms,

926
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,400
town halls and communities

927
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,320
across the country is,
uh,

928
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,810
Washington continues to underestimate
the power of the people.

929
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,320
And it's supposed to work
for you. Exactly. And that's
the thing is, you know,

930
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:37,220
our founding fathers had this vision for
our country that our government would

931
00:56:37,221 --> 00:56:40,340
be of the people,
by the people and for the people.

932
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:45,820
And instead what we have is a government
of the rich and powerful by and for the

933
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:49,600
rich and powerful of the special
interests in corporations buy in for the

934
00:56:49,601 --> 00:56:54,550
special interest in corporations and
you know, we, the people get left behind

935
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:58,320
and they continue to talk to us
like they're in control. Yeah.

936
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,930
They're one of us and they're
supposed to be public.

937
00:57:00,931 --> 00:57:04,080
Employees are supposed to be servants.
That's right of the public.

938
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,880
They don't talk like that.
No.

939
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:10,080
They talk like people who
are in a position of power
and influence and it's not

940
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:11,880
healthy.
It's not a healthy perspective.

941
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,430
DEF,

942
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,960
it's evident of that huge disconnect
between the bubble that is Washington and

943
00:57:16,961 --> 00:57:21,610
the reality of the lives that we live
every day. People all across this country.

944
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,340
That's always the case though.

945
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,090
When people get in control of things
though is metal, make it easier for them,

946
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:30,070
make it better for them. What can
I do to make this a little easier?

947
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,730
Is there another way?
How can I help myself here?

948
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,570
How can I make sure that when I get out
of office I can do these public speaking

949
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:39,660
tours and make a quarter
million dollars a pop. Yeah.

950
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,060
When I hear about the money those guys
make to just go and talk. Yeah. What?

951
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:44,800
Who is paying for that?

952
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,330
He was paying to listen to
Hillary Clinton getting out of it.

953
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,990
Why are you getting out of that?
Can I listen?

954
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,870
I would love to like
pretend to be a banker,

955
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:56,890
to put a lizard skin face mask on and go
sit with those bankers and listened to

956
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,530
one of those conversations that Hillary
Clinton got paid a quarter million

957
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:02,960
dollars to talk to. Yeah. Never released
the transcripts for what is that about?

958
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:04,323
Who is,

959
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:10,080
it's some weird sneaky deal that they
make where nobody wants to pay that like

960
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:13,660
go to that. A massive scar guards see
many tickets you sell. Right, exactly.

961
00:58:13,661 --> 00:58:17,200
That their bill and Hillary are doing
like the speaking tour thing right now.

962
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,500
I am baffled as to who is going to pay
to go see bill and Hillary bullshit them.

963
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,680
They're doing it together now,
right? Yeah. Pell is so old.

964
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,800
Why didn't you just
come clean? You know, I,

965
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:33,380
I would love to get that guy and just
get them drunk and put them on the edge.

966
00:58:33,381 --> 00:58:37,390
Just like have him just talk about life.
No, you only got like a few years left.

967
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:40,510
Everything's falling apart in your body.
What are your regrets?

968
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,900
What'd you do wrong?
What could you have done differently?

969
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,740
Stop all this bullshitting. Like
w you know, have him on your show.

970
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,600
I would love to,
I would love to do mushrooms with them.

971
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,280
That's what I wanted to have him on the
show and do it in Colorado because they

972
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:55,540
did some analyze mushrooms.

973
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,360
It's just this role of being the person
that is in control of this country is

974
00:59:02,801 --> 00:59:06,170
always been this impossible task.

975
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,670
And when I see a person like you
who wants to do it, I say, listen,

976
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:14,250
you have some of the best ideas in the
most healthy perspective that I've ever

977
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:16,710
heard from anyone that's
ever running for president.

978
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,810
But why would you want
to do that to yourself?

979
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,100
Those are the two things that I
think go because it's not for myself

980
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,510
and, and it's not to be in control
of the country and the people.

981
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,590
It's to serve the people and our country.

982
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:33,520
It's a continuation of this mission
that I've chosen for my life to be of

983
00:59:33,521 --> 00:59:36,310
service, to find different
ways to do that. You know,

984
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:40,120
it started in Hawaii with gathering my
friends as a kid and going in and picking

985
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:44,730
up trash off the beach on the weekends
and experiencing even then at a young age

986
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:49,310
that that made me happier
then than anything else.

987
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:50,301
Then,
you know,

988
00:59:50,301 --> 00:59:55,230
going and playing video games
with my friends or anything
like that and that MMM.

989
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:00,470
That mission that that
was deeply ingrained in me
further with my service in the

990
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,470
military, serving as a
soldier where, you know,

991
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:06,920
I'm serving alongside people of all
walks of life as you know, every race,

992
01:00:06,921 --> 01:00:09,230
religion, ethnicity,
orientation, everything,

993
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,490
every one of us wearing that same uniform,

994
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:17,160
serving that same flag that represents
the American people with that laser like

995
01:00:17,211 --> 01:00:19,910
focus on putting service above self.

996
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,490
And that's what I seek to
bring to the White House. To,

997
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:27,491
to restore those values of integrity
and honor and respect to make it so that

998
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:32,570
that White House is a beacon of light
for the American people to know that that

999
01:00:32,571 --> 01:00:36,720
White House belongs to them and represents
them and their interests and their

1000
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:37,554
interests alone.

1001
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,840
Does anybody, yeah. I mean, even a
person like you who's on the outside,

1002
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,920
do you think anybody truly knows what
it's like to run the country until they

1003
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:48,940
get in there? Do they, can
you even have an idea of what,

1004
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,970
how impossible a task it
is to be in control of the
economy, the environment, the,

1005
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:56,270
the infrastructure,
the military,

1006
01:00:56,340 --> 01:01:01,340
our position in the world to get
it seems like the most insane duty.

1007
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:03,390
Yeah.

1008
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,820
To require someone to run all those
things and be aware of all those things.

1009
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:11,540
To be responsible for all of the
successes and all of the failures. Yeah.

1010
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:16,740
MMM. It's an awesome responsibility.
There's no question about that. Uh,

1011
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:21,220
and I think it fulfills
that, um, that hire,

1012
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,083
that hire,

1013
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:26,870
that higher calling that this is not
about any kind of selfish interest.

1014
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:30,440
This for me is not about any
kind of ambition that I've had.

1015
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:33,500
I've never had any kind of thought,
well, I want to be president one day,

1016
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:35,480
or even I want to be a
member of Congress one day.

1017
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:38,390
It's always been about how can I,

1018
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:41,390
how can I best be of service and
how can I make a greater impact?

1019
01:01:41,391 --> 01:01:44,950
And that's what I've seen throughout my
time in Congress where I've served on

1020
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:45,551
these committees.

1021
01:01:45,551 --> 01:01:48,100
I've served on the foreign affairs
in armed services committees.

1022
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:52,930
I've been been calling for and fighting
for an end to these wasteful regime,

1023
01:01:52,931 --> 01:01:56,170
change wars and end to this new
cold war and nuclear arms race.

1024
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:59,800
There's only so much I can do
as a member of Congress, uh,

1025
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,320
to be able to serve as president
and commander in chief.

1026
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:07,160
I know that I can make that kind of
impact and see change in our policy that

1027
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:08,390
keeps our country safe,

1028
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:11,510
that moves us closer to that
future of peace and prosperity.

1029
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,700
And that's where I hope to
be able to make a difference

1030
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:18,640
if you'd become pros, excuse me, when
you become pros, there you go. Sorry.

1031
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:20,530
And

1032
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:25,530
you do get to change the way we spend
money and stop spending money on these

1033
01:02:26,621 --> 01:02:27,640
regime change wars.

1034
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:31,720
What would be the first thing you invested
in in this country and how would you

1035
01:02:31,721 --> 01:02:32,554
go about doing that

1036
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,210
question? I think there's, um,

1037
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,270
I'd want to give that some thought
because there are a whole host of,

1038
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,720
of challenges that we're facing.
You know, I mean, healthcare is,

1039
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:43,730
is among the top of the list.
And you know,

1040
01:02:43,731 --> 01:02:46,250
we've talked a little bit about
that the last time I was here.

1041
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:50,750
Our crumbling infrastructure continues
to be something that's not only just

1042
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:55,010
uncomfortable every time we're driving
over potholes, it's actually, uh,

1043
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:58,790
threatening peoples lives.
And wellbeing's uh,

1044
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,650
I was in Iowa a few weeks ago and we
visited this a few communities that were

1045
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:07,730
completely inundated and
devastated by the flooding. Um,

1046
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:12,800
that took place there. Gosh, about
three, three, four weeks ago now. Uh,

1047
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,620
many of them have not been
able to return to their homes.

1048
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,600
We went and helped out one family.

1049
01:03:17,601 --> 01:03:21,110
We were tearing down drywall and ripping
up the floors and underneath the wood

1050
01:03:21,111 --> 01:03:25,220
in the floors, there was still
like tons of water, uh, in place.

1051
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,400
And they were talking about how even with,
you know,

1052
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:32,270
the aid from FEMA and s
and SBA loans that they,

1053
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:37,630
they are unwilling to put a single
dollar back into rebuilding their homes

1054
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,080
because they're hearing
from the government and the
Army Corps of engineers that

1055
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:47,081
it may take two to four years to fix the
levees that broke down and caused that

1056
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:49,204
flooding.

1057
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:54,490
So why would they go and try to pour
their life savings back into rebuilding

1058
01:03:54,611 --> 01:03:59,611
their homes when they could get flooded
again in a year or in two years?

1059
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:04,020
Because we're not making the kinds of
investments in our infrastructure that we

1060
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:08,370
need to make. Uh, so there's an education.
I mean, there's a whole host of issues,

1061
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,030
um,

1062
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,780
that I think we need to look at how we
can best provide the resources that are

1063
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:17,400
necessary to improve those services,
uh, to the American people.

1064
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,250
And also look at how,
how we're doing business and,

1065
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:23,580
and fixing the problems that exist
within those different agencies.

1066
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:28,270
There's always been a call to help
countries in need in the world.

1067
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,050
There's always been a call for the
United States to step in and you know,

1068
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:34,290
and and,
and do something.

1069
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:38,970
But yet there's problems in this
country that are, that never change.

1070
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,410
There's bad communities in this country
that are impoverished and crime ridden

1071
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,500
that have been the same
way. Yeah. For decades,

1072
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,820
there was a former Baltimore police
officer named Michael Wood who came on my

1073
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:55,821
podcast and he was talking to me about
the time when he was in the Baltimore

1074
01:04:55,950 --> 01:04:55,951
Police Department.

1075
01:04:55,951 --> 01:05:00,951
They found a piece of paper that was
documenting various crimes from the 1970s

1076
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,310
for someone,

1077
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:07,310
one of the years from 1970 something and
it was the same exact crime in the same

1078
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,740
exact area that they were having problems
with. Now, whether it's homicide,

1079
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,350
narcotics,
whatever it was,

1080
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:18,460
they were having the exact
same in the exact same places.

1081
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,180
And then he realized like, well, this
is, there's no effort put to change this.

1082
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:26,440
Yeah, there's no, it is, if you're talking
about decades and decades and decades,

1083
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,850
why wasn't there a money
funneled into this community?

1084
01:05:30,851 --> 01:05:33,850
Why isn't there some community
centers that help children?

1085
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,790
Why isn't there an emphasis
on Edrick better education?

1086
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,970
Why isn't there more police officers or
at least some sort of civilian presence

1087
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,500
that helps out people and stop some of
this crime and gives people a better

1088
01:05:47,501 --> 01:05:52,501
place to live and then fix a lot of this
what you're seeing decade after decade.

1089
01:05:53,221 --> 01:05:55,400
Yeah.
If we want to make America better,

1090
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,030
the best way to do that is
to fix the weakest parts.

1091
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,630
The weakest parts of the people
that are born in a shit situation,

1092
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,990
they don't get a good break.
They got a bad break.

1093
01:06:05,991 --> 01:06:08,210
They're born and crime ridden environment,

1094
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:11,630
and then they have to figure out how to
be a better person while dealing with

1095
01:06:11,631 --> 01:06:15,200
all this and then you've got people that
are aloof to this that are like, hey,

1096
01:06:15,201 --> 01:06:16,280
figure it out for yourself.

1097
01:06:16,281 --> 01:06:20,730
I did like as if we all start from the
same spot in this crazy game called life

1098
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:23,390
because we don't know those
people are in the worst spot.

1099
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:28,310
Why can't we fix the worst bot? It seems
like we could, if we can help Iraq,

1100
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,020
if we can invade Syria,

1101
01:06:30,021 --> 01:06:34,760
if we can do some of the
things that people either
want us to do or we have done,

1102
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:36,560
why can't we do that?
Exactly,

1103
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:39,740
and that's, that's what I often
remind people is that right now,

1104
01:06:39,741 --> 01:06:44,030
today we spend $4 billion
every month in Afghanistan,

1105
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,920
$4 billion every month,
every single month.

1106
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,980
Imagine what could be done with those
dollars in those resources in communities

1107
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,360
like Baltimore and communities like Flint,
Michigan,

1108
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:59,900
where people are still being
poisoned by their water,

1109
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,720
where they're being lied to and
cheated by their leadership.

1110
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:07,200
Where the governor sent in
these inspectors and cleared
the water saying, hey,

1111
01:07:07,201 --> 01:07:08,250
everything's fine.

1112
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,260
What he didn't tell people was
that when those inspectors went in,

1113
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:17,650
they turn the faucet and let the water
run for five minutes before they tested

1114
01:07:17,651 --> 01:07:22,651
it to clean all the crap out of the pipes
and create this false conclusion that

1115
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:24,080
somehow the water is cleaned.

1116
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:27,410
When the people who live there know
that it is still not safe to drink.

1117
01:07:27,411 --> 01:07:31,310
And for some folks they can't even
take a shower in their own homes.

1118
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:35,680
And so that's why you're not going to
hear any other presidential candidates

1119
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:40,681
talking about the cost of war and where
our money is going and how it is counter

1120
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,990
to our national security.
It's making us less safe.

1121
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:48,140
It's counter to the interest of our
people and the people in those countries.

1122
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:52,790
But this is why I talk about this
everywhere I go. Because it's central,

1123
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:58,070
it's central to our ability to address
these domestic challenges that we are

1124
01:07:58,141 --> 01:07:58,651
facing.

1125
01:07:58,651 --> 01:08:02,430
We in this country are facing
in communities across the
country and dealing with

1126
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,290
health care,
affordable housing.

1127
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:09,040
There's a homeless crisis in both
urban cities and rural communities.

1128
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,120
People who are not able to
afford to put a roof over there,

1129
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,780
the people who are working full time,
maybe one,

1130
01:08:13,781 --> 01:08:17,750
maybe two jobs even still can't
afford to put a roof over their heads.

1131
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,300
There are serious issues
that we need to address here,

1132
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:25,301
but to think that somehow we'll have the
resources to do so without addressing

1133
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:29,300
where trillions of our dollars have been
going now for the last several years,

1134
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:32,060
uh, is a lie. It's just not true.

1135
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,700
When you talk about people
that are working full time
jobs and they still don't

1136
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,400
have enough money to get by,
what could you do to change that?

1137
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:45,410
I think there's a, we, there's not
one single action that can fix that.

1138
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,800
Uh, you know, I'm pushing
for a living wage.

1139
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,080
I think it's important
that that should be, uh,

1140
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:53,540
it's going to be different in
different places. You know, I've,

1141
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,850
I'm a cosponsor of the,
uh,

1142
01:08:55,910 --> 01:09:00,910
congressional legislation to raise the
minimum wage to $15 at the federal level.

1143
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:02,151
Um,
you know,

1144
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:06,530
there has not been an increase in the
federal minimum wage for a very long time.

1145
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,190
Uh, and I think that's, that's a
step that can be taken. But you know,

1146
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:15,220
Los Angeles is like Hawaii where a $15
an hour job is not going to be enough to

1147
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:18,630
pay the rent because you've
got high cost of living.

1148
01:09:18,631 --> 01:09:23,010
So living wage is going to be higher and
in communities like ours than it is in

1149
01:09:23,011 --> 01:09:25,110
smaller communities or
communities in the Midwest.

1150
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:28,140
What would you suggest for Los
Angeles? $20 an hour? I don't,

1151
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,530
I don't know what the answer is here.
It would have to be more,

1152
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,370
I think so the argument against that
would be that small businesses would go

1153
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,510
under or hire less people.

1154
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:39,080
Were that somehow or another
it would be bad for business.

1155
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,380
What is there? I think
there's a, uh, you know,

1156
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:43,720
I mean the cost of living here is higher.

1157
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,620
And so what we are paying the
employees who work in these industries,

1158
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:50,270
in these service jobs,
it has to match that.

1159
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:52,400
It has to correlate with
that higher cost of living.

1160
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:56,150
It costs more to go out to eat here
than it does to go out to eat in a

1161
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:59,620
restaurant in, I don't
know, Alabama for example.

1162
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:04,030
So I think we've got to,
we've got to recognize people
who are doing the work, um,

1163
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:08,780
that correlates with the higher cost of
living that we're seeing already. Um,

1164
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,300
I'm, I'm really looking at the
universal basic income, uh,

1165
01:10:12,301 --> 01:10:15,740
and seeing how that could be a tool to,
um,

1166
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:19,900
help deal with a lot of these poverty
stricken communities and people who've

1167
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:24,220
been struggling and still unable to
dig themselves out of a hole there and

1168
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:28,840
seeing how that potentially could
replace a lot of the bureaucracy,

1169
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,900
a lot of the money that we're spending
on bureaucracy and a lot of social

1170
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:36,880
welfare programs perhaps to both save
money and to provide support directly,

1171
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:39,010
uh, to people who need it. Uh,

1172
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:41,360
so I think that's an option that
we've got to consider this. It's,

1173
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:42,780
it's not simple.

1174
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:46,340
And so I'm doing the research and figuring
out how exactly that would work and

1175
01:10:46,341 --> 01:10:50,210
how exactly we'd pay for it. Uh, but we
also have to look at affordable housing.

1176
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:54,650
I think not accepting the fact that
the high cost of housing is what it is,

1177
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:59,230
um, is, is not the solution. MMM.

1178
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:02,550
There's a lot of money that goes into
our housing and urban development

1179
01:11:02,551 --> 01:11:03,384
department,

1180
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,730
but is it really having the effect that
we needed to have to make it so that you

1181
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,010
know, whether it's cops are
teachers, are firefighters,

1182
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:12,980
people who are working in these public
service jobs are able to afford to live,

1183
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,850
live in the communities where they're
working. Now, we were in Malibu yesterday.

1184
01:11:17,851 --> 01:11:21,150
We had a town hall there yesterday
and took a tour with the mayor,

1185
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:21,990
city council members,

1186
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:26,940
community leaders around a lot of the
areas that were completely devastated by

1187
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:30,810
the fires. And that was one of the
things that they mentioned is that a,

1188
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:33,780
they pointed out a trailer park.
Um,

1189
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:37,200
traditionally where a lot of
those first responders live,

1190
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:41,190
that's where the workforce in Malibu
have lived in that trailer park.

1191
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:45,450
And they said that it's not unheard of.

1192
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:48,840
That one of those trailer
homes go for 1 million bucks,

1193
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,491
1 million bucks,

1194
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:52,950
and you don't even get to own the
land that your trailer sits on.

1195
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,760
And so this is a real problem that they're
facing is people who are teaching in

1196
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:59,220
that area at the firefighters
who are working in that area.

1197
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,220
They're not able to afford to live
in the community that they serve.

1198
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:05,730
But how could that be fixed?
That's a supply and demand thing.

1199
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:09,330
There's some communities,
I mean, you know, there's,

1200
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:12,090
there's land in the valleys and,
and other areas,

1201
01:12:12,091 --> 01:12:15,930
but some communities are dealing with
this, both in the private sector. There's,

1202
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,030
there's hotels in Hawaii for example,

1203
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:22,320
who are recognizing that they can't
attract workers to work in the hotels

1204
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:24,660
because they can't afford to
live near where they work.

1205
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:28,680
And they're starting to buy up properties
to actually provide that workforce

1206
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:33,180
housing at an affordable cost to be
able to attract those workers. Uh,

1207
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,170
some communities are doing the same
thing for, uh, for first responders,

1208
01:12:37,171 --> 01:12:41,250
for firefighters and others. So this is
a problem that, that a lot of, you know,

1209
01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:45,120
city councils and local communities
are trying to deal with and solve.

1210
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:50,420
But I think it also points to a bigger
problem that we have a nationally that

1211
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,670
there is just not enough affordable,

1212
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:56,670
truly affordable housing for
working people in the country.

1213
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,490
But a place like Malibu is always been
this exclusive community because there's

1214
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:06,780
just not that much Malibu. It's next to
the water. So it's more valuable. Yeah.

1215
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,550
Like if,

1216
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:12,210
if is there a way to do
anything that would change that?

1217
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,510
Well, this, that's what I was asking
the mayor about and that, and that was,

1218
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:19,080
that was one of the things they
said that has been, um, you know,

1219
01:13:19,081 --> 01:13:20,610
people look at Malibu and they're like,
well,

1220
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:23,280
that's where a bunch of multimillionaire
rich people go and buy their beach

1221
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:27,610
homes. But there has always
been, uh, you know, the,

1222
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:31,380
the basis of that community was really
founded on those who worked to build the

1223
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,170
community. Uh, you know,
middle, middle class,

1224
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,320
middle class people who are
increasingly being pushed out.

1225
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:40,170
If you're not living in the home
that, you know, your grandfather,

1226
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:41,820
your great grandfather built,

1227
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:46,590
then you're not going to be able to afford
to stay there. Uh, so, you know, he,

1228
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,980
we didn't get into the,
the details on what they're looking at,

1229
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:54,480
but this is something that
the city council and the
mayor are grappling with now

1230
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:59,160
to be able to attract workers
who want to work in the area,

1231
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:02,610
but who don't want to have to drive
two hours or three hours just to get to

1232
01:14:02,611 --> 01:14:06,420
their place of work. Yeah. I just don't
know how you would ever do that. Yeah.

1233
01:14:06,421 --> 01:14:11,010
Especially with all those fat cats that
are living in Malibu. It's a crazy place.

1234
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,943
Live.
Yeah.

1235
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,190
Those houses on the beach or like
ridiculously expensive. Yeah.

1236
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:16,150
And that's where a lot of,

1237
01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,840
I mean a lot of the folks you were talking
to yesterday, they live, uh, you know,

1238
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:23,900
up on the mountain or in the valley or
that's a better spot anywhere. The thing,

1239
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:25,960
the thing about being by the beaches,

1240
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:29,020
people could just kind of hang out
in your backyard, like right there,

1241
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:30,610
like right where your bedroom is.

1242
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:34,340
It can be people that are cooking out
four feet away from your head. Yeah.

1243
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,050
That's not so much privacy.
You've got none. It's the
beach. It's everybody's. Yeah.

1244
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,660
Like people have tried to kick people off
it too, which gets really strange. Yeah.

1245
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,060
There's been a lot of those cases
where they hire private security,

1246
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:49,420
but it's like trying to kick someone out
of a park because you decided to have a

1247
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:51,830
picnic. That's true, man.
This beach is everybody.

1248
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:55,480
That's the ocean to stay that way.
Yeah. It has to stay that way. That way.

1249
01:14:55,481 --> 01:14:58,660
I have a problem with,
this is a personal problem with,

1250
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:03,580
with municipalities that charge
you to go to the beach. Crazy.

1251
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,190
So if I have no money in my pocket,

1252
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:10,160
you're going to bar me from going and
putting my feet on the sand and go for a

1253
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:14,950
surf in the ocean. It's insane.
It's insane. It is wrong. Right?

1254
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:15,640
I mean,

1255
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,640
I could see if you had a donation box
to help people clean up the beach.

1256
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:25,140
That's all I could see.
Donations. Yep. That's all.
Throw some money in and be like,

1257
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,730
yeah, I'll pay for my
parking. Sure, sure. You know,

1258
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:29,560
but don't stop me from
coming on the beach. Like,

1259
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:32,530
I'll catch a bus if I don't have any
money, I'll get you us to the beach.

1260
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,720
Poor People's,
you've got to like,

1261
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,890
that's the whole reason we have these
national parks, national wilderness areas.

1262
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:42,160
It's anybody. Yeah. Anybody
can get in there. Yeah.

1263
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:45,970
That's the beautiful thing about,
one of the best things about the,

1264
01:15:45,971 --> 01:15:50,140
the system that we have in
place in America is that
there's so much public land

1265
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,830
and people don't understand that they've
never been to other countries where

1266
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:56,860
that's just not the case. Everything
is private in many, many countries.

1267
01:15:56,861 --> 01:16:01,270
You can't just go camping. You can't
just take a raft and go down the river.

1268
01:16:01,271 --> 01:16:05,840
You can't just do that. And what
happens when those public spaces are,

1269
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:08,050
are lost,
they're lost,

1270
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:11,080
they're lost forever and you pave
over them when you develop them.

1271
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:16,500
You know when your beaches become trash
with pollution and others like that's a

1272
01:16:16,661 --> 01:16:19,030
treasure. It's a treasure
that's lost. Well,

1273
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:22,750
we have our forefathers to
thank for their foresight.

1274
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,900
Like Theodore Roosevelt
saw this in advance and met
with great resistance from a

1275
01:16:28,661 --> 01:16:32,230
lot of big businesses that just wanted
to put apartments up everywhere and start

1276
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:33,530
building factories.
Yeah.

1277
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:37,570
And we created this incredible system
of public land in this country that's

1278
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:41,800
unprecedented. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, only Canada has something
that rivals us. Oh Man.

1279
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:44,650
I guess Australia's got a lot of
public land too, but it's just,

1280
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:48,460
there's other countries that have it,
but it's amazing what we have here.

1281
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:52,060
And in terms of our diversity of,
of scenery and,

1282
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,740
and where you could go to,
I mean,

1283
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:57,490
you could go to the desert or you
could go to Idaho and you know,

1284
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,840
go to quarterly volcano in Hawaii. Yeah.
Well I think you guys have an advantage.

1285
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:02,650
I really do.

1286
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:07,650
And I've said this about many people
that are faced with incomparable beauty

1287
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:14,090
and this
in arguable sense of your perspective.

1288
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,390
And I think if you're living on a
volcano in the middle of the ocean,

1289
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,800
you're five hours by plane from anywhere.

1290
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,880
Like you guys have a different vibe,
you know? And I think, yeah, you know,

1291
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:28,580
I mean you go to, you, you,

1292
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:31,310
you turn on the news or you talk to
politicians in Washington. I by okay,

1293
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:34,460
we've got to protect our environment and
it's becomes like a political talking

1294
01:17:34,461 --> 01:17:35,840
point.
But a,

1295
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:40,520
I'm so grateful to have grown
up in Hawaii and uh, you know,

1296
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,040
that talking point is
actually a way of life.

1297
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:47,630
Like this connection that we
have, uh, you know, with nature,

1298
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:51,200
with mother earth is something that's
real and it's cultural and it's passed

1299
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:55,850
down from generations and it's,
it's actually living out,

1300
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,190
uh, that, that saying
that Mahatma Gandhi had,

1301
01:17:58,191 --> 01:18:03,191
that the earth provides
enough for everyone's need
but not everyone's greed and

1302
01:18:03,951 --> 01:18:05,300
what a powerful thing that is.

1303
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:10,300
And we think about both how we live our
lives personally in being respectful and

1304
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,180
being thoughtful about our impact
on other people and on our planet.

1305
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:19,450
And then of course for policy makers
who are making those decisions about how

1306
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:21,440
our natural resources are used,

1307
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:26,441
stopping them from being
exploited or polluted or lost for,

1308
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:29,810
you know,
short term monetary profits or gains.

1309
01:18:30,170 --> 01:18:32,450
There's a certain thing that
happens in Hawaii as well,

1310
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:35,270
where people are more accountable
because you can't get away from anybody.

1311
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,133
That's right.

1312
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,510
Somebody's uncle or Auntie is going
to see and be like, hey, junior,

1313
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:47,360
what's going on? You're on
an island. You gotta be nice.

1314
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:51,980
I can't drive like a dick. Yeah.
I worked for a senator Akaka,

1315
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:56,360
who's a US senator from Hawaii
for many decades in Washington,

1316
01:18:56,361 --> 01:19:00,680
and I worked for him in Washington for
two years between my two deployments. Uh,

1317
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:04,790
but he was a guy who
embodied that Aloha spirit.

1318
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:10,190
Uh, his wife, um, who we call
auntie Millie. She, she's,

1319
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:14,900
she's got a, she's a firecracker. She's a
little feisty, but even she, she's like a,

1320
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:20,060
you don't talks. Think about anybody
in Hawaii because you never know.

1321
01:19:20,061 --> 01:19:23,210
You might be related to them,
but you know,

1322
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:27,200
it's good words to live by, whether
you're related or not. Just, Hey,

1323
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:31,970
don't talk stink. Don't talk trash about
somebody. Show respect. Share that Aloha.

1324
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:35,730
Even if even if you're different, even if
you disagree, show that respect. That's,

1325
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:38,960
that's what my boss did. That's the
senator Akaka did. And, and you know,

1326
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:40,370
he passed away a couple of years ago,

1327
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:43,580
but people in Washington still
remember and talk about him,

1328
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:48,470
Democrats and Republicans. Uh, it's just
the kindest human beings I've ever known.

1329
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,990
The problem with people
is talking stink is fun,

1330
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,260
especially when there's nobody around.

1331
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,340
It's like a national pastime in many ways.

1332
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,780
The spreading of bad vibes is discouraged
in an area where you kind of have to

1333
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:07,610
know most of the people
around. Yeah. Yeah.

1334
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,020
Which I want to give a shout out to one
of the guys I met yesterday in Malibu

1335
01:20:11,021 --> 01:20:15,240
Guide named Keegan. Uh, he
organized like, I dunno,

1336
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:20,270
20 or 25 of his friends and they went
and they just started like fighting fires

1337
01:20:20,341 --> 01:20:24,600
and people's houses all on their own
organized like aid stations and food

1338
01:20:24,601 --> 01:20:28,290
stations, getting generators.
And they did incredible work. Uh,

1339
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,730
but I told them I was coming on
your show today and he was, um,

1340
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:33,990
he just said that,

1341
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:39,050
that Joe Rogan and his show has made
such a deep impact on my life because he

1342
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:44,880
went from somebody who was
really triggered was the
word he used by people who

1343
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,010
were saying things that he disagreed with.

1344
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:52,410
And you inspired him to kind of open
his mind and his eyes and to recognize,

1345
01:20:55,150 --> 01:21:00,130
um, that we are stronger and we are better
when we have this kind of respectful

1346
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,790
discourse.
And we're open to hearing from an,

1347
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:07,600
I'm trying to understand people who may
have a different view rather than being

1348
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:11,880
triggered and running away in the opposite
direction or reacting in a negative

1349
01:21:11,881 --> 01:21:15,080
way. So I just wanted to
pass that on because, um,

1350
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:19,840
you made a big impact on him and on a
lot of a lot of his friends and a lot of

1351
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:24,670
people in the country and that that's
having a positive impact on, um,

1352
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:25,890
you know,

1353
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:30,230
our culture. Well that's
very nice. And shout out to
Keegan. I appreciate that. Um,

1354
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,910
I think that's something we can all learn
how to do. And I learned how to do it.

1355
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,270
Yeah.
It's not something I was naturally yeah.

1356
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,370
But I didn't naturally gravitate towards
having good conversations with people.

1357
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:47,140
Yeah. It was a dickhead when I was
young. I was fighting all the time. Yeah.

1358
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,320
Most of what I did was involved with,
I was involved in martial arts,

1359
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:54,320
so it was always involved with competition
was always very intense and I was

1360
01:21:54,321 --> 01:21:58,920
very competitive and I wasn't necessarily
that Nice, you know, all the time. And,

1361
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,813
um,

1362
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:04,910
when I examine my life over
time I realized that hmm.

1363
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:10,600
The things that always felt the worst
or conflicts that were unnecessary.

1364
01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:15,460
And in particular the things that I
judged myself the most harshly where at my

1365
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:18,130
mistakes or failures in my
attempts at doing things,

1366
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:22,580
it was my misbehaving, my, my, um,

1367
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:27,490
just being a jerk where it
wasn't necessary or having
an opportunity to be nice

1368
01:22:27,491 --> 01:22:31,060
and not taking it or escalating things
where I could have used diplomacy. Right.

1369
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:36,290
And I just learned over time that a lot
of it is the way I was communicating

1370
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:40,770
with people where I was failing was
how I was approaching their thoughts.

1371
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:45,780
And that I was immediately trying to be
right rather than listen to them and I

1372
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:49,850
was thinking about them differently.
Then I think about myself.

1373
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:54,640
One of the things that happened to me
when I had children was I started thinking

1374
01:22:54,641 --> 01:22:58,900
of people like babies that grew up.
I think of everyone like old people.

1375
01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:01,810
Like it freaks me out when I go to
the, uh, I was in a casino yesterday.

1376
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:04,960
I was passing by this old lady
smoking cigarettes, playing Bingo,

1377
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,320
playing roulette, rather
slots, whatever. Fuck it is.

1378
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:12,550
Whenever wasted money and I'm watching
her do this and I'm like, Oh God, this is,

1379
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:17,650
it was a baby. That was, someone's paid
me. Now here it is barely hanging on.

1380
01:23:18,610 --> 01:23:21,490
Who the fuck knows, right? Yeah.
That's what she likes to do.

1381
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,280
Maybe I'm just an idiot,
but my,

1382
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:30,300
my perspective has radically shifted and
as I've gotten older and then started

1383
01:23:31,781 --> 01:23:32,730
this podcast,

1384
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:36,610
that thing that I realized was that I
needed to get better at talking to people

1385
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:37,690
when I was doing the podcast.

1386
01:23:37,691 --> 01:23:42,610
I need to get better at listening
and then I needed to have less bias.

1387
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:48,940
Perspectives may be less biased points
of view and just try to understand what

1388
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,500
someone's saying and if I disagree,

1389
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,800
disagree and try to be as nice as possible
while also being accurate about how

1390
01:23:56,831 --> 01:24:01,480
much something bothers me. Yeah.
But being nice like we can do that.

1391
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:04,060
We can all be better off that way.
You know,

1392
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:08,080
and I share a lot of black
men when you get to these,

1393
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,510
like if you want to look
at the left or the right,

1394
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:16,260
I share so much in common with so many
people in both the left and the right

1395
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:20,200
that I almost want to put
a graph down of like what?

1396
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:24,940
How do you live your life like a unites
to people are ya, are you friendly?

1397
01:24:25,090 --> 01:24:26,710
Do you have good friends he care about?

1398
01:24:26,711 --> 01:24:28,920
Do you have buddies that could call
you at four o'clock in the morning?

1399
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,960
Say you've got to drive two hours and
pick me up and he would immediately do it.

1400
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:35,290
Yeah. Like what? What do you like? Okay.

1401
01:24:35,291 --> 01:24:38,770
Then what's bothering you?
What's bothering you in the news,

1402
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:43,060
what's bothering you and why do these
things exist and how many of them are

1403
01:24:43,061 --> 01:24:46,960
bullshit. Yeah, and for me
it was like there was a lot
of them that were bullshit.

1404
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:47,231
I was like,

1405
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:50,950
what am I wasting time and effort and
thinking about what do I care what people

1406
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:54,900
do? I don't, I don't care. I want you to
be nice and that's it. And then it get,

1407
01:24:54,901 --> 01:24:59,901
it gets down to political and social
issues and it gets down to the heavy ones.

1408
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,670
Things like abortion and war and you know,
freedom of religion.

1409
01:25:03,671 --> 01:25:05,890
And then in these,

1410
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:10,950
these things I think are the ones where
we should all just be communicating as

1411
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:15,700
commonly in, as in as objectively as
possible. And we should discourage this,

1412
01:25:15,730 --> 01:25:20,730
this tribal perspective discouraged this
idea of being married to your own ideas

1413
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:25,630
and, and trying to win these
arguments which you see in Congress,

1414
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:27,880
which you see in political campaigns,

1415
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:30,790
which you see in television.

1416
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:33,460
News is a fucking dumpster fire.

1417
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:38,870
Every single time they have the panel
with the three people is just by,

1418
01:25:38,871 --> 01:25:43,390
I can watch it. It's nonsense. Thank
you for your time. What did you, what,

1419
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:46,540
what waste is this?
It's just people shouting over people.

1420
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:49,780
You never find out what the fuck anybody
really believes. You just hear their,

1421
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:53,110
their, their talking points
blurted and vomited out.

1422
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,360
And this is the news. What's actually
happening is completely lost and it's so,

1423
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,120
it's,

1424
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,290
it's so limited and this is how a lot
of us are getting our view of the world.

1425
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,820
Yeah.
And I feel like

1426
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:08,290
things are changing.

1427
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:11,920
I think the world is a different place
than it was even just 10 years ago,

1428
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:13,030
I think.
I think so too.

1429
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:17,500
I think humans are different and I think
we just were not aware of how much all

1430
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:18,650
of this conversation on,

1431
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,920
on all of our analyzing the world around
us has shifted over the last decade or

1432
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,453
so.

1433
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:30,550
Yeah. People are looking, I feel
like people are looking for, uh,

1434
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,420
for the facts.
They're looking for more information.

1435
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:38,690
They're less likely to just accept at
face value what they're seeing on TV or

1436
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:43,620
what they're hearing. Uh, which I think
is, is a positive thing. Uh, and I think,

1437
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:48,630
I think we do need to look at the
leadership of this country to, um,

1438
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:52,350
to set this culture for a civil discourse,

1439
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:54,030
for making it,

1440
01:26:54,031 --> 01:26:58,590
making it okay and encouraging
actually those kinds of conversations.

1441
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:00,270
And that's where if you look at it,

1442
01:27:00,271 --> 01:27:02,970
you've watch cspan one night
when he can't fall asleep. Uh,

1443
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,710
you'll see in the floor of Congress,

1444
01:27:04,711 --> 01:27:06,930
you've got the Democrats who
were all sitting on one side.

1445
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,990
You've got the Republicans
all sitting on the other side.

1446
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,600
And unfortunately,

1447
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:17,580
not often enough do you see intermingling
and conversation and people go into

1448
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:22,100
the other side of the island actually
getting, getting to know people. Um,

1449
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:24,800
that was something that when I
first got elected, I was told, look,

1450
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:29,790
as a new member of Congress, serving in
the minority with Republicans in charge,

1451
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:33,320
coming from a small state like Hawaii,
you will never get anything done.

1452
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:34,310
So just accept it.

1453
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,860
Just accept that reality that you're
not going to get anything done,

1454
01:27:36,861 --> 01:27:41,840
wait several years or whatever. But
one of the first things that I did was,

1455
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:46,910
uh, I got to get to know people.
I got to make friends. So I, uh,

1456
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,760
my, my mom and dad, they're small
business owners and they had this, uh,

1457
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:55,910
Macadamia nut toffee business. And
so I called home and I said, hey mom,

1458
01:27:55,911 --> 01:28:00,911
can you make 434 boxes of your toffee
for every single member of Congress,

1459
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:06,230
all the Democrats, all the
Republicans. She's like, wow,
that's a great idea. Yeah,

1460
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:10,370
sure, I'd be happy to. And then I said,
Oh, I've got one more, one more request.

1461
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:12,840
Can you make a bigger box?
Uh,

1462
01:28:12,841 --> 01:28:17,841
435 bigger boxes of toffee for the staff
of every member of Congress because

1463
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:23,510
they're the ones who make shit
happen. And she said, okay,

1464
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:26,540
I'm going to take me a little bit longer.
But, uh, yes, I think that's a great idea.

1465
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:29,870
So, you know, I started
writing handwritten notes to
every one of my colleagues,

1466
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:30,950
introducing myself.

1467
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:35,000
And as we started delivering these
little gifts of Aloha to their offices,

1468
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:39,770
it was amazing how quickly I saw while
on the House floor casting votes,

1469
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:45,440
I have Republican chairman of powerful
committees making their way across from

1470
01:28:45,671 --> 01:28:50,500
the republican side to the democratic
side. Uh, saying thank you so much.

1471
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:52,510
I really appreciate it.
It was delicious.

1472
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:54,610
I need to get more from
you cause I ate it all.

1473
01:28:54,611 --> 01:28:58,330
I got to take some home to my wife
or my husband and then saying,

1474
01:28:58,331 --> 01:28:59,740
tell me what's going on in Hawaii.

1475
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:02,660
Tell me what your constituents
are worried about.

1476
01:29:02,661 --> 01:29:04,460
I am the chairman of the
Transportation Committee,

1477
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,470
the Agriculture Committee
or whatever it is.

1478
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,150
Let me know how we can work together.

1479
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,830
Just that one small outreach of Aloha,

1480
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:16,650
open the doors to these relationships
that enabled me to be able to pass my

1481
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:21,030
first piece of legislation like my first
six months as a member of Congress from

1482
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:24,910
a small state in the
minority, um, as a democrat.

1483
01:29:25,180 --> 01:29:27,400
And it's because just
treating people with respect,

1484
01:29:27,401 --> 01:29:29,020
treating people with Aloha and saying,
yeah,

1485
01:29:29,021 --> 01:29:33,880
we can disagree even on nine out of 10
things, but on that 10th thing like,

1486
01:29:33,881 --> 01:29:35,860
Hey, let's talk. Let's get something done.

1487
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:39,880
Was that eye opening for you and when
did you at that moment in time realized

1488
01:29:39,881 --> 01:29:42,340
like, Hey, I not only can
I make an impact here,

1489
01:29:42,341 --> 01:29:44,260
I can do this the way I want to do it?
Yes,

1490
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:47,450
I can be a kind person and
reach out and do you mean,

1491
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,480
and I don't have to listen to these
people that are entrenched? Exactly.

1492
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:51,050
It,
it,

1493
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:56,050
it directly disproved what we were told
in those first days as new members of

1494
01:29:56,341 --> 01:30:00,630
Congress in Washington. And a
further affirmed what I already knew,

1495
01:30:00,631 --> 01:30:02,640
both from what I learned
from Senator Akaka,

1496
01:30:02,641 --> 01:30:06,690
what I knew from growing up in Hawaii
with the Aloha spirit, that this,

1497
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:11,690
this ability to transcend all of
this superficial divisiveness,

1498
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,250
uh, whether it be based
on politics like you said,

1499
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:17,100
or religion or race or ethnicity or,

1500
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:22,180
or any of these other things is what
has the power to bring us together as a

1501
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:23,014
country.

1502
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,920
Okay. That's a beautiful thing
to hear. Like that's true.

1503
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:31,210
That's what people want to hear. They
want to hear someone who thinks that way.

1504
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:34,090
Yeah and that like, oh, we're
okay. We're going to be okay.

1505
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:39,540
Like we can move forward and be okay and
do this like like human beings not like

1506
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:41,380
politicians. Yeah, exactly.

1507
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:44,680
There's a politician way of talking
and I want you to avoid at all costs.

1508
01:30:44,681 --> 01:30:47,290
I want you to never do this thing
with your thumb. Don't do that.

1509
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:49,870
Because I was talking to someone and
they did that thing with their thumb.

1510
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:53,110
I'd be like, hey bro, what the fuck's
wrong with your hand if you're not,

1511
01:30:53,290 --> 01:30:56,160
you didn't just have a stroke.
What's your Goddamn hand down?

1512
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:59,320
I never realized it until I
started watching like myself.

1513
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:02,770
Give speeches on TV that I do talk
a lot with my hands. That's fine,

1514
01:31:02,771 --> 01:31:04,340
but just don't do that. This one? Yeah.

1515
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:08,200
This is just as offensive as if you
just started putting up your dukes,

1516
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,990
like if you started like where we're going
to go out there and like what are you

1517
01:31:10,991 --> 01:31:13,300
doing man? He fighting people. Exactly.

1518
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:17,160
Talking down like this is a
teacher move. Right, right.

1519
01:31:17,170 --> 01:31:19,390
I feel like this is a teacher
move it in the military,

1520
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:23,380
they call it the knife hand. You see
like the drill instructors are like,

1521
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:26,460
come on private. Yeah, but at least
gets a drill instructor. Exactly.

1522
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:30,070
You're supposed to listen to,
this is the fucking public servant.

1523
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:31,450
He was like at a half a fist.

1524
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:35,170
Like there's no reason to ever put your
hand like that. This is not a good move.

1525
01:31:35,770 --> 01:31:39,580
Like unless you're trying to poke somebody
in the eye to see only reason why you

1526
01:31:39,581 --> 01:31:42,010
should have your thumb up like that.
Even know where that comes from.

1527
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,450
Clinton Move Clinton I think was the
first guy to do it. That was his shit.

1528
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:50,380
He used to do that. Funny. We're going
to do here. He used to have this thing.

1529
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:52,930
He would do it. His thumb. Yeah.
Would drive me crazy. I'd be like,

1530
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:56,790
this is such a bizarre thing. He
doesn't want to be forceful. Yeah.

1531
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:00,550
He doesn't want to have a fist and he
doesn't want to do and so just stick one

1532
01:32:00,551 --> 01:32:01,840
finger out and that that,

1533
01:32:01,940 --> 01:32:06,220
that deescalates who was making fun
of that Bedo Guy. What's his name?

1534
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:10,540
Yeah, he, his hand movements. You've
got some wacky hand stuff that he does.

1535
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:15,370
You can't be named Baido I'm sorry.
It's too close to Beta.

1536
01:32:15,730 --> 01:32:20,380
Just everyone should have told him that
one value away from being like the most

1537
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:24,580
mocked thing in society when it
comes to males. Can't do that.

1538
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:26,740
I don't even know if he's a good
guy or not, but you can't do that.

1539
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:29,170
You got to get in something. He's a
friend of mine changed name Homie. Yeah,

1540
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:32,530
it's too late.
You've got to get plastic surgery.

1541
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,780
Come back with a different social security
number. It's just too close. Yeah,

1542
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:40,730
and don't be skateboarding. No,
no. What's wrong? Let's keep going.

1543
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,020
Know what you're knowing it.

1544
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,370
Does he know what he's doing or was
he just goofing around? Young dude,

1545
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:47,100
he probably knows what he's doing.
Doesn't look like it looks sloppy.

1546
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:51,760
I didn't see it was pretty sloppy,
but it's a thing that people do with,

1547
01:32:51,761 --> 01:32:56,170
like I'm one of you how come on, I'm
letting you guys come on. It's like,

1548
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:59,890
get out of here with that William. Yeah,
this is, I, I dunno sometimes like,

1549
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:02,440
you know, I'll post
little, little videos, um,

1550
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:07,650
that Abraham takes his Gopro of us out
surfing. And sometimes I get that fruit,

1551
01:33:07,651 --> 01:33:11,950
but like, oh, like why are you trying
to pretend something? I'm like, dude,

1552
01:33:11,951 --> 01:33:16,510
I just love the ocean. I Love Surfing.
I want to share this with everybody.

1553
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,210
Yeah. It's, it's a simple thing.
People are funny like that.

1554
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:25,030
They don't want you to be fake, so, but
they also don't want you to be real. Ooh,

1555
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:29,440
that's true too. Right? Yeah, that's
true. Yeah. So it's, it's, I don't know,

1556
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:32,410
it's some kind of in between or
something. I don't know. Well,

1557
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:35,590
I think there's just certain
people that are malcontents. Yeah.

1558
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:36,670
And you're not gonna,
you know,

1559
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,820
if you addressed all the people
that are upsetting you all the time,

1560
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,400
you would never get
anything done. Right? Yeah.

1561
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:47,020
How are you recognize in that
though? Cause you're, how
old are you? 38. You're not?

1562
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:52,150
No. You're very young in terms of like
someone who's going to be president.

1563
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:56,470
Yeah. That's young. Thirties.
Um, I'll, I'll be, I'll just
say you're not that young.

1564
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,520
I'm not that. Yeah. 38 for
presidents. That's young shell.

1565
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,850
How old was JFK when he got elected?
I think like 41 42 older than he is.

1566
01:34:03,851 --> 01:34:06,990
I'm like that. Barely. I'll, I'll
do like, I'll be 41. I'm sworn,

1567
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:11,230
sworn in as president. Right, right
around there. Okay. But like I say when,

1568
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:16,450
but yeah, exactly. Confidence. Um, look,
look at, look at Donald Trump though.

1569
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,900
So what? He's in his mid seventies. Right.

1570
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:24,700
But his maturity is of an adolescent.

1571
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:27,520
He's a Canadian test. He's of a
fitbit. He should have been a comedian.

1572
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,380
I'm telling you,
the guy would've been killing it.

1573
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:34,300
That's comic instead of a real
estate developer. Great timing. Yeah,

1574
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:39,250
that's true. Yeah. He's
very mature. But my point is
maturity. Maturity Matters. Yes.

1575
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,780
Experience matters.
And that the experience that I bring is,

1576
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:47,020
is different from any other candidate
who's running for president of serving as

1577
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:51,250
a soldier for 16 years of serving in
Congress on these, on these committees of,

1578
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:54,580
of importance and national
security. Uh, you know,

1579
01:34:54,581 --> 01:34:57,470
I've started this state
legislature and the city council

1580
01:34:57,940 --> 01:35:02,170
and um, look, when you look back, we
talked about our founding fathers. Yeah.

1581
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:07,670
Most of them who crafted the constitution
and who wrote the declaration of

1582
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:12,300
independence or under the age of 40
many under the age of lived there,

1583
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:17,630
40 bag men still still we're talking
about experience and maturity here.

1584
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:21,170
I know you're, you're, no, you're
defending yourself. I fully support you.

1585
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:24,270
I think you could be president 38. I
really do. I don't think it's a problem.

1586
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:28,100
And at 40 for sure you'll be 24
years older or 24 months older,

1587
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:31,370
you're going to be wiser.
You'll, you'll have it nailed.

1588
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:36,470
But we do wonder, right? Like how,

1589
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:40,210
when has a person had enough life
experience and what, but then again,

1590
01:35:40,211 --> 01:35:43,330
the question is what is that life
experience? Is it life experience?

1591
01:35:43,331 --> 01:35:46,230
Like you said, that leads you to
be an immature 17 year old, right?

1592
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:51,420
Or is this the life experience of someone
who's served in combat and has Ben on

1593
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,620
in Congress for six years and someone
who understands how the government works

1594
01:35:55,621 --> 01:35:57,690
and has a better
perspective of human beings?

1595
01:35:57,790 --> 01:35:58,630
Yeah,
it is.

1596
01:35:58,631 --> 01:36:02,780
It is that experience and it's what you
draw from it and the conclusions and the

1597
01:36:02,781 --> 01:36:07,270
judgment and the kind of leadership
that you would exercise. Yeah. You know,

1598
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:12,310
there were a lot of folks in 2016
who said Hillary Clinton was the most

1599
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:17,000
experienced candidate ever to run for
president because of the jobs she had held

1600
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:19,180
or the experience that she had had.
Okay.

1601
01:36:19,290 --> 01:36:24,290
My problem was with her judgment and the
kinds of decisions that she would make

1602
01:36:24,990 --> 01:36:29,350
as commander in chief decisions
that would continue to send, uh,

1603
01:36:29,410 --> 01:36:33,070
people like me and my brothers and
sisters in uniform to continue to fight in

1604
01:36:33,071 --> 01:36:38,071
these wasteful regime change wars that
actually dishonor the oath that we all

1605
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:40,800
take when we volunteer to serve,
to serve,

1606
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,650
to protect and defend our
country and the American people.

1607
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:47,410
And instead sending us on
these missions that, uh,

1608
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:51,220
our counter to that promise that
undermine our national security,

1609
01:36:51,221 --> 01:36:55,050
that undermine the great sacrifice that
our troops and their families make.

1610
01:36:55,051 --> 01:36:59,170
So it's that judgment. It's the
experience and the judgment that, uh,

1611
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,080
I believe we need to look for
in the next commander in chief.

1612
01:37:03,081 --> 01:37:05,990
It's what I bring to the table and
it's what I challenge voters too.

1613
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:10,980
Ask the other candidates and to, to hold
them to account on both of those fronts.

1614
01:37:10,981 --> 01:37:15,840
Would they be ready to walk into that
Oval Office on day one and to serve our

1615
01:37:15,841 --> 01:37:17,400
country as commander in chief?

1616
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:21,550
One of the messages that Trump was very
successful in getting out was that he

1617
01:37:21,551 --> 01:37:23,110
wanted to drain the swamp.

1618
01:37:23,111 --> 01:37:28,040
That we all realize that there's
just this tangled web of bureaucracy.

1619
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,110
Yeah.
And

1620
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:30,350
that

1621
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:34,280
he did a good job of connecting
Hillary too, that bureaucracy and say,

1622
01:37:34,281 --> 01:37:37,190
this woman is just completely
entrenched in this world.

1623
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,310
She's never going to get out.
She's not even a real person anymore.

1624
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,410
She's just a professional politician.

1625
01:37:42,411 --> 01:37:45,500
And he would highlight all the different
things that she did and lied and all

1626
01:37:45,830 --> 01:37:50,650
call her crooked Hillary and that
just got stuck. What made him,

1627
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:54,280
one of the things that
made him very attractive to
people is that he seemed like

1628
01:37:54,281 --> 01:37:57,310
a person didn't seem like a
politician that seem like a person.

1629
01:37:57,700 --> 01:38:02,700
How do you avoid communicating like a
politician when you're doing this in mass,

1630
01:38:04,961 --> 01:38:08,330
when you're communicating with
giant groups of people, when you're,

1631
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:11,710
you're having these big
speeches in these big places,

1632
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:13,870
how do you do it without being,

1633
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,900
how do you do it and still let
people know you're just a person?

1634
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:21,010
Cause that's I think what
people are longing for and
what they don't see in many

1635
01:38:21,011 --> 01:38:24,640
candidates. You see this act like,
oh he's pretty good at it. Exact,

1636
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:28,000
but I see the act. Yeah. I
don't see a person. Yeah.

1637
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:34,250
Being myself speaking the truth and
standing up for what I believe in and why

1638
01:38:34,771 --> 01:38:38,040
I'm offering to serve our country,
think there's no really,

1639
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:40,890
there's no other way to do it
because if I start like, okay,

1640
01:38:40,891 --> 01:38:45,190
how am I going to convey myself as a real
person? The only way to do that is to,

1641
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:49,160
to actually be a real person and who
speaking truthfully and honestly and

1642
01:38:49,161 --> 01:38:54,161
respecting the American people and the
responsibility that I'm asking them to

1643
01:38:54,971 --> 01:38:58,090
bestow upon me. That mission that
I'm asking them to charge me with.

1644
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:02,110
Yeah. Does this, you, you,

1645
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:05,090
you've said you've always
been drawn to service. Yeah.

1646
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:10,270
Does this seem like, uh, calling to you?
Like what does this feel like to you?

1647
01:39:10,271 --> 01:39:13,750
This idea that you are going
to be the commander in chief,

1648
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,670
the greatest army the
world has ever known,

1649
01:39:15,671 --> 01:39:18,870
the leader of the free world in
a sense. Yeah. What does that,

1650
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,010
what does that seem like to you?

1651
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:25,970
The, the, the grave responsibility
that that job carries, uh,

1652
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:30,020
and the seriousness with
which I would bring, uh,

1653
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,830
my experience in my judgment
to fulfilling that job. MMM.

1654
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:35,731
You know,
this is,

1655
01:39:35,731 --> 01:39:40,200
I think one of the problems that we
have too often in our politics is that

1656
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:45,330
people self serving politicians are more
interested in keeping their job or in

1657
01:39:45,331 --> 01:39:49,940
getting the next job or you
know, in lining their pockets,
getting ready for the,

1658
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:51,770
you know,
the afterlife or whatever.

1659
01:39:51,771 --> 01:39:55,560
When they leave their political
office that that somehow is, is,

1660
01:39:55,561 --> 01:40:00,561
is defining of who they are
rather than recognizing,

1661
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:02,920
um,
that,

1662
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:07,270
that to be able to serve the people
is a great honor and it's tremendous

1663
01:40:07,271 --> 01:40:12,070
responsibility and that's how I
approach serving in, uh, you know,

1664
01:40:12,071 --> 01:40:15,260
the local, the state level
and at Congress. Uh, and,

1665
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:18,910
and how I approach being able to serve
the American people as president and

1666
01:40:18,911 --> 01:40:19,451
commander in chief.

1667
01:40:19,451 --> 01:40:24,451
It is a grave responsibility and I will
never forget for a single moment who I

1668
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:27,640
serve and who I work for.
Okay.

1669
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:33,720
What is your take on
wikileaks and Julian Assange?

1670
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:37,590
Okay.
What happened with the,

1671
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:41,160
with his arrest and all this
stuff that just went down, um,

1672
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:47,510
I think poses a great threat to our
freedom of the press and to our freedom of

1673
01:40:48,831 --> 01:40:50,040
speech.
Yeah.

1674
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:54,850
We look at what happened under
the previous administration
under Obama. You know,

1675
01:40:54,851 --> 01:40:59,530
they were trying to find ways to go
after a [inaudible] and wikileaks.

1676
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:04,800
But ultimately they chose not to seek
to extradite him or charge him because

1677
01:41:06,341 --> 01:41:11,341
they recognized what a slippery slope
that begins when you have a government in

1678
01:41:12,481 --> 01:41:14,670
a position to,
uh,

1679
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:19,560
Levy criminal charges and consequences
against someone who's publishing

1680
01:41:19,561 --> 01:41:23,070
information or saying things that the
government doesn't want you to say.

1681
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:26,010
The government does him
sharing information the
government government doesn't

1682
01:41:26,011 --> 01:41:30,600
want you to share. And so the fact that
the Trump administration has chosen,

1683
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:33,910
um,
to ignore that fact,

1684
01:41:33,911 --> 01:41:37,090
to ignore how important it is
that we uphold our freedoms,

1685
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:40,210
freedom of the press and freedom
of speech and go after him.

1686
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:45,640
It has a very chilling effect on
both journalists and publishers.

1687
01:41:45,921 --> 01:41:48,230
And you can look to both those
in the traditional media,

1688
01:41:48,231 --> 01:41:53,180
but also those in new media, uh, and
also on, on every one of us as American.

1689
01:41:53,181 --> 01:41:56,460
It was, it was, uh, uh, kind
of a warning call saying,

1690
01:41:56,461 --> 01:41:59,740
look what happened to this guy.
It could happen to,

1691
01:41:59,741 --> 01:42:01,210
you could happen to any one of us.

1692
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:02,990
Well,
it's very transparent too,

1693
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:06,890
cause there's no real compelling crime
for them to be going after him the way

1694
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:09,470
they are. There's not one
thing that stands out in the,

1695
01:42:09,471 --> 01:42:12,330
the latest one is hacking and some

1696
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:15,510
not even hacking it's
conspiracy conspiracy charges.

1697
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:19,150
That doesn't make any sense that they
would spend that much time going after

1698
01:42:19,151 --> 01:42:20,540
that guy for those charges.
Yeah,

1699
01:42:20,570 --> 01:42:24,550
it's obvious and very transparent
that there's another ulterior motive.

1700
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:28,310
Ulterior motive is that he leaked a bunch
of things that were incredibly, yes.

1701
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:32,340
Embarrassing. That's right. And not only
that, but I think it was Secretary Palm,

1702
01:42:32,341 --> 01:42:32,661
Peo,

1703
01:42:32,661 --> 01:42:37,661
secretary of state who said that they
wanted to designate Wiki leaks and

1704
01:42:39,531 --> 01:42:43,150
assigned as a foreign intelligence agency.

1705
01:42:44,190 --> 01:42:47,830
So once you do that, then you're talking
about a whole different category.

1706
01:42:47,831 --> 01:42:51,130
So they're pushing out information once
again that the government didn't want

1707
01:42:51,131 --> 01:42:55,000
pushed out. [inaudible] if
the government then says, oh,

1708
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:57,880
well now we're going to reclassify
you as a foreign intelligence agency,

1709
01:42:57,881 --> 01:43:01,960
then there's a whole different set of
rules of engagement that apply there.

1710
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:05,290
Then you're no longer
protected under, uh, you know,

1711
01:43:05,291 --> 01:43:07,900
the freedoms that we hold dear.
The freedom of the press.

1712
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:12,180
It's just such a disgusting
way of framing things. Like,

1713
01:43:12,181 --> 01:43:14,420
do you know he's on a foreign
intelligence agent? Yeah.

1714
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:20,370
He's a guy that got information and
released it to the general public that the

1715
01:43:21,191 --> 01:43:24,820
government wanted to keep private.
It's really that simple. Yeah. Um,

1716
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,750
Edward Snowden.

1717
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:30,860
Yup. What is your similar, similar
situation? Similar situation?

1718
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:34,470
I don't think I'm, I
don't think we, you know,

1719
01:43:34,471 --> 01:43:39,330
I remembered the very day
that I woke up, uh, in DC,

1720
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,720
looked at my phone and started looking
through the headlines and saw those

1721
01:43:42,721 --> 01:43:47,721
headlines about how the NSA was mass
surveilling all of us and collecting our

1722
01:43:49,781 --> 01:43:54,590
phone records, collecting our phone
records and Verizon at t and t, t mobile.

1723
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:59,760
And I was, I was shocked. So that
was something that Snowden uncovered,

1724
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:01,660
uh, and released, uh,

1725
01:44:01,661 --> 01:44:04,450
something that I don't know that even as
members of Congress who would have been

1726
01:44:04,451 --> 01:44:07,330
aware of. So now that we
were aware of it than, hey,

1727
01:44:07,331 --> 01:44:09,760
we can take action two to f,

1728
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:14,060
close those loopholes to change those
policies, to protect our civil liberties,

1729
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:18,320
to protect our fourth amendment,
constitutional rights as Americans.

1730
01:44:18,740 --> 01:44:23,050
But was the NSA going to disclose that
information voluntarily on their own?

1731
01:44:23,051 --> 01:44:23,884
Absolutely not.

1732
01:44:25,060 --> 01:44:26,870
No idea, no. We would have had suspicions,

1733
01:44:26,871 --> 01:44:31,610
but then again we'd have tin foil hats
on and there was a gentleman who was,

1734
01:44:32,150 --> 01:44:36,440
who left the NSA very early on a hill was,

1735
01:44:36,441 --> 01:44:39,770
that was his last name, but he was
one of the first ones to discuss this.

1736
01:44:39,771 --> 01:44:42,260
This is post nine 11 when
they first started doing it,

1737
01:44:42,261 --> 01:44:47,261
but Snowden was the guy that really made
it abundantly clear to everybody that

1738
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:49,950
not only are they doing that,
but they're also lying about it.

1739
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:54,120
And even Obama was talking about we're
just collecting better data. The metadata,

1740
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:58,590
like, no, you're not reading messages.
You could do anything. Exactly.

1741
01:44:58,591 --> 01:45:02,370
And this is just not an accurate
assessment of what was going on. No,

1742
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:03,470
and it was outrageous.

1743
01:45:03,910 --> 01:45:04,870
And you had a,

1744
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,740
I think he was the director
of the Department of
national intelligence at that

1745
01:45:08,741 --> 01:45:09,700
time.
James Clapper,

1746
01:45:09,701 --> 01:45:14,701
who sat before a committee in the
United States Senate and latently lied.

1747
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:19,380
Yeah. He was asked very directly, are you
collecting this information? And he said,

1748
01:45:19,381 --> 01:45:23,980
no. Are you collecting this information
on American citizens? And he said, no.

1749
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:29,580
And yet he's somebody who you see on TV
almost every day as an expert in this

1750
01:45:30,341 --> 01:45:32,950
country without any consequence
lying to the American people.

1751
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:36,870
And I think that if you
polled the American people
and you ask us to vote on it,

1752
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:42,160
know I w I think it would be a gigantic
landslide victory for Edward Snowden to

1753
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:46,320
be exonerated and brought back to the
United States. They've got this guy, Lou,

1754
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:48,090
he's in Russia now hiding.
Yeah.

1755
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:50,910
Like it's crazy that he lives
over there and he can't leave.

1756
01:45:50,911 --> 01:45:53,280
And if he does come over here, they're
going to immediately gonna lock him up.

1757
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:55,180
Yeah.
What would you do as president?

1758
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,880
One thing that I think,
I want to answer your question,

1759
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:02,810
but one thing that I think,
um, speaks to the Deign,

1760
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:07,260
the dangerous nature of this culture
that we're living in now. Uh,

1761
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:11,880
uh, the Senate minority leader, Chuck
Schumer had done an interview on,

1762
01:46:11,881 --> 01:46:14,790
I don't know, one of the major
networks, and I think he was,

1763
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,210
I think he was talking about
Trump when he said, be careful.

1764
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:20,320
You don't want a challenge,

1765
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:25,570
the intelligence agencies
basically putting out that threat.

1766
01:46:25,571 --> 01:46:27,910
I don't know if,
if you can pull that exact quote up,

1767
01:46:27,911 --> 01:46:32,560
but I was shocked when I heard him say
that because it basically makes out that

1768
01:46:32,561 --> 01:46:36,550
these intelligence agencies are their
own separate branch of government.

1769
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:40,810
And that if any one of us as Americans
or elected leaders in this country dares

1770
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:43,780
to challenge or exercise
oversight over them,

1771
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:47,860
then we will suffer the consequences.
Uh,

1772
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:51,000
so as president would change
that culture of leadership,

1773
01:46:51,001 --> 01:46:53,540
that that leadership starts at the top.

1774
01:46:53,990 --> 01:46:58,990
And when you have people in positions of
leadership who continued to perpetuate

1775
01:46:59,071 --> 01:47:01,740
that culture of unaccountability,

1776
01:47:01,970 --> 01:47:06,740
of complete disrespect and
disregard for the constitution of,

1777
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:10,310
of not understanding that yes,
we need to keep our country safe,

1778
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:13,110
we also need to protect
our constitutional rights.

1779
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:17,820
This is not a choice between the two,
which is so often how it's framed. Well,

1780
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,470
if you want to protect
us against terrorists,

1781
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:23,060
you've got to give up all of your rights
as Americans in your civil liberties

1782
01:47:23,061 --> 01:47:27,290
and your privacy's and, and just let
these intelligence agencies run, uh,

1783
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:30,000
run free and run roughshod over us.
Uh,

1784
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:33,680
and so that's the kind of of change
in leadership that I'll bring.

1785
01:47:33,681 --> 01:47:37,490
There's a whole host of policies that,
that we can look at. Uh, for example,

1786
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:38,271
with the Patriot Act,

1787
01:47:38,271 --> 01:47:42,150
the Patriot Act is up for
reauthorization in Congress this year.

1788
01:47:42,450 --> 01:47:46,140
There have been different sections of
it that we have worked to try to change

1789
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:51,141
and reform to make it so that agencies
like the NSA cannot collect our private

1790
01:47:51,151 --> 01:47:53,970
information as Americans
without a warrant.

1791
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:57,500
But there is far more that has to be done,
uh,

1792
01:47:57,530 --> 01:48:01,400
to undo the damage that,
that we've already seen,

1793
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:05,950
the abuse of our, of our rights and
privacies that we've already seen. Okay.

1794
01:48:06,130 --> 01:48:10,690
Yeah. Did you ever listen to the
Kennedy speech about secret societies?

1795
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:14,770
[inaudible] Kennedy had
a, a fantastic speech, uh,

1796
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:19,630
before he was assassinated where he was
discussing this very thing. And, uh,

1797
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:22,610
he apparently,
uh,

1798
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:27,130
had notions of disbanding the CIA and,
um,

1799
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:32,410
he was very concerned with the power of
people like a j Edgar Hoover course and

1800
01:48:32,661 --> 01:48:35,990
yeah. That this was all
happening while he was president.

1801
01:48:35,991 --> 01:48:40,460
And he felt like there were people that
were involved in these secret societies

1802
01:48:40,461 --> 01:48:44,730
and these secrets meetings and that there
was a lot of conspiracy going on and

1803
01:48:44,731 --> 01:48:47,880
he thought that the very idea was
repugnant. It's a fantastic speech.

1804
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:50,760
Interesting president. And the press
is what it's like, it's got a title,

1805
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:53,640
it's a fantastic speech.
I'll check it out. Um,

1806
01:48:53,690 --> 01:48:58,630
but this has always been
the real concern that, uh,

1807
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:03,670
people have that when you give someone
the ability to surveil the general

1808
01:49:04,191 --> 01:49:05,370
population,
when you give them,

1809
01:49:05,550 --> 01:49:10,550
they're going to use some
of that information to aid
in their allies and to work

1810
01:49:10,551 --> 01:49:11,450
against their enemies.

1811
01:49:11,550 --> 01:49:15,870
Yeah. That is ims a valid concern. Yes.
And I mean, this is what unfortunately,

1812
01:49:15,871 --> 01:49:16,860
we've already seen.

1813
01:49:16,861 --> 01:49:21,550
This is what has been revealed by some
of that information that was released by

1814
01:49:21,551 --> 01:49:24,140
Snowden and how,
for example,

1815
01:49:24,141 --> 01:49:29,141
the Pfizer court as we have it now
is a secret court that has and,

1816
01:49:29,590 --> 01:49:32,430
um,
has been abused for that purpose,

1817
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,710
allowing for that surveillance
of Americans violating
our civil liberties and

1818
01:49:36,711 --> 01:49:40,290
privacies. And that's something
that we've got to fix that whole,

1819
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:44,870
that whole Fi's a court from top to bottom
and how the different judges explain

1820
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,960
pointed to people. It's, it's
basically, it's a, it's a,

1821
01:49:47,961 --> 01:49:51,820
a secret court that was
appointed, uh, I believe, uh,

1822
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:56,821
created back in the 70s with the initial
objective of providing oversight over

1823
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:01,570
the executive branch,
um,

1824
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,590
mass surveillance that was happening at
that time or illegal surveillance that

1825
01:50:05,591 --> 01:50:09,100
was happening at that time,
unfortunately,

1826
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:11,020
especially since nine 11.

1827
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:15,760
Now you have this Pfizer court
that is both used to, uh,

1828
01:50:15,890 --> 01:50:20,890
approve surveillance and surveillance
programs on a foreign targets,

1829
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:26,740
uh, but also on Americans as well. Uh,

1830
01:50:26,770 --> 01:50:31,770
the one of the many problems with this
is it's a secret court where you have a

1831
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:35,620
judge and you have someone
representing the government,

1832
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:40,240
whether it be one of the Intel agencies
or the dod or whatever coming before

1833
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:45,220
this court in making their case to try to
get this warrant approved by the judge.

1834
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:49,180
There is no advocate there for the people.

1835
01:50:49,181 --> 01:50:53,170
There is no civil liberties or
privacy advocate there. Uh, it's,

1836
01:50:53,171 --> 01:50:56,800
it's a one sided conversation.
Uh,

1837
01:50:56,801 --> 01:51:00,310
and the information being provided by
the government is the only information

1838
01:51:00,311 --> 01:51:05,180
that's being given to the
judge. Uh, so this is one of
the big problems there. And,

1839
01:51:05,181 --> 01:51:09,250
and we've seen over decades now
and especially since after nine 11,

1840
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:13,980
that there have been
very, very, very few, um,

1841
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:18,580
applications for these surveillance
warrants that have been rejected by the

1842
01:51:18,581 --> 01:51:20,560
judges. So, you know,

1843
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:23,930
a rubber stamping of these
applications for warrants is,

1844
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:27,880
is really what appears to
be happening. Um, you know,

1845
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:30,940
there's a few different ways that
we're looking at trying to fix this.

1846
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:35,590
There are some who are arguing, uh, to,
to take away the Pfizer court completely.

1847
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:38,950
One of the concerns about
that is that if we do that,

1848
01:51:38,951 --> 01:51:43,951
then there has to be some other entity
in place to exercise oversight over the

1849
01:51:43,991 --> 01:51:48,070
executive branch and not allow them to,
um,

1850
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:52,300
conduct the surveillance, you know,
Willy Nilly as as they please.

1851
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:54,880
Um,
so it's figuring out exactly what,

1852
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:59,230
what are the best reforms to meet that
objective of providing that oversight,

1853
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:03,910
making it so that those warrants
are given, um, you know,

1854
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,590
as needed and making sure that all in
all the information is being presented.

1855
01:52:08,890 --> 01:52:09,371
And again,

1856
01:52:09,371 --> 01:52:13,660
that that Fi's a court was initially
put in place to go after a tick to get

1857
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:18,250
warrants, to conduct surveillance on
foreign targets. Um, not Americans.

1858
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:21,100
And that's been one of the biggest
problems here with a lot of this mass

1859
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:25,420
surveillance is it's collecting our
information as Americans illegally and

1860
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:30,220
unconstitutionally because you can't do
that unless you go through this process

1861
01:52:30,221 --> 01:52:33,340
and you actually get a
warrant based on evidence.

1862
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:39,610
What would you do about Julian the songs?
What would you do about Snowden? Uh,

1863
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:44,050
as far as undoing, dropping the charges
president of the world, right? Yeah.

1864
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:45,350
We're dropping the charges.

1865
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:46,950
You dropped the charges,
but yeah,

1866
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:50,510
they're still going after him
for something from Sweden, uh,

1867
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:52,190
in Julian [inaudible] case.
Yeah.

1868
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:56,120
And so Edward Snowden would be the only
one that you'd be able to write because

1869
01:52:56,150 --> 01:53:00,410
unless you would influence it, the charges
that the Trump administration is, um,

1870
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:02,870
uh, putting on Julian
Assange's. Right, exactly.

1871
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,470
And it remains to be seen whether or
not they will push for extradition.

1872
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:11,000
There's another charge that was, I think
it was today, the Sweden decided to, uh,

1873
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:16,820
go after him again for some
sexual thing that they had, uh,

1874
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:22,100
decided to go after many, many
years ago. Um, Edward Snowden,

1875
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:28,480
what he's doing right now is essentially
living day to day hold up in Russia in

1876
01:53:29,031 --> 01:53:33,650
hiding.
And w w the charges against him stem from,

1877
01:53:33,680 --> 01:53:38,060
again, this illegal operation
that he, in many ways,

1878
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:42,830
he's very patriotic. I mean, he let
us know and at, at great costs. Yeah.

1879
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:47,270
So you would give him a pardon?
Yeah, yeah. And I think address,

1880
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:52,271
we've got to address why he did the
things the way that he did them.

1881
01:53:52,850 --> 01:53:57,140
And you hear the same thing from
Chelsea Manning, how there is not,

1882
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:02,360
there is not an actual channel for
whistle blowers like them to bring forward

1883
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:07,900
information that exposes egregious
abuses of our constitutional rights and

1884
01:54:08,031 --> 01:54:12,350
liberties. Um, period. I mean there's,

1885
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:15,470
there was not a channel for
that to happen in a real way.

1886
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:18,920
And that's why they ended up taking the
path that they did and suffering the

1887
01:54:18,921 --> 01:54:19,760
consequences.

1888
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:24,200
There's a great bill hooks bit about what
happens when you become president that

1889
01:54:24,201 --> 01:54:28,320
they, uh, they bring you in a room
filled with smoke, cigar smoking buttons,

1890
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:29,173
industrialists,

1891
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,810
and they play a video of the Kennedy
assassination from an angle you never saw

1892
01:54:32,811 --> 01:54:37,490
before. Wow. And they say, uh, any,
any questions? And he had this bit,

1893
01:54:37,491 --> 01:54:42,350
and I thought about this bit when I
thought about Obama because Obama,

1894
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:45,620
when he had his hope and change website
when he was running for president,

1895
01:54:45,621 --> 01:54:48,470
one of the things that they addresses
whistle blowers and how much they would

1896
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:53,471
provide a platform for whistleblowers to
expose illegal activity that was still

1897
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:57,500
on his website while he was president.

1898
01:54:57,500 --> 01:55:01,310
And while Julian Assange was
getting arrested. And while this,

1899
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:03,790
all this was going down and,
um,

1900
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:07,550
they wound up taking it down off of the
website. Once somebody pointed it out,

1901
01:55:07,551 --> 01:55:08,540
like, hey, you had this,

1902
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:12,590
what happens when you become president?

1903
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:15,290
What do you think
happens and why do these,

1904
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:17,870
do you think that there are full of
shit and they're just saying what,

1905
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:20,510
what we want to hear so
they can get elected?

1906
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:24,740
Or do you think that there is something
that happens to them once they get into

1907
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:25,574
office?

1908
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:30,670
Do you think that it's possible that
they're given information that shows the

1909
01:55:32,270 --> 01:55:37,160
real threats at the world has and there's
things that the general public is just

1910
01:55:37,161 --> 01:55:38,030
not privy to.

1911
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:42,990
And these are what influences people's
decisions to go against all the things

1912
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:43,980
they were saying when they're running for

1913
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:47,160
president. Yeah. Um, look,

1914
01:55:47,161 --> 01:55:51,180
I haven't been with them and I've been
in those rooms, so I won't speak for, uh,

1915
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,970
for, for that, which I do not know.

1916
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:59,390
But what I do know is this is
what happens when you have,

1917
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:04,350
um, people who are elected to
serve in this job as president,

1918
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:07,800
who's most important responsibility
as commander in chief.

1919
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:13,070
And they lack the experience and the
understanding to be able to make the right

1920
01:56:15,691 --> 01:56:20,691
kinds of decisions that serve the American
people and end up even those going in

1921
01:56:21,121 --> 01:56:25,320
with the best of intentions
end up being very influenced,

1922
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:29,340
whether it be by the military
industrial complex or the foreign policy

1923
01:56:29,341 --> 01:56:34,341
establishment that as we've seen over
decades has crossed both political

1924
01:56:34,651 --> 01:56:39,090
parties, both political parties in these
areas often end up making the very same

1925
01:56:39,091 --> 01:56:41,610
decisions about continuing
these wasteful regime,

1926
01:56:41,611 --> 01:56:46,470
change wars and acting as
the world's police. And, uh,

1927
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:51,500
therefore I'm listening to them because
they lack that experience or that

1928
01:56:51,601 --> 01:56:56,130
backbone and understanding themselves
and then just continue the status quo.

1929
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:59,520
Um, you know, Trump was somebody who,

1930
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:03,450
during his campaign talked a lot
about ending the stupid wars,

1931
01:57:03,451 --> 01:57:05,460
talked about going after Saudi Arabia,

1932
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:08,010
that they're the biggest supporters
of terrorism in the world.

1933
01:57:08,550 --> 01:57:12,960
And you know what happened now,
you know, and his administration,

1934
01:57:12,961 --> 01:57:17,490
what he called draining the swamp,
he's turned that swamp into assess.

1935
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:20,980
You look at the people he
surrounded himself by, uh,

1936
01:57:21,240 --> 01:57:25,230
some of the biggest war hawks that our
country has seen. Guys like John Bolton,

1937
01:57:25,231 --> 01:57:26,460
people like Mike Pompeo,

1938
01:57:26,461 --> 01:57:29,610
people who've wanted to go to war
against Iran for a very long time.

1939
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:34,200
People who have been cozy with Saudi
Arabia for a very long time. Uh,

1940
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:37,680
you see who he's nominating
to be secretary of defense,

1941
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:42,920
long time a defense contract
career men like over 30 years.

1942
01:57:43,050 --> 01:57:45,330
I think working for Boeing,
uh,

1943
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:50,220
you see the kinds of people who he
surrounded himself by. And so it's, it,

1944
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:55,200
it doesn't take a lot to figure out
how he has been influenced by them in

1945
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:59,130
continuing these regime change or this
regime change is still going on in Syria

1946
01:57:59,131 --> 01:57:59,730
now.

1947
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,480
Threatening regime change in Venezuela
threatening regime change and disruption

1948
01:58:04,010 --> 01:58:06,930
in Iran. Uh, and that's the difference.

1949
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:11,190
That's the difference quite
bluntly between me and
other people who are running

1950
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:15,480
for president is that experience and
understanding that I bring to be able to

1951
01:58:15,481 --> 01:58:18,960
walk into that office, to do that
job as commander in chief and uh,

1952
01:58:19,050 --> 01:58:24,050
on day one and to not succumb to the,

1953
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,840
the establishment that,

1954
01:58:25,841 --> 01:58:30,841
that I have both felt the effects of as
a soldier as well as seen in action as a

1955
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:33,810
member of Congress.
I'm going in with both,

1956
01:58:33,811 --> 01:58:38,811
both eyes wide open and understanding the
situation as it really exists and most

1957
01:58:39,751 --> 01:58:43,880
importantly understanding who I work for,
that I work for the American people.

1958
01:58:44,160 --> 01:58:48,280
Do you think with someone
like Trump radically shifts
his position he's doing so

1959
01:58:48,281 --> 01:58:52,090
because it's been influenced to change
his position because he's been given more

1960
01:58:52,091 --> 01:58:55,900
information or do you think they become
compromised when they're on an office

1961
01:58:56,110 --> 01:58:58,860
and they, I scratch your
back, you scratch mine?

1962
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:03,050
Uh, I don't know. I imagine that
there's probably some of both,

1963
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,220
but if you're,

1964
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:10,020
if you don't have the strength of your
convictions and your understanding about

1965
01:59:10,021 --> 01:59:13,410
what kinds of policies actually
best serve the American people,

1966
01:59:13,820 --> 01:59:18,060
then you can see how easily you'd be
swayed and influenced by others. Uh,

1967
01:59:18,080 --> 01:59:18,820
you know,

1968
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:23,190
you saw Trump's rhetoric on the campaign
trail about Saudi Arabia against Saudi

1969
01:59:23,190 --> 01:59:25,230
Arabia against the United
States support for Saudi Arabia,

1970
01:59:25,231 --> 01:59:28,470
calling them out for what
they are and now, uh,

1971
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:33,520
refusing to end US military support for
this genocidal war in Yemen that Saudi

1972
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:39,820
Arabia is waging that's created the worst
humanitarian crisis of our generation

1973
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:42,230
because he says,
well,

1974
01:59:42,231 --> 01:59:47,231
he doesn't want to risk a multibillion
dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia.

1975
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:53,740
So you can see at least in that respect,

1976
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:56,400
what he's really motivated by.
He doesn't,

1977
01:59:56,430 --> 02:00:01,430
he would rather continue to support
the senseless and devastating deaths of

1978
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:05,680
innocent people in Yemen
and using our US military,

1979
02:00:05,681 --> 02:00:09,730
my brothers and sisters in the military
to do that because he doesn't want to

1980
02:00:09,731 --> 02:00:14,240
risk an arms deal with Saudi Arabia
theocratic dictatorship that actually

1981
02:00:14,241 --> 02:00:18,090
directly supports terrorist
groups like al Qaeda. Wow.

1982
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:21,580
It's hard for people to
imagine that that's the case,

1983
02:00:22,030 --> 02:00:27,030
that it's an arms deal and they want to
make sure that this deal goes through

1984
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:32,180
and that it continues to be financially
productive for both nations.

1985
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:35,350
Well, that's, you know, and
this is Trump's argument.
He's like, well, you know,

1986
02:00:35,860 --> 02:00:40,590
that's American jobs building those
weapons that were selling to Saudi Arabia.

1987
02:00:40,710 --> 02:00:41,880
That's what's at risk.

1988
02:00:42,410 --> 02:00:46,670
My challenge to him and to the American
people is if the best our president can

1989
02:00:46,671 --> 02:00:51,671
do to help support the creation of jobs
in this country is to build weapons that

1990
02:00:52,081 --> 02:00:56,100
are being dropped on innocent
people in countries like Yemen,

1991
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:00,220
then we need a new president.
We need a new commander in chief.

1992
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:05,280
It will actually help serve the best
interests of our people and work towards

1993
02:01:05,281 --> 02:01:07,800
the interest of peace,
peace here at home and peace abroad.

1994
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:09,190
Okay.

1995
02:01:09,190 --> 02:01:09,630
Yeah.

1996
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:13,420
The idea that it's just jobs.
It's not just jobs. Yeah.

1997
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:16,630
I mean there's consequences to these jobs.
Um,

1998
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:22,700
you were talking about universal basic
income earlier and you were saying it in

1999
02:01:22,730 --> 02:01:26,480
regards to dealing with
impoverished communities, but, uh,

2000
02:01:26,481 --> 02:01:31,481
one of the big issues that people think
we're going to need universal basic

2001
02:01:31,581 --> 02:01:33,080
income for his automation.

2002
02:01:33,230 --> 02:01:35,900
Something that Andrew Yang has
built this whole platform on.

2003
02:01:35,930 --> 02:01:38,480
Elon Musk has talked extensively about it,

2004
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:42,880
are in a situation where there was
an article today about Amazon, um,

2005
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:46,310
using automo autumn, uh, these, um,

2006
02:01:46,930 --> 02:01:48,550
I forgot exactly how to describe it,

2007
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:52,810
but essentially robots that are packaging
things and automation is going to

2008
02:01:52,811 --> 02:01:56,590
start taking over many non-skilled jobs.

2009
02:01:56,770 --> 02:02:00,980
And this is, that's true with the
travel industry, with trucking,

2010
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,150
with moving things,

2011
02:02:02,151 --> 02:02:07,151
shipping that we're going to see less and
less of these unskilled jobs and we're

2012
02:02:07,671 --> 02:02:09,260
going to see millions
of people out of work.

2013
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:13,280
And that universal basic income may be
the only way to bridge that gap between

2014
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:18,281
them finding some sort of
viable new source of income.

2015
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:23,200
Yeah, I think that's certainly part
of it. I think that's a, I mean,

2016
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,230
it's a strong argument.
Uh,

2017
02:02:25,270 --> 02:02:29,560
we've got to figure out how we pay for
it and how it actually, uh, at, you know,

2018
02:02:29,561 --> 02:02:34,270
achieves that intended objective.
Uh, but also look at, um,

2019
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:37,820
making that,
those kinds of investments in,

2020
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:41,660
in how do you train a whole new
workforce and in what new areas?

2021
02:02:41,661 --> 02:02:45,080
So any you're taking people who are
working in, in, you know, really tough,

2022
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:46,830
tough labor jobs.
You know,

2023
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:51,150
you hear all these stories about people
who are working at Amazon very long

2024
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:53,870
hours, very stringent timelines, uh, and,

2025
02:02:53,871 --> 02:02:58,380
and so if they're now being replaced by
automation or robots or whatever it is,

2026
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:03,510
um, you know, let's look at our,
our economy and see how we can, um,

2027
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:08,730
help train folks for, for jobs
that pay more money, uh, and,

2028
02:03:08,731 --> 02:03:11,740
and hopefully help offer
a better quality of life.

2029
02:03:12,220 --> 02:03:16,000
And I think that's overall when we
look at this. Um, I think that's,

2030
02:03:16,001 --> 02:03:20,500
that's the way that we
should be addressing this
is not just a job as a job,

2031
02:03:20,501 --> 02:03:21,670
as a job,
as a job,

2032
02:03:22,030 --> 02:03:27,030
but really looking at the quality of
life of people in this country that a job

2033
02:03:27,481 --> 02:03:32,020
does not equal happiness or fulfillment.
Um,

2034
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:35,580
but really looking at,
um, you know, parents who,

2035
02:03:35,581 --> 02:03:39,190
who have a child and who want to be able
to spend some time at home raising that

2036
02:03:39,191 --> 02:03:41,380
child or you know,
someone who wants to start,

2037
02:03:41,381 --> 02:03:45,550
start a small business and work out of
their home to be able to hang out with

2038
02:03:45,551 --> 02:03:47,350
their kids more or
whatever the case may be.

2039
02:03:47,351 --> 02:03:52,351
I think as we look at this and how we
make this transition in a positive way in

2040
02:03:52,691 --> 02:03:53,524
this country,

2041
02:03:53,830 --> 02:03:58,220
we've got to look at it from
this comprehensive approach.

2042
02:03:58,880 --> 02:03:59,240
Yeah.

2043
02:03:59,240 --> 02:04:04,240
The idea of these people that are working
in these fulfillment centers being

2044
02:04:04,941 --> 02:04:06,800
happy,
it seems pretty ridiculous.

2045
02:04:07,010 --> 02:04:10,730
They're not happy they have those jobs
as people are in back breaking incredibly

2046
02:04:10,731 --> 02:04:13,880
stressful positions where if
you read the reports, I mean,

2047
02:04:13,881 --> 02:04:17,330
I don't know how accurate their
reports of what the job is like,

2048
02:04:17,331 --> 02:04:20,150
but they literally run
from one place to another.

2049
02:04:20,151 --> 02:04:24,660
They're timed and they have
their own breaks or yeah.
Yeah. Time limits. Yeah. Yeah.

2050
02:04:24,830 --> 02:04:27,110
This part of the problem

2051
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:28,363
with

2052
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:34,510
the idea that companies are supposed to
constantly make more and more money as

2053
02:04:34,511 --> 02:04:36,610
you get Russo ruthlessly competitive.

2054
02:04:36,611 --> 02:04:39,660
People looking at the bottom line in
every single aspect of that business.

2055
02:04:39,990 --> 02:04:43,980
And one of the things that
suffers is human human sacrifice,

2056
02:04:44,450 --> 02:04:46,260
satisfaction.
And their,

2057
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:49,520
their sacrifice has to
be greater because they,

2058
02:04:49,550 --> 02:04:53,100
they have to find a way to justify
their position in the company.

2059
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:55,890
And so they get paid very little.
They work very hard.

2060
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:59,030
Yeah. And now the wild placement
real company like Amazon. Yeah.

2061
02:04:59,410 --> 02:05:01,780
Paying not only paying no taxes when,

2062
02:05:01,781 --> 02:05:05,460
I think this is for the third year
in a row. Yeah. And also getting,

2063
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:10,520
I think this last year was over $125
million tax credit that's on top of it.

2064
02:05:11,740 --> 02:05:13,320
Jeff Bezos says how much it was,

2065
02:05:13,330 --> 02:05:16,990
you got $150 billion and he's going
to give 75 to his wife and right.

2066
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:21,760
The whole thing is ridiculous.
And it's what people who,

2067
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:22,390
uh,

2068
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:27,010
lean socialist point to when they talk
about unchecked capitalism without any

2069
02:05:27,011 --> 02:05:31,690
sort of regulation that can stop something
like that from happening and stop

2070
02:05:31,691 --> 02:05:35,860
workers from being exploited in that way.
It's just, and people say, hey, you don't,

2071
02:05:35,980 --> 02:05:39,100
you don't have to have that job if you
don't, you know, you don't want that job,

2072
02:05:39,101 --> 02:05:42,250
don't take it. But no one should have
to have that job. How about that? Yeah.

2073
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:43,210
How about if,

2074
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:48,270
if there's a job that makes you have
timed bathroom breaks and run from one

2075
02:05:48,351 --> 02:05:51,350
place to another, you should get paid
a fuck load of money for that job.

2076
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:56,090
That job should be something that it,
it sucks all day long, but yeah, dude,

2077
02:05:56,091 --> 02:06:00,890
I make $5,000 a week and people are
like, what? Yeah, man, eight hours a day,

2078
02:06:00,891 --> 02:06:04,880
five thought you've got to run. But when
at the end of the, to save up your money,

2079
02:06:04,881 --> 02:06:08,330
man, you're making a lot of money that
way people would go, oh, okay. Yeah.

2080
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,790
Amazon would still make a shit load of
money if they did it that way. But yeah,

2081
02:06:13,590 --> 02:06:16,620
automation barely making, I mean,
they're barely making minimum wage.

2082
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:18,730
It's crazy. Yeah. I mean,

2083
02:06:19,310 --> 02:06:22,220
so that's where I think, you
know, as, as, as, and look,

2084
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:26,850
this automation really changing
our economy is something that,

2085
02:06:26,900 --> 02:06:30,620
that I think we're behind the curve
ball on because it's already happening.

2086
02:06:31,010 --> 02:06:34,370
But let's try to see
the opportunity in that,

2087
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:38,660
where if robots are going to start
taking over those back breaking jobs,

2088
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:41,880
then then let's try to find, uh, you know,

2089
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:46,660
new and innovative ways for people to
work and to earn a living that's actually

2090
02:06:46,661 --> 02:06:50,060
bringing value to them.
That sounds awesome on paper,

2091
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:53,570
but how would one absolutely. That's
what we've got to work out. And it's not,

2092
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:54,710
I'm not saying like,
Hey,

2093
02:06:54,711 --> 02:06:57,980
there's a government solution to this
and snap your fingers and it's all done.

2094
02:06:57,981 --> 02:07:01,670
No, the, I mean, this is, the government
has a role. I'd, private sector,

2095
02:07:01,671 --> 02:07:05,190
private business has a
role. Um, and we've got a,

2096
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:07,710
we've got to work together because
this is all of our futures.

2097
02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:11,670
How ultimately imagined any potential,
any possibility,

2098
02:07:11,671 --> 02:07:13,170
any potential solution?

2099
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:17,550
Well, I think there's, there's
pieces of it, right? I mean it's,

2100
02:07:17,551 --> 02:07:20,020
it's making sure that we close these,

2101
02:07:20,021 --> 02:07:25,021
these loopholes that tax loopholes that
allow companies like Amazon to get away

2102
02:07:25,661 --> 02:07:29,780
with paying no taxes and to get this
much money back as a tax credit.

2103
02:07:29,781 --> 02:07:33,440
How do they do that? Oh Gosh. I
mean our tax code is so complicated.

2104
02:07:33,680 --> 02:07:37,810
You know it has to do with the write
offs and how many years and depreciation

2105
02:07:37,811 --> 02:07:42,220
and all of these different things that
they plan for a and they exploit in order

2106
02:07:42,221 --> 02:07:46,600
to pay no taxes and to get money
back in return. It's just so easily.

2107
02:07:46,660 --> 02:07:51,660
It is and it's this crony
capitalism that's really at
the heart of this problem.

2108
02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:55,010
How, how do we, how do they
get that kind of sweet deal?

2109
02:07:55,160 --> 02:07:57,230
When you look at the
tax code that's written,

2110
02:07:57,470 --> 02:07:59,600
when you look at the tax
bills that are passed,

2111
02:07:59,720 --> 02:08:02,450
who are the people who are helping
influence and write those bills?

2112
02:08:02,990 --> 02:08:06,680
They're the big paid lobbyists that Amazon
has in Washington who are saying, hey,

2113
02:08:06,681 --> 02:08:10,340
this is something that we want to see
in there and working with lawmakers who

2114
02:08:10,341 --> 02:08:12,590
their cozy with to get
that legislation in there.

2115
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:16,030
Well, this is one of the things that, uh,

2116
02:08:16,150 --> 02:08:18,670
has come out about Trump
over the last week or two,

2117
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:23,200
is that he lost $1 billion over
the course of a x amount of years.

2118
02:08:23,870 --> 02:08:26,840
And that this is not really accurate,

2119
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:32,410
but that this is how he set
like [inaudible] purposes
basically did basically

2120
02:08:35,211 --> 02:08:39,340
said it's sport is what you said is his
description was that it's sport. Wow.

2121
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:42,160
So essentially he was
playing within the rules.

2122
02:08:42,161 --> 02:08:44,230
No one's accusing him of
doing anything illegal,

2123
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:49,320
but the way he framed his taxes,
the way he,

2124
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:50,273
Eh,

2125
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:53,740
it turned out to be more than a billion
dollars worth of losses over a period of

2126
02:08:53,741 --> 02:08:56,830
something like a decade. Yeah. And
uh, you know, people were like,

2127
02:08:56,831 --> 02:09:00,400
what the hell is that? And
he's like, look, that's what
I was trying to tell you.

2128
02:09:00,910 --> 02:09:02,830
He was basically trying to say,
look,

2129
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:06,130
this is something that I was telling
you people about when I was running for

2130
02:09:06,131 --> 02:09:07,840
president,
that the system is rigged.

2131
02:09:07,841 --> 02:09:11,110
I know because it was a part of the
rigged system and I paid these people off.

2132
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:13,390
Yeah. Um, it is rigged.

2133
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:16,990
But how could you get in
without getting assassinated?

2134
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:19,270
How do you get in and say,
Hey,

2135
02:09:19,271 --> 02:09:22,120
all you billionaires that
are making all this money,

2136
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:27,240
you're gonna make less money now because
of Tulsi President Tulsi is coming in.

2137
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,640
There's a new sheriff in town.
Yeah.

2138
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:33,280
Sheriff with an army of people
in this country mobilizing,

2139
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:37,830
saying this government was
put in place to serve us,

2140
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:43,550
to serve the people and as much money in
high paid lobbyists is these guys have.

2141
02:09:44,140 --> 02:09:47,530
Ultimately it is the people
of this country who cast
the votes and it ultimately

2142
02:09:47,531 --> 02:09:50,710
the people in this country who have
the power, if we choose to use it,

2143
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:54,960
if we choose to make sure that our
voices are heard and that that is the way

2144
02:09:54,961 --> 02:09:56,250
that we make this change.

2145
02:09:56,340 --> 02:09:59,070
So would you have to simplify the tax
code? Would you have to make things

2146
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:02,560
heavily simplify the tax code? And
you know, I'm working with my team,

2147
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:05,290
we're doing our research to figure
out exactly what that would look like.

2148
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:09,370
But I think we do have to simplify the
tax code because it is so many of these

2149
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:13,450
loopholes and massive corporate deductions
that have brought us to the place

2150
02:10:13,451 --> 02:10:14,500
where we are today.

2151
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:19,860
Where know most folks are not getting
any kind of meaningful deduction.

2152
02:10:20,701 --> 02:10:24,180
Most folks certainly are not getting
the kinds of tax breaks that these

2153
02:10:24,181 --> 02:10:27,330
corporations are getting.
Uh, because it's,

2154
02:10:27,331 --> 02:10:30,240
these corporations are influencing how
our tax laws are written and it's written

2155
02:10:30,241 --> 02:10:34,880
to benefit them. The, the ultra
rich and the 1%. And you know,

2156
02:10:34,881 --> 02:10:39,050
people who are working very hard
every single day are, are struggling.

2157
02:10:39,051 --> 02:10:40,610
They're still struggling just to get by.

2158
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:45,650
What kind of dirty tricks do you think
they will pull out against you if you try

2159
02:10:45,651 --> 02:10:50,651
to fix the tax code and
try to make corporations
accountable and make sure that

2160
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:51,770
they have to pay?

2161
02:10:51,770 --> 02:10:56,770
If they're coming after you now and
you're just making waves and get ready for

2162
02:10:57,441 --> 02:11:00,990
2020. I mean, it could be,
it can be pretty gross. Yeah.

2163
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:04,850
Yeah. But I just, I, I don't
underestimate the power of people.

2164
02:11:05,310 --> 02:11:06,900
That's what I tell them,
you know,

2165
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:10,030
and they've been playing these
dirty tricks for a long time. Uh,

2166
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:12,340
there is more and more people,
I think,

2167
02:11:12,341 --> 02:11:16,600
in this country who are paying attention
and who are calling him out on it. MMM.

2168
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:19,090
Don't underestimate the
power of the people.

2169
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:23,920
You know what I think too? I think it'd
be better for them. Like Jeff Bezos,

2170
02:11:23,921 --> 02:11:28,090
you know, you fucking people over and not
paying taxes, Bro. That's so much money.

2171
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:33,560
And I'm sure he pays taxes. I don't
know what he pays. But you know the,

2172
02:11:33,561 --> 02:11:37,660
the idea that Amazon's figured out
how to weasel that out, like that's

2173
02:11:38,180 --> 02:11:41,250
postures. You hear stuff like, you
know, Warren Buffet talks about this,

2174
02:11:41,251 --> 02:11:45,930
about he pays a lower tax rate than his
secretary, right? There's a famous line.

2175
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:48,660
How is that? Because he has, look,

2176
02:11:48,661 --> 02:11:52,710
he's figured out all of these holes
within the tax system that he can benefit

2177
02:11:52,711 --> 02:11:56,690
from to pay lower taxes when most
people don't have that ability.

2178
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:59,880
And as a business person
who is also fairly ethical,

2179
02:11:59,881 --> 02:12:02,520
you have to be perplexed or collect,
what do I do here?

2180
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:05,250
Do I just do the right thing and give,

2181
02:12:05,310 --> 02:12:08,220
give more money to charity
and balance it out?

2182
02:12:08,430 --> 02:12:13,030
Or do I just take these cuts where
they are and let everybody know,

2183
02:12:13,031 --> 02:12:15,530
hey,
look how much money I paid

2184
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:19,240
broken the system is the
shits. This shit's wack. Yeah.

2185
02:12:19,690 --> 02:12:22,840
I mean like ultimately what you're
saying, you know, as business owners,

2186
02:12:22,841 --> 02:12:26,650
whether they're small business owners of
these large corporations, I mean, look,

2187
02:12:26,651 --> 02:12:31,651
it is these large multinational
corporations that are
exploiting the system and

2188
02:12:31,871 --> 02:12:36,520
exploiting the people and represent
the worst of these crony capitalists

2189
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:38,200
policies.
Uh,

2190
02:12:38,230 --> 02:12:42,150
and so when I talk about changing
this culture of leadership at the top,

2191
02:12:42,180 --> 02:12:45,690
it's bringing these values
of service above self.

2192
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:47,810
This has to happen within our government,

2193
02:12:47,811 --> 02:12:52,811
but we as a society need to encourage
ourselves bringing these values of service

2194
02:12:53,421 --> 02:12:58,010
above self to our businesses,
to every sector of our community.

2195
02:12:58,011 --> 02:13:01,430
Because just because you run a business
and you make a profit doesn't mean that

2196
02:13:01,431 --> 02:13:05,090
you can't, uh, be a servant
leader and to think about, hey,

2197
02:13:05,091 --> 02:13:08,660
how can I make a positive impact? Yes.
For my employees and for their families,

2198
02:13:08,661 --> 02:13:12,740
but on, on society. On our
community, on our environment.

2199
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:16,630
I think for the people that are running
these corporations, there would be,

2200
02:13:17,740 --> 02:13:22,740
there would be real value in appreciating
the fact that we're all in this

2201
02:13:23,921 --> 02:13:25,900
together. And you know, you're
not gonna live that long.

2202
02:13:25,901 --> 02:13:27,970
You just don't have that much time.
Nobody does.

2203
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:30,860
Not even a hundred years if
you're lucky and you probably,

2204
02:13:30,861 --> 02:13:32,010
if you're running a corporation,

2205
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,820
you probably on death's door, you've got
kids and you've got kids who have kids,

2206
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:38,290
generations who will live
with the repercussions,

2207
02:13:38,291 --> 02:13:39,420
the decisions that are being made.

2208
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:43,620
And the argument is that if you
forced them to pay more taxes,

2209
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:46,650
then there's going to be less jobs because
they're going to have to make cuts.

2210
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:50,040
Yeah. But that's, that seems
like a ridiculous argument to me.

2211
02:13:50,380 --> 02:13:54,300
One that's been made all along. It's
just you're used to it. That's all it is.

2212
02:13:54,301 --> 02:13:57,750
You're used to these loopholes.
You're used to it. So you
want to keep them there.

2213
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:01,080
And if they take away those loopholes,
you're going to punish other people.

2214
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:03,120
Cause you don't want to be
punished yourself financially.

2215
02:14:03,270 --> 02:14:06,000
That's what's really going
on. Yeah. And you know,

2216
02:14:06,001 --> 02:14:08,100
and this is coming from me
who's a financial dummy,

2217
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:13,340
I don't pin spend any time analyzing
the financial situ situation this world,

2218
02:14:15,150 --> 02:14:17,370
but I could see that. Yeah,
that's pretty obvious.

2219
02:14:17,371 --> 02:14:21,690
It's glaringly clear and the impact that
it's having on people is also glaringly

2220
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:21,931
clear.

2221
02:14:21,931 --> 02:14:26,931
People are seeing this and when automation
really kicks into focus and you know,

2222
02:14:28,171 --> 02:14:31,740
however x many years when millions
and millions of jobs go away,

2223
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:36,750
we're going to be confronted with this
new world and this is what a lot of

2224
02:14:36,751 --> 02:14:39,760
people are very concerned with when they
talk about the next couple of decades

2225
02:14:39,890 --> 02:14:40,180
there.

2226
02:14:40,180 --> 02:14:44,600
They're very concerned with automation
and they're very concerned with audit,

2227
02:14:44,630 --> 02:14:46,140
our artificial intelligence,

2228
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:51,320
artificial intelligence and that it's
not just going to take away skill are

2229
02:14:51,571 --> 02:14:54,120
unskilled labor, but it's also
going to take skilled labor away.

2230
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:56,310
There's going to be no one
answering phones anymore.

2231
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:57,480
It's all going to be computers.

2232
02:14:57,540 --> 02:15:01,140
They're very close to be able to do that
right now where a computer will have a

2233
02:15:01,141 --> 02:15:04,350
legitimate conversation with you and you
don't even know that you're talking to

2234
02:15:04,351 --> 02:15:07,410
a computer. It's crazy. It's crazy.

2235
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:12,720
Are you concerned with sentient artificial
intelligence and in terms of its

2236
02:15:12,721 --> 02:15:16,470
military applications in
terms of, um, there's,

2237
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:21,590
there's a lot of concern that what we're
experiencing now with particularly,

2238
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:25,140
you wouldn't talk about Yemen with drones,

2239
02:15:25,800 --> 02:15:30,800
with these piloted things that you're
going to have is autonomous weapons in the

2240
02:15:31,501 --> 02:15:34,650
future where you just going to be able
to literally release killer robots.

2241
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:40,400
I'm very concerned about
artificial intelligence and
how quickly this technology

2242
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:45,750
is evolving, uh, with very little, um,

2243
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:51,380
oversight or even understanding at the
highest levels of our government about

2244
02:15:54,030 --> 02:15:59,010
both what the opportunities are that it
presents and also the very real dangers

2245
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:03,810
of this technology being weaponized and
how quickly that could spiral out of

2246
02:16:03,811 --> 02:16:04,644
control.

2247
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:10,910
What could we do to stop artificial
intelligence from spiraling and spiraling

2248
02:16:12,331 --> 02:16:16,950
out of control in particular,
what can we do to stop autonomous weapons?

2249
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:20,190
What a lot of people are really
concerned with. Did you watch that show?

2250
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:23,310
Black Mirror? It's a great
show. It's on Netflix,

2251
02:16:23,340 --> 02:16:27,600
but a lot of it is dystopian stories about
the future and one of them was called

2252
02:16:27,601 --> 02:16:29,980
heavy metal and it's about
this woman being chased by

2253
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,890
these little intelligent robots
that are trying to kill her. Yeah.

2254
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:37,480
It's terrifying because this is something
that could be implemented in the

2255
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:41,360
battlefield and we could have,
if we don't do it first,

2256
02:16:41,390 --> 02:16:45,220
we could have a situation where our
soldiers [inaudible] in some sort of a

2257
02:16:45,221 --> 02:16:49,750
situation facing off against robots. Yeah.
It sounds like a science fiction movie,

2258
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:52,030
but it's not that far away from reality.
Yeah.

2259
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:55,570
I think this is one of those things that,
um,

2260
02:16:56,160 --> 02:17:00,230
and of leaders in the global
community have to recognize that some,

2261
02:17:00,470 --> 02:17:03,770
some key just to, just like with
nucleus, the nuclear arms race,

2262
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:08,590
once you start on this race, I mean, there
are no winners in a, in a nuclear war.

2263
02:17:09,070 --> 02:17:11,820
Everybody loses in that scenario.

2264
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:16,530
And I think there's a similar approach
that needs to be taken to, um,

2265
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:21,850
the dangers of artificial intelligence
being weaponized and coming together as a

2266
02:17:21,950 --> 02:17:23,750
kind of a global community to say,
Hey,

2267
02:17:23,751 --> 02:17:26,930
this is something that a
end date could potentially,

2268
02:17:26,931 --> 02:17:31,590
if putting the wrong hands in danger,
all of us and find the best approach,

2269
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:34,360
um,
to deal with that.

2270
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:39,380
Because my concern is as we see with
so many of these other weapons systems,

2271
02:17:39,650 --> 02:17:43,040
if it's just one country that's doing
it, then you have, well my gosh,

2272
02:17:43,041 --> 02:17:44,960
if everyone else is weaponizing,

2273
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:47,690
but we're the only ones who
are doing the right thing,

2274
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:52,270
then is that creating a situation where
our national security is at risk or our

2275
02:17:52,271 --> 02:17:56,410
troops are at risks? I think it's one
of those things that, uh, you know,

2276
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:58,930
this world is a small place.
Uh,

2277
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:03,370
we would have a shared interest with
leaders of other countries in the world to

2278
02:18:03,670 --> 02:18:06,780
provide the right kinds
of checks and balances.

2279
02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:11,400
I'm on this technology so that it doesn't
become something that's a danger to

2280
02:18:11,430 --> 02:18:12,263
humanity.

2281
02:18:12,270 --> 02:18:16,860
And the real fear would be that someone
would not think that at all. Yeah.

2282
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:18,960
There would be whatever country,

2283
02:18:18,961 --> 02:18:21,270
figure out what the country is that
some country be like, fuck you,

2284
02:18:21,271 --> 02:18:23,070
we're going to do whatever we want.
We're gonna look,

2285
02:18:23,071 --> 02:18:25,050
you guys took over this world
because of nuclear power.

2286
02:18:25,051 --> 02:18:28,260
We're going to take over this
world because of autonomous
weapons and artificial

2287
02:18:28,261 --> 02:18:31,410
intelligence. Yeah. And we're going
to design it to go kill American.

2288
02:18:31,450 --> 02:18:34,630
Yeah. I think that that's why
it's important that we take, uh,

2289
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:37,710
that we take a global approach to this.
Yeah.

2290
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:39,580
And because otherwise I think you do,

2291
02:18:39,581 --> 02:18:42,550
you end up with that scenario
and where you just, you know,

2292
02:18:42,660 --> 02:18:46,180
this race begins and then there's
no way to stop it and it's too late.

2293
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:51,370
Unlike China, the United
States has at least, yeah.

2294
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:53,170
In perception,
uh,

2295
02:18:53,190 --> 02:18:58,190
cleared differentiation between
business and government.

2296
02:18:58,560 --> 02:18:59,080
[inaudible]

2297
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:02,040
and one of the concerns that, um, oh,

2298
02:19:02,060 --> 02:19:07,040
when I've talked to experts in China
and their electronics and their,

2299
02:19:07,050 --> 02:19:11,020
their technological innovation is that
they're inexorably connected to their

2300
02:19:11,021 --> 02:19:12,940
government in some way, shape, or form.

2301
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:17,320
And that it's one of the main reasons
that makes it incredibly difficult to

2302
02:19:17,321 --> 02:19:19,530
compete with them on a global marketplace.
Yeah.

2303
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:22,630
When you see that this,

2304
02:19:22,860 --> 02:19:27,030
our State Department has told people to
stop using Walway devices cause while,

2305
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:30,110
which is the number two provider
of cell phones in this world,

2306
02:19:30,111 --> 02:19:33,030
now they're connected to
the Chinese government.

2307
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:36,230
Like how do you take that? What, what,

2308
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:40,700
what do you do about that situation and
how relationship between the private

2309
02:19:40,701 --> 02:19:45,050
sector in government in particular
with the competition, what, look,

2310
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:48,950
when it comes to data, I mean, we're
very concerned about people sharing data.

2311
02:19:48,951 --> 02:19:51,320
We've, we've done it
ourselves. We've spider,

2312
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:53,480
we've proven through
the Edward Snowden case,

2313
02:19:53,481 --> 02:19:55,670
govern our government's
doing as well to us.

2314
02:19:56,090 --> 02:19:58,430
We're worried the Chinese are
doing it to us or so. And it's,

2315
02:19:58,440 --> 02:19:59,900
we're saying don't buy Chinese stuff.

2316
02:20:00,050 --> 02:20:03,530
They're gonna steal your data and steal
your information and still your business

2317
02:20:03,531 --> 02:20:06,140
secrets. Yeah. What can
you do to stop that?

2318
02:20:06,270 --> 02:20:08,400
What can you do to mitigate
what's already happened?

2319
02:20:09,270 --> 02:20:10,260
Uh, I, you know,

2320
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:14,010
ultimately you can't stop every single
individual with what they're purchasing.

2321
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:18,380
I think that, um, you know,
you can regulate what is, uh,

2322
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:21,450
sold here in the United States.
Uh,

2323
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:23,220
I think there's a role
that government can play,

2324
02:20:23,221 --> 02:20:26,190
especially as we're talking about
artificial intelligence and that kind of

2325
02:20:26,191 --> 02:20:30,920
technology, again, first in
understanding it and then playing,

2326
02:20:31,190 --> 02:20:35,990
um, being that responsible party, uh, too,

2327
02:20:36,380 --> 02:20:40,680
make sure that what is being developed
is not something that's going to result

2328
02:20:40,681 --> 02:20:45,100
in these, uh, unintended
negative consequences. Uh,

2329
02:20:45,101 --> 02:20:48,240
so obviously our government, uh, you know,

2330
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:51,300
doesn't have ownership over
private business in this country.

2331
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:54,500
We still do have sensible,
uh,

2332
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:58,670
regulations and responsibility that
government has to play in regulating what

2333
02:20:58,671 --> 02:21:00,410
businesses can and can't do.

2334
02:21:01,040 --> 02:21:06,040
What's interesting to me is this
competition aspect between dealing with

2335
02:21:07,250 --> 02:21:09,760
essentially just the private
sector here in America. Yeah.

2336
02:21:09,940 --> 02:21:14,940
Versus the private sector in China that's
combined inexorably with the military

2337
02:21:15,011 --> 02:21:18,940
and that they have much more influence
over what gets done and how things get

2338
02:21:18,941 --> 02:21:20,200
done.
Um,

2339
02:21:20,260 --> 02:21:24,490
what did you pay attention at all to the
State Department's call for a boycott

2340
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:27,550
of Walway products?
What did you think about that?

2341
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:30,090
Uh, well, I understood it. You know,

2342
02:21:30,091 --> 02:21:35,070
I think there is a concern about that
technology being, um, being used to,

2343
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:40,070
to get our information. Um,
you know, so that that, um,

2344
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:43,360
can be enforced within the
federal government, right?

2345
02:21:43,361 --> 02:21:44,710
So if the State Department is saying,
Hey,

2346
02:21:44,711 --> 02:21:48,970
the federal government is not going to
purchase any Walway produced products or

2347
02:21:48,971 --> 02:21:49,870
cell phones or whatever,

2348
02:21:49,871 --> 02:21:54,871
the technology is a and encourage other
people in the private sector to do the

2349
02:21:55,211 --> 02:21:56,044
same.

2350
02:21:56,660 --> 02:21:59,300
What people were worried about over here
is that what they're trying to do is

2351
02:21:59,301 --> 02:22:04,301
stifle the development of this gigantic
company and that what they're trying

2352
02:22:04,481 --> 02:22:05,830
wowway yeah.
Of Wallet.

2353
02:22:05,831 --> 02:22:09,820
Because while we went from having a
tiny share of the marketplace about five

2354
02:22:09,821 --> 02:22:13,990
years ago to being the number two cell
phone provider in the world next to

2355
02:22:13,991 --> 02:22:18,370
Samsung, we just surpassed apple.
And that this is a Chinese company.

2356
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:21,550
And that because it's Chinese companies
connected to the Chinese government,

2357
02:22:21,551 --> 02:22:26,100
the worry is that they're making ungodly
sums of money and it's enhancing the

2358
02:22:26,101 --> 02:22:27,510
Chinese government's ability to do,

2359
02:22:27,511 --> 02:22:30,480
to perform surveillance
or just to just compete,

2360
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:35,380
just financially compete on a
global scale. And Tech nerds, um,

2361
02:22:35,381 --> 02:22:38,590
seemed to be siding with Walway,
which is interesting to me.

2362
02:22:38,890 --> 02:22:42,730
I've read a lot of tech blogs and people
that are experts and they say that

2363
02:22:42,731 --> 02:22:46,390
there's no evidence that these cell
phones have anything in them or,

2364
02:22:46,510 --> 02:22:47,680
or doing anything,

2365
02:22:47,980 --> 02:22:51,460
but that there has been some
evidence of network devices and it's,

2366
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:56,180
some of these network devices do have
some sort of a third party input or some

2367
02:22:56,230 --> 02:22:59,740
building, some ability to extract
information that shouldn't be there.

2368
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:02,030
That's interesting. Yeah. What this,

2369
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:06,470
it's like when you're dealing with a
situation where you're competing with a

2370
02:23:06,471 --> 02:23:11,471
country that also controls these companies
that are the biggest cell phone and

2371
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,510
electronics providers on the planet.

2372
02:23:14,650 --> 02:23:15,330
Yeah.

2373
02:23:15,330 --> 02:23:18,230
How do you handle that? Like what,
what is diplomacy with China like?

2374
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:21,660
Well, we can see what's happening
right now with Trump. It's,

2375
02:23:21,690 --> 02:23:26,170
it's not working very well. Yeah. Uh, you
know, this trade war that, that frankly,

2376
02:23:26,171 --> 02:23:30,160
president Trump is escalating I think
is really, really dangerous. Uh,

2377
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:34,540
it's having a negative impact on
domestic producers, manufacturers,

2378
02:23:34,890 --> 02:23:35,520
farmers.

2379
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:39,870
A friend of mine is a small business
owner and he saw the news this morning

2380
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:44,860
about China retaliating,
um, with Trump's escalation,

2381
02:23:45,070 --> 02:23:49,000
I think with, with another increase of
their tariffs. And how he's thinking like,

2382
02:23:49,001 --> 02:23:52,120
my gosh, that's going to impact my
small business. It got, I don't know,

2383
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:56,080
probably less than 15 employees and
trying to figure out how it's gonna impact

2384
02:23:56,081 --> 02:23:59,620
the pricing and production, manufacturing
and everything every step of the way.

2385
02:24:00,310 --> 02:24:02,940
What's so dangerous about,
uh,

2386
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,770
what Trump is doing with this
trade war that he is, um,

2387
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:11,800
that he's escalating is that these trade
and economic wars can very easily turn

2388
02:24:12,531 --> 02:24:14,300
into a hot war.

2389
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:19,490
And we're talking about a nuclear
armed country in China. Uh,

2390
02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:24,170
so while there are trade differences and
issues that we've got to address with

2391
02:24:24,171 --> 02:24:27,950
China and issues with intellectual
property and other things, um,

2392
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:30,260
the way that Trump is going about this,

2393
02:24:30,261 --> 02:24:32,570
I believe is very
irresponsible and dangerous,

2394
02:24:32,571 --> 02:24:36,560
creating a huge amount of
uncertainty for American businesses.

2395
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:41,830
A while increasing tensions with one of
the biggest nuclear powers in the world.

2396
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:44,880
That's a scary thought.

2397
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:46,203
It is.

2398
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:49,740
[inaudible] and the ramifications of those
that could lead to a nuclear war that

2399
02:24:49,741 --> 02:24:52,260
this trade war could lead
to something military. Yes.

2400
02:24:53,230 --> 02:24:53,920
Yes.

2401
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,720
What does Trump's argument is?

2402
02:24:55,721 --> 02:24:59,200
His argument essentially is that China
has been treating us unfairly and that

2403
02:24:59,230 --> 02:25:02,750
the rates that we're getting
there are there not, yeah,

2404
02:25:02,860 --> 02:25:06,310
they're not even yet. I mean, Trump
is recognizing a problem that exists.

2405
02:25:06,610 --> 02:25:09,790
That trade imbalance with China is,
is a real issue.

2406
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:11,960
Why does that trade imbalance exists?
While,

2407
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:15,730
I mean you can point to
probably a whole host of,

2408
02:25:15,790 --> 02:25:20,680
of issues and trade policy. I don't
think it's any one single incident,

2409
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,790
um, that has, that has created
imbalance and that, you know,

2410
02:25:24,791 --> 02:25:28,480
I'm an Iowa a lot these days and a lot of
farmers have been struggling with that.

2411
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:29,703
Um,

2412
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:34,510
and would like to see it fixed a lot
in the tech community would like to see

2413
02:25:34,511 --> 02:25:37,360
these issues fixed, especially
related to intellectual property.

2414
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:43,170
But the way in which Trump is doing it
is having a very negative effect on these

2415
02:25:44,231 --> 02:25:46,780
American businesses
and jobs that Trump is,

2416
02:25:46,781 --> 02:25:51,220
is supposedly advocating for both in,
um,

2417
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:54,840
well really in the uncertainty that
that is being set where, you know,

2418
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:57,670
it looks like they're on the brink of a
deal. Just the other day it looks like,

2419
02:25:57,671 --> 02:26:00,880
Hey, okay. The United States and China,
they've been working through these issues.

2420
02:26:01,180 --> 02:26:04,210
They're on the brink of a deal and all
of a sudden Trump sends out a tweet

2421
02:26:04,211 --> 02:26:05,044
saying,
nope,

2422
02:26:05,170 --> 02:26:10,170
we're going to increase these terrorists
from 10% to 25% and now China is left

2423
02:26:10,241 --> 02:26:13,810
like, okay. I thought we were, I
thought we were close to working,

2424
02:26:13,840 --> 02:26:18,670
working things out and now
left in a situation where
they have no other recourse

2425
02:26:18,671 --> 02:26:23,671
but to retaliate as they did this morning
so you can see quickly how this thing

2426
02:26:23,801 --> 02:26:24,581
is spiraling,

2427
02:26:24,581 --> 02:26:29,581
so out of control and increasing these
tensions between our two country not

2428
02:26:29,651 --> 02:26:33,580
being done in a way that
that to me is strategic,

2429
02:26:33,790 --> 02:26:37,360
providing us with the certainty of
that path forward to reach a specific

2430
02:26:37,660 --> 02:26:39,680
objective of correcting
this trade imbalance,

2431
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:42,340
which is how this whole thing began.
Why do you think he's doing that?

2432
02:26:42,370 --> 02:26:45,100
Why would he make a cute look that it's,

2433
02:26:45,290 --> 02:26:47,590
it's hard to explain because
it doesn't make sense.

2434
02:26:47,591 --> 02:26:52,300
It doesn't actually serve us in our
interests of our economic interests of

2435
02:26:52,301 --> 02:26:55,900
meeting that objective. I don't know if
he thinks this is part of his masterful,

2436
02:26:56,110 --> 02:27:00,880
you know, negotiation skills, but
it's got a very dangerous effect. And,

2437
02:27:00,910 --> 02:27:05,910
and the fact that we have
nuclear strategists in this
country who remind us that

2438
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:12,070
we are at a greater risk of
nuclear war now than ever before.

2439
02:27:12,071 --> 02:27:16,810
It's because of these kinds of things
that are increasing tensions between the

2440
02:27:16,811 --> 02:27:18,430
United States in China.
Uh,

2441
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:22,930
other things that are increasing the
tensions between the United States and

2442
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:24,700
Russia. You know, a country that we're,

2443
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:29,440
we still have a nuclear missiles pointed
at each other that can be set off at a

2444
02:27:29,441 --> 02:27:30,490
moment's notice,

2445
02:27:30,730 --> 02:27:35,730
literally leaving us as people with
just minutes before a nuclear holocaust,

2446
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:39,430
a nuclear disaster,
nuclear war.

2447
02:27:40,420 --> 02:27:44,920
And you really think that this could be
set off by these financial negotiations

2448
02:27:44,921 --> 02:27:48,340
and by Trump saying something
like that and just changing who's,

2449
02:27:48,730 --> 02:27:49,750
who's offering a tweet.

2450
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:54,780
If you threaten a country's economy
and their economic security,

2451
02:27:55,750 --> 02:28:00,390
where does that logically lead?
You threaten their ability to, uh,

2452
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:01,540
provide for their people.

2453
02:28:01,541 --> 02:28:05,470
You threaten their ability to
provide that stable environment,

2454
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:08,960
which China so much of what
they do is just like, hey, they,

2455
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:13,060
they look for that stability. What
else? What are the recourses there?

2456
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:16,930
Other than the threat of military force.
And in this case,

2457
02:28:16,931 --> 02:28:19,000
when you're dealing with
two nuclear armed countries,

2458
02:28:19,001 --> 02:28:22,280
this is what's at risk and it's something,
you know,

2459
02:28:22,281 --> 02:28:25,370
it's hard for a lot of people to
conceive of like, okay, my gosh,

2460
02:28:25,371 --> 02:28:28,820
nuclear war really. I mean this
is something that, you know,

2461
02:28:28,821 --> 02:28:32,600
back during the Cold War
with the, the, the, you know,

2462
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:36,140
kids going under their desk, these
drills and, and you know, okay,

2463
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:40,190
where do you go find a bunker?
Uh, but this is something that,

2464
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:44,750
that's a reality that we're facing
today. And it's something that, you know,

2465
02:28:44,751 --> 02:28:49,060
we in Hawaii in January of last year went
through with that missile alert. Yeah,

2466
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:54,250
that was clear. It was terrifying. Missile
alert, nuclear weapons on it, right?

2467
02:28:54,710 --> 02:28:58,970
Right. Missile inbound towards
Hawaii seek immediate shelter.

2468
02:28:58,971 --> 02:28:59,990
This is not a drill.

2469
02:28:59,991 --> 02:29:04,280
That was the message that was blasted
out to over a million phones all across

2470
02:29:04,281 --> 02:29:06,410
our state on the radio,

2471
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:11,060
scrolling across the television and people
immediate like seek immediate shelter.

2472
02:29:11,090 --> 02:29:14,810
Okay, where do I go? Where do I take
my kids? Where do I take my family?

2473
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:18,260
Had College kids sprinting across campus
at the University of Hawaii trying to

2474
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:22,850
find shelters, seek immediate
shelter. But the, the sick,

2475
02:29:23,390 --> 02:29:27,890
um,
insanity of all of this is that there,

2476
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:32,840
there is no shelter, there is no
shelter and no nuclear bunkers,

2477
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:35,050
which, which really, I mean, and for,

2478
02:29:35,051 --> 02:29:38,840
for people in this administration and
politicians who are ratcheting up these

2479
02:29:38,841 --> 02:29:42,710
tensions with these nuclear armed
countries bring us to this new cold war.

2480
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:48,560
They are not saying, okay, well because
we're doing this, we're gonna Invest,

2481
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:50,150
uh,
not just trillions,

2482
02:29:50,151 --> 02:29:54,170
but hundreds or thousands of trillions
of dollars to make sure that every single

2483
02:29:54,171 --> 02:29:58,880
American in this country has a nuclear
bunker within 10 minutes of their home or

2484
02:29:58,881 --> 02:30:00,980
their place of work or their,
or their school.

2485
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:02,780
Because that's how much time we'd have.

2486
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:06,290
That's what we would need in order
to deal with the consequences of the

2487
02:30:06,291 --> 02:30:10,730
decisions that they're making in the
failed leadership that they're providing.

2488
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,830
And so this is,

2489
02:30:12,831 --> 02:30:16,940
this is an issue that I'm raising
awareness about because of what's at risk.

2490
02:30:16,941 --> 02:30:17,960
I mean,
this is,

2491
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:23,480
this is the greatest threat that we face
and it requires strong leadership to

2492
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:27,560
walk us away from this brink
of nuclear war, to be able to,

2493
02:30:27,590 --> 02:30:30,180
to work with other countries,
uh,

2494
02:30:30,350 --> 02:30:34,310
based on cooperation rather than conflict,
deescalate these tensions,

2495
02:30:34,311 --> 02:30:39,080
work out our differences and,
and walk us back from a,

2496
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:40,430
walk us back from the brink.

2497
02:30:40,430 --> 02:30:43,820
Stop this nuclear arms race that's
making us in the world less safe.

2498
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:48,230
The last thing I wanted to ask you
about was the opiod crisis. Yes.

2499
02:30:48,231 --> 02:30:49,340
And what are your thoughts on it?

2500
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:55,520
This is an epidemic that is
continuing to ravage the country and,

2501
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:58,430
uh,
we're not doing enough.

2502
02:30:58,820 --> 02:31:03,790
Our government is not doing enough
right now, uh, to solve it. Uh, and I,

2503
02:31:03,791 --> 02:31:05,720
I 0.2 to one,

2504
02:31:06,070 --> 02:31:11,070
a very simple thing that could drastically
help those who are dealing with

2505
02:31:11,541 --> 02:31:15,110
opioid addiction and trying to walk
down that path towards recovery.

2506
02:31:15,380 --> 02:31:17,810
And that is ending the federal
prohibition on marijuana.

2507
02:31:18,620 --> 02:31:23,620
There has been a correlation in states
that have legalized either a medical use

2508
02:31:24,041 --> 02:31:28,410
or adult use of cannabis, a
direct correlation in, uh,

2509
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:33,700
a reduction of opioid addiction
as well as opioid related deaths.

2510
02:31:34,520 --> 02:31:39,500
This is one thing that Congress
can do now to help make progress,

2511
02:31:39,800 --> 02:31:42,580
uh,
in dealing with this opioid epidemic.

2512
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:48,240
Another thing we've got to put a lot more
resources towards treatment on all of

2513
02:31:48,941 --> 02:31:52,210
the things that need to
happen after that detox,

2514
02:31:52,211 --> 02:31:55,660
that initial detox with folks who are,
uh,

2515
02:31:55,930 --> 02:32:00,930
dealing with opioid addiction and have
lost everything in their lives then or at

2516
02:32:01,041 --> 02:32:04,970
the place where, okay, well if they
have gotten through that detox now they,

2517
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:09,110
they've got no place to live. They've got
no place to work, they've got no money.

2518
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:12,010
And to be able to,

2519
02:32:12,011 --> 02:32:16,820
to provide that helping hand up as they
start to put back the pieces of their

2520
02:32:16,821 --> 02:32:21,170
life is something that we as a
society need to do a better at.

2521
02:32:21,470 --> 02:32:26,330
And the third thing I'll say is we've
got to go after the culprits responsible

2522
02:32:26,331 --> 02:32:27,164
for this.

2523
02:32:27,500 --> 02:32:32,500
When you look at companies like Purdue
Pharma who have intentionally deceived

2524
02:32:33,151 --> 02:32:38,151
and lied and cheated the American
people into taking these opioids saying,

2525
02:32:38,351 --> 02:32:41,140
no, you know, they're not risky, they're
not dangerous, don't worry about it.

2526
02:32:41,141 --> 02:32:46,141
These highly addictive opioids
creating this situation that we're in,

2527
02:32:46,440 --> 02:32:50,700
they are still not being held accountable
in the way that they need to. This,

2528
02:32:50,701 --> 02:32:51,640
this, uh, thing.

2529
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:56,660
It's the Sackler family has made tons of
money off of selling these opioids that

2530
02:32:57,091 --> 02:33:00,780
have ruined and devastated people's lives.
Our legislation,

2531
02:33:00,781 --> 02:33:03,930
the opioid accountability
act we introduced in the
last congress we're going to

2532
02:33:03,931 --> 02:33:08,931
be introducing again soon would provide
our federal prosecutors with the tools

2533
02:33:09,301 --> 02:33:13,980
they need to hold companies like Purdue
Pharma and others responsible for this

2534
02:33:14,030 --> 02:33:18,210
proliferation of opioids
criminally, uh, accountable.

2535
02:33:18,900 --> 02:33:23,900
And another thing that baffles me is
this constant changing of the dosage.

2536
02:33:23,951 --> 02:33:27,930
This fentanyl in this new thing that's
even more powerful than fentanyl.

2537
02:33:27,931 --> 02:33:31,470
The fact that they're developing
these incredibly potent opioids,

2538
02:33:31,471 --> 02:33:34,350
the FDA has approved like,
I don't understand.

2539
02:33:34,620 --> 02:33:37,610
I don't understand why do you need them?
What are they for their there,

2540
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:41,820
they're toxic. They're fatal and
incredibly small doses. Yeah.

2541
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:46,180
And it's not like we don't
already have oxycontin coding. Oh,

2542
02:33:46,340 --> 02:33:48,290
we have all these pain medications.

2543
02:33:48,500 --> 02:33:53,500
Like why are they insisting on letting
these companies patent these superior and

2544
02:33:54,111 --> 02:33:57,920
even more lethal versions of something
we already have a problem with. Exactly.

2545
02:33:57,921 --> 02:33:58,140
Right.

2546
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:01,830
It makes no sense. And I think
it speaks to the huge influence,

2547
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:07,120
the huge influence that these
pharmaceutical companies
have over regulators and

2548
02:34:07,180 --> 02:34:11,590
lawmakers. Both. So much of
this comes back to money.

2549
02:34:11,810 --> 02:34:15,270
Joe, you say all the right things.
I love, I love talking to you.

2550
02:34:15,360 --> 02:34:17,980
I really wish all the best.
Thank you. It was, uh,

2551
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:21,230
you know, it's a, we live in a
crazy time, you know, and uh,

2552
02:34:21,231 --> 02:34:24,020
your breasts breath of fresh
air. So, um, thank you.

2553
02:34:24,021 --> 02:34:27,430
I appreciate you and I wish you
well. Thank you. So good luck to you.

2554
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:31,250
Appreciate it. All right, folks
on the road, good luck. Take care.
