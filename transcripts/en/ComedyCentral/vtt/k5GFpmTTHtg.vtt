Tuesday was the birthday of
Geek Squad employee of the year

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.341
Edward Snowden, one of the few
people in trouble with the law

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.476
for a leak
that isn't public urination.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.979
Snowden's infamous leak led to
one of the biggest revelations

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.214
about the NSA's surveillance
tactics. I would like you

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:16.183
to come up with
some lesser-known top secret

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.653
government revelations
in 60 seconds. And begin. Steve.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.622
Joe Biden is from Kenya.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:26.827
Yeah, no one ever asked.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.795
Points. Eli.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.164
Ramsay Bolton is actually
based on Donald Trump.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.467
All right, points.
Spike.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.170
Bernie Sanders has a giant dick.

00:00:36.203 --> 00:00:39.606
Points. Points.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.941
Uh, Eli.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.876
The NSA beats off
to your Snapchats.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.812
All right, points. Steve.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:49.183
Sometimes if you
pee white into a lady

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.651
it makes a baby.

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.753
Oh, Jesus...

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.755
Christ.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:58.358
I didn't think you could
gross anyone out more

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:02.396
after (bleep) with the sock,
but well (bleep) done.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.632
Points. Spike.

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.534
Hans Solo dies.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.137
All right, points. Spike.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.107
It doesn't matter who wins
the election, we're all (bleep).

00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:15.709
Eli.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.010
Bernie Sanders is actually

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.712
one of the old guys
from the Muppets.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:21.715
All right, points. Steve.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.586
Some dude name Remy
actually let the dogs out.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.456
All right. Points.
I'm glad we solved that. Eli.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.559
<i>Lemonade</i> is really about
Bill and Hillary.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.028
Aw. That's nice.

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.530
Spike.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:39.032
The Harlem Globetrotters'
games are fixed.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.468
-HARDWICK: What?
-Yup, it's true.

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:43.270
Now, that's the oldest
reference we have...

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:43.370
That is probably the oldest
reference we have at all.
