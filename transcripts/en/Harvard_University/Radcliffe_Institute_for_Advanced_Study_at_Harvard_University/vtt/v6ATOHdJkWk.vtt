00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.982
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.400
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.480
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.340
I'm Dean here at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.660
And I'm delighted to welcome
you to this afternoon's program.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.940
In a moment my
colleague, Susan Ware

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.610
who is the Honorary
Women's Suffrage Centennial

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.100
Historian at the
Schlessinger Library,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.070
will give a proper introduction
to today's speaker,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.770
the acclaimed science
writer Dava Sobel.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.170
But first, I would
like to welcome you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.450
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
This afternoon's program
marks our final Davis lecture

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.150
of this academic year.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.600
The Davis Lecture Series,
established by Kim and Judy

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.280
Davis, brings prominent
thinkers in all fields

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.960
to Radcliffe to share
their work with the public.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.980
And I'm happy to see Kim
here in the audience with us

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.110
this afternoon.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.660
It is because of support
from people like Kim

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.350
and donations from many
others each year, some of whom

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.180
are here in the
audience, that we

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.550
are able to keep our events
free and open to the public.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.030
So I just want to say thank you.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.250
The Radcliffe
Institute is dedicated

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.510
to fostering cutting edge
research and inquiry across all

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.460
academic disciplines
and the creative arts,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.050
to promoting the study of
women, gender, and society,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.420
and to sharing the
fruits of advanced study

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.400
with a broad audience.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.430
We are especially proud
of our strong tradition

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.640
of supporting research
and public programming

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.650
in the sciences.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.750
True to our
interdisciplinary mission

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.380
we are also committed to
connecting the sciences

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
with other fields, including the
arts, literature, and history,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.160
which is our focus here today.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.730
The popularity of the
recent movie Hidden Figures

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.460
shows what a real
public hunger exists

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.130
to learn more about
the history of science

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.420
and in particular about
women's role in that history.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.450
Harvard has a fairly
complicated relationship

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.190
with the history of women in
science, as you could guess.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.310
To be sure, we have
our success stories.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.350
Grace Murray
Hopper, for example,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.610
was a mathematician and computer
scientists in the US Navy

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.130
who worked at the
Harvard Computational Lab

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.080
during World War II.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.900
She was one of the first
programmers at the Harvard Mark

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.070
I computer.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.560
And she was pivotal to
the invention of computer

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.120
programming languages
for business use,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.930
including the pioneering
language COBOL.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.660
Yale has just renamed
one of its eight

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.300
undergraduate
residential colleges,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.750
formerly known as Calhoun
College, after Hopper.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.606
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.790
- Yet many other
women in the sciences

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.400
and not just at
Harvard but everywhere

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.130
remain nearly invisible.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.040
Dava Sobel's newest
book, The Glass Universe,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.620
about women at the
Harvard Observatory

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.910
offers an important
antidote to that anonymity.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.920
Susan will introduce Dava
more fully in a moment.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.580
But I want to express
my own admiration

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.300
for Dava's and for her work,
which so brilliantly echoes

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.760
Radcliffe's goal
of bringing science

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.580
into conversation
with other disciplines

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.830
and with the broader public.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.770
Here's how the rest of
the afternoon will work.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.130
After Susan's introduction,
we will hear Dava's lecture.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.050
Then we will open the
floor for your questions.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.710
There will be a microphone
placed in the center aisle

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.280
if you have a question,
please come up,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.500
wait in line as there's
likely to be one

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.780
and introduce yourself
and ask your question.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.260
And as soon as the last
question is finished,

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.350
I hope you will
join us next door

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.930
in the Lyman Room in Agassiz
House for a reception.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.680
So it's now my great
pleasure to introduce Susan

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.170
and to turn things over to her.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.510
In addition to her current role
at the Schlesinger, Susan Ware.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.770
Is a celebrated historian
and the biographer

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.160
of such notable figures as
Billie Jean King and Amelia

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.250
Earhart.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.960
She is also the editor of the
last volume of Notable American

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.269
Women, a biographical
dictionary.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.420
Susan currently serves
as the general editor

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.970
of American National Biography.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.770
Please join me in welcoming
Radcliffe Institute's

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.205
very good friend, Susan Ware.

00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:30.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.440
- Good afternoon.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.420
I first developed
an appreciation

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.330
for the challenges of
scientific biography

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.180
when I served as editor
of the final volume

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.720
of the biographical dictionary
Notable American Women.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.920
It was hard not to feel a
real soft spot for the women

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.990
scientists we profiled.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.350
They were all
independent, spunky women

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.550
who battled sexism,
discrimination, nepotism,

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.150
and more to just do
what they loved best--

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.650
their research.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.200
Our authors usually
rose to the challenge

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.500
of telling the biographical
details of these women's lives

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.710
in science, but it
often proved much harder

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.170
for them to describe
their subjects

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.560
actual scientific
contributions in terms

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.590
that our general readers
could understand.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.250
And that is when I began
to appreciate good science

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.330
writing.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.010
And there is no better role
model than Dava Sobel, a master

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.820
storyteller, who not only
makes science come alive,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.620
but makes it fun.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.310
And she often does it through
the lens of biography.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.810
Her 1995 breakout book
Longitude used the life

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.740
of an obscure clockmaker
named John Harrison to tell

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.120
a story of intrigue and
discovery in the 18th century.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.110
Her next book Galileo's
Daughter in 1999

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.340
put a personal cast on the
story of the great scientist,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.740
grounding the story
in the relationship

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.320
between a father
and his daughter,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.840
who was a cloistered nun.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.560
In 2005, her next
book, The Planets,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.480
offered what I
suppose could be seen

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.720
as a biography of
the solar system.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.780
And she returned to
biography in 2011

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.310
with A More Perfect Heaven,
How Copernicus Revolutionized

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.270
the Cosmos, but with an
added twist, a two act

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.940
play embedded in the narrative.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.550
How many writers
could pull that off?

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.430
Well, Dava did,
which is testimony

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.690
to her years of experience
as a writer for publications,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.750
such as The New York
Times, Harvard Magazine,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.160
and The New Yorker.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.210
And she not only writes science,
she teaches science writing,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.110
including a recent three-year
stint at Smith College.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.290
She told me proudly
that one of her students

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.920
had recently been accepted
into MIT's graduate program

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.260
in science writing.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.290
Now we're here today to
hear her talk about her most

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.190
recent book, The Glass Universe,
How the Ladies of the Harvard

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.130
Observatory Took the
Measure of the Stars,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.650
published in December by Viking.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.900
This is very much
a Harvard story.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.670
And as Liz Cohen alluded to,
Harvard stories involving women

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.280
do not always end well,
but this one does.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.770
Under the leadership
of Edward Pickering

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.640
and with the financial
support of Anna Palmer Draper,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.060
an extraordinarily
talented group of women

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.790
found a congenial
and supportive,

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.610
if not especially
well-paid, place

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.040
to pursue careers
in astronomy that

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.470
literally changed the field.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.520
One of my favorite characters
is Annie Jump Cannon,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.110
in part because her middle
name captures so well the hoops

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.670
that women had to jump through
to pursue careers in science.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.530
But like Elizabeth
Warren, they persisted.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.150
There is a phrase
that astronomers

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.170
use when they experience
optimal atmospheric conditions.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.980
They say they have never
enjoyed better seeing.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.830
That I predict is
what Dava Sobel

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.010
is going to offer us today
on this fascinating topic.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.490
- Thank you very much.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.160
I think I need this.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.740
I have a microphone on me.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.530
Not that I have such
a booming voice.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.580
I just have other help.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.900
Thank you.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.280
It is really great to be here
at the scene of the story

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.850
and to see so many familiar
faces here and so many

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.680
unfamiliar faces too.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.180
And as Susan said, this
is really a happy story.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.810
It's not a chip on the
shoulder story at all.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:15.130
And it started for me
more than 20 years ago

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.950
when I was interviewing
astronomer Wendy Freedman.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.260
And at that time she was in
charge of a Hubble telescope

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.210
key project about the
expansion rate of the universe.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.320
And she mentioned the name
Henrietta Swan Leavitt

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:39.040
as someone whose work had been
fundamental to the Hubble study

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.240
in progress.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.340
And I've never heard of her.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.210
And when I went to learn
more about Miss Leavitt

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:50.450
discovered she was working in a
room full of women at Harvard,

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.220
which was a big
surprise, especially

00:09:54.220 --> 00:10:01.090
considering the time period, the
1890s through the early 1920s.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.560
And I thought that's a story.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.800
But it's taken me a long
time to get around to it,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.580
partly because there were
so many personalities

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.590
and a long period of time
over which a lot of science

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.690
happened.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.310
But this is the story.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.130
So as background, here we are
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.430
In the 1870s, this
book was published.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:36.130
And although the subtitle is A
Fair Chance for the Girls, what

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.580
the book really argued was
that young women should not

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:45.370
go to college because at
that time in their lives,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.440
their bodies were developing.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.450
And if they devoted too much
energy to higher education,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.510
their reproductive
organs would atrophy.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.830
You can afford to laugh.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.070
It took till 1885
for that theory

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:07.010
to be thoroughly
debunked by interviewing

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.456
women who had gone to college
and managed to have children.

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:13.700
And it was one of the
first acts of the American

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:19.000
Association of University
Women to go against Dr. Clark.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.390
This is the way the
observatory looked in 1847

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.270
and for a long time thereafter.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.700
A wooden building,
very grand at the top

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.910
of what was then known
as Summer House Hill

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.340
and later became
known as Observatory

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.130
Hill for obvious reasons.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:48.880
And early on women
were employed there.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.450
Or let's say they
were working there

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.510
because they were married
to the astronomers

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:59.100
or they were the children or
siblings of astronomers there.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.650
And the women were taught how
to do necessary computations

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.800
for the observations.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.460
And they performed
the work very well.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:16.920
So from there it was the logical
next step to hire people--

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.030
hire women from outside
the university family,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.980
I mean outside the
observatory family.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:31.890
Edward Pickering came to
the observatory in 1877.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.770
He was not quite 30 years old.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:41.790
And he was a physicist,
which seemed questionable.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.000
Was he really going
to do the proper thing

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.410
at the observatory?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.860
The President Eliot
thought he was the very man

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.000
and brought him in.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.050
He had 10 years experience
teaching at MIT.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.080
And he taught physics
by making students

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.940
do their own experiments.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.980
So they learned from doing
experiments that he designed.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.940
And there were several
instances of women

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.990
who approached him interested
in taking that course,

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.210
and he would let
them take the course.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.540
Harvard had a very
grand telescope.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.950
It's still there
in the observatory.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.100
This was a gift from
the people of Boston.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.290
And the earliest directors of
the observatory, William Cranch

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.050
Bond and his son
George Phillips Bond

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:43.050
used this telescope to take
the first photograph of a star.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:47.940
But the telescope really wasn't
designed for photography work.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.720
And the photographic
plates in their time

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.070
had a wet emulsion that
was difficult to handle.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:04.470
Although they succeeded in 1850,
they didn't carry it very far.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:08.400
And Pickering was very
interested in photography.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.730
His younger brother
was teaching it at MIT.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.570
And he really saw it as
the wave of the future.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.760
Some people were
opposed to photography.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.970
How could a photograph do what
a trained observer's could not?

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.040
But because the photographic
plate can gather light

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.450
over time, stars would appear
on these plates that had never

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:40.890
been seen by the most
skilled observers using

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.390
the most powerful instruments.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.780
So it caught on.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.150
And Pickering
began amassing what

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.580
I'd like to call
the glass universe,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.210
this phenomenal, unique
collection of half

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.250
a million glass plates,
which is still here today.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.520
Some of the plates
show actual objects,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.000
like this comet in a familiar
looking positive format.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.770
Most of them are negatives.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:18.700
So the stars appear black
against a white background.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.780
And Pickering's greatest
project actually

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.550
started with a love story.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.330
This is Dr. Henry Draper and
his wife Anna Palmer Draper.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:36.880
He was a medical doctor and
taught at New York University.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.840
And he was the first
person to succeed

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:46.030
at taking a photograph of
the spectrum of a star.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.170
So spectroscopy broke
up the light of a star.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:53.320
So that instead of looking
like a point of light,

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.780
it would look like a strip
of different shadings.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.730
And these shadings and
lines enabled scientists

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.280
to identify some
of the chemicals

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.190
in the stars, which
was terribly exciting.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.930
People had thought
that the stars were

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.470
so far away and inaccessible
that no one would ever

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.440
know what chemicals
they were made of.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.700
But with the spectra, it
became possible to do that.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.390
And Draper liked to
say that spectroscopy

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:31.030
had made the chemists' arms
millions of miles long.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:36.460
So he decided-- and his
wife was his assistant,

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.200
his partner in this work.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.210
She was also the
funder of the work

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.150
because she was
independently wealthy.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.270
And the two of them
were going to devote

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.000
the rest of their
lives to photographing

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.150
the spectra of the
stars and creating

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.530
a classification system,
a taxonomy, of the stars.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.600
And just when they
had everything

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.830
organized to do that,
he contracted pneumonia

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.540
and died at age 45.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:12.849
So she was heartbroken
but also determined

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:16.119
to see his dream realized.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:20.980
And she tried to pursue it
on her own with assistance.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.510
But then she
approached Pickering,

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.430
who had been a friend of
theirs and offered him

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.400
her personal fortune
if he would do

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.820
the work in her husband's name.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.604
And he agreed to that.

00:17:36.604 --> 00:17:42.240
Now this is a textbook
diagram of a spectrum.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.960
You see the colors of
light and the dark lines

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.000
that signal the emissions
of different chemicals.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.470
But there was no color
photography at the time,

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:58.950
so some of Draper's best
pictures look like this.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.680
And the Harvard
pictures look like this.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.160
Because Pickering
had the genius idea

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.570
to move the prism to the light
gathering end of the telescope

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.050
so he could capture
hundreds of them

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.330
on a plate at a time instead
of doing one per photograph.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.060
So every one of
these little smudges

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.780
is the spectrum of a star.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.530
And the women used
this type of image

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:32.980
to create the
classification system.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:39.580
Pickering really turned it over
to them, gave them free rein.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:45.700
And several classification
systems developed as a result.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.580
The big, black spot
is a penny just

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.070
to give you some idea of scale.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:58.240
And they say they examined the
plates with magnifying glasses,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.010
microscopes.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:05.670
Here you can see the kind
of stand that was used.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.550
So the plate is in
this wooden frame.

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:11.280
And then there's a
mirror at the bottom that

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.610
catches incoming
light from the window

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.600
and shines it up
through the plate.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.460
And see, she's holding
a magnifying glass.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.480
And here's Pickering
overlooking the operation.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.480
So the education
level of the women

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.540
was not particularly
higher, was not

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.000
a requirement at the beginning.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.850
Most had only a high
school education.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.170
And Mrs. Fleming came to
this country from Scotland

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.540
with her husband.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.900
But when she began working
at the observatory,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.500
she was pregnant and abandoned.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.860
And so she took a job
as a domestic servant

00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.900
in the director's
residence, and he

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.350
recognized how smart she
was and moved her over

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:09.790
to the observatory side and
taught her how to do computing.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.210
Then the Pickerings helped
her go home to Scotland

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.920
to have her baby.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.890
And they promised her a real
job if she would come back.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.880
Well, she came back
two years later

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.780
and took over this
project of classifying

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.090
the stars by their spectra.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.040
She was very
organized and orderly,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.490
and she named them with the
letters of the alphabet.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:38.320
And in 1890, her
classification the Henry Draper

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.710
Classification, was published.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.540
And she was credited
for that work.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.570
She eventually brought
her son to this country

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.100
when he was seven.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.410
And she continued working.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.730
She was a working mother before
that concept even existed.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:01.270
And she managed to
put him through MIT.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.060
And he became a mining engineer.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.320
And she went on to earn the
first Harvard University

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.620
title ever awarded
to a woman, which

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.280
was a curator of
astronomical photographs,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.879
and stayed working
at the observatory

00:21:17.879 --> 00:21:18.920
for the rest of her life.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.100
Antonia Maury was
the first woman

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.500
who came to work at the
observatory with a college

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:28.430
degree.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:30.350
She was a Vassar graduate.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:34.970
And she had eight semesters
of astronomy at Vassar

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:42.910
with Maria Mitchell, really the
first recognized American woman

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.530
astronomer.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.250
And Miss Maury was also
Henry Draper's niece.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.850
So she had a lot of
ins at the observatory.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:56.050
And her classification
system was very complicated.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:02.060
And it was probably
Pickering's least favorite.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.100
So here is Maria
Mitchell as a young woman

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.160
because she had a
Harvard connection also.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.360
When she discovered
her comet in 1847,

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.510
her father, who was a
good friend of the Bonds,

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.590
wrote to them and told
them what she had found.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.910
And there was a prize being
offered by the King of Denmark.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.810
And the Bonds
submitted her discovery

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:29.700
to the proper authorities.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.570
And eventually she
did win the medal

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:38.070
and that made her
world famous and is

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.790
what enabled her to
have the career she did

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:44.400
and to be invited
by Matthew Vassar

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.700
to teach astronomy
at his college.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.330
Annie Jump Cannon with
her wonderful active name

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.030
was the first women
who came to work

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.510
at the observatory who really
made her own observations.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:05.620
She was not there just
to look at glass plates.

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.050
She knew how to
handle a telescope.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.250
She came in 1896 doing
graduate work at Radcliffe.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.070
She was a Wellesley alumna.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:22.750
And at Wellesley she had--

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.980
here she is assisting
in the physics lab--

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.250
she studied physics with
Sarah Frances Whiting,

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.870
who was one of the women who
had taken Pickering's laboratory

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.060
physics class at MIT.

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.330
So she had the advantage
of all of that.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:45.100
And here she is observing on
the roof of the observatory.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.090
This is from a children's
book called Annie Jump Cannon

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:52.650
Astronomer.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.630
And this is one of the
plates she looked at.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.110
So what do you think?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:06.120
So Miss Cannon looked at
the two systems, the one

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.090
by Mrs. Fleming and
the one by Miss Maury.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:12.840
And she made the
best of both of them.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:18.760
She kept the alphabet
as her nomenclature.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:27.690
But she reordered the alphabet
to reflect some of the findings

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.790
in the spectra of the stars.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.870
So instead of going
in alphabetical order,

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:40.050
her alphabet went
O, B, A, F, G, K,

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:44.250
M, which generations
of astronomy students

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:48.900
have learned to memorize
as Oh, Be A Fine Girl,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.850
Kiss Me, or Be A
Fine Guy, Kiss Me.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.020
So one of the treasures
here in the Harvard archives

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.670
that helped me
separate the women

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:10.380
by their strong personalities
was the collection

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.850
of Miss Cannon's diaries.

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.520
She was a lifelong diarist.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.760
And being able to read
these was a privilege.

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.350
Her handwriting was not
great, as you can see.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:30.990
That slowed me down for
a while, took a while,

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:36.350
but I really loved
having that as a resource

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.500
and also having
her correspondence

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.130
and the correspondence of just
about everybody else who had

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.230
worked at the observatory.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:50.400
The records are quite complete.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.950
And in the early days,
everything was recorded.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.700
If they ordered
coal or ink, there

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.740
was a letter
documenting that fact.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.890
And you will still find
it in the correspondence

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.090
at the observatory.

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.780
Miss Cannon made very personal
relationships with astronomers

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.200
all over the world.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.950
She also corresponded
with their children.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:16.770
And then after some
number of years,

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.340
the children would invite
her to their weddings.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.740
So here's a group picture.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.350
This is Miss Cannon.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:30.492
This is Arville Walker who was
a 1907 graduate of Radcliffe.

00:26:30.492 --> 00:26:35.810
This is Margaret Harwood,
and 190-- no, I've

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.310
got them backwards.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.650
Arville Walker was 190--

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.210
I'm going to look that up later.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.380
One of them was 1906
and the other is 1907.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.560
But Miss Harwood
was the first person

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:57.960
chosen by a relative of Maria
Mitchell's to have a Nantucket

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.210
Fellowship.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:04.770
So Maria Mitchell's
home on Nantucket

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.840
became an observatory.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.340
And her relatives
wanted to provide

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.340
funding for a young
woman to spend

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.090
part of the year at Harvard
and then the rest of the year

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.470
at Nantucket doing research
and also teaching astronomy

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.980
to the local people.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.620
And Miss Harwood
was the first person

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.990
to win one of those fellowships.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.080
And the family--

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:41.550
Lydia Swain Mitchell,
Hinchman was her married name,

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.680
who started this project.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.560
And she and the
rest of the family

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.580
liked Miss Harwood
so much that they

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.400
decided to make her
the permanent fellow

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.610
and the director of the
Nantucket Maria Mitchell

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.750
Observatory.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:02.480
And she kept that position
for more than 40 years.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.730
So then Miss Mitchell
had to come up with--

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.850
or she volunteered to come
up with another fellowship

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:15.620
since Miss Harwood was now the
permanent Nantucket Fellow.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.200
So they created a
second fellowship.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:21.260
And they wanted to name it
the Harvard Astronomical

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.080
Fellowship for Women.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.360
But President Lowell
objected to that

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.670
because Pickering was going to
have charge of this fellowship,

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.170
of choosing the people
and giving out the money.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.570
And Lowell didn't think
that any fund controlled

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.290
by an individual should
have the Harvard name.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.440
So they changed the name to
the Pickering Astronomical

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.360
Fellowship for Women.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.860
And they were very
happy with him

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:54.410
because they felt he had
been so broadminded and fair

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.640
in his treatment of women.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.670
One of the things he did to
make the plate collection really

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.990
complete was send a
deputy to South America

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:12.700
to find a place to erect a
telescope so that pictures

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.770
of the entire sky
could be taken,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.490
not just what was visible
in the skies over Cambridge.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.970
And this was what
was euphemistically

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.270
called Mount Harvard.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.860
Very rough at the beginning,
it wasn't that great a site.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:36.040
They moved to a site near
the town of Arequipa in Peru

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:40.480
and really created what I think
everyone will agree looks like

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.970
a very legitimate
observatory in the shadow

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:52.170
of an extinct volcano, El Misti,
actually a dormant volcano,

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.930
not quite extinct.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.270
In the building
that has the dome--

00:29:57.270 --> 00:30:00.660
there were several
telescopes at the site.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:05.100
But this large telescope,
which parts of it

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.280
are now on exhibit
in the Science Center

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:15.150
in the show about scale, this
is called the Bruce Telescope,

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.620
because it was paid for
by another heiress charmed

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:23.950
by Pickering, Catherine
Wolfe Bruce of New York.

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.920
She learned that he needed
$50,000 to build this telescope

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.116
and she wrote him a check.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.720
This is Solon Bailey, who
was Pickering's assistant

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.200
who went to South America
and chose the spot

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.570
and did much of the work.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:49.162
And this is his wife,
Ruth Poulter Bailey.

00:30:49.162 --> 00:30:50.870
Bailey knew he'd be
down there for years,

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.490
so he took his family.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.120
They had a young
child, a son, who

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.040
later became a
professor of botany

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.440
at Harvard, Irving Bailey.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.680
And so they had nice times too.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.690
They had picnics.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.110
And Bailey was most
interested in these objects,

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:16.370
which are called
globular clusters,

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.130
for maybe obvious reasons.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:23.750
And one thing he tried to
do was to count the stars

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:28.010
in the globular clusters,
which was challenging.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:33.590
And they did that by creating a
grid on another piece of glass

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:36.890
that they could put
over the photographs

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:40.060
and then count
the stars per box.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.020
And the husband and
wife would each count.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.570
And where they didn't
agree, they could average.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:52.820
And she also did a lot
of the meteorology work

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:56.060
because that was very
important to understand

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.065
the weather at several
stations around the country.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:08.070
So Henrietta Leavitt, the one
whose name I learned first,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.390
she came to work at the
observatory in 1895.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.720
She was a Radcliffe graduate.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:21.980
And she was given a lot of
the plates from South America,

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.910
from the Bruce telescope
and the other telescopes.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:29.920
And her job was to look
for variable stars.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.490
Bailey too was very interested
in the variable stars.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:37.150
Some of those clusters
were full of stars that

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.370
change their light over time.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.770
So he was not only
counting the stars,

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:45.970
but he was looking at them
in a series of photographs

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:51.270
and noticing how their
brightness changed over time.

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.990
And Miss Leavitt was
looking at other objects

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:57.360
looking for variable stars.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.160
Here's one of her plates.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.670
So this is the small
Magellanic Cloud,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.300
which can be seen only from
the Southern hemisphere.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:11.260
And she found about 1,000
variable stars in it.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.510
And she realized that
all of those stars

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.390
were pretty much the
same distance from Earth.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.360
So the stars that looked
the brightest really

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.130
were the brightest.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:27.350
And she noticed that
among the variable stars

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:31.500
that the brightest ones took
the longest time to cycle

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.120
through their changes.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.790
And she thought that
was significant.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.650
And Pickering reported
that and gave her credit

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.510
for the observation.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.360
This is the Large
Magellanic Cloud.

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.030
She looked at that too.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.920
And after making that
general observation,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.910
she followed very closely
about two dozen stars

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.350
in these objects.

00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:03.270
And she became convinced
that this was indeed true

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.800
that these variable stars
that their brightness was very

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.810
much tied to their
period, a discovery that's

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.980
long been called the
Period Luminosity Relation.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:22.090
This was her data,
which she reported

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:26.480
in the annals of the
Harvard College Observatory

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.550
over her own name.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.670
And one of the first things
that happened with her finding

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.540
was that astronomers
made calibrations

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.810
with the variable stars
within the Milky Way

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.260
and were able to determine
the distance to the Small

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:43.969
Magellanic Cloud.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:47.030
So measuring
distances across space

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.429
beyond what had
been possible before

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:53.310
was the direct outcome of
Miss Leavitt's observation,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.420
a tremendously
important finding.

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:04.580
Harlow Shapley, who took over as
director after Pickering died,

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:08.710
was also very interested
in Miss Leavitt's work.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:16.630
And he used her stars
and the globular clusters

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:20.290
to estimate the size
of the Milky Way.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.310
And it was gigantic.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.620
It was so big that
he felt it was

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:29.290
the sum total of the universe.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.870
At that time, the
early 1920s, there

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:35.980
was debate as to
whether the Milky

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:42.550
Way was one of many galaxies or
if it was the entire universe.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:46.580
And Shapley came to believe
that it was the universe.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.590
Shapley was also very
interested in ants.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.210
When he was working at Mt.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.740
Wilson, he did scientific
research on ants

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.860
when he wasn't looking
at globular clusters.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:08.250
And so this cartoon is
perfect for him the.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.490
Caption is missing,
but it says, "Makes

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.050
you feel small, doesn't it?"

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:23.150
Shapley loved the idea that
the sun and planets were not

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.640
at the center of the Milky Way.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.910
And he liked to say that
that proved that man was not

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.760
such a big chicken.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.110
But it didn't take
long for Edwin Hubble

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:41.690
to also use Miss Leavitt's
stars to make the discovery

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:46.730
that, in fact, the little
spiral shapes that could be seen

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.870
through the telescope really
were separate galaxies

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:56.120
and the Milky Way was not the
sum total of the universe.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.680
So that was hard for
Shapley to swallow,

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.400
but then again, it came
out of Miss Leavitt's work.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.790
And later, Hubble
also used her stars,

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:12.170
her reasoning to show that
the universe was expanding.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.700
So I mentioned Margaret
Harwood earlier.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:25.760
And she was the
director at Nantucket.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:33.440
And she had gotten a
master's degree in astronomy

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.940
at Berkeley while she
was working at Harvard.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:44.420
And when Shapley came, he formed
a very close bond with her.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.150
She was one of his favorites.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.720
And he often visited
Nantucket, gave talks

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.700
there in the summertime.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:59.270
And he had the idea to create
a graduate program in astronomy

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:00.740
at Harvard.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.060
There had not been one.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:04.250
So that's why she
had to go to Berkeley

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.430
to get her graduate degree.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:13.310
And the only money he had
to support graduate students

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.790
were these Pickering
fellowships for women.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:21.890
And as a result, since
the money was specifically

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.120
designated for women, he had
to find graduate students

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.950
at the women's colleges.

00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:34.460
So the first graduate student
to come in under this program

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.300
was Adelaide Ames from Vassar.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.030
And the second
was Cecilia Payne,

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.050
who came from England, where
she had been told that she

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.001
had no future in astronomy.

00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:53.290
The most she could hope for was
maybe become a schoolteacher

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.680
with a hobby of stargazing.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.640
But she knew about
the work at Harvard.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.760
She certainly knew of
the work of Annie Jump

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.470
Cannon and the others.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.660
And she knew about
the plate collection.

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:08.810
So she applied for a
Pickering Fellowship

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:13.190
and came here on those terms.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:21.230
And Shapley quickly realized
that she could go on to a PhD.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.670
And he pushed her to do that.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:29.620
And in the course of
her doctoral research,

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.700
she was looking at the
spectra and determining

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.210
the relative abundances
of the different chemicals

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:38.560
in the stars.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.270
And the idea had been that
since the materials were

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.400
the same chemicals
as had been found

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.970
on Earth that the proportions
would be the same.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.990
And she came up with an
abundance of hydrogen

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.470
that seemed completely
out of proportion,

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.350
that it was about a
million times more

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.230
prevalent than anything else.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.050
And Shapley was
nervous about that

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:09.180
and went back to his Princeton
mentor, Henry Norris Russell,

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:15.250
to have a look at Miss
Payne's thesis in draft

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.920
and advise her about it.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.380
And Russell also
felt that it was

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:24.670
just impossible for hydrogen to
be about a million times more

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.620
prevalent than anything else.

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.470
But she had called
attention to that.

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:33.990
And Russell took it
on and studied it

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.910
for the next several years.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.520
And it took only
four years for him

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.640
to publish a paper in
which he said it really

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.880
is mostly hydrogen and helium.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.020
So it wasn't all work
at the observatory.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.820
Sometimes they had fun.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:57.270
On New Year's Eve
in 1929, they put

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.640
on a production of
an operetta, called

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.090
The Observatory
Pinafore, which had

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:07.920
been written decades
earlier about the hard life

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.320
of an astronomer.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.950
And so here's Harlow Shapley.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.800
His daughter Mildred was
part of the computer chorus.

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.845
This is Adelaide Ames,
the graduate student.

00:41:18.845 --> 00:41:20.730
This is Miss Payne.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:33.020
And this is Helen
Sawyer Hogg, who

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:40.130
was the second woman to go
on to a PhD here at Harvard.

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.390
Here she is.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:47.150
And when she came in the 1920s
that the earlier women had just

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.280
been married to the job.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.100
If they got married, they left.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.770
But most of them
didn't get married.

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:54.270
They stayed.

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.550
They worked six days a week.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.510
They stayed for 40 years,
some of them 50 years.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:02.540
And they socialized
on Saturday night.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.510
So it was really a family.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:09.740
And they understood the
fantastic opportunity

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.210
they'd been given.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:18.090
And they really enjoyed
their work and were rewarded.

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:23.930
They were all always
credited, always recognized.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:29.900
And she married the first of
male graduate student, Frank

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.120
Hogg, who came from Canada.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.030
And they wound up
moving to Canada.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:41.630
But she pursued
her own research.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.650
And after he died, she
continued his research

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:51.740
and was also a very skilled
popularizer of astronomy

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:57.090
and wrote a newspaper column
and won prizes for her writing.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.740
This is the whole picture
of the little blowup

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.550
we saw at the beginning.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.865
This is Miss Cannon.

00:43:08.865 --> 00:43:12.270
This is Miss Leavitt.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:15.300
This is Arville Walker.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.860
So the picture strikes
some people as demeaning.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.420
It is called "the paper
doll" photograph after all.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:27.900
But I want to emphasize
that their situation was

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.840
unusual in the amount of respect
and recognition they got.

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:37.560
They became members of the
American Astronomical Society.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.710
Miss Cannon was an
officer of the society.

00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:42.630
And they were also
foreign members

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.600
of the Royal
Astronomical Society,

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.630
the French, the Mexican.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.700
And Miss Cannon
was the first woman

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.730
awarded an honorary
doctor of science degree

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.830
from Oxford University.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:44:03.680
So there's no question they
were recognized and respected.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:10.970
Miss Cannon created her
own prize late in life that

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:15.650
recognized a young woman,
or not so young woman--

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.820
the first winner
was Cecilia Payne--

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.460
but someone who had
done extraordinary

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.455
work and showed great promise.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:29.780
There was a monetary prize.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:36.830
She had won a prize herself and
turned the money into a fund

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.110
to create the Annie
Jump Cannon prize, which

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:41.450
is still awarded to this day.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:46.370
And she thought it would be nice
if in addition to the money,

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:50.030
the winner would get a
little piece of jewelry

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.110
that she could wear all
the time as a memento.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.830
And each time the prize was
awarded in Miss Cannon's

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:02.480
lifetime, she commissioned
a different woman jeweler

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:06.440
to create the pin.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:08.150
And it was supposed
to be a pin that

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:10.190
could be worn as a pendant.

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:13.820
And this one, which was
just photographed for me

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:17.300
by Joanne Davis here,
this was the one

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.310
awarded to Margaret Harwood.

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.580
And it lives here in
the Schlesinger Library

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:23.780
with her collected papers.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.120
And Helen Sawyer
Hogg won one too.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.670
So the plate collection,
which is still

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:44.760
housed in the special
building constructed for it--

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.040
as soon as Pickering
began amassing the plates,

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.350
he became paranoid about fire.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.350
The observatory was
a wooden building.

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:56.130
So he built a brick
building, which

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:58.320
later had to be enlarged
a couple of times

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.620
because there are
half a million plates.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.650
And it's interesting that
the curator has always

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.640
been a woman.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:13.120
And the current curator
is Lindsay Smith.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.860
These are two pictures
of the same person.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.770
Here she is looking
through the plates, which

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.020
all have these paper jackets.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.660
And here she's looking at
some of the record books,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:26.120
because as the women
studied the plates,

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.150
they made notations
in the record books.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.820
And you may know, the
plates are currently

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.760
being digitized
because they are still

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:39.260
a valuable and
irreplaceable resource.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.510
People come here to study them.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.660
There has been concern
that the emulsion

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.750
might separate from the plates.

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.190
So there's been a
push and there's

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.410
been funding from the
National Science Foundation

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.220
to digitize the collection.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:00.530
And special equipment has
been built here to do that.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:05.540
And it is in progress.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.170
It suffered a minor
setback about a year ago

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.935
when there was a water main that
burst under the brick building.

00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:16.190
You know, the irony,
Pickering worried about fire,

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:21.350
but there was a flood that
submerged about 60,000

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:21.950
of the plates.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:28.330
But all is well
and they continue.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:31.730
How many people have
seen Hidden Figures?

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:32.850
OK.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:37.680
So this is Alyssa Goodman,
who's professor of astronomy

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.480
here at Harvard.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.790
Call attention to
her T-shirt, which

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:43.370
is not quite the NASA T-shirt.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:51.780
And to me Hidden Figures is
more about race relations

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.980
in the United States than it is
about computing or astronomy,

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.190
but it is a very
important movie.

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:06.210
And we're all in favor of it.

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:07.980
Professor Goodman
was one of the people

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:12.060
I enlisted to read my manuscript
as a technical expert.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:17.310
And she kind of dropped the
responsibility on the astronomy

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:22.450
because she got so surprised
by the work of the women.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:28.860
And she said she had heard
their names as a student,

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.630
and certainly now
she works here,

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.220
she knows they had something
to do with Harvard.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.490
But she always
thought that they were

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:39.510
doing something cute or quaint.

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.360
And she didn't realize
that they were actually

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:46.410
doing science and very
important science at that.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:51.990
So she was so excited
that she agitated for me

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.870
to be able to have
my book launch

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.480
in the observatory,
which happened

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.340
and which made me very happy.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.900
So here they are again.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.892
This is Margaret Harwood.

00:49:06.892 --> 00:49:09.960
This is Antonia Maury.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:15.290
This is Cecilia
Payne, Arville Walker.

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:18.800
And here's Miss Cannon
too busy to look up,

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.660
working to the last.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:27.720
And I enjoyed working on
this book tremendously.

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.560
I mean it just always seemed
like such an important story

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.360
to me, but now it seems
even more important

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.580
because of current
events, because

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:43.670
of an increasingly anti-science
attitude that I fear is abroad

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.970
in the land, and we
all need to do whatever

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:52.630
we can to tell true
stories about science

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:58.090
and to make it clear that women
have always been interested

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.580
in science.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.330
It's not a brand new thing.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.080
There are some
inspirational figures

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:09.400
in the past whose
stories can be revived.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.320
And Marie Curie, although
she's the only female scientist

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.500
that many people can name,
she's not the only one.

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:22.594
So we want to put some
more names out there.

00:50:22.594 --> 00:50:24.570
Thank you.

00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:28.522
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:41.230
- Hello.

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.060
Thank you.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.630
Patty Nolan.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.640
I live here in Cambridge.

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.730
I'm curious as a
historian your thoughts

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:52.400
on not having artifacts
in the present day,

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.670
that the kind of
letters and plates

00:50:54.670 --> 00:51:00.016
might be being replaced today,
that current scientists today

00:51:00.016 --> 00:51:02.140
would be working through
email or through some kind

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.750
of electronic means and may
not have the actual physical--

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:07.499
and I don't know about you, but
I don't think my kids have ever

00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:09.040
written a letter in
their lives other

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.727
than thank you letters I made
them write, as opposed to all

00:51:11.727 --> 00:51:13.810
of us who probably have
letters that we wrote back

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.600
and forth many
years ago and that

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.749
was a source of a lot of
what your understanding

00:51:18.749 --> 00:51:19.540
of the people were,

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.750
so whether that will influence
future historians as they

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.370
look back on scientists.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.460
- I'm sure that will.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:32.020
And I started thinking about
that with Galileo's Daughter

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.530
because I read
their correspondence

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:38.230
or her letters to him
which he had saved.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:42.160
And that was so meaningful, not
just the content of the letters

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.650
but the things that had
been spilled on them

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:49.980
and other clues like that.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.600
And the way it made
me feel was I'm

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.670
glad I won't live that
long, that I think it's

00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.920
a different sort of record.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.990
And much is gained because
there's much more material,

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:08.625
but a lot is lost as well.

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:09.360
- Hi, Dava.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:10.590
I'm Melanie Wallace.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:12.720
I'm a producer from NOVA.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.280
I just want to
let everybody know

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.930
we've made two films
with Dava Sobel,

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:22.530
one on Galileo's Daughter
and one the Longitude story.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.770
Both of them are
available online.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.530
Go to YouTube.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.710
Don't tell anybody I told you.

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:32.760
Also, I just wanted to
say that many years ago I

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:34.830
worked with Phil
Morrison from MIT,

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:37.920
and we did a film in
the glass plate library.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.350
And we focused on the
work of Cecilia Payne

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.930
and told the story of
these amazing women.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.900
And that film is called
Atoms, The Ring of Truth.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:47.040
It's on YouTube.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.020
Anybody can see it.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.900
It just gives some background to
Dava's book, which is fabulous.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:52.470
- Great.

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:53.157
Thank you.

00:52:53.157 --> 00:52:54.490
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:52:57.948 --> 00:52:58.940
- Hi.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:04.520
Dave Sobel, a science writer
with a strangely familiar name.

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:05.240
It just happened.

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.030
In the book, you quote
Mrs. Fleming as saying that

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.780
women's patience, perseverance,
and method in many things were

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.310
superior to men's.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.179
So having done
all this research,

00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:16.220
what do you make of that?

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.150
Was it true then?

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.320
Is it true now?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.620
- Well, she thought it was true.

00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:27.590
And some people felt that women
actually had better pattern

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.630
recognition skills.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.554
Maria Mitchell is on
record as saying--

00:53:32.554 --> 00:53:34.220
I'm going to mangle
this quote, but it's

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:39.320
something like the hand
that guides the needle helps

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:43.970
the eye of the telescope,
that the skills that girls

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:47.840
were taught in her day actually
made them better observers.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.510
I have no evidence
for that, but it

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.020
was something people thought.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:58.520
The big complaint Mrs. Fleming
had was not being paid enough.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:04.130
And that was the downside of the
wonderful opportunity they had.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.580
And I think as forward
thinking and broadminded

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:11.690
as Pickering was, he knew he
was getting a bargain because he

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:13.582
could hire the
women more cheaply.

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:16.850
- Hello.

00:54:16.850 --> 00:54:18.170
My name is Joan Shaw.

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:19.790
And I live in Cambridge.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.850
And I want to make a comment
and I have a question.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:27.950
In 1995, a friend in Edinburgh
went into a thrift shop

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:31.700
and he found the birth
certificate was longitude

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:36.050
about the chronometer, he found
that man's birth certificate

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:39.560
in Edinburgh in a charity shop.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.210
My other question
is have you ever

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:46.070
had a conversation with former
Harvard President Larry Summers

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.090
about women in science?

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.890
- That's a good question.

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.060
No, I have not.

00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:00.570
But the review of
The Glass Universe

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.000
that ran in The
Boston Globe started

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.950
with a comment
about Larry Summers

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:09.180
and how if he had only
looked right there at Harvard

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.340
he could have found evidence
against his argument.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.450
Yes.

00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:17.214
- I think this is
a fitting segue.

00:55:17.214 --> 00:55:17.880
I'm Judy Singer.

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.000
I'm the Vice Provost for Faculty
Development and Diversity.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.320
My office was created in 2005 in
the wake of President Summer's

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.260
comments on women in science.

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:31.050
And I have a question
about Cecilia Payne

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.080
after she became Cecilia
Payne Gaposchkin.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.880
So she was actually
the third woman

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.605
tenured at Harvard University.

00:55:37.605 --> 00:55:40.710
So in 1958, she
did receive tenure

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:43.290
from the Department
of Astronomy.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.590
But I hope you can
clarify a mystery to me.

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:51.060
She has been presented to me as
the first dual career retention

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:53.580
case at Harvard University.

00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:56.060
And I'm hoping that you
have some information

00:55:56.060 --> 00:56:00.120
from your research that
according to legend--

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.610
and I'm hoping you can
either corroborate or correct

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.200
my legend--

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.450
that her husband,
and I'm not sure,

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:11.460
and she were being recruited to,
I believe, Princeton and that,

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.710
quote, "the only
reason Harvard tenured

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.530
her was to retain her husband."

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:19.080
So I'm hoping you can
refute this story.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.110
- Yeah, I'm sure
that's not true.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:21.610
- Good.

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.466
Do you know what is true?

00:56:23.466 --> 00:56:23.965
- Pardon?

00:56:23.965 --> 00:56:25.690
- Do you know what is true?

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:29.160
- Well, she met her
husband in Europe.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.070
She was going to
scientific meetings

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:35.100
and visiting other
observatories in Europe.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.370
And he was in truly
desperate circumstances.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:41.830
He was Russian but
living in Germany.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.814
And he was thought
to be a Russian spy,

00:56:44.814 --> 00:56:46.980
but he couldn't go home
because the Russians thought

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.080
he was a German spy.

00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.280
And he had gone to
this particular meeting

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:55.560
knowing that she would
be there and hoping

00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.840
that he could find help.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.170
He expected her to be the
age of Annie Jump Cannon.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:04.620
But she turned out to be
a young woman his own age.

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:11.160
And he gave her a written
summary of his life story

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.160
to that point, his situation.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.040
He was educated in astronomy.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:21.930
And she went back to Harvard
and prevailed on Shapley

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.520
to rescue him.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.240
And they did.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.730
And they created a job
for him and brought him

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:27.799
to this country.

00:57:27.799 --> 00:57:28.840
And then she married him.

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:35.110
But I think she was
always considered

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.737
the more important scientist.

00:57:37.737 --> 00:57:38.711
- That's fabulous.

00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:41.800
Thank you.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.300
- Hi.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.200
I'm Jane Kamensky.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.900
I'm the faculty director
of the Schlesinger Library.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:47.880
I think we should be
reissuing those pins.

00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.310
They're fabulous.

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:53.700
But my question is about
generations in your story.

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.410
It's such an important
part of the book.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:59.670
And we can see it so nicely
in the photograph where we've

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:02.760
got women spanning
several decades

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.760
and several decades of dress
style in that paper doll

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.570
photograph.

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:08.520
So I wondered if
you could give us

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.640
a kind of thumbnail
sketch of what

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:14.820
changed in the generations
between the immediate

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:17.280
post-Civil War period
where your story starts

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.870
and where your story ends, and
maybe what stays the same too.

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:26.890
Your bending over backwards to
tell a glass half full story,

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.030
and I agree with the
need for inspiration

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.350
from the perspiration.

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:32.730
But are there
things that you see

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.162
as sort of intractable that
stick across the generations

00:58:36.162 --> 00:58:37.620
that we ought to
be thinking about?

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.510
- Well, the pay
problem certainly

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:42.000
sticks across the generations.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.470
So that's one of them.

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:52.490
Post-Civil War that was the
beginning of women's colleges.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.140
Those grew up and those
created a feeder system

00:58:57.140 --> 00:59:00.050
of well-educated
young women who could

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:03.080
come to the observatory
prepared to do the work here.

00:59:06.744 --> 00:59:12.100
And the fellowships enabled
them to get a grounding here

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.800
and then go get a job
at another observatory.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.910
So they really
infiltrated observatories

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:21.020
all over the country.

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:24.200
And I think the
reason that there

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.040
were women doing computing at
Langley and at Jet Propulsion

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.160
Lab was because of
the Harvard situation,

00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:36.380
that it made that look
normal because it worked.

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:38.330
Before that, computers
had been men.

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.450
I don't know if I've answered
your question totally,

00:59:43.450 --> 00:59:48.850
but I think we've slid backward.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:52.660
The situation here was
unusual and special.

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.810
It wasn't a general
condition of women.

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:58.270
When Miss Cannon went
to Europe to meetings

00:59:58.270 --> 01:00:02.440
she noted that there were no
women working at Greenwich

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.570
and at the big astronomy
meeting in Germany

01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:08.650
there were no women
attending the lectures.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.890
They would be at meals, but
they weren't at the lectures.

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:16.080
And she was alone in the room
as the only woman in the room.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:22.630
And so it's not that there were
lots of women astronomers then

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.160
and that it shrank.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:28.581
But the ones who had the
opportunity here really got to

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:29.080
excel.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:35.340
- Hello, Ms. Sobel.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.640
I'm Sam Terry.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.140
I live in Cambridge.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.360
And I work in the
performing arts.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:46.990
I'm struck by the prose of
your writing and the narrative

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.480
economy that you kind of find.

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:54.100
I'm curious about your
discovery of the narrative

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.380
amidst the history,
amidst the science,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:01:03.480
and how you're able to allow
it to have momentum the way

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.830
a story will have momentum
being true to the history

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.080
and also keeping
it from flatlining

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.624
with anecdotes and whatnot.

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:15.040
You do it fantastically, so
I'm curious about the process.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.550
- Thank you.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.820
Thank you.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:22.050
Well, the story is paramount.

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:27.180
And this was a great
story before I touched it.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:32.580
And then the thing that helps me
is to think of someone to tell

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.590
the story to.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:40.590
And I think every story
has maybe an ideal voice

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.570
or an ideal audience.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:46.350
And the audience I had
in mind for this book

01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:49.470
was my daughter, who
is in her mid '30s

01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:51.630
and not at all
interested in astronomy.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.470
But she is a very
serious reader.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:03.920
And she's interested in
women and women's history.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.910
And I talk to her
about what I was doing,

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.430
and I could see how
interested she was.

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:15.800
So I thought if I could
tell it to her, even

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.740
with all that astronomy,
that would be great.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.040
So that was what I kept in
mind all the way through.

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:34.589
I felt it was crucial to
talk about the science

01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:36.380
that the women did,
that it would have been

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:40.010
a disservice to them
just to skip over it,

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:44.630
even though I knew that
detailing the science

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:48.500
could well make the
book less popular.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:53.420
But people like my daughter say
that the story carried them,

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.040
and they kind of whizzed
through the science parts

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.530
as quickly as possible
and they kind of

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:04.774
got it enough to have a
sense of what went on.

01:03:04.774 --> 01:03:06.065
Does that answer your question?

01:03:06.065 --> 01:03:06.235
- It does.

01:03:06.235 --> 01:03:08.060
You personify the
science very well.

01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.890
So it invigorates that interest.

01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.580
Thank you.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:16.700
- It's having a person
in mind on the other end

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:20.240
to always think, am I going
to lose her at this point?

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.190
- Hi.

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.420
My name is Maya Miklos.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:29.510
I'm an undergraduate
here studying physics.

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:32.930
And I was just curious about
your comment about the person

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.550
on the other end.

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:36.290
I'm finding your story
very interesting.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:38.780
And I'm wondering if there's
a message or a lesson

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:42.320
that you'd like this generation
of astronomy and physics

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.510
students, both male and
female, to take away

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:48.980
from the story of the ladies
in the Harvard Observatory.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:52.910
- Not a message, no.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:55.820
I don't remember who said
this, but it's a famous line,

01:03:55.820 --> 01:04:00.210
if you want to send a
message, call Western Union.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:06.690
But just the story itself
that it was forgotten.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.890
And it's a great story.

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:14.130
And I think it's good for a
lot of young people in science

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.268
to know about what
happened here.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.220
- Hi.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.100
I'm Bulbul Chakraborty.

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:23.240
I'm a physicist.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.590
I am a professor at Brandeis.

01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:29.530
In physics, astronomy
astrophysics

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:33.550
has many more women
than physics in general.

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.870
And what I didn't
know is that there

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.700
was this special fellowship
that Pickering had,

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:44.650
which recruited
women to go into PhD.

01:04:44.650 --> 01:04:49.540
And it almost seems to me after
being around these many years

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.470
that you almost need
a catalyst like that

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:57.700
to balance out the numbers.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.070
A biologist colleague
of mine told me

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:02.710
that that's what happened
in the life sciences

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:06.850
in the '60s when men
were drafted for the war

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:09.670
and women were readily
taken into labs.

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:14.080
And then people started
appreciating what women did.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.020
It seems to me that the
Pickering Fellowship

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.100
did that same thing for
astrophysicists and women

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.230
astronomers hasn't
happened in physics.

01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:29.790
- I think we need to
find somebody like that

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:32.820
who cam make it happen.

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.940
- I had one more
question, comment.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:36.450
So when I came to
graduate school,

01:05:36.450 --> 01:05:39.000
I was a graduate
student at Stonybrook.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.460
And there used to be
a room full of women

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:45.080
who used to look at bubble
chamber photographs.

01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:47.610
And it was a completely
different population.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:52.040
We as women PhD students
never talked to them.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:55.510
I don't think I ever
talked to any of them.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:58.450
And in later years
I had thought,

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:01.230
it was just a complete--

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:05.680
I we didn't think they
were doing science.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.340
They were never part
of the department.

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:10.100
They were never--

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:16.930
- Well, I think there's a
tendency among women as much

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:22.580
as some men to feel that if
women are doing that work,

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:26.140
it can't be that difficult
or that important.

01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.900
And--

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.380
- It was just that importance
was never made clear to us.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:35.710
And I sort of now in
retrospect blame the faculty

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.782
for not doing that
in some sense.

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:43.450
I don't know what they did.

01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.090
I still don't know
what they did.

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:48.200
- Well, someone is
writing a book about them.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:50.220
So you'll find out.

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.570
