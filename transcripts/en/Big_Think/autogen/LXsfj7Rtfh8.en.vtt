SETI is the search for extraterrestrial

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069
SETI is the search for extraterrestrial
 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.490
SETI is the search for extraterrestrial
intelligence and it addresses the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500
intelligence and it addresses the
 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.720
intelligence and it addresses the
question are we alone in the universe

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730
question are we alone in the universe
 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.810
question are we alone in the universe
this is a question which was goes back

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820
this is a question which was goes back
 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.660
this is a question which was goes back
to the dawn of history but for most of

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670
to the dawn of history but for most of
 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.760
to the dawn of history but for most of
human history it's been in the province

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770
human history it's been in the province
 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.609
human history it's been in the province
of religion and philosophy 50 years ago

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619
of religion and philosophy 50 years ago
 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.589
of religion and philosophy 50 years ago
however it became part of science and

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599
however it became part of science and
 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.420
however it became part of science and
the trailblazing work of a young

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430
the trailblazing work of a young
 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.499
the trailblazing work of a young
astronomer named Frank Drake set the

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:29.509
astronomer named Frank Drake set the
 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.710
astronomer named Frank Drake set the
trend Frank decided to start scanning

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720
trend Frank decided to start scanning
 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.020
trend Frank decided to start scanning
the skies with a large radio telescope

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030
the skies with a large radio telescope
 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.490
the skies with a large radio telescope
in the hope of stumbling across a

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
in the hope of stumbling across a
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.890
in the hope of stumbling across a
message from et it seemed a somewhat

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900
message from et it seemed a somewhat
 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.860
message from et it seemed a somewhat
quixotic enterprise when he began but

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870
quixotic enterprise when he began but
 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.540
quixotic enterprise when he began but
over the years it's grown and grown is

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
over the years it's grown and grown is
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.090
over the years it's grown and grown is
now an international effort and I think

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100
now an international effort and I think
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.640
now an international effort and I think
it's taken seriously by many scientists

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650
it's taken seriously by many scientists
 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.110
it's taken seriously by many scientists
and so it really consists of using radio

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
and so it really consists of using radio
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.050
and so it really consists of using radio
telescopes choosing target stars where

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060
telescopes choosing target stars where
 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.360
telescopes choosing target stars where
it's conceivable there might be some

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370
it's conceivable there might be some
 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.690
it's conceivable there might be some
sort of advanced alien civilization and

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700
sort of advanced alien civilization and
 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.729
sort of advanced alien civilization and
hoping that they might be beaming radio

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739
hoping that they might be beaming radio
 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.030
hoping that they might be beaming radio
messages our way and so the the 50th

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040
messages our way and so the the 50th
 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.130
messages our way and so the the 50th
anniversary of this it seems to me a

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140
anniversary of this it seems to me a
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.130
anniversary of this it seems to me a
good time to take stock because after

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140
good time to take stock because after
 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.890
good time to take stock because after
all we've had nothing but an eerie

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
all we've had nothing but an eerie
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.390
all we've had nothing but an eerie
silence in 50 years

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400
silence in 50 years
 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.370
silence in 50 years
so these astronomers have been patiently

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
so these astronomers have been patiently
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.649
so these astronomers have been patiently
pursuing this quest I might say Frank

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659
pursuing this quest I might say Frank
 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.380

Drake himself is still in the game 50

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390
Drake himself is still in the game 50
 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.380
Drake himself is still in the game 50
years on this is heroism of an unusual

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390
years on this is heroism of an unusual
 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.230
years on this is heroism of an unusual
sort who else do you know his devised a

sort who else do you know his devised a
 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.420
sort who else do you know his devised a
scientific experiment and has pursued it

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
scientific experiment and has pursued it
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.550
scientific experiment and has pursued it
for 50 years got a null result and is

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560
for 50 years got a null result and is
 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.100

still smiling and optimistic so Frank

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110
still smiling and optimistic so Frank
 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.410
still smiling and optimistic so Frank
Drake is a great hero of mine and I

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420
Drake is a great hero of mine and I
 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.310
Drake is a great hero of mine and I
admire his zeal and positivism but it is

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320
admire his zeal and positivism but it is
 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.380
admire his zeal and positivism but it is
just an eerie silence and so the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390
just an eerie silence and so the
 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.399
just an eerie silence and so the
question is are we doing the wrong thing

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409
question is are we doing the wrong thing
 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.960
question is are we doing the wrong thing
should we be looking somewhere else or

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
should we be looking somewhere else or
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.520
should we be looking somewhere else or
in some other way shall we broaden the

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530
in some other way shall we broaden the
 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.310
in some other way shall we broaden the
search and my conclusion is really that

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320
search and my conclusion is really that
 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.039
search and my conclusion is really that
I think what the SETI people are doing

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049
I think what the SETI people are doing
 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.450
I think what the SETI people are doing
is just great and I hope they go on

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460
is just great and I hope they go on
 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.039
is just great and I hope they go on
doing it and doing it better but

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049
doing it and doing it better but
 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.289
doing it and doing it better but
meanwhile we should start thinking

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299
meanwhile we should start thinking
 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.660
meanwhile we should start thinking
outside the proverbial box a bit to see

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670
outside the proverbial box a bit to see
 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.160
outside the proverbial box a bit to see
if there are other ways in which we

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170
if there are other ways in which we
 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.199
if there are other ways in which we
could try to track down et

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
 
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.030
 
if you ask the astronomers of the sharp

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
if you ask the astronomers of the sharp
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.640
if you ask the astronomers of the sharp
end of Seti why they think there has

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
end of Seti why they think there has
 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.470
end of Seti why they think there has
been an eerie silence they'll say well

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480
been an eerie silence they'll say well

been an eerie silence they'll say well
we only have been doing it for 50 years

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
we only have been doing it for 50 years
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.489
we only have been doing it for 50 years
we just started what more do you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499
we just started what more do you
 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.429
we just started what more do you
expected to begin of us out there and in

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439
expected to begin of us out there and in
 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.050
expected to begin of us out there and in
fact to put that into context they

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
fact to put that into context they
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.140
fact to put that into context they
looked carefully at just a few thousand

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
looked carefully at just a few thousand
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.809
looked carefully at just a few thousand
stars there are four hundred billion

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
stars there are four hundred billion
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.470
stars there are four hundred billion
stars within our Milky Way galaxy alone

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
stars within our Milky Way galaxy alone
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.059
stars within our Milky Way galaxy alone
so it is a needle in the haystack search

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
so it is a needle in the haystack search
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.640
so it is a needle in the haystack search
of course it's easy to conclude simply

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
of course it's easy to conclude simply
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.099
of course it's easy to conclude simply
that they just haven't been doing it

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109
that they just haven't been doing it
 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.319
that they just haven't been doing it
long enough for hard enough it's no

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329
long enough for hard enough it's no
 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.479
long enough for hard enough it's no
surprise they haven't heard anything but

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489
surprise they haven't heard anything but
 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.360
surprise they haven't heard anything but
the alternative is that we are indeed

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
the alternative is that we are indeed
 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.689
the alternative is that we are indeed
alone in the universe and it's

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:52.699
alone in the universe and it's
 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:54.670
alone in the universe and it's
impossible to answer that question

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680
impossible to answer that question
 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.990
impossible to answer that question
because there are so many unknown

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
because there are so many unknown
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.089
because there are so many unknown
factors if we're looking for

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099
factors if we're looking for
 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.039
factors if we're looking for
intelligence in the universe I think

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
intelligence in the universe I think
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.050
intelligence in the universe I think
everybody assumes that this has to start

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060
everybody assumes that this has to start
 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.270
everybody assumes that this has to start
with life and so the question is how

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
with life and so the question is how
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.979
with life and so the question is how
likely is it that there will be life

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
likely is it that there will be life
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.929
likely is it that there will be life

was any life beyond Earth today it's
 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.890
was any life beyond Earth today it's
fashionable to say that there's life all

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900

40 or 50 years ago about how life began
 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.129
40 or 50 years ago about how life began
got a very good theory of the evolution

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139
got a very good theory of the evolution
 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:31.280

we would at least like to know whether
