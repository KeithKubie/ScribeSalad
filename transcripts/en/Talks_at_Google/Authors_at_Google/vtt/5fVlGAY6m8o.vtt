00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.750
MALE SPEAKER: Hello and welcome.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.970
Thank you all for joining us
for another iteration of Authors

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.760
at Google, where we are
very pleased to welcome

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.302
Sydney Padua.

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:17.968
I hope I actually
pronounced that right.

00:00:17.968 --> 00:00:18.680
I failed to ask.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.320
So in recent months, we've
had the good fortune here

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.340
to host many leading lights.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.810
We had Barney Frank, and more
recently, David Duchovny,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.050
but today's guest puts
all of those to shame.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.860
We are happy to have
a preeminent scholar

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.530
of the Victorian
computing era among us.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.680
Sydney Padua, who
hails from Canada,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.880
did her schoolwork at
University of Alberta,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.710
where she got a PhD
apparently in footnotes

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.920
and has since become both
an impressive comic artist

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.600
and impressive scholar of the
history of early computing.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.440
And as I was just
saying to her, I'm

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.970
very glad that she reads all
the primary source material so

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.329
that I don't have
to because there's

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:16.870
quite a copious
amount of it, and I'm

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.500
truly impressed by the depth
to which she has explored it.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.390
So I guess without
further ado, we'll

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.100
welcome Sydney to tell us all
about Lovelace and Babbage

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.509
and the marvelous
history of computing.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.380
SYDNEY PADUA: Thanks.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.870
Hi.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.130
My name is Sydney Padua.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.290
I don't have a PhD I
should hasten to say.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.960
So this is me.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.860
I am just a random cartoonist
and also a VFX artist.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.870
Most of the time, I
can be found making

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.690
imaginary monsters appear to
attack people for the movies.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.520
I came from hand drawn
animation many years ago.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.680
I worked on "Iron Giant,"
which is a film a lot of people

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.900
really like.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.049
Since then, I've moved on to
computers, where apparently, I

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.340
work on blue and orange movies.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.174
I have to say it's really
very strange and hilarious.

00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.590
Five years ago,
if you had told me

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.260
I would be giving a talk
on computers at Google,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.980
I would have
laughed in your face

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.580
because I was a very, very
reluctant convert to computer

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.920
animation.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.060
I've always
distrusted computers.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.850
I was probably the last person
to be dragged backwards,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.150
with my fingernails
digging into the carpet,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.790
into CG from hand
drawn animation.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.580
But the reason I'm here
is because of these two

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.050
crazy kids.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.160
So that's Ada Lovelace
and Charles Babbage.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.860
I think a lot of people
know their story roughly

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.580
from computer science 101.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.595
You kind of get
the quick rundown.

00:03:13.595 --> 00:03:15.730
Charles Babbage, the
[INAUDIBLE] professor

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.395
of mathematics at Cambridge,
the position once held by Newton

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:22.840
and currently held, I
believe, by Stephen Hawking,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.910
so he's pretty clever.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.770
He was famous in
his own time for

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.890
this mysterious
calculating machine

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.510
which was perpetually
planned and never built,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.540
which we would now
recognize as a computer.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.730
It is really amazing
their computer,

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.090
as I'll talk about a bit later.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.860
The other person in that
duo is Ada Lovelace.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.510
She was born Ada Gordon,
probably better known

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.590
as Ada Gordon, daughter
of George Gordon,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.030
better known as Lord
Byron, the infamous poet.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.220
I learned about these people
when I was in a pub in London

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.900
with a friend of mine,
Suw Charman-Anderson, who

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.260
started this thing called
Ada Lovelace Day, which

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.920
you might be familiar with.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.110
It's sort of an online
blogging festival

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.420
every year to celebrate
women in computing

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.560
and raise their profile.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.880
And she said to me, Sydney,
you're a woman in tech now.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.370
You should do a blog post
for Ada Lovelace Day.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.630
And I said, I don't even
know who Ada Lovelace is.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.160
I'm also not really
a woman in tech.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.140
I work on tech.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.330
I'm not in tech.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.010
But I went to Wikipedia,
like anybody else would,

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.630
and there I found this
extraordinary story

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.340
about Lovelace, who was
raised by mathematicians so

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.190
that she would not become a
crazy poet like her father.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.940
It had very much a feel of
a superhero origin story.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.620
It had that nice, angsty
story of conflict.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.942
I thought, oh, that would make
a really cute little comic.

00:04:58.942 --> 00:05:00.400
And I thought
because I didn't know

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.940
who Lovelace was that a
nice idea for a blog post

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.690
would just be a
short, little comic.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.811
I did it as a strip so
it's about this long,

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:12.310
just explaining who Ada Lovelace
is, and I did it like this.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.460
So this is all true.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.670
I can now verify, having read
a hell of a lot of letters--

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.870
sorry, heck of a
lot of letters--

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.870
that Lovelace's mother was
very concerned that she not

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.710
become "poetical,"
which I believe

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.970
was a Victorian euphemism
for not ladylike or wild.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.500
So she had her tutored
in mathematics and logic.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.780
She met Babbage at a party in
1833, always the best place

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.000
to meet someone.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.310
He's leaning there on the only
working fragment of a machine

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.310
that he built. That's a
fragment of the difference

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.920
engine, which was a calculator.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.820
You can actually see that
piece, a beautiful machine

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.480
made of brass, in the
Science Museum in London.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.160
It's about this big.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.250
And you could turn a crank
and it could turn out

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.180
some little calculations.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.710
At this party,
apparently someone

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.300
said, "Has everyone gazed
upon the machine like savages

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.930
looking at a looking glass?"

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.630
Only Ada Byron understood the
true beauty of the machine

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.880
and understand its function.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.850
She sort of hung out
with Babbage for a while.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.330
She became very fascinated
with his machine,

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.620
in fact, obsessed with
the analytical engine

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.700
and wrote, of course, a
famous paper about it,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.525
which I'll talk about in a bit.

00:06:42.525 --> 00:06:44.230
However, this was
a very short comic.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:50.410
I should stress the original
comic was maybe four pages long

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.170
laid out.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.660
And of course, I
reached the end, which

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.600
is a really stupid ending,
said Babbage doesn't build

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.780
his machine and
Lovelace dies at 36

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.120
and it's 100 years before
there's another computer.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.125
So this was a real dead
end, unfortunately,

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:08.780
in computing history.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.984
I think I knocked this whole
comic out in an evening,

00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:14.150
and when I reached this
panel, it was about midnight

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.200
and I thought, ugh, I
can't end it like that.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.980
That's terrible.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.480
So I just threw in
as a joke this panel.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.050
I think I was aware of steampunk
as a thing that existed,

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.320
so I just threw them in fabulous
clothes and gave them ray guns

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.940
and resurrected them
briefly as a punchline.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.340
I think I was thinking
of "The Avengers."

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.690
It's uncanny.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.110
So I kind of threw the
comic up online on my blog

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.000
and went to bed, and then
when I woke the next morning,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.640
it was turning up
all over the internet

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.890
as, "This person is going to do
a comic in which Ada Lovelace

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.340
and Charles Babbage
fight crime."

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.090
It was a joke.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.680
I succumb easily
to peer pressure,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.570
and also, I was putting off
working on something else,

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.890
so I started drawing comics
about Ada Lovelace and Charles

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.504
Babbage fighting crime.

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.420
Anyone who's read the
comic will tell you this

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.410
is a very sporadic comic.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.340
They fight crime.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.710
They fight it quite badly.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.480
It's quite a silly
comic I should stress.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.164
Anyone expecting a very serious
comic about Victorian computing

00:08:35.164 --> 00:08:36.789
is going to be out
of luck because it's

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:41.200
quite silly, especially because
their chief enemies, of course,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.410
as they were in life, were
poetry and street music.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.660
Babbage's famous bugbear
was street music,

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.040
so that's his main
nemesis is the organist.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.970
Aside from silly comics,
if you look at the book,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.300
you will notice there's quite a
lot of words in it for a comic.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:10.410
This is because as I
was doing the blog,

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.860
I became very
obsessed with reading

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.890
all the wonderful
primary documents that

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.480
were turning up online.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.590
In a sense, the
footnotes are a joke

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.060
on Lovelace's
famous paper, which

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.390
you can see on Google Books.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.550
This is it as it
originally appeared.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.570
Lovelace wrote her paper.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:33.220
It began as a translation.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.000
Babbage himself
never wrote, never

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.690
published anything on his own
machine, or anything in detail,

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.460
and of course, women
did not normally

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.750
publish scientific papers.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.180
This was not something
that was done.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.100
However, there was
a space for women

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:54.460
to do translations as sort
of a ladylike accomplishment.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.000
So when this paper--
this is Menabrea.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.990
He eventually became
prime minister of Italy.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:06.210
At the time, he was a guy at a
conference where Babbage spoke

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.510
and described his machine.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.110
Menabrea took notes.

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.640
He published the
notes in French.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.850
A year later, Lovelace
translated the notes

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:18.340
from the French into the English
and begin adding footnotes

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.040
because as she read along.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.790
She herself was considered an
"expert" on Babbage's machine

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.022
at this time, mostly by
hanging out and continually

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:28.105
begging him for the plans.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.231
So she was known as someone
who knew a lot about it.

00:10:34.231 --> 00:10:36.230
That's why she was asked
to translate the paper.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.130
But as she went down
the translation,

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.250
she began to add
footnotes saying,

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.590
actually, I have a much
clearer illustration of this,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:51.440
or in fact, another way
to say this is this.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.490
A lot, I think to some
extent, she's actually

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.100
writing the footnotes to Babbage
because she often says things

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.960
like, "I don't know
if this has occurred

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.890
to the creator of the
calculating machine,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:04.900
but I have this idea about
how this could actually work."

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.400
And this is one of
those notes where

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.730
she says-- this is the first
appearance of general computing

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.690
theory-- "in enabling the
mechanism to combine together

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.910
general symbols in successions
of unlimited variety

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.850
and extent--" she goes on.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.200
She's Victorian,
so these sentences

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.390
get extremely lengthy.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.140
If you battle your way
through this paper,

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.740
you'll see it's not the most
readable thing in the world,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.986
but it is wonderful and it can
be found on Google Books, which

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:33.360
is my favorite
thing in the world

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.880
and which is why
I'm so delighted

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.500
always to speak to Google
because this entire comic would

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.220
not have been possible without
the incredible cornucopia

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.590
of amazing documents that were
poured out right around 2009

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.700
when I began comic.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.190
Google Books was
dumping, basically,

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:59.930
all this 19th century
ephemera online.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.200
I should stress again
I'm not a proper scholar.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.640
I'm just some random clown.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.180
But the great power
of Google Books

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.250
is that I don't have to go
through some specific place

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.240
in an archive and know
what I'm looking for.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.760
I can just type "Babbage
street music 1830-1870,"

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.290
and you would get
amazing amounts of stuff.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:22.981
This is what it
looks like in situ.

00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:26.800
"A Great Calculator, Anecdotes
of the Famous Problem Solver

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.962
Babbage."

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:29.920
I think the first thing
I was surprised to find

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.120
when I started my research
was how famous Babbage was.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.650
This was actually from
the Salt Lake City News,

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.270
and Babbage was famous enough
that the Salt Lake City

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.257
News would run some random
anecdotes about him.

00:12:46.257 --> 00:12:48.340
I also like this because
of the "Pocket cigar case

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:52.975
free to smokers of
Tansills Punch."

00:12:52.975 --> 00:12:54.350
This is a great
set of anecdotes.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:58.640
This is in the book, I
believe, and actually, they

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.430
come to some Lovelace
stuff in the end.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.080
I think she says, "Our family
is an alternate stratification

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:09.200
of poetry and mathematics"
along the line there.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.490
Also, to get a sense
of the Victorian era,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.930
"A clever woman is one whose
ability is never unpleasantly

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.110
felt by the rest of the world."

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.830
So I found just fantastic stuff.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.600
"This calculating machine was an
endless subject of monologue."

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.390
A lot of people remarked
on Babbage's tendency

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.545
to go on and on about
his calculating machine.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.035
What else?

00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:38.151
Of course, it wasn't only
Google that I found stuff in.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.650
The general method
of my approaching

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.720
the comic was I
would run around,

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.610
read a bunch of
primary documents,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.100
and then just riff on it,
basically, in a comic.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.380
This is from when Queen
Victoria's diaries were

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.970
digitized and put online.
so of course I immediately

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.839
searched Babbage,
who was, by the way,

00:13:55.839 --> 00:13:58.130
very obsessed with what other
people thought about him.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.620
He used to keep a scrapbook
with all of his news clippings

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.960
in it.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.730
And I like this.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.060
This is a classic
Babbage quotation.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.930
Lord M-- that's
Lord Melbourne-- has

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.930
said, "Babbage has made
a great fool of himself,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.890
as he does everywhere."

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.710
Poor old Babbage.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.930
He had many, many
fantastic talents,

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:22.110
but he did have some
issues socializing properly

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.890
with people.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.410
So that's Queen Victoria
on Charles Babbage.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.900
This is Babbage in Punch
on the Great Exhibition.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.660
He's very angry at
only being honorably

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.260
mentioned-- "Is that all?

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.620
Scandalous!"-- to go into
the Great Exhibition of 1851.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.070
He was very angry
that they didn't

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.290
put his calculating
machine in there.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.890
I think the feeling was
that people would not

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.590
understand what it
was, which I think

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.020
shows a sad underestimation
of the British public.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.100
I think people would have
thought it was great.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:59.800
I like this one, "Babbage, the
logarthmicetical Frankenstein."

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.100
That's from Google Books.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:07.490
There's a ton of primary
documents in the book,

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.840
probably too many, apparently.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.150
This is 1833, The
New York Mirror.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.980
You need good eyes
to read this one.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.870
"Oh fie.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.530
It is said that Ada Byron, sole
daughter of the noble bard,

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.580
is the most coarse and vulgar
woman in England," which

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.680
I do have her swear
a fair bit, so that's

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:34.890
sourced, if anyone's dubious
about the historical accuracy

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.480
of that.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.530
You'll notice these
wrong pop-ups here.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:39.740
That is also sourced.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.240
Babbage did, in fact,
invent an error pop-up

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.074
for the analytical
engine, believe it or not.

00:15:46.074 --> 00:15:47.990
"If any mistake had been
made by the attendant

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.270
and a wrong logarithm had
been accidentally given

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.650
to the engine, at
the proper place,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.430
you'd see a plate above the
logarithm with the word 'wrong'

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.260
engraved on it."

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.749
He later adds the continually
ringing loud bell,

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:01.915
which I'm sure would be
absolutely delightful if you

00:16:01.915 --> 00:16:03.498
were the attendant
trying to hunt down

00:16:03.498 --> 00:16:06.990
this error in this
gigantic machine.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.250
So this is Lovelace debugging
one of these error pop-ups

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.200
here with a crowbar, which
is the only way you can

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.550
debug the analytical engine.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.700
So this just my
joke on the subject.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.739
"Let's see how Lady
Lovelace is getting on."

00:16:23.739 --> 00:16:25.280
Some cartoon swears
which I won't say

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.571
because this is being recorded.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.820
"That's a special language
we're developing just

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.720
for the engine."

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.430
Babbage and Lovelace
were actually

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.900
both very funny people.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.460
People tended to remark
on them as being eccentric

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.082
and tell stories about
how strange they were.

00:16:43.082 --> 00:16:45.290
But amongst all the wonderful
things in Google Books,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.020
this is by far my favorite.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.855
This was a really magical
find that would only

00:16:49.855 --> 00:16:52.520
have been possible
with Google Books

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.390
because this is
from a thing called

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.640
the Southern Review, which
was a short lived journal

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.400
out of, I believe, Maryland.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:06.417
It was put out in
1867, this is from,

00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:08.000
"to celebrate the
culture of the South

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.420
in the wake of the Civil War."

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.099
It reads like a church circular.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.230
It's clippings from all sorts
of random stuff happening

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.369
around Maryland, generally
speaking, but one of them

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.440
is your basic letter
home to the folks

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.300
from the guy who took
a trip to Europe.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.340
This is Walter Reed, who is a
wonderful writer, by the way.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.930
He was actually
from Pennsylvania,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.660
an English professor
there, and he

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.320
writes by far the most
vivid description of Babbage

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.110
that I found from the period.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:44.440
This is actually a
letter from 1854.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.500
I don't know why.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.850
I guess they had some space to
fill in the old Southern Review

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.910
10 years later because I'm not
quite sure why they put it in.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.750
They put in the entire letter,
which is about 13 pages long.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.910
He meets several people,
but one of them is Babbage,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.720
and there's just
a magical section.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.880
This is about two years
after Lovelace had died,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.630
and we get here,
"After he got up to go,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.560
by some chance of conversation,
the late Lady Lovelace's name,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.350
Lord Byron's daughter
Ada, was mentioned.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.300
He knew her intimately
and spoke highly

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.780
of her mathematical powers
and of her peculiar capability

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.080
higher, he said, then that of
anyone he knew, to prepare,

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.300
I believe it was the
descriptions connected

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.680
with his calculating machine.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.810
I fear I'm not expressing
myself rightly here

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.959
as to the precise
nature of the subject."

00:18:30.959 --> 00:18:32.750
And I think he's talking
about the programs

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:37.170
here, the descriptions
of how the machine would

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.020
go through a problem.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.300
So this is something
that would not

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.490
have been found without
Google search, basically.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.130
If you were a Babbage
scholar, I can't

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.790
see any conceivable
reason you would

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.998
be reading through every
single issue of the Southern

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.960
Review, 1867.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.210
So thank you, Google.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.250
It's just a magical thing.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:07.200
The other stream
of research I took

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.500
was regarding the
analytical engine.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.165
In addition to all these
wonderful primary documents

00:19:13.165 --> 00:19:15.790
that are extremely evocative of
Babbage and Lovelace as people,

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.770
they are extremely
vivid personalities

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.490
and they write all
their own material.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.310
They come up with great gags for
themselves and great dialogue.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.340
But there's sort of a third
character in the comic,

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.340
and that was always
the analytical engine.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:36.920
As I said, I'm not
a computer person,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.190
so for me, when I tended
to draw the engine,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:45.530
it's this vast, building
sized labyrinth of confusion.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.070
People tend to get lost
and attacked in it.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.780
But I guess as I was
drawing the comic,

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.100
I began being really
frustrated by the fact

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:57.240
that pretty much every
book, even fairly

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.380
specialist books on the engine,
would, A, say it was exactly

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.760
like a modern computer but
it's too complicated for you

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.800
to understand it.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.650
And also, they wouldn't give me
a drawing of the engine, which

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.230
really, as a comic
artist, I want

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:20.337
to see a drawing of a huge
ass engine made of cogs.

00:20:20.337 --> 00:20:21.170
It's just eye candy.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.530
I had to actually
make one myself

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.247
so you can get a sense
of what this engine was.

00:20:31.247 --> 00:20:32.330
A lot of you are familiar.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.871
Sorry, this is my own video,
and I know I shot it like a noob

00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:37.800
in portrait.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.180
So this is the beautiful--
let me turn on the sound

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.112
because you have to hear it.

00:20:43.112 --> 00:20:47.060
This is the difference
engine that they've built

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.750
in Mountain View, California.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.361
This is them demonstrating
it for me, which

00:20:51.361 --> 00:20:52.580
was just wonderful of them.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.455
You can hear me oohing and
aahing like an idiot over it.

00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:02.559
Those beautiful arms at the
back are carrying the ones.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.500
So that's the difference engine.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.150
It's a huge machine and
it's incredibly beautiful

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.251
and incredibly
clever, but that's not

00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:17.000
the analytical engine.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.210
There's two machines of
Babbage, the difference engine

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.480
and the analytical engine.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:27.080
The difference engine
is essentially an adder.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.500
It really only adds.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.150
It adds in a very specific
way and a very clever way,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.610
but it can only add.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:39.140
Right around the early
1830s, pretty much

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:44.310
when Babbage met Lovelace,
he began to think,

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.070
what if you could
take the sum that

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.770
came out of one
end of the engine

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.120
and put it back
in the other end?

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.550
He described this as the
engine eating its own tail.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:22:01.620
So he devised a second
machine, the analytical engine.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:07.320
He didn't build either of
them, partly because it's just

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.310
really super hard.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.050
I think a lot of
people asked me,

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.570
why didn't Babbage build
the analytical engine?

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.290
It's actually really,
really, really hard

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:19.140
to build a giant computer
entirely made of cogs.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.470
It's not a disgrace
not to complete it.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.060
Babbage also kept
changing the plans.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.305
So this is the famous Plan 25.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.079
It's the most beautiful
and the most complete

00:22:32.079 --> 00:22:32.870
of Babbage's plans.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.970
This is from 1840, so
this is the machine

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:40.330
that Lovelace would have
been writing her paper about.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:46.110
So at first, as a comic
artist who is not very clever,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.570
I looked at this picture and
said, ooh, and then I said,

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.420
I have no idea what
I'm looking at here.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.610
So in order to draw
the machine accurately,

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.360
I had to basically
go in and start

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.350
doing elevations and hunt down
as many of Babbage's diagrams

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.860
as I could.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.750
It was by no means
straightforward to do

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:14.120
an image of this,
partly because Babbage

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.870
wasn't very good at showing
complete elevations.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:23.700
So this is very much an
interpretation of me,

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.096
but anyway, this is possibly
the first visualization

00:23:29.096 --> 00:23:29.970
of the entire engine.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.991
You may go "ooh" because
it took me forever.

00:23:37.991 --> 00:23:38.490
Thank you.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.147
Thank you very much.

00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:43.730
There's the punch
cards at the bottom.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.170
I'll actually show
you in animation

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.860
how I believe it works
because it's much clearer.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.330
There's a lot going on.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.300
Basically, you have storage
going down the back here.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.880
This is a whole line of gears.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.380
For Babbage, this
machine was exclusively

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.730
a machine for doing arithmetic.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.150
The entire bulk of this
thing is numerical.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:11.790
So each of these columns
represent a number

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.060
with 50 decimal places.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.120
So each little gear has a number
from one to 10, its decimal,

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:18.920
on it.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.160
So you set this to 5,
this to 2, and then

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.200
you have 25, this
to 3, you have 325.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.600
So it just goes up.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.140
And so if you have a
column of 50 gears,

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.540
it's a column of a number
of 50 decimal places.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.270
50 is a lot of decimal places.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:38.970
Babbage said himself that
the reason he put in so many

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.880
is that he thought
that should "be

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.400
sufficient for all future
purposes of science."

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.080
That's Babbage all over for you.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.370
So here's the three
types of punch cards

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:53.800
that I'll go through
in a bit, barrels.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.105
I should say I think the
machine was probably actually

00:24:57.105 --> 00:24:59.770
a bit taller than this.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:02.240
Cats for scale.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.310
I think also it's very likely
it could have been freestanding.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.030
I think you would
have had to have

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.950
enmeshed the entire
thing in an enormous cage

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.790
to keep it stable.

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:18.030
The whole machine is based
around numerical gears that

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.745
turn around and they have
locks to hold it in place,

00:25:20.745 --> 00:25:23.610
and if the lock hits
a tooth at any point

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:27.400
in this gigantic machine,
the whole thing will freeze.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.040
So absolutely nothing
can be out of alignment

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.060
by so much as a
couple of millimeters,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.630
so stability would be
a big, big, big issue

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:35.620
with this machine.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.370
Although, that said,
the difference engine

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.880
works on that same principle,
and generally speaking,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.662
it hardly ever crashes ever.

00:25:43.662 --> 00:25:45.566
AUDIENCE: Do replicas
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:48.192 --> 00:25:48.900
SYDNEY PADUA: No.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.510
They think there are only 20,
so you have a little more space

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.010
for error in those.

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:00.330
So that's the analytical engine.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.850
So in the book, without
the power of animation,

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.710
this is the plan I did.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:10.600
It's actually quite a bit
more clear in animation.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.550
I had a great
advantage in building

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.760
these diagrams in that I
am a computer animator,

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.510
so I work on this
thing all day long.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:21.870
So this is a simplification.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.700
This is sort of a
cartoon engine version

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.430
that's stripped down,
partly because it's

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.820
really difficult to see
what's going on when you have

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.810
the whole thing in,
and also, it's so huge,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.690
so you have helpfully labeled
the layer "whole thing."

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.960
It's so huge my
machine really starts

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.860
to struggle once you
put in all those gears,

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:46.610
but it's just decimal places.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.370
So this is actually just a
slice, and each slice going up

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.170
is exactly the
same, so you don't

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.090
need all those 50 to understand
the information flow.

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.485
So here's your engine.

00:26:56.485 --> 00:26:58.360
I'm assuming you guys
are interested in this,

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.361
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.135
Some people start
to glaze over, but I

00:27:05.135 --> 00:27:08.910
thought Google would
probably be into it.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:13.110
So just so I can explain here,
basically, the red colors

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.885
indicate the driver and
the greens are passive.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.240
So the first thing that
activates is the number card,

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.370
and that will be a card
with each 50 decimal number

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.580
in holes, basically, or
rather, a lack of holes.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.180
The way these punch
card things work,

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.930
so you have a whole
arrangement of levers,

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:39.200
each lined up to all the holes.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.930
You'll have a hole
pretty much everywhere

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.070
except for one point.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.457
So as the card is pushed over
the levers, if there's holes,

00:27:47.457 --> 00:27:49.290
it just goes right
through, nothing happens,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.180
but if there's no
hole, then the card

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.070
will push the lever at that
corresponding position,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.330
so that's how the
punch cards work.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:28:00.510
So that will basically
select a bunch of levers,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.170
50 of them-- I
haven't animated 50

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:03.586
because that was
just way too much

00:28:03.586 --> 00:28:07.750
work-- and that sends
it to an address

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.490
on the store The address
is on the card as well.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.900
Babbage has an
addressing system.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.170
The machine is an incredibly
beautiful and incredibly clever

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.530
thing, and really
shockingly like a computer.

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.540
This is the store.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:22.390
This is short.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.160
The store would have gone
on into the distance.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.200
Babbage said maybe 100,
maybe 1,000, maybe 5,000.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.420
Everyone wants more
storage, obviously.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.000
You'd run into a problem
because the entire way

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.420
that these read-- so it reads
one number onto the store,

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.990
and then reads the second
number into the store,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:48.560
so that's the two
storage positions.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.420
Now, this is the
operations card.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.130
I should say I'm slightly fuzzy
as to the order of events.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.910
I think the operation
card is next

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.030
but it might be the address,
but it doesn't actually matter.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:04.750
The operations cards
are amazingly clever.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.020
They were quite small cards.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:12.760
A single hole would then
rotate these barrels

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.220
to a certain position.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.450
There's actually
three sets of barrels,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.950
and each of the barrels has
50 or 80 rows of pegs around.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.870
So a single hole in
an operations card

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.840
could activate dozens
and dozens of levers,

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.600
which is what you need
to run an operation.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.620
The machine could do
basically four things.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.990
It could add, subtract,
multiply, divide.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:36.520
Any more complicated
mathematical thing

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.020
you did, you would have to be
very clever in the programming

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:43.986
end, break it down into
those four operations,

00:29:43.986 --> 00:29:45.235
run it down a string of cards.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.100
So all those levers are
activated, and what they do

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.350
is they then engage
all the levers

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.582
at one of these sections.

00:29:56.582 --> 00:29:58.290
Basically, each of
these little sections,

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.320
this is just a cartoon version.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.490
All these little sections
are beautifully worked out

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.265
and extremely complicated.

00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:06.640
But each of these
little sections

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.585
does a specific thing,
adding or carrying ones.

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:12.960
If you were
multiplying a number,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.840
it would break it up into
multiply by 1, multiply by 2,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.070
multiply by 3, into all
these sections for speed.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.530
So it basically
engages that section

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.860
so it's all ready to go.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.830
Then the variable card, which
is the third kind of card,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.540
this is the addressing
system, basically.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:35.790
It then says, OK, pick up
from address number one,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:37.600
engages the rack.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.280
The rack slides
off into what you

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.930
call the ingress axis, which
is this one at the front here.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:45.910
Sorry.

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.890
I'm pointing, which
you can't see.

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.640
So this is the
position in the store,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.545
so it actively reads out to
the passive ingress axis.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.984
Then that engages the big
central wheel possibly.

00:30:58.984 --> 00:31:01.150
I mean, this is all much
more complicated, actually.

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.390
There's way more bits
than I'm showing here.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.880
And then this becomes
active and reads the number

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.576
off into whatever section
has been indicated,

00:31:12.576 --> 00:31:13.575
reads the second number.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.340
So now it's got both numbers,
and then it does a thing,

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.990
basically.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.800
Each of these little bits
is very, very specialized

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:29.650
for a specific
arithmetical thing.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.630
You'll notice the barrels
are turning around.

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.260
The barrel would
have, basically,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.090
a little program
in wedges around.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.740
So once you set it up
with one operations card,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:40.925
then it runs through a
little micro program.

00:31:40.925 --> 00:31:45.470
[MECHANICAL SOUND] That's
my scientific sound

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.650
that it would make.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:51.650
So once it's done, hooks back
up so that now it's ready to go.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:52.857
The number is processed.

00:31:52.857 --> 00:31:54.190
So it's taken those two numbers.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.981
It could only work on
two numbers at a time

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:58.990
and spit out a result.
So it takes that number,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.080
hooks up to the output.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.050
The output hooks up
to the variable card

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:09.060
to take the address that it's
supposed to read out to you

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.230
and then reads out.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:15.410
So now you have the
results on the store,

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.910
and that will animate for you.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.784
Now you understand how
everything's going on.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.799
It runs in cycles
like a computer.

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.215
They're just way,
way, way slower.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.630
Multiplication might
take a few minutes

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.890
to run because it's got to go
through over and over again.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:38.500
I don't know much
about computers.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.500
I probably know more about
the analytical engine

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.583
and how it works than a
computer and how it works,

00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:46.040
but it is remarkably
computer like and it's

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.820
incredibly detailed.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.030
This is not an abstract concept.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:54.030
Babbage left extremely detailed
plans for all these levers.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.980
He thought through all the
timing, all the weights

00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.470
and all that stuff.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.780
And there is, in fact, I
should give a plug to Plan 28.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.580
If you go to plan28.org,
there's some crazy folks

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.800
who are trying to get one
built in reality like they've

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.810
built the difference engine.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:15.940
So that's the analytical
engine and a bunch

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:20.582
of primary documents and
my comic, and that's it.

00:33:20.582 --> 00:33:21.568
Thank you.

00:33:21.568 --> 00:33:27.689
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:27.689 --> 00:33:29.480
I think we have a few
minutes for questions

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.599
if anyone has any questions.

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:34.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.015
So you said there would
be one layer of these

00:33:36.015 --> 00:33:39.176
for every digit
of the 50 digits.

00:33:39.176 --> 00:33:41.690
Do you know how the carry
system worked between layers?

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.440
SYDNEY PADUA: Yes.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.740
Actually, I put a
video on YouTube up

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.021
and it took me nine minutes to
explain the analytical engine

00:33:52.021 --> 00:33:52.520
carry.

00:33:58.977 --> 00:34:00.060
I guess I could put it up.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.080
I could bring up that
file and explain it.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:09.219
He basically uses a very,
very ingenious system.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.949
The carry arms, the
spiral ones that

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:12.719
go up the back of the
difference engine,

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:15.120
Babbage discarded those
because they were too slow.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:19.969
They cost 10 imaginary seconds
off his imaginary machine.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:23.286
So he devised-- and this
was by far his favorite part

00:34:23.286 --> 00:34:25.639
of the engine was
the ones mechanism,

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:27.719
so he would be absolutely
thrilled that someone

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:28.760
was asking that question.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.670
In his autobiography,
he says, this

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.630
is by far the most
important part of the engine

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.020
is the system for
carrying the ones.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:43.510
Basically, he had a little
peg on the nine on each gear.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.580
So as it came around,
if there was a peg--

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:49.400
it's really hard to explain.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.260
If there's a peg and a
peg below for a carry,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:58.480
it would lift two carries
onto the next gear.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.730
It's super hard to explain,
but if you come up after,

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.810
I'll show you the
animation, and everyone

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.390
who's into it can see it,
which is probably everybody,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.430
actually.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:08.970
It does take awhile to explain
because it's quite fiddly,

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:13.120
but he had it all
worked out, for sure.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.130
AUDIENCE: You may have implied
an answer to this question,

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:20.410
but it sounds like you do have
YouTube videos with things

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:24.767
like this explaining
all the parts as well?

00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:26.350
SYDNEY PADUA: Yeah,
I've got a couple.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.370
The carry one is
the most complete.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:35.447
This one I'll put up
shortly with an explanation.

00:35:35.447 --> 00:35:37.780
I just have the animation
with no explanation right now.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.550
AUDIENCE: So you said that
the operations it could do

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.100
did the four fundamental
arithmetic operations.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.170
It actually divides?

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:47.920
SYDNEY PADUA: Yes.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.540
AUDIENCE: Wow, because
division is arithmetically

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.270
a far more complicated
operation to do,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.610
and modern CPUs devote
an inordinate number

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:58.630
of transistors to
division alone.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.057
So how is division
implemented here?

00:36:01.057 --> 00:36:02.848
SYDNEY PADUA: You're
asking me to explain--

00:36:02.848 --> 00:36:05.250
and actually, division is
the one I'm fuzziest on.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.410
I haven't built it yet.

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:11.290
Basically, it's unwinding
it, if that makes sense.

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:15.270
So to multiply, it's
winding around and around

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.880
and it's got accumulators,
and to divide, it

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.980
unwinds by the divisor.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.000
It breaks up the
divisor into units

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.090
and then unwinds
it unit by unit.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.070
It's quite complicated and,
like everything Babbage did,

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:33.052
it's very, very clever but
quite Rube Goldbergian.

00:36:33.052 --> 00:36:34.510
AUDIENCE: Seems
like you could just

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:35.968
go through and
stamp on every part,

00:36:35.968 --> 00:36:37.985
"This part is quite clever."

00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:41.170
SYDNEY PADUA: He was so clever.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.450
AUDIENCE: So Ada
Lovelace famously

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:47.640
wrote programs for this device.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.370
Were her programs
strictly mathematical?

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.620
Was she calculating logarithms
and that sort of thing,

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.130
or was there any approach
towards the more general

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.310
computation?

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:03.310
SYDNEY PADUA: Lovelace's
paper has a bunch of programs.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:08.510
Most of them are quite short and
were Babbage's little tiny work

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.100
outs.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.496
There's a huge fold out one,
the Bernoulli numbers one, that

00:37:13.496 --> 00:37:14.620
demonstrates all the loops.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.920
This machine can
loop, by the way.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.586
It can instruct itself
to go background.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.560
Those programs are all
strictly mathematical,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.800
and Babbage for sure
only saw the machine

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.107
as for doing
specifically arithmetic.

00:37:31.107 --> 00:37:32.440
AUDIENCE: So no Minecraft, then?

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.148
SYDNEY PADUA: No.

00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:42.960
It was Lovelace who looked
at the machine and said,

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.950
actually, with the new
developments in logic--

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.180
this was before [INAUDIBLE]
by about 10 years,

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.920
but she was a student
of Augustus De

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.950
Morgan, who was trying to
find this way of mathematizing

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:56.400
logic.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:00.510
So she looked at it, said,
with these levers and pegs,

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.590
you could in theory turn this
into a logic machine, not

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.540
an arithmetic machine.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.690
And her example was
music theory, which

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:12.010
is probably way in advance.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:16.270
But she said if you could
take the rules of music theory

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.890
and find a way to express them
into-- she didn't use the word

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.850
program, but into a set
of rules for the machine,

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:25.760
the machine could in
theory compose music,

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:29.310
"scientific music," she
said, of any extent.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:36.390
But no, we don't have,
unfortunately, any experiments

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.870
in that direction from her.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.780
And I think to actually do that
sort of thing with the machine,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.410
you'd have to redesign
the whole thing

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.090
because the enormous bulk
of it is really, really,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:53.070
very, very specialized
to arithmetical bits.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:57.180
AUDIENCE: So I'm
really blown away

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.610
by the extent to which you got
your head into the workings

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:02.570
of this machine.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:05.600
I also expect you got your head
into the workings of Charles

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.170
Babbage and Lovelace personally.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:13.210
Can you talk to me a
little bit about how

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:16.150
you came to grips with what
motivates them as people

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.140
and to what extent
you personally

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.360
identified with them in the
process of doing all that work?

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.360
SYDNEY PADUA: They
both definitely

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:38.600
became incredibly
absorbed with this machine

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.160
and what it could do.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.580
In terms of what drove
them, it's hard to say.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.080
I mean, I think once you
see how it could work,

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.310
especially if you're Charles
Babbage with this brain that

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.010
can see all these possibilities
and that can see the machine.

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:01.910
I guess, what you call his
spatial reasoning skills must

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.990
have been remarkable.

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:09.900
It drove him nuts that something
he could see so clearly

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.927
wasn't actually
happening, so he became

00:40:11.927 --> 00:40:13.510
obsessed with solving
all the problems

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:16.630
and he kept solving the
problems past the point

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.885
that the problems were so many
decades away from existing.

00:40:19.885 --> 00:40:23.670
You're like, Babbage, stop.

00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:26.640
The carrying mechanism
is classic Babbage

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.462
in that he had a
carrying mechanism

00:40:28.462 --> 00:40:30.170
design that worked,
the difference engine

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.630
one, but if it was too slow.

00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:36.140
It couldn't look ahead.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.250
It had to feel
out one at a time.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:39.100
And he spent a year.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.900
He says in his autobiography,
he spent an entire year

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.560
shaving these imaginary
seconds off of this machine.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.570
So for him, it was definitely
solving all these problems

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.290
and getting the perfect machine.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.500
For Lovelace, as always,
she's a lot murkier

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.680
and more complicated.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:03.500
In the comics, she can be the
Batman-esque, angst ridden one.

00:41:07.755 --> 00:41:09.630
She actually wrote in
a letter to her mother,

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.500
it was a bit weird.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.330
Obviously, her father's
legacy as a genius,

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:22.150
but also as a genius who
had brought basically

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:27.020
sex and danger
into the world, she

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.330
said to herself that she felt
she should redeem her father's

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:36.710
legacy by finding a way to unify
poetry and mathematics, which

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.740
is an extraordinarily strange
thing but an extraordinarily

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.450
marvelous thing to say.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:45.380
She said she wanted to create
a poetical science, which

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.260
in a way, if you think
about it, programming

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.120
is sort of a poetical science.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.230
It's a unifying of
metaphor and logic

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:55.910
in a way that's very beautiful.

00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:02.180
So for her, she felt that
she had this dark legacy

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.595
that she had to redeem.

00:42:04.595 --> 00:42:06.470
And in terms of
identification, I don't know.

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.970
I could never have come up
with this in 15 million years.

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:13.070
I'm not a super genius, and I
really felt that every second,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.550
looking at this machine, and
also at Lovelace's paper.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.880
To make the leap from this
before, again, as I say,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.860
logic at the time was still
basically Aristotelian

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.030
in terms of sentences
and syllogisms.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:31.070
To look at this machine
and say, there's

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.140
got to be a way to make
logic this perfect and this

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.910
machine-like, and then this
machine could compose music.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.640
I mean, it's just a
completely extraordinary feat

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.530
of imagination to see
that in the machine.

00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:48.820
I'm just completely blown
away by their genius

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.940
and I'm humbled by it.

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.190
Does that answer the question?

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:59.300
AUDIENCE: So in my
reading about this,

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.930
I stumbled on
something about I think

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.180
they were a pair
of Swedish brothers

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:09.030
that actually commercially
made several difference engines

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.240
and had customers for them.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.760
Did you stumble on that as well?

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:14.680
I don't remember their names.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.700
SYDNEY PADUA: Scheutz.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.074
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's right.

00:43:17.074 --> 00:43:19.574
SYDNEY PADUA: I'm not sure if
I've ever heard it pronounced.

00:43:19.574 --> 00:43:20.550
I think it's "Shoots."

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.910
They were Swedish.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:29.240
And actually, I was delighted
to see some Swedish comics blog

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.634
pop up when the book came
out saying, as we all know,

00:43:31.634 --> 00:43:33.050
the difference
engine was actually

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.890
built by the famous Swedes,
the Scheutz brothers.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.700
Everyone has their own national
history in the computer.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.790
Yeah, they built
their own machine off

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:46.660
of Babbage's
arithmetic, basically,

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:50.050
this method of differences, but
they had a completely different

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:50.845
mechanical system.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.675
When I saw one at
the science museum,

00:43:56.675 --> 00:43:59.050
I thought it was a model
because it's a tenth of the size

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:02.380
or less than Babbage's engine.

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.570
There is, in fact, a beautiful
video of it on YouTube.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:07.987
If you look up "Scheutz
difference engine,"

00:44:07.987 --> 00:44:10.070
it'll come up, because I
think the Smithsonian has

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.780
one that they run
every once in awhile.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.340
It's an absolutely
delightful little machine.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.450
But as it turned
out, nobody really

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.570
needed a difference
engine after all,

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:23.280
so I don't think they
made any fortune off

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.380
of it, unfortunately.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.470
AUDIENCE: I think I
heard they did three.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.300
SYDNEY PADUA: Yeah.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:32.110
I guess the Astronomical
Lab in the US bought one,

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.590
and there was one in
England and one in Sweden,

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.760
I guess, and everyone
was like, oh actually,

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.660
these aren't that useful.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.840
It's quite sad, actually.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.820
AUDIENCE: I recall a
reference early in the book,

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.280
it was a passing reference,
it must have been a footnote,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.700
that mathematics would
not only probably

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.950
be too rigorous for
the spirit of a woman,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.970
but also her
constitution, which seems,

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.680
obviously, odd to modern ears.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:08.280
How many women mathematicians
were there at the time?

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.280
Lovelace seems to have been
fairly well accepted as one,

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.510
but was it, in fact,
an anomaly for there

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:16.105
to be a woman mathematician?

00:45:16.105 --> 00:45:19.950
Was she seen of
some sort of oddity?

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:22.450
SYDNEY PADUA: I mean, people
tend to see it as cute,

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.550
to be honest.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.720
They tend to write, oh,
isn't that adorable, a woman

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.180
trying to do mathematics?

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:34.860
The letter about mathematics
damaging a woman's constitution

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:39.800
is actually from Augustus De
Morgan, who wrote to her mother

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.300
twice, apparently, saying,
I'm very, very concerned

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.990
because Lady Lovelace has
as much mathematical power

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.180
as would challenge the
constitution of a man,

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.140
and somehow he felt
that it was over

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.120
clocked for a woman's body.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.820
I mean, this was actually
a very common idea.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.490
He gave me some
great comic dialogue.

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:06.200
He said, "Soon, the struggle
between body and mind

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.010
will begin."

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:12.410
It's actually incredibly sad
and ironic because the idea was

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:17.200
that mathematics, this excessive
use of that part of the brain,

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.260
would specifically
damage women's wombs,

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:25.340
and Lovelace did, in fact,
die of uterine cancer.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:28.050
I can't find anyone
using that as proof.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.030
I'm sure somebody
somewhere said, I told you.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:38.780
And actually, Lovelace's
mentor was Mary Somerville,

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.070
after whom Somerville
College in Oxford is named.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.199
She did all these very
complicated translations

00:46:43.199 --> 00:46:45.240
of works from the continent,
and Lovelace is very

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.510
definitely modeling
herself on Somerville

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:52.180
in doing the translation of
the analytical engine paper.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:55.024
But Somerville had
to study in secret

00:46:55.024 --> 00:46:56.565
because her parents
thought she would

00:46:56.565 --> 00:46:59.680
hurt herself studying math.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.490
I think her first husband didn't
agree with her studying math,

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:04.660
so she wrote her first
mathematics books

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.780
when she was 45 when he died.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.490
That's when she got
her first freedom.

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.660
So no, it was
very, very unusual.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.740
Lovelace is kind of at
the end of that era.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.700
They started to have
women's programs in college

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.120
in the 1870s, 1880s,
and I think that's when

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.554
it started to turn around.

00:47:25.554 --> 00:47:28.220
AUDIENCE: So I want to thank you
for all the amazing work you've

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.300
done, the great comic and
the really beautiful book,

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.930
but I've got to wonder,
where are you heading now?

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.510
You said that you were
ambushed by the comic.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.694
Is there still going
to be a comic, I hope?

00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:44.360
SYDNEY PADUA: I get
this question a lot.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.010
Actually, I have not quit
the proverbial day job.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:55.240
I still work as an animator,
which is quite all consuming

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.320
work when it's on.

00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:59.930
I definitely have a bunch
more comics I'm dying to do.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.110
I've got a ton of sketches,
so when work dies down a bit,

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:05.250
I'll be cracking on, for sure.

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.510
AUDIENCE: My understanding
is that there

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.640
was a couple of critical
problems, maybe just one, that

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.010
needed the difference engine.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.780
Back when Babbage was born,
"computer" was a job title.

00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.390
They were the people who
manually computed tables

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.300
of logarithms and they
were full of errors,

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.890
and this led to things
like ships sinking.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.550
It may just be that one
difference engine was

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.320
enough to solve that
problem and there

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.450
weren't any other problems.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.510
SYDNEY PADUA: Yeah.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.220
This was Babbage's thing.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:40.860
The difference engine
wasn't supposed

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.550
to solve a specific calculation.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:44.760
It was supposed to print
out these big tables.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.930
What would happen is you'd
have these giant books

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.680
of every iteration of a problem,
and then when you were at sea

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.820
without your difference engine
or in your accountant's office

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.800
or whatever, you would
just go to volume 15

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.590
and pull it up and look up
that one little iteration.

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:07.010
But Babbage himself actually
supervised this production

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:11.070
of these beautifully triple
checked, error free logarithm

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:13.110
tables, after which you
don't need it anymore

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:16.240
because they're all done.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.640
The difference engine
was redundant by the time

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.740
those tables were printed.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.345
I think for him, it was
more of an art object maybe.

00:49:26.345 --> 00:49:29.590
He used to throw a lot of stuff
around about all the problems

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.110
it could solve, but he was
really more into just building

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.380
the engine itself, I think.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.440
AUDIENCE: What's happening to
your originals from the buck?

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.815
SYDNEY PADUA:
There are, in fact,

00:49:38.815 --> 00:49:40.090
no originals from the book.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:44.300
It's completely drawn in
Photoshop, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:48.805
So it's a virtual comic,
computer generated.

00:49:48.805 --> 00:49:50.430
AUDIENCE: So if the
point of the engine

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:56.200
was to produce tables of
numbers without errors

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:01.090
and he had 50 decimal
digits of precision,

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.510
did he ever work
out how many volumes

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.660
were going to be required
to print that out?

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:09.510
SYDNEY PADUA: I am
quite sure he did.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.466
Babbage loved working
stuff like that out.

00:50:12.466 --> 00:50:13.840
So I can't tell
you specifically,

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.010
but I will tell you if
it involves working out

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.740
