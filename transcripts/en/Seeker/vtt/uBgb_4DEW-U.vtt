Does Your Bottled Water Come From a Drought
Zone? by Matt Lieberman

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.200
This DNews episode is brought to you by Domain.com.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.529
Do you know where your bottled water comes
from? If the answer makes you cry, bottle

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.509
the tears. We’re going to need them.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.500
Hey everyone, this is Matt Lieberman guest
hosting for DNews. Bottled water. We know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.369
we shouldn’t drink it because of the waste
that the bottles can cause, but it’s right

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.910
there and it’s oh-so convenient. But did
you know that a sizeable majority of bottled

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.529
water in the U.S. comes from California, a
state currently experiencing its third driest

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.320
year ever? ...Ever?

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.050
Now bottled water tends to fall into two categories:
Spring water, such as Crystal Geyser or Arrowhead,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.790
which is groundwater that, according to the
EPA, is collected “at the point where water

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.420
flows naturally to the earth’s surface or
from a borehole that taps into the underground

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.000
source”. This accounts for approximately
55 percent of bottled water in the United

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.460
States. The other 45 percent is Purified Water,
such as Aquafina or Dasani, which comes from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.410
the municipal water supply. Put simply, it’s
Tap Water!

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.930
Now, I must stress that the amount of water
sucked up in California by bottling companies,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.160
like the four I just mentioned, is just a
drop in the bucket compared to the amount

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.400
of water used for the production of food and
beverages, or for agriculture, which is responsible

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.670
for roughly 80% of California’s water supply.
But still, we have to wonder: Why are we bottling

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.070
water and shipping it out of a state that
deeply, deeply needs it?

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.000
Well, two reasons spring to mind. First and
foremost, California is where these companies

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.340
have been based for a long time. For example,
Arrowhead has been bottling California’s

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.040
water since long before plastic bottles were
the norm, about 120 years. The other major

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.450
reason? California is the only western state
without any form of groundwater regulation

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.780
or management. Basically, if you drill into
the earth, anywhere in California, and find

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.570
water, it’s your property. No muss, no fuss,
no environmental responsibility.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.409
One more fun fact about bottled water: Companies
are not required to reveal where their sources

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.960
are or how much water is bottled and shipped
from their facilities. For example, only about

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.170
33 percent of Poland Spring’s bottled water
comes from Maine’s actual Poland Spring.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.329
No one is sure where the rest is sourced from.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.360
But I guess the biggest reason that bottling
companies are using water from drought zones

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.729
like California is that demand is high enough
that to them, it’s a necessity. According

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.009
to the International Bottled Water Association,
the United States bottling industry produced

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.550
10 billion gallons of water in 2012, and sales
reached as high as 12 billion dollars. Maybe

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.280
it’s time we started using our own faucet.
I mean, we might be buying the same water

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.760
anyway. Hmm. Now we want to hear from you:
What can we do to curb our use of water from

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.930
drought zones? Is legislation an option, or
are we on our own?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.670
