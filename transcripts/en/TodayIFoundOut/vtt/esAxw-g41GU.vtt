00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.349
Few occupations from history are as maligned
as that of Medieval-era executioner.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.730
Popularly painted as gleeful dispensers of
death and torture, the truth seems to be that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.920
many executioners throughout this period usually
treated the occupation with a certain reverence

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.140
and exhibited an extreme dedication to duty.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.949
Beyond trying to minimize the suffering of
those slated to be executed, this was, among

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.070
other reasons we’ll get into, because it
would often mean the life of the executioner

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.810
if they ever botched an execution or otherwise
weren’t extremely professional in carrying

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.810
out their job.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.710
So, moving beyond any Hollywood depictions,
what was it actually like to be an executioner

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.070
in the ballpark of Medieval times and how
did someone get the job in the first place?

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.890
A thing to note before we continue is that
the duties expected of and performed by executioners,

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.000
as well as what life was like for specific
executioners, has varied wildly across time

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and regions.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.210
For example, as we’ve talked before, those
condemned to death in the Ottoman empire during

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.390
the 18th century could potentially get off
scot-free by challenging the executioner to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.390
a footrace.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.390
In this case, in addition to doling out lethal
justice with their bare hands, executioners

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.780
also worked as both bodyguards and gardeners.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.030
That caveat out of the way, how did one become
an executioner in the first place?

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.130
It turns out that many European Medieval executioners
were former criminals themselves.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.680
You see, for reasons we’ll get into shortly,
the role of executioner was so unpopular that

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.979
finding someone to do the job often required
either forcing someone into the profession

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.880
or offering the gig to someone who was slated
to be executed themselves.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.369
Scandinavian countries were known to make
extensive use of this novel hiring practice,

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.330
with a little twist thrown in- they’d maim
executioners by cutting off one or both of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.380
their ears so that they could be easily identified
by the public.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.869
It also wasn’t uncommon for people made
executioners in this way to be branded somewhere

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.829
on their head, once again for the purpose
of their new profession being, in this case

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.310
literally, written all over their face.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.610
For example, as noted in Hugo Mathiessen’s
Boddel og Galgefugl,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.010
In the year 1470, a poor thief stood at the
foot of the gallows in the Swedish town Arboga

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.790
and was waiting to be hanged.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.120
The public attending the spectacle had pity
on the sinner and when he, to save his neck,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.720
offered to become executioner in the town,
it was agreed.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.620
He was pardoned and the red-hot iron was used
to brand his body with both thief and executioner

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.620
mark.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.820
In Germany, on the other hand, as author Joel
Harrington notes in a discussion of his book,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.459
The Faithful Executioner: Life and Death,
Honor and Shame in the Turbulent Sixteenth

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.610
Century, while “standing executioners on
salary were the norm” throughout Germany

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.130
during the 1600s, for many centuries prior
to this it was commonplace to thrust role

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.400
of executioner upon a victim’s oldest male
relative.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.970
This all brings us around to why so many avoided
the profession like the plague.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.150
To begin with, the general consensus among
most was that in taking such a job, one was

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.400
then sure to be damned in the afterlife.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.829
This was despite the fact that in some regions,
such as France, executioners were by official

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.750
church decree absolved of the sins committed
while performing their duties.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.700
This still didn’t stop the general public
from considering executioners unclean, leading

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.360
to the more practical problem with the job-
nearly being completely ostracized from society.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.210
Coming back to those condemned to die instead
becoming an executioner, people seem to have

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:46.160
been perfectly fine with this as the criminal’s
life would still be forfeit, just in a more

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.440
metaphorical sense.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.840
For example, throughout Medieval Europe executioners
were often forced to live in houses outside

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.690
of the city or town they plied their trade
in.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.750
In cases where this wasn’t possible, they
tended to live near things like public latrines,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.030
lepertoriums, or brothels.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.889
Executioners were similarly often denied citizenship
to the towns and cities they served (and thus

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.419
had few rights in the town) and were largely
barred from holding office or even entering

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:14.590
churches, pubs, bathhouses, etc- basically
most public establishments were off limits

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.979
to the executioner.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.919
Thus, despite executioners being deemed critical
for a society to remain civilised, they were

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.830
paradoxically generally forced to live apart
from that civilised society.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.870
In fact, some places across Europe went as
far to institute laws specifically targeting

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.580
executioners and what they could and could
not do in their day to day lives.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.120
For example, the Bavarian town of Memmingen
enacted an ordinance in 1528 that forbade

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.650
members of the general public dining with
an executioner.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.370
Such laws and just general attitudes effectively
limited the people an executioner could interact

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.639
with in their day to day lives to their own
family and those from the criminal underworld

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.460
who simply didn’t care that the executioner
was unclean.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.270
On top of this, an executioner’s children
and spouse were likewise similarly shunned

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.150
by anyone but the underbelly of society.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.860
This, combined with the fact that the children
of executioners could usually only find mates

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.860
with children of other executioners, understandably
led to the role of executioner becoming a

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.000
macabre family trade that resulted in executioner
dynasties that spanned centuries.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.979
Beyond being ostrosised and damning your progeny
to a similar life, as well as an afterlife

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.719
full of hellfire, while there were potentially
ways for an executioner to make a killing

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.670
within the profession, it turns out for most
there simply weren’t enough executions themselves

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.670
to make ends meet.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.400
Alternate work was limited to jobs nobody
else wanted.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.039
This included all manner of things, from disposal
of corpses (animal and human), emptying cesspools,

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.939
collecting taxes from the diseased and prostitutes,
etc.

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:49.590
Oddly, at least from a modern perspective,
another common profession for a well trained

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.330
executioner was that of a doctor and surgeon.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.099
You see, beyond executing people, another
thing executioners were often called to do

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.050
was torture people for various reasons.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.360
These two things, combined with the close-knit
community of executioners sharing their knowledge

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.919
amongst themselves, resulted in lifelong executioners
generally having exceptional knowledge of

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.919
human anatomy, and thus they were commonly
called on to treat various medical maladies.

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.250
In fact, one rather famous 17th century German
executioner, Frantz Schmidt, noted in his

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.569
journal that over the course of his near five
decade career he had over 15,000 people he

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:29.370
treated as a doctor, while executing only
394 and disfiguring or otherwise torturing

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.930
or flogging roughly the same number- meaning
most of the time he functioned as a doctor,

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.439
despite society at the time considering him
an executioner.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.629
Schmidt was one of those thrust into the profession
as his father was strong-armed into becoming

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.479
an executioner, condemning Schmidt to the
same life once he came of age, though Schmidt’s

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:49.729
story has something of a happy ending.

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:53.639
Like many executioners, Schmidt was given
a wide berth by the public in his day-to-day

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.979
life, but the incredible professionalism with
which he conducted his grisly duties earned

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:02.199
him the begrudging respect of both the general
public and those in power.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.779
In his later years, Schmidt was able to parlay
this into a meeting with Nuremberg authorities

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:12.240
and then was able to appeal to Emperor Ferdinand
II himself, with the goal of restoring his

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.380
family honor.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.909
Swayed by not just Schmidt’s words, but
also letters from city council members and

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.610
other notable people extolling Schmidt’s
character and dedication to his duty, the

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.949
then 70 year old executioner was granted both
Nuremberg citizenship and had his family name

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:31.509
cleared, allowing his progeny to escape the
bloody spectre of his work.

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.770
Of course, being ultra-professional with the
profession was something of a necessity for

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.790
Schmidt as, at the time in Germany, there
was a law stipulating that any executioner

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.430
tasked with doling out death by the sword
(a form of execution largely reserved for

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.629
especially important individuals) who took
more than three swings to behead a victim

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:50.900
would be condemned to die themselves.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.900
Even where such laws didn’t exist, the job
of an executioner was extremely dangerous

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.870
as executioners were also at risk of being
killed either by vengeful relatives or the

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.800
crowd witnessing an execution.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.159
In regards to the latter, if an executioner
was especially cruel in their meting out of

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:11.059
punishment, simply incompetent to the point
that they caused undue suffering, or just

00:08:11.059 --> 00:08:15.750
otherwise acted in an unprofessional manner
in performing their duties, it wasn’t unheard

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.889
of for a crowd to retaliate by killing the
executioner on the spot, generally with no

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.250
consequence to anyone in the mob.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.229
This constant danger of the job was something
Schmidt himself talked about several times

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:31.529
in his journal, though he only notes one instance
where the crowd turned into a mob.

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:36.419
This occurred during a flogging he was performing,
with the person being beaten ultimately stoned

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.090
to death by the crowd.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.229
As you might imagine from this, in cases like
Schmidt who was trained from childhood to

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:46.380
take over the job from his father, a rather
lengthy apprenticeship was called for, including

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.850
a robust education from one’s parent, followed
by assisting in executions and torture from

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.850
a young age.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.060
Schmidt also notes that he practiced executions
extensively on various animals before being

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.160
allowed to actually execute a human himself.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160
The end goal of all of this was to make sure
he wouldn’t screw up, as raucous mobs didn’t

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160
really care if it was someone’s first day
on the job or not.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:05.440
Now, although being an executioner came with
some massive downsides, it wasn’t all bad.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.520
Enterprising executioners could actually earn
a fairly decent living doling out torture

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.930
and capital punishment on command if they
were smart about it.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.800
For example, especially skilled executioners
who didn’t mind traveling could take advantage

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.090
of the scarcity of people willing to do their
job by plying their trade across whichever

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.750
country they happened to live in, rather than
just staying local.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.740
Executioners also frequently earned extra
money in the form of bribes from the condemned

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:34.240
or their families, invariably given in the
hopes that the executioner would ensure death

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.400
was as swift and painless as possible, or
otherwise allow the condemned extra comforts

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.790
leading up to the execution.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.730
This might include, for example, slipping
them extra alcohol or the like to make the

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.800
execution a little easier to handle.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.270
On top of this, throughout much of Medieval
Europe a perk of being an executioner is that

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.590
it was customary for whatever property was
worn at the time of death to be granted to

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.960
the executioner.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.470
Additionally, executioners in Germany were
frequently tasked with things like arbitrating

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.400
disputes between prostitutes and driving lepers
out of town, among other such jobs, all of

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.090
which they could charge a premium for because
nobody else was willing to do the job.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.100
Executioners were also sometimes not just
given the job of disposing of animal carcasses,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.650
but also in some regions the explicit right
to all stray animal carcasses found in a town.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:26.170
Depending on the animal, this could mean the
rights to valuable hides, teeth, etc.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:30.580
An even greater benefit for certain executioners,
this time in France, was the idea of droit

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.640
de havage.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.870
In a nutshell, because executioners were so
ostracized and couldn’t in some regions,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:40.940
for example, just go down to the market and
shop freely, under droit de havage, executioners

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:45.040
were more or less allowed to tax those who
sold various food and drink items.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.100
This came in the form of being able to demand
goods for free.

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:52.630
Finally, there’s the money an executioner
would be paid for performing an execution,

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.640
flogging, or the like.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.540
Although it’s hard to say exactly how much
an executioner could earn per hanging or beheading

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.690
in today’s currency due to the inherent
difficulty of gauging the value of historic

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:06.500
currencies, it’s evident that it was a good
amount, at least relative to the generally

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.880
low social standing of executioners.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.390
For example, according to information gleaned
from an old statute dated to a small German

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.680
town in 1276 an executioner could earn the
equivalent of 5 shillings per execution.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.820
This is an amount roughly equal to the amount
of money a skilled tradesmen could earn in

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.710
about 25 days at the time.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.230
Likewise, an executioner operating in England
some two centuries later in the 1400s could

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.760
reportedly earn a fee of 10 shillings per
execution, or roughly 16 times the amount

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.430
a skilled tradesmen could earn in a single
day.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.190
Granted, as you might have deduced from the
aforementioned case of Frantz Schmidt only

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.240
executing about 400 people and flogging a
similar number in his near five decades on

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.010
the job, nobody was getting rich doing this
by itself, it at least wasn’t bad pay per

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.010
hour of work.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.050
Finally, we’d be remiss in any discussion
of Medieval executioners to not point out

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.240
that the idea of executioners wearing masks
to hide who they were does not appear to have

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.990
actually been much of a thing.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.611
Beyond, as mentioned, in many regions being
literally branded as executioners, even large

00:12:01.611 --> 00:12:06.550
cities for much of history weren’t actually
that large; so people knew who the executioner

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.060
in a given region was, if not directly, by
being marked such.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:13:29.380
Thus, wearing a mask would have been pointless.
