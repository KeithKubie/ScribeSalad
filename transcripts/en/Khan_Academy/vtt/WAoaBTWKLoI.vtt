00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.320
In the last video,
in order to evaluate

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.790
this indefinite integral, we
first made the substitution

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.500
that x is equal to 3 sine theta.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.010
And then this got us to
an integral of this form.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.500
Then we were able to break
up these sines and cosines

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350
and use a little bit
of our trig identities.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.820
To get it into the form where
we could do u substitution,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.260
we did another
substitution where

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.234
we said that u is equal
to cosine of theta.

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:23.900
And then finally, we
were able to get it

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.560
into a form using that
second round of substitution.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.204
And this time, it
was u substitution.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:29.620
We were able to
get it into a form

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.800
that we could actually
take the antiderivative.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.033
And we got the final
answer here in terms of u.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.520
But now we've got to
go and undo everything.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.690
We have to undo
the substitutions.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.984
So the last substitution
we had done--

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:42.650
we're now going to
go in reverse order--

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.240
was that u was equal
to cosine theta.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.780
So you might just want to
substitute u with cosine theta

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.280
here.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.904
But then we're going
to have everything

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:54.850
in terms of cosine theta, which
still doesn't get us to x.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.970
So the ideal is if I can
somehow express u in terms of x.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.380
So let's think how we can do it.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.150
We know that u is
equal to cosine theta.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.590
We know the relationship between
x and theta is right over here.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590
x is equal to 3 sine theta.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.920
So let's write that over here.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030
So we know that x-- let
me write it over here--

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.840
we know that x is
equal to 3 sine theta.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.470
So if we could
somehow write cosine--

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.440
let me rewrite this a
little bit differently.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.850
Or we could also say that x
over 3 is equal to sine theta.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060
I just divided both sides by 3.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.650
So if we could
somehow re-express

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.780
this in terms of
sine theta, then we

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.960
can replace all the sine
thetas with x over 3's, and we

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.940
are done.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.889
So how can we do that?

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.180
And I'll actually show you
two techniques for doing it.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.360
So the first one is to
make the realization, OK, u

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210
is equal to cosine of theta.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.550
If I want to write this
in terms of sine of theta,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.280
I can just say that this
is equal to-- straight up,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.880
this is the most fundamental
trigonometric identity.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.760
Cosine theta is the square root
of 1 minus sine squared theta.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.020
And we see sine of theta
is equal to x over 3.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.290
So this is the square root
of 1 minus x over 3 squared.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.362
So this is u in terms of x.

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:15.820
So everywhere we
see a u up here we

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.610
can replace it with
this expression.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.910
And we are essentially done.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.217
We would have written
this in terms of x.

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:23.300
Now, there's another
technique you might sometimes

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.383
see in a calculus class
where someone says, OK, we

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:27.350
know that u is equal
to cosine theta.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.570
We know this relationship.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.860
How can we express
u in terms of x?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.400
And we'll say, let's
draw a right triangle.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.400
They'll draw a right
triangle like this.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.150
They'll draw a right triangle,
and they'll say, OK, look,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.620
sine of theta is x over 3.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.640
So if we say that this is theta
right over here, sine of theta

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.980
is the same thing as
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.620
Opposite over hypotenuse
is equal to x over 3.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.660
So let's say that this is x and
then this right over here is 3.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.760
Then the sine of theta
will be x over 3.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.065
So we look at that first
substitution right over here.

00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.190
But in order to figure out
what u is in terms of x,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.550
we need to figure out
what cosine of theta is.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.160
Well, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.540
So we have to figure out
what this adjacent side is.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.046
Well, we can just use the
Pythagorean theorem for that.

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:10.420
Pythagorean theorem
would tell us

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.086
that this is going
to be the square root

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:14.520
of the hypotenuse
squared, which is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.550
9, minus the other side
squared, minus x squared.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.340
So from this, we fully
solved the right triangle

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.420
in terms of x.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.740
We can realize that
cosine of theta

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.860
is going to be equal to the
adjacent side, square root of 9

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.800
minus x squared,
over the hypotenuse,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.700
over 3, which is the same thing
as 1/3 times the square root

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.780
of 9 minus x squared,
which is the same thing

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.980
if we square 1/3 and
put it into the radical.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.220
So we're essentially going
to take the square-- 1/3

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.490
is the same thing as
the square root of 1/9.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.830
So can rewrite this as the
square root of 1/9 times

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.460
9 minus x squared.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.160
Essentially, we just brought
the 1/3 third into the radical.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.400
Now it's 1/9.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.590
And so now this is going
to be the same thing

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:12.720
as the square root of 1
minus x squared over 9,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.760
which is exactly this
thing right over here. x

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.120
squared over 9 is the same
thing as x over 3 squared.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.970
So either way, you
get the same result.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.940
I find using the trig
identity right over here

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.220
to express cosine of theta
in terms of sine theta

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.970
and then just do
the substitution

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.889
to be a little bit
more straightforward.

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.180
But now we can just substitute
into the original thing.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.000
So either of these-- I can
write it as either way--

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.700
this thing right over here,
this is the same thing as 1

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.570
minus x squared over
9 to the 1/2 power.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.130
That's what u is equal to.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.040
And everywhere we see u, we just
substitute it with this thing.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.080
So our final answer
in terms of x

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.000
is going to be equal to 243
times u to the fifth, this

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.780
to the fifth power over 5.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.590
This to the fifth power is
1 minus x squared over 9.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.050
It was to the 1/2, but if we
raise that to the fifth power,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.560
it's now going to
be to the 5/2 power

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:12.750
over 5 minus this to the
third power, 1 minus x squared

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.800
over 9 to the 3/2 raising this
to the third power-- that's

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.765
this right over here-- over 3,
and then all of that plus c.

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:22.390
And we're done.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.570
It's messy, but using first
trig substitution then

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.830
u substitution, or trig
substitution then rearranging

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.780
using a couple of our
techniques for manipulating

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.505
these powers of trig functions,
we're able to get into a form

00:05:35.505 --> 00:05:37.410
where we could use
u substitution,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.230
and then we were able to
unwind all the substitutions

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.420
and actually evaluate
the indefinite integral.
