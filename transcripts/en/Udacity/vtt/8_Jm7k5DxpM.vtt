00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.150
You've already taken a look at the profile class, but so

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.470
far it doesn't define an entity. What you're going to be doing

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.160
now is going in and adding the annotations to make it

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.275
an entity. You can look for the places marked to do in

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:15.640
profile.java, it's just a couple things you need to do. You

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.420
need to add the annotation to indicate that the class is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.620
an entity, and when you've done that go ahead and write

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.170
the annotation here. You also need to add the annotation to indicate

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.940
that the user ID is a property that's

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.840
going to be used as a unique identifier for profile

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.920
entities. When you're done just go ahead and add

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.790
the annotation for identifying the unique ID field here.
