Now, that we have our equations matched with the proper lines, I'd like to point

00:00:05.352 --> 00:00:09.945
out that I see three special spots on this plot, the three points that all lie

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:14.601
right here on the y-axis. Looking at our three equations, which, of course,

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:19.207
represent these three lines, can you pick the term in each equation that

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:20.979
determines these three points?
