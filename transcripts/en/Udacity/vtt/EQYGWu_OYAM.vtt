00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.945
Now it's important to know that there are cultural restraints when it comes to

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:09.810
IQ testing. The question of race and IQ is very complicated and controversial.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.173
Now we won't cover all the nuances of this argument, and the evidence

00:00:13.173 --> 00:00:17.682
supporting it. But it's true that traditional IQ tests have worked against

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:22.950
people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, because they're so verbally based.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.793
And people from low socioeconomic backgrounds tend to be exposed to less

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:32.064
complex vocabulary. In order to be more culturally fair, non verbal

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:36.782
intelligence tests have been created. The most well known of these is Raven's

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:41.238
Progressive Matrix Test. This is what the test looks like. Because this simply

00:00:41.238 --> 00:00:44.694
asks the person to recognize a pattern in shapes, it doesn't require special

00:00:44.694 --> 00:00:49.740
language or educational skills. Hence, it's culturally free.
