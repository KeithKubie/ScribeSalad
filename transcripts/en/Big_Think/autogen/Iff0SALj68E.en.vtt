this<00:00:29.349><c> virus</c><00:00:30.310><c> so</c><00:00:30.730><c> this</c><00:00:30.880><c> is</c><00:00:30.910><c> one</c><00:00:31.239><c> of</c><00:00:31.270><c> the</c><00:00:31.450><c> few</c>

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 align:start position:0%
this virus so this is one of the few
 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.130 align:start position:0%
this virus so this is one of the few
things<00:00:32.460><c> where</c><00:00:33.460><c> old</c><00:00:33.700><c> age</c><00:00:33.880><c> really</c><00:00:34.420><c> is</c><00:00:34.660><c> good</c><00:00:34.899><c> in</c>

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 align:start position:0%
things where old age really is good in
 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.740 align:start position:0%
things where old age really is good in
terms<00:00:35.620><c> of</c><00:00:35.829><c> this</c><00:00:35.950><c> h1n1</c><00:00:36.460><c> virus</c><00:00:37.120><c> so</c><00:00:37.300><c> the</c><00:00:37.420><c> older</c>

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 align:start position:0%
terms of this h1n1 virus so the older
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.889 align:start position:0%
terms of this h1n1 virus so the older
ones<00:00:37.960><c> sitting</c><00:00:38.350><c> around</c><00:00:38.710><c> here</c><00:00:39.239><c> and</c><00:00:40.239><c> standing</c>

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 align:start position:0%
ones sitting around here and standing
 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.759 align:start position:0%
ones sitting around here and standing
around<00:00:41.170><c> here</c><00:00:42.420><c> much</c><00:00:43.420><c> more</c><00:00:43.449><c> protected</c><00:00:43.899><c> and</c><00:00:44.469><c> the</c>

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 align:start position:0%
around here much more protected and the
 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.380 align:start position:0%
around here much more protected and the
reason<00:00:45.160><c> for</c><00:00:45.190><c> that</c><00:00:45.430><c> is</c><00:00:45.850><c> that</c><00:00:46.300><c> this</c><00:00:47.260><c> virus</c><00:00:47.559><c> is</c>

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that this virus is
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that this virus is
h1n1<00:00:49.390><c> virus</c><00:00:49.840><c> is</c><00:00:50.190><c> actually</c><00:00:51.190><c> derived</c><00:00:51.429><c> from</c><00:00:51.969><c> this</c>

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 align:start position:0%
h1n1 virus is actually derived from this
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
h1n1 virus is actually derived from this
1918<00:00:52.989><c> virus</c>
