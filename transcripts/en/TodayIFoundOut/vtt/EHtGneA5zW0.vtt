00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.399
In Russia Vodka is Water and 12 Other Language
Facts

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:09.599
1) The fear of dinner party conversations
or dinner parties in general is known as Deipnophobia.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.450
2) “School” comes from the Ancient Greek
“skhole”, which meant “leisure or spare

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.450
time”.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.980
3) Vodka comes from the Russian word for “water,”
which is “Voda.”

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.490
Like most distilled liquors, in the beginning
Vodka was mainly used as a medicine.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.279
Vodka was also used as an ingredient in early
European formulas for gunpowder.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.530
4) A “tittle” is nothing dirty, it’s
simply the name for the dot over the letter

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.329
“i”
5) Air Force One is only called that when

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.550
the U.S. President is aboard.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.449
It is not a specific plane and the U.S. maintains
a presidential air fleet at Andrews Air Force

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.660
Base in Maryland, with each plane meeting
the requirements for transporting the President.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.280
6) The “USA Patriot” in USA PATRIOT Act
actually stands for something: Uniting &amp; Strengthening

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.600
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required
to Intercept &amp; Obstruct Terrorism

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.559
7) The term “Speak of the Devil” is the
shortened version of “Speak of the Devil

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.199
and he doth appear.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.930
” It was first printed in Giovanni Torriano’s
‘Piazza Universale’in 1666, where he wrote,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.340
“The English say, Talk of the Devil, and
he’s presently at your elbow”.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.770
In 1672, it again appeared in a poem which
stated “Talk of the Devil, and see his horns.”

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.770
However, during the 19th century the term
started losing its sinister meaning and was

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.190
used as a warning of an eavesdropper to a
conversation rather than the literal Devil.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.200
In the 20th century, it simply started being
a reference to someone who appeared unexpectedly

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.400
while being talked about.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.230
8) Glass tubes created by lightning strikes
in sand are called “fulgurites”.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.310
9) The drug Premarin (made of conjugated estrogens)
originally came from the urine of pregnant

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.680
horses, hence: PREgnatn MARe urine
10) The only word in the English language

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.490
to end with “mt” is “dreamt”, unless
of course you consider “undreamt” to be

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.050
a separate word.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.160
11) “Desperation” is an anagram for “A
Rope Ends It”.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.189
12) The Ewoks in Star Wars were named after
the Native American tribe Miwok.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.680
The Miwok’s lived in the Redwood forest
that is the setting for the Endor scenes on

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
Return of the Jedi.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.599
It has also been suggested that Princess Leia’s
bun hair style was also of Native American

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.990
origin, based on the Hopi Indian “Squash
Blossom” hair style that very strongly resembles

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.489
Leia’s bun hair style.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.599
George Lucas denies this, stating the strong
similarity is coincidental.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.750
Of course, he also now claims Han shot second,
so…

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.659
13) The word “Velcro” is derived from
the French “velour” (velvet) and “crochet”

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:43.659
(hooks).

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:59.250
So essentially, Velcro just means “hooked
velvet”.
