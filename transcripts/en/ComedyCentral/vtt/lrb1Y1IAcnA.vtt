00:00:05.423 --> 00:00:08.006
(dubstep beat)

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.303
(grunting and gagging)

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:22.396
- Just too, buku?

00:00:22.396 --> 00:00:25.979
Is this way too bu ku?

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.044
Gahhhhhhh!

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.310
- [Video Game] Go, go, go!

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.430
- Oh God, I can't believe
Kid Lightning's dead.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.926
He was my best friend, even though he was

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:43.537
a total dick to me.

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:44.896
(crying)

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:49.372
He was so young. Or old. Just
don't know what I can do.

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:50.911
- You're not helping.

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.960
You're making this sadder.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.748
- You probably deal with
it in your own way and...

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.219
- I masturbate. You can say it.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:59.587
- You masturbate.

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:01.821
- Hey, toe cheese lovers. What's up?

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.559
Let's play man, I'm psyched.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.284
Play.
- Listen, before you came in

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:08.574
we were talking about grief processes.

00:01:08.574 --> 00:01:09.680
- [Doctor Flashback] Yeah.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.340
- And clearly you're dealing
with this with humor, but--

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.760
- Dealing with what?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.860
- Kid Lightning.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.322
- Yeah, what about him?

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:17.910
- He's dead.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.743
- Really?

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:19.722
- How do you not know this?

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:20.722
- I'm off the grid.

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:22.812
- He died three days ago.

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:25.291
- It's a really big grid.

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.478
(battle sounds)

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:30.907
- What happened? He was so young-old.

00:01:30.907 --> 00:01:33.407
- I heard from a very reliable source,

00:01:33.407 --> 00:01:35.967
national public radio,
you should all donate.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.518
- Oh boy.

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:41.355
- He died fighting his
arch-rival, Shrewd Shrew,

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:45.375
who was trying to use a
quantum cube to open up a

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:47.489
gateway to a hell dimension.

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.732
In order to distract Kid
Lightning he placed a

00:01:50.732 --> 00:01:54.582
busload of MILFs, a bang bus if you will.

00:01:54.582 --> 00:01:56.412
- Yeah, he likes that.

00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:59.511
- Kid Lightning had to close
the gate to the hell dimension

00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.981
but also to save the teetering MILFs.

00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:03.342
- He's a multi-tasker.

00:02:03.342 --> 00:02:05.998
- [Big Chill] I mean, he was
able to destroy the cube but

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.956
it weakened him and he was
crushed by the bang bus.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.073
- Oh man, that is
- wow, that is

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:13.393
- Terrible.
- An amazing story.

00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:14.246
If it were true,

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:15.715
which it's not
- What do you mean?

00:02:15.715 --> 00:02:19.018
- I have a different story.
I was in Peru doing Ayahuasca

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:21.334
with my Shaman friend, Mike

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:22.584
- [Complacent Man] Oh wow

00:02:22.584 --> 00:02:24.767
- [Doctor Flashback] On
my fourth hour of tripping

00:02:24.767 --> 00:02:26.902
a king snake came to me

00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:30.731
and told me that Kid
Lightning got his dick

00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:32.991
stuck in his zipper a week ago.

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:34.245
- [Complacent Man] Oh man.

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:36.355
- He died of a dick infection.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.040
- That must be true then.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.873
- [Big Chill] No, I don't--

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:40.139
- Forget that bus shit.

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.979
- I'm sorry, I just don't
trust your flashbacks anymore.

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:44.764
- Remember when you said Abraham Lincoln

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:47.190
- [Together] Only farted, he never talked.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.523
- Yeah, I stick by that one.

00:02:50.595 --> 00:02:52.928
(explosion)

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.696
- I've got the best arbiter of facts here,

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:01.646
world star hip hop, I'm gonna look it up.

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.476
- You're going to a
website that specializes

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:05.727
in Denny's parking lot fights.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:06.811
- [Complacent Man] Oh, here it is.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.441
Kid Lightning did enormous amount of cokes

00:03:09.441 --> 00:03:12.069
off Al Roker's head
and had a heart attack.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.642
- I do not think that's true.

00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:14.777
- It's true, look!

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.273
(notification beep)

00:03:16.273 --> 00:03:17.482
- Wow.
- Lightning just signed in.

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:19.052
- My eyes, my eyes.
- Whoah, whoah.

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:20.304
- Okay, let's invite him to the game.

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:21.212
We have to see if
- Okay, I'm sending him

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:22.247
this is him or not.
- an invite right now.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:23.080
Here we go.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.985
- Maybe it's him, maybe
he came back to life.

00:03:23.985 --> 00:03:25.031
Maybe a super hero came back to life.

00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.864
- We'll see.
- He's a ghost.

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:26.697
- That happens a lot.

00:03:26.697 --> 00:03:28.174
- [Doctor Flashback] Here he comes.

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:29.294
- Lightning, is that you?

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:30.127
- Uh, no.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:32.936
- Who the fuck are you then?

00:03:32.936 --> 00:03:35.074
- Whoah, man, my name's Zeke.
I'm Lightning's roommate.

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:35.968
- Oh, hey Zeke.

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:36.801
- Hi.

00:03:36.801 --> 00:03:38.388
- While we have you here, which is weird,

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:39.221
- [Zeke] Yeah?

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:41.075
- Maybe you can settle
and argument for us.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:42.806
How did Kid Lightning die?

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.054
- There's been some debate.

00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:44.964
- Well, I know.

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:45.797
- You guys don't...

00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:49.126
Oh yeah, he got, It's weird,
he got struck by lightning.

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:50.358
- That...That's--

00:03:50.358 --> 00:03:51.191
- Wow, really?

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.024
- [Big Chill] Sorry.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.342
it's a little funny.
- No way.

00:03:53.342 --> 00:03:54.175
- It's a little bit funny.

00:03:54.175 --> 00:03:55.008
- It is funny.

00:03:55.008 --> 00:03:57.129
- While masturbating with
a plastic bag on his head.

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.243
- oh, that's less funny.

00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:01.826
(dubstep beat)
