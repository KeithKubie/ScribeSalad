-(applause and cheering)
-Welcome back!

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:08.975
Now, man, after witnessing
the full-blown circus

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.177
of the RNC last week, it's clear

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.379
that the future of the America
rests solely

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.748
in the hands
of Hillary Rodham Clinton.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.750
Look, Hillary,

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.987
we are at a level red
apocalyptic (bleep) show.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.922
(laughter)

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.690
And we desperately need you

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:27.960
to keep us from imploding
into the abyss, girl, all right?

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:29.796
-(applause and cheering)
-Listen to me, Hillary!

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.531
I'm serious, girl!

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.332
If you don't turn
this thing around,

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:35.234
Donald Trump could very well
be president!

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.171

-People are nervous up in here!

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.972
-(laughter)
-Yeah?

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.375
But I met someone at the White
House Correspondence dinner

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.910
who can give you some guidance.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.545
