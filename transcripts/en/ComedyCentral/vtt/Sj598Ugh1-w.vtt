00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.560
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME TO "THE DAILY
SHOW".

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.720
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.580
GOOD SHOW TONIGHT. TONIGHT'S
GUEST THE GREATEST, THE GREATEST

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.780
RELIEF PITCHER IN BASEBALL
HISTORY MARIANO RIVERA IS

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.120
GOING TO BE JOINING US ON THE
PROGRAM LATER ON TONIGHT.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.120
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT
BUT --

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.523
[LAUGHTER]
I SAID THE BUT REALLY LOUD,

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.658
DIDN'T I?

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.794
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT, SCARED
SOME PEOPLE.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.229
WE HAVE TO GET TO THE NEWS.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:30.631
BECAUSE LATE LAST WEEK IT ALL
WENT DOWN.

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.401
&gt;&gt; THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE
DEFENSE OVER A NEW SMOKING GUN

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.335
BENGHAZI E-MAIL.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.337
&gt;&gt; SOME ARE CALLING A SMOKING
GUN.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.273
&gt;&gt; THE SMOKING GUN.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.807
&gt;&gt; Jon: SMOKING GUN.

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.211
[ LAUGHTER ]
IT'S ONE OF WORST KINDS OF GUNS.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:45.712
[LAUGHTER]
A GUN THAT SMOKES.

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.448
ITS A TERRIBLE INFLUENCE.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.618
[LAUGHTER]
ALL THE OTHER GUNS THAT JUST

00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:52.786
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:57.424
THEY ARE NOT SMOKING, NOT
DRINKING AND THEN THAT GUN WALKS

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.292
IN.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.161
COME ON, ALL THE COOL GUNS ARE
DOING IT.

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.864
[ LAUGHTER ]
NOW WE WENT INTO IRAQ BECAUSE WE

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:09.336
DIDN'T WANT THE SMOKING GUN TO
BE IN THE FORM OF A

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.537
MUSHROOM CLOUD. WHAT WAS
THIS GUN SMOKING?

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:15.008
&gt;&gt; THE CONSERVATIVE WATCH DOG
GROUP JUDICIAL WATCH OBTAINED

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:19.580
INTERNAL WHITE HOUSE E-MAILS
THAT IT CLAIMS REVEAL MORE ABOUT

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.149
THE EFFORT TO GET THEN U.N.
AMBASSADOR SUSAN RICE TO ASSERT

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:26.253
ON THE SUNDAY MORNING TALK SHOWS
THAT THE ATTACK ON THE

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:31.458
U.S. CONSULATE WAS THE RESULT OF
A DEMONSTRATION OVER AN

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.594
INTERNET VIDEO AND NOT A FAILURE
OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY.

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:34.761
&gt;&gt; Jon: HUH.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:35.996
MAN, THAT IS DIFFERENT. THE
WHITE HOUSE HAD SAID THEY HAD

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.532
VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH CHANGING
THE TALKING POINTS. WELL, NOW

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.867
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS BEN RHODES A
WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.908
SECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS AIDE
DID ADD TO THE TALKING POINTS,

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.577
EMPHASIZING THAT THE PROTESTS
SURROUNDING THE BENGHAZI

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:54.248
VIOLENCE WERE NOT COORDINATED BY
TERRORISTS BUT WERE INSTEAD

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:55.582
SOMEHOW RELATED TO A PROVOCATIVE
ANTI-MUSLIM VIDEO THAT HAD

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.685
CAUSED DEMONSTRATIONS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES. BY THE WAY,

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.420
THAT VIDEO, SNOW DOGS.

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:03.257
IT REALLY IS A TERRIBLE,
TERRIBLE VIDEO.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.928
[LAUGHTER]
WELL, I WILL SAY THIS, FROM THAT

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.298
E-MAIL IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WHITE
HOUSE -- WELL DONE.

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:15.435
THE WHITE HOUSE HAD POLITICS AND
ELECTIONS ON THEIR MIND WHEN

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.939
THEY SENT SUSAN RICE TO THE
SUNDAY SHOWS.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.174
IT'S DEPLORABLE.

00:02:20.207 --> 00:02:24.378
NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS
OF FIXING THE INITIAL PROBLEMS

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:29.016
OF INADEQUATE COMMUNICATION AND
PROTECTION THAT CAUSED THE

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.284
TRAGEDY BUT OKAY. GOOD FIND.
MOVING ON.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:36.056
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE OVER
THOSE FOUR DEAD AMERICANS?

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.324
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAIT, WHAT NOW?

00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:40.928
&gt;&gt; WE NOW KNOW THAT THE WHITE
HOUSE HAD A CONSPIRACY WHERE

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.330
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY WERE
TRYING TO DO WAS CHANGE THE

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.331
STORY.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.733
&gt;&gt; WILL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA
EVEN PAY ATTENTION?

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:47.634
&gt;&gt; THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS
GIVING PRESIDENT OBAMA A PASS ON

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.870
BENGHAZI.

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.971
WHERE WAS THAT OUTRAGE?

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.275
THE PRESIDENT AND THE WHITE
HOUSE CREATED A POLITICAL

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.943
AGENDA.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:57.377
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE MEDIA OUTRAGE?

00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:00.347
&gt;&gt; THEY KNEW IT WAS A TERRORIST
ATTACK FROM THE GET GO.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.849
&gt;&gt; NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE.

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.118
&gt;&gt; FOX NEWS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT
STAYED ON THE STORY AND HAS NOT

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:05.819
LET GO OF IT.

00:03:05.853 --> 00:03:10.090
&gt;&gt; WHERE IS THE OUTRAGE THERE?

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:13.760
[LAUGHTER]
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY.

00:03:13.794 --> 00:03:15.729
I THINK I SEE THE PROBLEM.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.832
[ LAUGHTER ]
YOU THINK PEOPLE'S FAILURE TO

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:23.604
MATCH YOUR LEVEL OF OUTRAGE IS
BASED ON IGNORANCE THAT AFTER

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:27.975
NEARLY 100 NETWORK NEWS STORIES,
HUNDREDS OF CABLE NEWS STORIES

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.676
ABOUT BENGHAZI 13 CONGRESSIONAL
HEARINGS, 50 FURTHER

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.546
CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGS AND

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.183
25,000 PAGES OF OFFICIAL
FINDINGS CONCERNING WHAT

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:42.089
HAPPENED IN BENGHAZI THAT IF WE
ALL ONLY KNEW ABOUT IT --

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.826
[LAUGHTER]
-- WE WOULD CARE.

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.262
[LAUGHTER]
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE VERY FEW

00:03:48.295 --> 00:03:52.366
THINGS WE'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT IN
THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:53.700
THE ONLY THING WE'VE HEARD ABOUT
IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.869
THE ONLY THING WE'VE
HEARD MORE ABOUT MAYBE

00:03:55.903 --> 00:04:01.575
THE KARDASHIANS AND THERE IS,
THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT THIS

00:04:01.608 --> 00:04:03.744
SITUATION WAS SPAWNED BY THE
RELEASE OF THE VIDEO.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.946
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THINK

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.714
THAT -- I THINK I SEE THE
PROBLEM. HERE'S YOUR PROBLEM,

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:13.153
YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET
OUTRAGED ABOUT AN INTELLIGENCE

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:18.659
FAILURE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TO
SOME AMERICANS LOSING THEIR

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:19.593
LIVES.

00:04:19.626 --> 00:04:20.928
ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE. AND
THEN, I MEAN,

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:24.598
IMAGINE THE OUTRAGE IF THERE WAS
A SECOND FAILURE RIGHT AFTER

00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:29.303
THAT ONE THAT TRAGICALLY LED TO
EVEN MORE AMERICANS LOSING

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.371
THEIR LIVES? BUT, YOU ARE NOT
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:34.675
YOU ARE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT
THIS ONE INTELLIGENCE FAILURE

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:38.946
AND YOU ARE UPSET THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION IN ITS HASTE TO

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.615
GET REELECTED PULLED SOME DODGY
FACE SAVING (bleep).

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:47.788
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE AFRAID
OF. WELL, I COMMEND YOU FOR

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.756
FINALLY GETTING IN TOUCH WITH
YOUR INNER OUTRAGE BECAUSE

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.191
IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,
IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE

00:04:51.225 --> 00:04:55.128
IT WAS AN EMOTION YOU DIDN'T
SEEM COMFORTABLE

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:56.163
ADDRESSING OR EXPRESSING. LIKE,
FOR INSTANCE WHEN FORMER BUSH

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.232
HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY
TOM RIDGE SAID HE WAS

00:04:58.265 --> 00:04:59.766
PRESSURED BY ASHCROFT AND
RUMSFELD TO RAISE THE

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.504
NATION'S TERROR THREAT LEVEL
BEFORE THE 2004 ELECTION TO

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.373
HELP PRESIDENT BUSH'S ELECTION
CHANCES.

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:07.875
WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:12.513
&gt;&gt; WELL, TOM RIDGE IS A GOOD AND
DECENT MAN ENTITLED TO HIS

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:15.716
IMPRESSIONS BUT THERE'RE JUST
THAT AND THERE ARE SOME FACTS

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.117
THAT STAND BETWEEN TOM RICH AND
THE SMOKING GUN.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.786
&gt;&gt; IF FORMER HOMELAND
SECURITY CHIEF TOM RIDGE

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.857
WAS HOPING TO GENERATE BUZZ
ABOUT HIS UPCOMING

00:05:23.891 --> 00:05:25.392
BOOK, MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

00:05:25.425 --> 00:05:25.959
&gt;&gt; Jon: ZING.

00:05:25.993 --> 00:05:26.994
THAT'S NOT OUTRAGE.

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.629
THAT IS SNARK.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:28.729
SNARK IS NOT OUTRAGE, SILLY.
[LAUGHTER]
