00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.450
Films can do a great job of taking us inside
the minds of characters.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.110
Martin Scorsese burrows into the warped psyche
of Robert De Niro’s vigilante in Taxi Driver.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.740
In Safe, director Todd Haynes asks us to see
the world through the eyes of Julianne Moore’s

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.360
suburban housewife, who may or may not be
going crazy.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.450
And, of course, David Fincher’s Fight Club
fractures a character’s mind so deeply that

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.040
by the end we have to re-evaluate everything
we’ve seen.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.840
In 1993, the acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.900
released a film that explores
the mental and emotional experience of a woman

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.900
grieving her husband and young daughter.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.269
It’s heavy material, but the filmmaking
remains lyrical, expressive, and humane.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.320
So let’s take a closer look at Krzysztof
Kieślowski’s Blue.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:56.060
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.700
[intro]
Blue is actually the first film in a loose trilogy.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.800
After making The Decalogue, a collection of
ten short films inspired by the Ten Commandments,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.920
writer-director Krzysztof Kieslowski 
decided to make a series of feature films

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.130
named after the three colors of the French
flag.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.210
He and co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz — and, yes, they’re both named Krzysztof

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.560
— mistakenly believed that each color represented
one of the three ideals of the French Revolution:

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.119
liberty, equality, and fraternity.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.450
They liked that framework so much that they
stuck with it, even when they learned that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.390
the colors and the motto weren’t directly
linked.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.400
It didn’t matter much anyway, since Kieslowski
wasn’t interested in making explicitly political films.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.700
He’s a deeply humanist filmmaker, and all
his films are notable for their patience,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.710
their emotional power, and their closely-observed
characters.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.700
The stories often examine how universal themes
play out in the intimate moments and day-to-day

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.899
lives of humans.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.420
And Blue is Kieslowski’s movie about liberty.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.509
He chose to focus on a character who, in the
wake of a tragic accident, attempts to liberate

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.079
herself from all ties to her past, her own
desires, and even the world itself.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.189
Juliette Binoche plays Julie, the
protagonist.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.600
Her husband, Patrice, and young daughter,
Anna, are killed in a car accident within

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.999
the first few minutes of the film.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.770
The story then follows her attempts to go
on without them.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.740
And, at first, she almost chooses not to.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.860
While recovering in the hospital from the
accident, Julie tries to kill herself.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.640
She stops, but we immediately understand the
depth and power of her grief.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.780
Back in the world, she resolves to strip all
traces of her family from her life.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.530
She just wants to exist, free from all attachments
— physical, emotional, and spiritual.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.910
She sells most of her possessions and puts
her country estate on the market.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.220
The only thing she keeps is a mobile made
from blue crystals that hung in her daughter’s room.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.391
She collects sheet music for an unfinished
composition her husband was working on, and

00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:36.470
throws it into the jaws of a garbage truck.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.390
And she moves to a nondescript apartment building
with no children in it and finds a bit of

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.370
peace in her solitary nighttime swims in the
building’s pool.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.780
Her isolation is almost complete.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.810
And yet, the more she tries free herself from
the past, the more it seems to grip her.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.790
A boy who witnessed the crash tracks her down
and attempts to return a necklace he took

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.790
from the accident.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.730
Caught off-guard, Julie appreciates the gesture,
but tells him to keep it.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.780
She doesn’t want another physical reminder
of her family.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.160
She’s also haunted by her husband’s unfinished
symphony.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.640
Pieces of it play over the soundtrack at emotional
moments.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.760
And sometimes Julie seems to hear it, as
if it’s surging up from inside her own mind.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.640
She also discovers Patrice has left behind
a very tangible echo of himself.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.120
He had been having a long-term affair, and
his mistress is pregnant with his child.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.970
As it becomes clear that Julie can’t actually
free herself from her memories, she begins

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.430
to wrestle with new ways to live in the world.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.720
Reluctantly, she works to complete her husband’s
symphony with his steadfast colleague Olivier,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.970
played by Benoît Régent.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.250
She gives her country house to Patrice’s
mistress, suggesting that her unborn child

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.190
should have both Patrice’s name and his
house.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.570
And by the end of the film, she even seems
open to a possible romantic relationship with

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.570
Olivier.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.570
Maybe.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.570
Just maybe.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.320
As the complete version of Patrice’s composition
plays at the end of the film, we check in

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.440
with each of our major characters, ending
with a weeping Julie who gives a hint of a smile.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.960
It’s one final indication that she might
be healing, even if the hurt will never fully

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.980
go away.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.760
At the core of Blue is Binoche’s powerful performance
as her character navigates grief.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.709
She’s in every scene and rarely speaks more
than a few lines at a time.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.700
Kieślowski keeps the camera close to her
face, tracking the emotions roiling inside

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.690
her, from despair to tenderness.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.030
And often she embodies more than one of those
conflicting emotions at once.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.510
In the scene where she confronts Patrice’s
mistress, Binoche is somehow able to play

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.500
Julie’s hurt and anger, but also her curiosity,
determination, and maybe even envy.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.830
She’s lost her child, and this stranger
is carrying her husband’s unborn son!

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.400
Kieślowski and cinematographer Slawomir Idziak also flood the film with the color blue.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.880
Not a huge surprise there… it’s in the
title, after all.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.970
And one way to critique a film is to analyze
motifs that the filmmakers use again and again

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.970
to try and understand some deeper meaning.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.570
Whether it’s sunlight refracted through
the blue mobile crystals, or the wavering

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.090
hues of the swimming pool, the color seems
to take on different meanings to match Julie’s

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.090
emotions.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.090
Writing in The New Review of Film, author
and Kieślowski scholar Steven Woodward observes

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.680
that despite the American association of blue
with sorrow, the color is actually the least

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.030
culturally defined of Kieślowski’s trilogy.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.700
White commonly represents innocence, purity,
and light, while red often signifies desire,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.790
heat, or anger.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.200
But blue can be soothing or sad, distant or
refreshing, scary or relaxing.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.770
And that makes it the perfect color to illustrate
Julie’s shifting emotions.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.770
When she steps into Anna’s empty room, we
discover its walls are all blue.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.520
Overcome, Julie attacks the mobile, tearing
off some of its crystals.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.020
Here, blue is a prison, a stark reminder of
what she’s lost.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.250
Elsewhere, the color seems to haunt Julie.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.620
Off-screen lights will inexplicably turn blue,
making her look ghostly.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.210
For some shots, Kieślowski and Idziak went
so far as to wrap the entire camera in blue

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.100
gels, which are those transparent filters
used in lighting.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.030
Beyond color, Kieślowski uses sound and music
in sophisticated ways to give us a sense of

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.190
Julie’s experience.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.530
Most of the music in the film is non-diegetic.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.660
That’s music added to the film to create
meaning or heighten emotion, but it doesn’t

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.460
have a source within the world of the film.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.950
In other words, it’s music that the characters
in the film can’t actually hear.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.610
Even though we, the audience, do.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.080
Kieślowski and composer Zbigniew Preisner play with the line between

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.360
diegetic and non-diegetic sound to great effect.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.260
When Julie first retrieves the score for her
husband’s symphony, we hear pieces of the

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260
music.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.260
And so does Julie.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.520
Or at least she imagines it, and we get
to listen into her imagination.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.480
And when she throws the sheet music into the
garbage truck, the song distorts as the trash

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.360
compactor’s teeth tear the paper.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.270
This extreme use of subjective sound puts
us in Julie’s experience even more fully.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.620
And the opening chords of Patrice’s symphony
haunt Julie throughout the film.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.020
In one early scene, Julie sits alone in a
chair at night, shortly after watching her

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.120
family’s funeral through a little TV set.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.110
The opening beats of the symphony blare on
the soundtrack as a bright blue light fills

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.680
the room.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.960
Julie looks almost directly at the camera
with a vaguely terrified expression, watching

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.770
us as we dolly away from her, and then back
toward her.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.290
Suddenly, Julie seems aware not only of the
non-diegetic score, but also of the camera.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.020
Are we inhabiting Patrice’s or Anna’s
ghost, back from the dead to spook her?

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.800
Or are we her grief, threatening to overwhelm
her?

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.240
Some critics have argued that this scene actually
depicts Julie’s call to action.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.720
It’s the first indication that her salvation
will come through helping Olivier finish the symphony.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.021
By the time she finally agrees to work on
the composition at the end of the film, we

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.520
can even think of the symphony as a metaphor
for Julie herself.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.490
Just like her, it’s a bit of a mess.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.139
And only by bringing it to life is Julie able
to find some measure of peace.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:00.080
When she first starts working on the composition,
Kieślowski gives us a close-up of the notes

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.110
on the page.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.120
As Julie’s finger moves along them, we hear
the music indicated by the notes.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.160
Then she starts suggesting changes and we hear the
new musical arrangement.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.680
It’s a remarkable moment that plays beautifully
with this gap between diegetic and non-diegetic

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.899
sound, as we hear the score that Julie imagines.

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:38.320
Not only that, we hear it getting better
at the same time that Julie herself is getting better.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.680
Georgina Evans, a film scholar at the University
of Cambridge, has a unique reading of Blue

00:08:42.699 --> 00:08:47.220
that explores the film’s intense identification
with Julie’s subjective experience.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.939
Evans suggests that maybe Julie experiences
synesthesia, a “neural condition in which

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:55.730
a stimulus to one sense produces a response
in one or more others.”

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.490
In other words, maybe Julie sees music and
hears color.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.160
So when the symphony plays over emotional
moments, or when a new shade of blue washes

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.110
over her face, perhaps that’s how Julie
processes the world around her.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.350
This interpretation may also give new meaning
to one of the most interesting shots near

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.430
the end of the film.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.529
When Julie finally gives in and helps Olivier
complete the symphony, the sequence ends with

00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:20.560
a wide shot of them that goes out of focus,
and then stays that way for a long time.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.100
We hear Julie and Olivier, but we only see
them as fuzzy shapes deep within the frame.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.839
It’s as if Julie needs enter some sort of
blurry mental state and let her senses fully

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:31.949
merge in order to create.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.440
Finally, it’s worth noting that this film
links Julie to the music in a very literal way.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.960
Music doesn’t really exist with only one
note.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.880
As a karaoke singing demon once said...

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.280
Lorne: It's like a song. Now, I can hold a note for a long time.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.120
Lorne: Actually, I can hold a note forever.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.800
Lorne: But, eventually, that's just noise. It's the change we're listening for.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.640
Lorne: The note coming after and the one after that. That's what makes it music.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.960
And the same is true here.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.660
Julie suffers, as a single person — or note
— in isolation.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.569
But as she collaborates on the symphony and
connects with more people, more notes and

00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:06.670
more variations of those notes appear.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.129
The score grows right along with Julie.

00:10:09.129 --> 00:10:13.540
So Blue could be about isolation as a coping
mechanism for grief, the ability of music

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.699
to save us, or even a woman whose senses are
scrambled.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:20.629
Anchored by one of the great performances
of the end of the 20th century, this film

00:10:20.629 --> 00:10:26.220
uses camera, lighting, and sound to tell a
difficult story with compassion and resonance.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:29.960
Next time, we’ll trade Paris for Mongolia
to witness a real teenage girl’s attempt

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.980
to master an ancient tradition and bear the
title Eagle Huntress.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.050
