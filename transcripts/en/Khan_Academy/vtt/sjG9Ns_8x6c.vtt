00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.099
- [Instructor] We're told
that Della has over 500 songs

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:03.399
on her mobile phone,

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.535
and she wants to estimate

00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:09.854
what proportion of the songs
are by a female artist.

00:00:09.854 --> 00:00:12.292
She takes a simple random sample,

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.520
that's what SRS stands for,
of 50 songs on her phone

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.562
and finds that 20 of the songs sampled

00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:20.605
are by a female artist.

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.602
Based on this sample,

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:25.806
which of the following is a 99%

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:27.966
confidence interval for the proportion

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:31.193
of songs on her phone that
are by a female artist?

00:00:31.193 --> 00:00:33.051
So like always pause this video and see

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:35.698
if you can figure it out on your own.

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:40.087
Della has a library of
500 songs right over here.

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:41.898
And she's trying to
figure out the proportion

00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:43.871
that are sung by a female artist.

00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:46.402
She doesn't have the time
to go through all 500 songs

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.676
to figure out the true
population proportion, p.

00:00:49.676 --> 00:00:53.159
So instead she takes a sample of 50 songs,

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.063
n is equal to 50,

00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:58.036
and from that she calculates
a sample proportion,

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:00.079
which we could denote with p hat.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.680
And she finds that 20 out of the 50

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.375
are sung by a female,

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:08.949
20 out of the 50 which
is the same thing as 0.4.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:13.500
And then she wants to construct
a 99% confidence interval.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.474
So before we even go about constructing

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:16.867
the confidence interval,

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.421
you wanna check to make
sure that we're making

00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.417
some valid assumptions or
using a valid technique.

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:25.319
So before we actually calculate
the confidence interval,

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.314
let's just make sure that
our sampling distribution

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:30.520
is not distorted in some way,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.448
and so that we can with confidence

00:01:32.448 --> 00:01:34.328
make a confidence interval.

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.115
So the first condition is to
make sure that your sample

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.274
is truly random.

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:41.411
And they tell us that it's
a simple random sample,

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:43.849
so we'll take their word for it.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.355
The next condition is to assume that

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:50.768
your sampling distribution
of the sample proportions

00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:53.229
is approximately normal.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.155
And there you wanna be
confident or you wanna see

00:01:56.155 --> 00:01:59.661
that in your sample you
have at least 10 successes

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:01.728
and at least 10 failures.

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:03.864
Well here we have 20 successes which means

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.395
well 50 minus 20, we have 30 failures.

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:08.137
So both of those are more than 10,

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:10.505
and so meets that condition.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.734
And then the last condition is,

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:15.799
sometimes called the independence test

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.934
or the independence rule or the 10% rule.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:22.371
If you were doing this
sample with replacement,

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.089
so if she were to look at one song,

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.177
test whether it's a female
or not and then put it back

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:29.406
in her pile and then look at another song,

00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:33.028
then each of those observations
would truly be independent.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.584
But we don't know that.

00:02:34.584 --> 00:02:36.976
In fact we'll assume that she
didn't do it with replacement.

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:38.694
And so if you don't do
it with replacement,

00:02:38.694 --> 00:02:41.573
you can assume rough independence for each

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:44.569
observation of a song
if this is no more than

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.053
10% of the population.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:50.072
And so it looks like it is
exactly 10% of the population,

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:52.626
so Della just squeezes through on our

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:55.087
independence test right over there.

00:02:55.087 --> 00:02:57.363
So that out of the way
let's just think about

00:02:57.363 --> 00:02:58.803
what the confidence
interval's going to be.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:01.218
Well it's going to be her

00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.190
sample proportion plus or minus,

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.163
there's going to be some critical value,

00:03:06.163 --> 00:03:08.787
and this critical value
is going to be dictated by

00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.714
our confidence level we wanna have,

00:03:10.714 --> 00:03:13.083
and then that critical value times

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.707
the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution

00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:18.098
of the sample proportions
which we don't know.

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:19.724
And so instead of having that,

00:03:19.724 --> 00:03:23.787
we use the standard error
of the sample proportion.

00:03:23.787 --> 00:03:26.086
And in this case it would be p hat

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:28.431
times one minus p hat

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:31.218
all of that over n our sample size,

00:03:31.218 --> 00:03:33.400
all of that over 50.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.072
So what's this going to be?

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:37.417
We're gonna get p hat, our
sample proportion here,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.167
is 0.4 plus or minus,

00:03:40.227 --> 00:03:43.408
I'll save the z star
here, our critical value

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:45.312
for a little bit.

00:03:45.312 --> 00:03:46.938
We're gonna use a z-table for that.

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:49.399
And so we're gonna have
0.4 right over there,

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.325
one minus 0.4 is times 0.6

00:03:52.325 --> 00:03:53.992
all of that over 50.

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:56.272
So we can already look at some choices

00:03:56.272 --> 00:03:57.967
that look interesting here.

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:01.241
This choice and this choice
both look interesting,

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:03.284
and the main thing we
have to reason through

00:04:03.284 --> 00:04:05.699
is which one has a correct critical value.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.461
Do we wanna go 1.96 standard
errors above and below

00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.993
our sample proportion?

00:04:10.993 --> 00:04:14.453
Or do we wanna go 2.576 standard errors

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:17.449
above and below our sample proportion?

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.117
And the key is the 99% confidence level.

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:23.672
Now if we have a 99% confidence level,

00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:26.528
one way to think about it is,

00:04:26.528 --> 00:04:28.780
so let me just do my best shot at drawing

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.030
a normal distribution here.

00:04:32.634 --> 00:04:36.280
And so if you want a 99% confidence level,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.159
that means you wanna contain the 99%,

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.919
the middle 99%, under the curve
right over here, that area.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.940
And so if this is 99%,

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.330
then this right over
here is going to be 0.5%,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.697
and this right over here is 0.5%.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:56.864
We want the z value that's
going to leave 0.5% above it.

00:04:57.967 --> 00:05:02.426
And so that's actually going to be 99.5%

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:04.724
is what we wanna look up on the table.

00:05:04.724 --> 00:05:06.559
And that's because many z-tables,

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.184
including the one that
you might see on something

00:05:08.184 --> 00:05:10.065
like an AP Stats exam,

00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:14.430
they will have the area
up to and including,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.635
up to and including, a certain value.

00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:20.235
And so they're not going to
leave this free right over here.

00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:24.624
So let's just look up
99.5% on our z-table.

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:28.307
All right, so let me move
this down so you can see it.

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.095
All right that's our z-table.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:34.274
Let's see we're at 99.
okay it's gonna be right

00:05:34.274 --> 00:05:36.875
in this area right over here.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.458
And so that is 2.5,

00:05:40.892 --> 00:05:42.225
looks like 2.57,

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:44.418
or 2.5,

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.696
2.58 around that.

00:05:49.878 --> 00:05:53.378
And so this right over here is about 2.57,

00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.960
it's between 2.57 and 2.58,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.723
which gives us enough information
to answer this question.

00:05:59.723 --> 00:06:02.324
It's definitely not going to
be this one right over here.

00:06:02.324 --> 00:06:06.491
We have 2.576, which is
indeed between 2.57 and 2.58.

00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:09.917
So let's remind ourselves,

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:12.169
we've been able to construct
our confidence interval

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.818
right over here.

00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:16.720
But what does that actually mean?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.158
That means that if we were
to repeatedly take samples

00:06:19.158 --> 00:06:22.293
of size 50 and repeatedly use

00:06:22.293 --> 00:06:25.730
this technique to construct
confidence intervals,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.121
that roughly 99%

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:30.583
of those intervals constructed this way

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:34.526
are going to contain our
true population parameter.
