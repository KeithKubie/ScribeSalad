the 80s at all?

Right. Wow, this is so
much fun, being back.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.150
And it's kind of what I
wanted to quickly go through.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.040
Everyone wants to know why,
and it is a good question.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.350
I even had to ask myself and think

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.570
about it before I had a good
ready-made answer for it.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.570
Which is why it was -- this is a
great opportunity to go over it

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.380
with you, my extended family.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.680
We're ready to go?

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.380
Well, let me put the next slide up.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:26.180
So, again, why?

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.770
And I wanted a glib,
easy one-sentence answer,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.600
and it actually didn't exist.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.210
So I went back and thought about it

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:37.040
and I realized there were three
things like so often in life

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.690
that all come together,
you didn't expect it,

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.440
and it forms something new, and it
forms a new idea, and it puts you

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.670
in a place like me, that was
never -- I was never going to --

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.690
I didn't think I was
going to go to again.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.020 position:56%
Because when I stopped Bloom County,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.740
I really had never thought
ever, ever, ever going back.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.670
So why all of a sudden
was it a good idea?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.560
And there were -- it's sort
of a triangle of causation,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.020
and the first side of
it, believe it or not,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.280
was one of my children's books
called "Mars Needs Moms,"

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.430
which is -- it is my
favorite of my books,

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.010
short of the new Bill the Cat book.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.450
But it was drawn and written out
of a particular moment in my life

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.740
when I watched my son, who was
-- Milo, who's there, who's --

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.550
the book is -- stars Milo, say
something very, very, very,

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.130
very bad, and unfortunate
to his mother.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.220
And I wrote the book that night

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.050
and spent the next six weeks
illustrating it in a frenzy.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:40.010
And it basically tells
the story of a bunch

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.330
of Martians that come down to Mars.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.720
They don't have moms on Mars.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.020
They need one.

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.610
They think that they know what
moms are good for, and they come

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.930
and they steal Milo's mom,

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.650
who he has just said
some horrible things to,

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.420
and clearly doesn't appreciate
his mom like he should.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.130 position:56%
And this is a look at the book here.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.890
So, as you might expect, it's
fun and silly and whimsical.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:06.960
And he ends up very badly needing
a space helmet that he broke,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.320
and his mom that's on Mars comes
over and takes off her helmet

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.250
and gives it to him
while she slowly dies.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.240
That's the moment that I was
hoping my child might understand

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.520 position:56%
about their parents, that there is
probably only going to be one person

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.690
in their lives, despite what the
songs say, that is willing to die

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.720 position:56%
for you, and it's the very person
you probably said something horrible

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.330
to about 10 minutes ago.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.630
So think about that.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.470
And that was the idea of the book.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:38.940
So this is the movie that it
came out of, or this is the movie

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.730
that came out from my book.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.490
Now I had been spending
years getting movies

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.630
and projects into Hollywood.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.320
This was the only one that
made it actually onto film.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.750
And I thought I should
have a pretty good chance,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.940
giving it to my favorite
film director, Bob Zemeckis,

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.760
with my favorite studio,
Walt Disney.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.540
How could it go wrong?

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.790
So they immediately threw out
my book, told me not to come

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:07.650 position:56%
in the doors, and they redesigned
everything and rewrote everything --

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.420
and this is an old
story in Hollywood,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.920
but it was a new one for me.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.810
And this is -- I wrote this for the
Hollywood Reporter, as I drew it,

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.380
to show my feelings about the
movie, or my character's feelings

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.270
about the movie, which
is abject confusion.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.870
And it nearly brought Disney
Film Studio to its knees,

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:30.080
along with another movie called
Carter of Mars that year.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.690
Mars was not a good thing for
Disney three or four years ago.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.920
So this is the other -- this is
the second side of the triangle.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.870
People think that because
of Donald Trump I came back,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.500
and that would be giving him
far, far too much credit.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.260
Trump -- Trump and I go way back.

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.300
He had a great quote
about me and said

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.870
that I was a poor man's
Doonesbury and that I was --

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.210
I'd probably quit way too late.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.940
I started one of my
older books 20 years ago.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.720
And I didn't think
I'd see him again.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.840
But I think of Donald Trump

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.900
as our zombie reverse
canary in the coal mine.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.550
You know how they used to
carry canaries into a coal mine

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:16.550
and when they stopped singing,
they knew they were in trouble.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.350
We've got a canary that rose from
the dead and started singing,

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.210
and now we're really in trouble.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.640
So this is what -- this is what --

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.360
he just represents the world
that I was about to miss.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.470
The one that created him, and I
didn't want to miss out on it.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.270 position:56%
As far as Donald Trump is concerned,
he is basically untouchable now.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.250
Saturday Night Live should
just quit, and give it up,

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.840
as well all the networks,
and stop, because there's --

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.490
everything we do only
generates more of the cons.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.020
So I may talk around Donald
Trump in the future of the strip,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.130
and I may talk about the
world from whence he comes,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.650
or the effect it is having on
the rest of us, but he's not --

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:04.230
hopefully not going
to get mentioned much.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.920 position:56%
Now I saw this painting and thought,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.390
as an illustrator --
this is a side bar.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.190
You don't see images
of people very often

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:21.390
that pretty much contain everything
about the person in the painting,

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:24.930 position:56%
and this was a very, very successful
-- he requested it painted.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:30.180
He commissioned it and had it
done for his Mar-a-Lago estate.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.160
Everything you need to
know about this man is

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.510
in that painting, and
I couldn't resist.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.200
[ Laughter ]

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.540
I don't think this
has occurred to him.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.030
So yes, Donald Trump
somewhat represents the --

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.160
sort of the second side
of my triangle of return.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.120
But here's the third.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.420
And this is a good one.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.480
This all happened the same time.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.880
Again, the -- a movie that
should've been a success was not,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:04.120 position:56%
and I was disappointed that I had so
little control over my own material.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.620
The world was going in some new
areas that I didn't want to miss

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:13.480
out on as a writer, and then
-- let me tell you this story.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.780
And I'm a story guy.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.080
I'm a narrative guy.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.380
That's why I got into
children's books.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.390
I love a great story.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.170
In comic strips, you
can tell some stories.

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.050
There is some story telling in it.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:28.530
Not as much as I'd like, because it
often doesn't have a good ending.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.100
And now, consider this one.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:36.330
So there's a 10-year-old
boy in 1967, and he's --

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.740
well, this is -- let
me put it this way.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.430
This is what set off my going
back to this side of the triangle,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.070
was the publication
of Go Set A Watchman,

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:49.260
Harper Lee's unfortunate
return to the pages,

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.900
that I think she had
very little to do with,

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.510
and the hullabaloo
that happened about it.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:17:00.840 position:56%
It got me thinking about not only my
own characters, but also this story,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.880
which I'm about to tell you.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:09.090
So that's Harper, that's
her in about 1960, '61.

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:15.910
And in 1967, a 10-year-old boy who
fancied himself a future writer

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.320
and future artist was in his
Los Angeles English class,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.280
and he was told to write
to his favorite author.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.760
And he wrote a letter,
like so many people did

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.460 position:56%
in those days -- this is, I'm sorry.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.760
I'm skipping around.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.560
This is the imagery
that lasted so long

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.760
in my imagination, I'll return to.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.780
But this is the letter that this
10-year-old boy wrote to Harper Lee

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.450
in 1967, and it's fairly standard
as these kind of letters go.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.070
I get them myself from
people, from kids.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:52.930
But at the bottom, you see I
typed "we want more Mockingbird."

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.370
And it was my way of
saying don't stop.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.770
Whatever you do, don't stop.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.220
Bring my characters back.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.380
Don't let them die.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:07.300
So this letter was sent back to me,
as all of ours were in that class

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.330
from Ms. Lee, as her publisher

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.250
in those days sent all
the fan mail that she got.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.480
It was basically returned
back to from whence it came.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.470
She never answered mail.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.730
So I -- the reason that picture
is there because after --

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.560 position:56%
I was disappointed with my imploring
of my favorite author to return

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.240
and not let my favorite characters
die, I went on and when I was 12

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:37.110
or 13, I painted this, and as it
goes down in Bloom County legend,

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.570
it was my first cartoon,
and I didn't realize it.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:43.870
I handed it in as an art
project to Mrs. Lewis' class,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:51.850
and she gave me an F. So I showed
it to my father, who probably is

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.870
to either get credit or blame for
my sense of humor and he looked

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.850
at it, and he said one word.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.820
I put the word back on
underneath that drawing

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.510
and handed it back
into Ms. Lewis and --

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:11.100
[ Laughter ]

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:17.280
Mrs. Lewis gave me an A,
but it was an A slash F,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.730
meaning I had failed the
art project, but her comment

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.530
about the A was, "You're going to
be a very wealthy man one day."

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.090
She hated it, but she
recognized it, as I did,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.820
that something magical happened.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.690
A funny picture with a word,

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.940
either one of them
aren't particularly funny

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.380
until you put them together.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.020
Voila. It's magic that
none of us can explain,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.290
and I pretty much knew
my destiny at that point.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.290
But, believe me, I'm coming
back around to Harper Lee.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:46.740
Don't forget.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:52.350
When it came time to invent a comic
strip in the Washington Post here

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.110
in town, didn't know
what to suggest to me.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:56.410
I didn't know what
I should be doing.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.220
I knew I should be
doing a college cartoon

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.210
that you can't sell to
a regular newspaper.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.530
They said, "Do whatever
the hell you want.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:04.690
Come up with something,
and we'll do it."

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.520
And in those days, we weren't
into marketing so much,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.250
that you would've come up
with a brand or a gimmick

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:14.900
or a more catchy idea
for your strip.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.200
I had nothing.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.720
All I knew is I wanted to have
some funny characters in a place.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.090
What would that place look like?

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.090
Well, it would look like Maycomb
County from To Kill a Mockingbird.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.130
And when it came time to draw the
damn thing, I was just drawing

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.810
To Kill a Mockingbird, and when
I populated it with characters,

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.840 position:56%
it was children, it was parents that
was there to comfort their kids.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:39.520
When it came time to draw a
house, this was in Iowa City,

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.270
I drew the house of --
it's not Maycomb County,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.300
but it probably looks
a little like some

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.160
of the houses in Maycomb County.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.000
Mockingbird was informing my
art, as art should happen,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.450
and I was continuing Mockingbird
in my own way, after my imploration

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.710
of Ms. Lee was getting nowhere.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.680
So, I went on to do Bloom County.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.470
Spent the next 10 years -- 20,
well, 10 years doing Bloom County.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:19.240
Forty years after that little
boy's letter to Ms. Lee in 1967,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.950
I get this piece of fan mail.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.170
"Dear Mr. Breathed, this is
a plea from a dotty old lady

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.730
from others not dotty at all,
please don't shut down Opus.

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.270
Can't you at least
give him a reprieve?

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.890
Opus is simply the best
comic strip of all time."

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.700
And at the bottom, she
says, "Much love, Harper."

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.980
So 40 years later, the woman
who writes nobody, writes back,

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.530
finally writes back the kid that
wrote her at 10, and begged her not

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.180
to quit and not to let
her characters die.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.410
She was not a creature of irony.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:59.690
She probably could never appreciate
this on the level that I did.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:05.340
But when you get a gift from
the gods like this, as a writer,

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.800
you don't easily dismiss it.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.080
And I received these at a
time when I really wasn't

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.010
in a position to act on them.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:17.710
When her book, her new book came
out, and I'd realized that she was

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:22.110
at the end of her life, and
her franchise was threatened

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.450
with a bad move, and her
characters -- when I say franchise,

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.890
I mean her -- the legacy
of her characters.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.090
I thought back about
mine, and I thought back

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:33.420
about the letter she had written me
some years before imploring me not

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.230
to quit, combined with
those other two things,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:39.740
which is my story telling I
wanted to get back control of,

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.490
Hollywood couldn't give it to
me, and great times were coming

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:49.160
to be a comic strip writer.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.680
I decided to go back.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:23:00.380
And the reason that these
are here is because I had

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.100
to rediscover what made
it fun to begin with,

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.160
because I had quit Bloom County
because it had stopped being fun

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.030
in 1989, which is what most people
stop a successful enterprise,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.340
is because they become bored.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.690
And when you become
bored, your guys are going

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.470
to sense it right away
and you don't want that.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.060
So I wanted to get out
before I embarrassed myself.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.500
Bill Watterson, I'm
sure, did the same thing.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.030
Gary Larson did, too.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.340
Unfortunately other strips
haven't taken the cues.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.280
That's the approach that we --

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.290
if we're being responsible
for our readers should take.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.900
So at one time, it was a huge
amount of fun for me to do.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.580 position:56%
So I went back and found -- and I'm
going to throw a few of these images

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.100
that I remember I flagged
just a year ago

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:47.410
to remind myself did
I find this fun.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.810
Did I actually ever
laugh at my own work?

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:52.340
Which we're not supposed to admit,
but let me tell you, when working,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.090
you do laugh at your own work.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:57.540
And it's the only time you really
know, especially in the old days

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.740
when you didn't have Facebook,
that you might be doing it right.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.100
So these are the images --
I always laugh at this one,

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.400
I think Barbara Bush in Bill's
arms is intrinsically funny.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.540
What's going on, the
Vicodin is kicking in.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:17.420
I remember giggling at that at
about 3 a.m. when I drew it.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.510
Chaney's outside with a Molotov
cocktail, happy hour already.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:27.060
[ Laughter ]

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:30.930
Anytime I can put an edited thing
over Opus' butt, I laugh at myself.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:32.730
Various images --

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:37.380
[ Laughter ]

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:43.110
So I realized, and I remembered
that I used to amuse myself,

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.510
which you have to do
in this business.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.510
So I felt much better.

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:57.120
[ Laughter ]

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.420
I forgot about that one.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.390
Here's a coincidence.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:08.310
My son, Milo, is best friends
with Sparky Schulz's grandson,

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.870
and it's not because we
knew each other at all.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.860
He just happened to meet him in
Santa Barbara, and he came home

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.530
and he says, "All right,
I met a guy.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:19.000
I think his grandfather
you might know."

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.900
Now, some statisticians need
to tell me what the chances are

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.550
that my son became best friends
with Sparky Schulz's grandson.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.850
So it's pretty cool.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:30.220
Again, the universe is
telling me something, right?

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.520
A year ago.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.470
So I found my old --
I dug into my files

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:39.530
and found the old original
four panels from 1981,

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:45.690
and I started doing this, and it
was the most terrifying moment

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.960
that I've had as a creator for a
long time, because remembering how

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.460
to fill those four spaces.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.970
And there's something unique

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.580
about a four-panel comic
strip, a three-panel strip.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.780
It's a matter of rhythm and
timing that you can catch

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.450
and then you can lose, and
you forget how to do it.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.040
It's not like riding a bicycle.

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.400
You do forget.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.940
So it was terrifying.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.920
I'd love to say that I was
totally emboldened by going back

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.510
and seeing how I could amuse myself
like an idiot, but I didn't know

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.350
that I could fill those,
which is why when it showed

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.750
up on Facebook a year ago,
you didn't see any press.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.580
There was no stories about it.

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.950
There was no interviews,
which drove, you know,

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.360
my publicist and such crazy.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.910
That normally this
would be a big deal.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.500
You get as much publicity
as you can.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.220
I wanted no publicity.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.520
I didn't know whether I
could fill those four.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.040
So I did the first one.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.340
Some of you remember
this favorite one.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.510
Anyone remember seeing this one?

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:49.110
[ Applause ]

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:54.190
The only reason I mention it is
because for an unsteady author,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:27:00.000
or cartoonist, I got to Panel
Four, I knew exactly how to end it,

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.410
and I knew he should be pulling
up that side of his underwear,

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.310
and it was 1983 all over again.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.140
It was as if time had
never happened.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.590
I mean, I'm 59 now, I was 22
when I did this stuff originally.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:20.450 position:56%
So now it's been updated, and
you're seeing hopefully the same DNA

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:26.460
that was in the strip in the 80s,
but with a different twist to it.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.890
I'd like to think so.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.470 position:56%
So I've only got a few minutes left,

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.770
and I'm going to show the
secret Watterson letters.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.200
Now some of you -- has anyone been
to Comic Con in the last few years?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.890
I did this there and it got
infamous and I got in a whole lot

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.820
of legal trouble about it.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.820
And we probably have some kids
here, so I'm going to have to zoom

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.200
through a couple of
slides really fast.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.070
If any of you wonder
what cartoonists do

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.180
when they're not doing their
strip, they write to each other.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.340
In the old days we did, anyway.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:05.490
And Bill Watterson and I
were friends via snail mail

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:10.250 position:56%
on actual onionskin paper for dozens
and dozens and dozens of pieces

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.680
of mail, because I had successfully
got myself out of the contract

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.600
for my syndicate and
gotten my ownership back.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.270
He was desperately trying to do it.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.380
And he was not getting success.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:24.730
He was a very, very unhappy guy.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.670
So we had a lot of letters.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.920
Cartoonists like to draw on
the bottom of their letters

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.590
to each other, and that's when
their inner demons come out.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:35.070
So you're about to see some of the
letters that Bill Watterson wrote

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.300
to me, and with the
illustrations on the bottom,

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.110
just to see what these guys are
really like deep down inside.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:46.740
Again, these are, to me, I
am the object of this stuff.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:52.260 position:56%
I am the target, more specifically,
and you'll see that the sweet Calvin

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:58.020 position:56%
and Hobbes creator had a side to him
that you might not have known about.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.100
And you have to know -- a
little bit of subtext is

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.090
that I had won a Pulitzer prize,
I had a TV special recently,

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:08.550
and he was dead set on
mocking me for both,

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.180
largely because I was also known
for spending a lot of the money

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.000
on fast speed boats,
which is about as opposite

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.350
of the things he could imagine
doing, since he lived on a bicycle.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.130
So this is after the
Christmas special.

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.030
Again, this is his drawings to me,

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:27.740
so everything here is
drawn by Watterson.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.040
Go ahead and quote scripture.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.870
This is real holiday entertainment.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.630
This is after the "A Wish For Wings

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.520
That Work" Christmas
special in 1987.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.180
He didn't appreciate -- he didn't
think the hairball should be in it.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.150
Now this is me in the boat.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.910
He's drawing the syndicate guy
on the dock with the money,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.570
and I'm stuffing the
money into my boat,

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.970
kicking my cartoon characters
off while I go spend the money

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.270
from the syndicate boss.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.580
And he's saying, "Lazy freeloaders!

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.220
I said none of you ride until
your faces are on boxer shorts!"

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.040
Remember, he sold nothing
in his entire career.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.620
Not a single thing with
Calvin and Hobbes on it.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.360
And the syndicate guy is going,
"Hee hee, I'll have this guy back

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.100
in the palm of my hand in no time."

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.340
This says everything
about Bill at the time.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.340
And there's, again, he's drawing
me as Opus in my speed boat,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:21.110
and Opus -- and again, this is
the reflection on the special.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.690
So I sound like a mixture of
Woody Woodpecker and Donald Duck.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:24.990
Heck, it's worth it.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.430
You know what was cool is he
found a picture of my boat

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.820
and he completely nailed the
stripe that was on the side of it.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.830
That's -- so here he is.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.530
He's got my cartoon, my
character saying to Hobbes,

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.680
"Quit the daily papers like I did.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.980
Buy a boat.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.280
Blow all your savings.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.100
When you run out of gas
money, sell your home and move

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:46.220
to a smelly pier in Seattle."

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.510
Which is exactly what I did.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:53.690
[ Laughter ]

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.510
Now -- no, no no!

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:58.810
This is -- it's good.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.270
It's all good.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.580
This is the Bill Watterson
you thought you knew.

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:09.860
Now I think -- I think
the dodgy one's coming up.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.570
Oh, no. Here's the next one.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:17.890
So Ronald Reagan had called
me in 1982 on the phone,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.800
and nearly woke me up with a
compliment about that week's strip,

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.580
because it had Nancy drawn in it.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.120
That's the short -- long -- a
very short story and a long --

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.890
short version of a long story.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:32.170
So it got in the press, and I
did tell -- it was a true story.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:36.390
No one believes it that when
I answered the phone to talk

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:38.440
to President Reagan, I
didn't know it was him.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.300
I said, "Hello," and they said,
"Please hold for the President."

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:46.560
And he gets on and Michael has a
better Reagan version than I do,

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.960
so I won't try it,
but he said, "Hello.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.860 position:56%
I just wanted to tell you how much
I liked the strip this last Sunday."

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.980
And I said, "Mr. President,
I think you should know,

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.510
I'm not wearing any
pants right now."

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:02.620
[ Laughter ]

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.510
So he heard that story, and
this is his version of it.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:18.280
[ Laughter ]

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.670
Don't you think that I could sell
these one day and put my kids

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:24.230
through school on this stuff?

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.840
So the last -- the
last letter that I got

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.030
from him before he went off
the grid, and he's been gone.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.510
I never heard from him again.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.990
The last one was this, and I
think it's okay to show you.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.030
It's Opus drawing -- now some of
you know who the lady is on top.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:46.030
It's Daisy Mae from Li'l
Abner, if you go way back.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.430
He says, Opus is saying, "Oh,
a few more lines, la-da-da.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.600
I'll be back on my
boat, la-da-da-da-da.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.870
Another Pulitzer is good as mine."

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.260
So I -- I finished that
drawing and sent it back to him.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.460
So I'm going to go through
it real quick before it ends

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.030
up on social media.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.830
And there it is.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:16.210
[ Laughter ]

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.680
I would love to let you
linger on that for a moment,

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.100
because it's really a good job.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.710
It's really a great drawing.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.070
So I got him back.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:30.390
If some of you have read Facebook,
I got him back April Fool's Day

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:34.660
when I drew Calvin and Hobbes
instead of Bloom County that day,

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.160
and as I will be for
every April Fool's

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:40.030
for the next 10 years, by the way.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.110
Hoping to smoke him
out, and I did not.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:46.850
I don't know what he's doing, but
he's -- he refuses to surface.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:52.260
So yes, I'm back having fun, and
how could I not be having fun?

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:56.230
Facebook, the changes are legion

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:59.230
between the old world
and the new with this.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:03.750
I think that I'm trying this
for the first time with a foot

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.820
from the old days and
newspapers onto digital media.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.410
I had to make a decision a year
ago whether I go back to newspapers

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:12.690
and make a crap load of money,
or do it for free on Facebook,

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.550
and have freedom and talk
to all of you within an hour

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:18.440
of drawing the strip, and
hearing what you think about it,

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.030
and your stories from your
background and your kids

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.980
and your families, and I
went with the Facebook.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:25.560
Now I know it's limiting.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.430
Some of you aren't on Facebook.

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:29.350
We're going to come
up with some paradigms

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.070
so there's some other options.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.530
But I'm afraid we're not
going to newspapers again.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.490
I don't think I could ever
be edited by the editor

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:40.720 position:56%
of the Salt Lake City Tribune again.

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.460
So thank you so --
we're here for books,

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.680
and I know I've got to wrap up.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.030
I am -- I have thrown the gauntlet
down as a challenge to myself.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.580 position:56%
Can I do a picture book for
children, and you all, but for kids,

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:00.810
starring the least predictably
appropriate character

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.280
for children's literature
I could come up with.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.820
And I'm going to try
it with Bill the Cat.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.950
You should know that I was
very well edited on this book.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:13.580
Any good author should
also be careful

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:14.960
to stay true to his character.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.110
You're often pulled off of
character for the sake of a gag

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.290
or a story line, and you're not
servicing the character's real

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.700
personality by doing it.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.090
I found myself going
back to old instincts

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:33.420
as I was painting this book,
about where Bill came from,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:40.820
by putting emotion and
personality into my lead character.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.870
Bill the Cat has no emotion,
he has no personality,

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.570 position:56%
he is a blank slate, he is a cipher.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:50.160
And I kept, by instinct,
having his eyes, even just --

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:53.570
his eyeballs come together as
if he's focusing on something,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:55.100
and I get a note back
from my editor, "You know,

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.860
you've got to get his focus on.

00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.340
He's got to look like he's
completely nearly comatose."

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:01.940
And he was correct.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.260
Bill works, I believe,
maybe you can tell me better

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.100
than I can, as a cipher.

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.200
We react to him.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.650
We project everything
onto poor Bill.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.810
If we love him, it's
probably because we're lonely.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.880
It's not because Bill
is so loveable.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.310
And how do you design that into
a picture book for children

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.800
in telling them something maybe a
little bit of a lesson at the end.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.330
So we wrote a simple origin story
for Bill that little Binkley

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:32.630
at age 4 or 5 finds the animal of
his dream at an animal shelter.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:35.770
It gets cruelly taken away
and sent to the North Pole

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.130
by Cat X Kitty Shoppers
International.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:43.560
He loses his cat and he spends
years dreaming about him.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.430
This caused me untold amount
of trouble from Disney

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.960 position:56%
when I put Winnie the Pooh in there.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.660
And we decided to ignore them.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.210
But that's little Binkley
with his version

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.210
of the missing Bill the
Cat on top of his head.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.150
I will tell you that there in the
far left of the painting there used

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.720
to be a Darth Vader doll.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.380
They did succeed in
getting me to pull that off

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.660
with a lawsuit from Lucas Arts.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.160
So they didn't think it
was as funny as Disney did.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:14.270
So Bill gets -- Bill goes off
into a great adventure for years.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:17.780 position:56%
Slips into a society and a
civilization that thinks he's a god,

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:23.090
and they build him pyramids, and
eventually aliens come and grab him

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.670
and they lure him away
from his life of ease.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:31.040
And he's delivered back to
Opus, who just recently met --

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.390
or just met him years before as
he's passing through Bloom County.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.800 position:56%
And Opus had given him his underwear
with the words Opus written in it,

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:42.370
which the aliens saw, read,
recognized as the source

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:45.170 position:56%
of where this Bill -- where this cat
should go back to, brought him back

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:50.340
to Opus, and Opus journeys
back via every way he can

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:53.650
to bring Bill the Cat
back to the little boy

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:57.150
who loved him or needs to love him.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:03.700
And he returns to Bloom County in
the end of the book, just as me

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.460
and all the rest of
you are doing, too.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.460
So I thought it was
a nice way to end.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.480
And I don't know if I have
any time for any questions,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.690
but I appreciate you being here.

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:20.940
Do we have to exit within a few
minutes, or do I have five minutes?

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.900
You can talk.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.730
Okay, a few minutes.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.400
Yeah, so a couple questions
and then I'll send you back

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.410
on your way, and hope
you enjoyed it.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:37.970
Oh, by the way, the -- some of the
videos you saw were Opus tests done

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.630
over the years as they tried
to bring him to the movies.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.060
They were never going to succeed.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.910
You can see some of the problems in
that you're trying to bring a voice

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:49.430
and a personality to
something that each

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:51.020
of you have already
done within your head.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.670
It's a hat trick.

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.260
It's very tough.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.370
The first one had -- anyone
know who was narrating?

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.020
Who was playing the director?

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.320
John Cleese, that's right.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.760
A friend of mine I picked up
on the Santa Barbara beach

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.670
like a drifter and
we became friends.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.710
The second one, does anyone
know who the voice of Opus was

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:12.750
in the second one when he was
pulling the kid's pants down?

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.250
Hyde Pierce, that's right.

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.640
Probably the best voice
that we tested,

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.990
and we tested hundreds of people.

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:25.730
Every -- we were going all
the way back to the 80s

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.850
when Steven Spielberg tried
his best, and it [inaudible].

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:33.320
I can tell you there won't
be a Bloom County movie,

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:38.750
and there won't be an Opus movie,
largely because of my experience

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:44.320
in Hollywood already, but as
witnessed by the last memo I got

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:53.090
from -- from the guys
running the studio at Miramax,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.760
and I won't even mention
them by name,

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.510
the Weinstein brothers, actually.

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:02.060
[ Laughter ]

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.150
He spent years, five years we
spent trying to figure out how

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.910
to please them and get them to
sign off of on an Opus movie,

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:12.900
and finally the last memo I got,
and I am not making this up,

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.490
"Lose the voice from the penguin.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.990
It's only going to
confuse the audience."

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:19.150
So he didn't want Opus
to talk at all.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.950
So I knew that actually
the gods were speaking,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.030
and this was not to be.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.850
So it should be left
to the comic world,

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:28.600
which is where I've returned to.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.160
A question, yeah, after
I dangled an opportunity.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.840
Yes?

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.210
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.640
Oh, a microphone, I
didn't know there was one.

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.940
I can't see it.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.240
Great.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:42.020
&gt;&gt; So I saw in your
early Facebook posts,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.060
one of your first pictures
you put up was you working

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.340
on a computer drawing
your first cartoon.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.640
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.950
&gt;&gt; Back as Bloom County 2015.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.250
&gt;&gt; A year ago.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I was curious whether

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.860 position:56%
or not you're still actually putting
any pen to paper in your process,

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:02.320
or if it's, at this
point, your thought --

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.040
&gt;&gt; Sold out to digital, totally.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.680
I have, I still have
hundreds of sketchbooks.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:15.510
Everything starts as a pencil
sketch, and then I either scan

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.460
or I move it to the computer
and I draw on the computer.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.230
And that's just allowed me
to do it on schedule now.

00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:26.370
And I'm being told
that we're out of time.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.170
So --

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:31.100
[ Applause ]

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.870
That's the big question.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.170
Thank you.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.880
I think that I'm as happy as you
are that we're doing this again.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.020 position:56%
We're back together at Bloom County.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.640
I hope you're enjoying
it as much as I am,

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.180
and you need to know I'm
really having a good time.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.700
So thank you very much.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.000
I'll see you next year.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:55.860

of the Library of Congress.
