sense is that that's not what we should
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.069
sense is that that's not what we should
be striving for first of all when you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
be striving for first of all when you
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.590

looking for often is very short-lived I
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.950

you may have be able to connect this
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.289
you may have be able to connect this
with your own experience that people who

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
with your own experience that people who
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.390
with your own experience that people who
go to other areas of the world that are

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
go to other areas of the world that are
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.550

much less affluent than ours where
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.010
much less affluent than ours where
people have much less are very struck by

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
people have much less are very struck by
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990
people have much less are very struck by
the fact that people are more content

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
the fact that people are more content
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.850
the fact that people are more content
and there seems to be a very clear

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
and there seems to be a very clear
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.520
and there seems to be a very clear
correlation between material affluence

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
correlation between material affluence
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.319
correlation between material affluence
and deteriorating contentment that's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
and deteriorating contentment that's
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990
and deteriorating contentment that's
just a fascinating observation the more

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
just a fascinating observation the more
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700
just a fascinating observation the more
people have the less content they seem

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
people have the less content they seem
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.210
people have the less content they seem
to be

to be

and I'd also would emphasize that I

all the time everything in our
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.770
all the time everything in our
experience varies and I think it is good

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
experience varies and I think it is good
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109
experience varies and I think it is good
to be accepting of these natural cycles

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
to be accepting of these natural cycles
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.810
to be accepting of these natural cycles
and mood that doesn't mean you mean

back up here and you don't want to get
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160
back up here and you don't want to get
stuck in the bottom but I think it is

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
stuck in the bottom but I think it is
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.340
stuck in the bottom but I think it is
natural to cycle through this also I've

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
natural to cycle through this also I've
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.289

come across some other very interesting

research from the relatively new field
of evolutionary psychology which

of evolutionary psychology which
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.949
of evolutionary psychology which

essence of depression is a very strong
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.179

you know which lead is negative it makes

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709
you know which lead is negative it makes

that's called depressive rumination in

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670
that's called depressive rumination in
 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520
that's called depressive rumination in
psychology and it's seen as being a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
psychology and it's seen as being a
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.430
psychology and it's seen as being a
pathological trait but the evolutionary

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
pathological trait but the evolutionary
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.410
pathological trait but the evolutionary
psychologists suggest that that's

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420
psychologists suggest that that's
 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.920
psychologists suggest that that's
exactly the mental strategy that favors

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930
exactly the mental strategy that favors
 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.860
exactly the mental strategy that favors
problem solving and creativity and that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
problem solving and creativity and that
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.929
problem solving and creativity and that
people who do this are you know either

people who do this are you know either
 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.399
people who do this are you know either
you're faced with a really difficult

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409
you're faced with a really difficult
 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.890
you're faced with a really difficult
problem you sort of can't stop thinking

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
problem you sort of can't stop thinking
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.179
problem you sort of can't stop thinking
about you chew it over and over until

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189
about you chew it over and over until
 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.039
about you chew it over and over until
you either decide there's no solution

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049
you either decide there's no solution
 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.589
you either decide there's no solution
give up or you find the solution and so

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599
give up or you find the solution and so
 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.500
give up or you find the solution and so
it may be that evolution favoured this

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
it may be that evolution favoured this
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.259
it may be that evolution favoured this
kind of trait in us and that may also

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269
kind of trait in us and that may also
 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.990
kind of trait in us and that may also
help explain why we see such a strong

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000
help explain why we see such a strong
 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.699
help explain why we see such a strong
correlation between depression and

is there such a strong association
