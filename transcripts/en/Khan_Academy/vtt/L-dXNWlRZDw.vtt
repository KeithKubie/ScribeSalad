00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.570
- [Instructor] In this
video, we are going to focus

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.900
even more on the idea of evolution.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.470
We introduce it in other videos,

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.450
but here were really
gonna focus on what it is

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.380
and what it isn't.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.710
And as I've mentioned before,
it's a super important idea.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.850
If you were to try to understand
life on another planet,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.140
well you would have to
understand how evolution works.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.850
And so evolution as we know it is based

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.260
on two underlying principles.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.060
It's based on a principle
that in a population

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.313
of a species, that there is variation.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.120
That there's variation in the phenotype,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.560
in the traits that that population has.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.330
Now the other idea that's
related to that variation

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.593
is that you have natural selection.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.300
Natural selection, if
someone tries to explain

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.090
evolution without variation
and natural selection,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.470
they might not be explaining evolution,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.910
they might be explaining something else.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.500
So this idea, so if I have
a population of circles,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.680
some of the circles are blue circles,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.593
some are yellow circles,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.850
yellow circles, some are pink circles;

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.770
and there are, for sure, traits,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.990
there are phenotypes that
might not have any bearing

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.940
on an organism's ability
to survive or reproduce.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.730
In that case, that variation
would probably continue.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.340
But there will be some
variations, some phenotypes;

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.170
remember, phenotypes is what's expressed

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.470
versus genotypes which
are the actual genes,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
the actual alleles that an organism has.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.090
But evolution occurs because,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.230
depending where we are in our environment

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.980
and the time and space of our environment,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.020
certain phenotypes might be slightly more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.700
advantageous than others.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.730
They might make it slightly more likely

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.440
that the organism will
survive and reproduce,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.840
slightly less likely that it will die

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.560
or not be able to reproduce.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.770
And so if we said these
circles were living things,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.830
and let's say the environment
that they happen to be in

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.140
right now, it's that much more likely

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.670
for them to reproduce and survive

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.230
if they're warmer colors, if
they are an orange or a pink

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.610
verus a blue.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.040
So then in your next generation,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.060
the yellows and the pinks
are more likely to reproduce,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.040
and so they might reproduce
a little bit more.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.950
Let me put some of the pinks in there.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.050
They're going to reproduce
a little bit more.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.840
And the blues might have
a lower probability,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.340
or would have, based on
this situation I described,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.210
of reproducing.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.090
So you'll still have some blues,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.760
but you might have fewer blues.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.210
And then this process could keep going on

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.590
for a very, very, very, very long time.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.230
And at some point you might
see only pinks and yellows.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.640
And this is only one
phenotype that we're talking

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.900
about being selected for.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.340
There might be another
one, if we're talking about

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.270
circles it might be
roundness or whatever else.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.190
So the key thing is is
you need that variation.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.280
And depending on where
in time and space you are

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.210
in that environment, that
some of those variations,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.720
some of those phenotypes,
the exhibited traits,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.000
might make you more
successful at reproducing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.070
and passing on that
trait to your offspring.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.540
And I really wanna contrast
this with what some

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.720
people think of when
they think of evolution.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.110
Some people think that
evolution is a process

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.940
of going from basic to advanced.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.600
And the reason why we
sometimes think this is

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.610
we think of many of the
early organisms on Earth

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.110
maybe being unicellular organisms.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.930
And now we have these complex
animals like ourselves

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.393
that we consider much more
advanced than those things,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.430
we have trillions of cells.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.470
But remember, unicellular
organisms continue

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.910
to be very successful even today.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.903
And some of them aren't
all to more advanced

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.310
than things that might've existed, say,

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.900
500 million years ago, or
even a billion years ago.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.920
And so even though these things might be

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.880
the product of evolution, all it says is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.620
that overtime you have this variation,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.260
and then based on which
variations, which phenotypes,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.160
were more suited to their environment,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.960
those are the ones that were
able to pass on their traits.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.220
Another place where this
misconception comes from

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.010
is you've seen these
diagrams where you have

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.720
these apes where the first apes are

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.480
kind of hunched over, and
then they get upright,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.530
or more and more upright.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.680
And eventually you see a walking person,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.010
and we are officially apes as well.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.670
And we tend to think that
we are pretty advanced,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.600
we do things like wear hats and things.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.390
And so we say, oh yeah, it's going from

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.810
primitive to advanced,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.600
or from basic to advanced.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.100
But that is not the case.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.620
Remember, even today's world, we aren't

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.560
the end of evolution.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.090
Even in our world, there's many animals

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.120
in the animal kingdom that
are at all different levels

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.870
of complexity or if we wanna think about

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.200
intelligence or sophistication.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.780
And there could, for
sure, be a reality where

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.820
you could imagine a human
colony goes to another planet,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.520
and it's actually suitable
to be more hunched over.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.690
In which case, the human
beings, the variant,

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.500
the variations of humans who
are better at hunching over

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.670
might be more successful.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.880
Maybe they need to go into these tunnels

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.470
to find some animals to
eat or whatever else,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.303
or to farm.

00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:29.460
And then on that planet,
that variation might be

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.470
the one that wins out.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.800
Now another misconception that people have

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.530
with evolution is, when they hear it,

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.610
they kinda think, hey, this might be due

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.120
to the effort of an
animal over its lifetime.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.060
Some of the early
explanations that folks gave

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.900
before Darwin of why a
giraffe, for example,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.580
has a long neck,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.230
some people believe that, hey,
some of the early giraffes

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.350
might've been straining to
get leaves on tall trees,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.350
and that straining somehow
stretched out their necks,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.630
and somehow they might've
been able to pass that on

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.080
to their offspring.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.090
This is not the case.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.690
The explanation consisted
with our understanding

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.210
of evolution is that you
would've had a population

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.470
of giraffe ancestors,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.399
and they would've had variation in their,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.940
in their neck length.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.800
And because of the
environment that they happen

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.130
to be in for that population,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.370
the variance that had longer neck lengths

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.250
would have been able to have a slightly

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.680
higher probability of
reproducing and surviving.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.540
And so overtime, those longer necks

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.710
became more predominant in the population.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.600
And at some point, you might say,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.030
well why don't giraffe neck lengths

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.000
become indefinitely tall?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.810
Well that's because at some the variations

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.930
that had super long
necks, even longer than

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.690
the giraffes we had today,
that might've created

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.720
some other difficulties
making it harder for them

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.070
to survive and reproduce.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.860
Maybe their heats weren't strong enough

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.970
and so they died of heart attacks.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.610
Or maybe it was more
difficult to escape predators

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.920
for the variations where
the necks were too long.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.240
And so it's really important to recognize

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.750
that evolution is a byproduct

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.340
of variation that happens in populations

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.080
and then natural selection,
due to the environment,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.920
on those variations.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.750
And they act on the phenotype,

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.340
they act on the exhibited
traits that are shown.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.720
Evolution is not necessarily a process

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.060
going from basic to advanced.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.290
And it's not due to an individual organism

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.610
somehow exercising or training

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.133
itself to the environment that it's in.
