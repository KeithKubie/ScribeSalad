00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:08.058
In tropical seas,

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:09.967
flying fish leap out of the water,

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.457
gliding for up to 200 meters 
using wing-like fins,

00:00:13.457 --> 00:00:16.058
before dipping back into the sea.

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.680
In the Indo-Pacific,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.540
a hunting sailfish can reach speeds 
of 110 kilometers per hour.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.888
That’s 11 times faster than Olympic 
swimming champion Michael Phelps.

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.187
It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin 
like a brake,

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:34.587
grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim.

00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:38.427
Each of these physical feats is made 
possible by a fish’s form,

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:44.827
which in most species is a smooth, 
elongated body, fins, and a tail.

00:00:44.827 --> 00:00:48.473
These features are shared across thousands
of fish species,

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:54.868
each introducing its own variations on
the theme to survive in unique habitats.

00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:57.469
What makes these features so
commonplace in fish,

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.339
and what does it reveal about the more 
than 33,000 fish species

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.007
that inhabit earth’s rivers, 
lakes, and seas?

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.798
Fish can be split into two main groups,

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:10.206
according to the type 
of motion they favor.

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:13.878
The first is body 
and caudal fin driven motion,

00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:19.207
and most fish species, about 85%, 
fall into this group.

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:22.739
Here, the body and tail 
are the primary propelling forces,

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:26.769
with fins mainly playing 
a stabilizing and steering role.

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:29.728
This configuration suits 
many open-water species,

00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:34.778
which need speed, thrust and control for
constant, efficient swimming.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:37.217
Eels lie at one extreme of this group.

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:39.878
Known as anguilliform swimmers,

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:45.038
their entire bodies undulate to generate 
a wave-like motion.

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:47.268
Compared to anguilliform fish,

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:51.559
species like salmon and trout, 
known as subcarangiforms,

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:54.983
use about two-thirds of their body mass
to generate motion,

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.953
while carangiform swimmers, 
such as mackerel,

00:01:57.953 --> 00:01:59.879
only use about a third.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.927
Typically, the less of its mass a fish 
uses to generate motion,

00:02:02.927 --> 00:02:07.115
the more streamlined its shape.

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:13.179
At the other end of the spectrum from eels
are ostraciiform species like boxfish,

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:15.597
and thunniform swimmers like tuna.

00:02:15.597 --> 00:02:21.100
In these fish, the tails, 
also known as caudal fins, do the work.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.737
A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons 
to multiple muscles in its body.

00:02:25.737 --> 00:02:28.138
It powers the body like an engine,

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.408
forcefully catapulting
the bullet-like fish

00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:35.213
to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour.

00:02:35.213 --> 00:02:39.711
The second major fish group relies 
on median and paired fin motion,

00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.581
meaning they’re propelled through the 
water predominantly by their fins.

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.001
Fins allow fine-tuned movement 
at slow speeds,

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.709
so this propulsion 
is typically found in fish

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.719
that have to navigate complex habitats.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.897
Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,
fall into this group;

00:02:55.897 --> 00:03:01.229
using their huge pectoral fins, they can
lift themselves swiftly off the sea floor.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.987
That conveniently allows them 
to inhabit shallow seas

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:06.809
without being buffeted about by waves.

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.708
Similarly, shallow-water flatfish 
use their entire bodies

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:15.267
as one big fin to hoist 
themselves up off the sand.

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.158
Ocean sunfish lack tails,

00:03:17.158 --> 00:03:22.588
so they move around slowly by beating 
their wing-like median fins instead.

00:03:22.588 --> 00:03:25.907
Similar movements are shared 
by many reef species,

00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:27.688
like the queen angelfish,

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:28.997
surgeonfish,

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:30.779
and wrasse.

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.577
Their focus on fins has taken 
the demand off their bodies,

00:03:33.577 --> 00:03:39.649
many of which have consequently 
evolved into unusual and inventive shapes.

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:44.137
There are fishes within both groups 
that seem to be outliers.

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:45.427
But if you look closer,

00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:48.008
you’ll notice that these 
common traits are disguised.

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:52.967
Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear 
fish-shaped in any conventional way,

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:57.018
yet they use their flexible 
dorsal fins as makeshift tails.

00:03:57.018 --> 00:04:00.147
A pufferfish may occasionally 
look more like a lethal balloon,

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:04.828
but if it needs to swim rapidly,
it’ll retract its spines.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.967
Handfish look like they have legs,

00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:10.439
but really these limb-like 
structures are fins,

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.157
modified to help them 
amble across the sea floor.

00:04:14.157 --> 00:04:17.288
For fish, motion underpins survival,

00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:21.551
so it’s become a huge evolutionary 
driver of form.

00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:24.028
The widespread features of fish 
have been maintained

00:04:24.028 --> 00:04:26.750
across tens of thousands of fish species,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.347
not to mention other 
ocean-dwelling animals,

00:04:29.347 --> 00:04:30.267
like penguins,

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:31.256
dolphins,

00:04:31.256 --> 00:04:32.279
sea slugs,

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.670
and squids.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.688
And that’s precisely because 
they’ve proven so successful.
