00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Smoothing was the only planner that actually really worked in a continuous domain.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Everything else was very discrete.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Our breadth-first, A-star, and dynamic programming all find the optimal solution.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Dynamic programming is the only one that's universal,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and smoothing is the only local operation

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
whereas those over here all optimize a global planning problem.
