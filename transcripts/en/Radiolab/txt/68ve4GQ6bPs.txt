Speaker 1:          00:02          Okay, I'll do that. Okay, let me do one more time. Three, two, one. This is Tim Howard and today on radiolab we've been talking about black boxes and the next story started with a radio piece that I heard at the third coast international audio festival. There were a lot of incredible stories, but there was this one called keep them guessing that I just loved and I couldn't get it out of my head. So I sat jad and Robert Down in our little black box of a studio on deep look. Tim Howard, I'm not sure. I like your tone. Okay. And I connected them with the guy who made the piece. Hello.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39          I hear the sound of what sounds like another room. Does he sound like me now? Oh, his name is Jesse Cox. Wow. You spent so close. Can See your foot far away. He's actually in Australia where everybody is because they're upside down from the rest of us. They are very, very likely to fall into the sky. You have as Australians worked out, down to the tee, rub it. I'm gripping on with my hands and the table. That's what we speak. You'll get. Just to start, I mean, maybe just introduce us to your grandparents. Who are they? Well, my, my grandparents were mind readers.

Speaker 2:          01:11          Mm.

Speaker 1:          01:11          On the radio. Really? Yeah. You don't have to explain that on what are they? What are their names? First? Leslie, Leslie Pennington and Sydney Pennington. Piddington. He didn't and they had a radio show. Yeah. The show was called the pediatricians or the amazing Penningtons and was on the BBC radio in the 1950s now Jesse told us that for most of his life he didn't know this. I guess the reason was that my grandfather and my grandmother divorced well before I was born, and then his grandpa, he died when I was four or five. Then his grandma remarried, so nobody talked about it. Crazily enough, I knew that my grandparents had been famous and my grandma was an actress, that it really wasn't until I was a teenager and a radio produce actually discovered by accident that my grandma was alive. I went, what? They still have Pennington alive.

Speaker 1:          02:03          The reporter calls up his grandma's like, Hey, can I interview you? And my grandma was hesitant. She was like, Oh, I'm not sure. I'll be very good. I can try and remember, and I came and interviewed her and when it went to air, when it got broadcast, we all drove up to his grandma's house and listened to it around the radio that they would have back in the 1950s and heard the story and that's when Jesse discovered that his grandparents, Leslie and Sidney Pennington one time had an audience of 20 million people. Yeah. Basically the population of Australia was listening to my grandparents back in the 1950s no way. I was like, yeah, why? Why don't I know this is, this is in my family and why? Why don't I know it? But he says, it was really when he sat down and listened to the original broadcasts, what's left to them? Two hours of old BBC recordings that survived today because my grandparents pirated them from the BBC back in 1950 he says, it wasn't until he heard those tapes that I went, wow, tell us this story. Tell us what you heard that made you go, wow. Well

Speaker 2:          03:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:11          you hear these very dramatic theme song and this old BBC voice comes into the tape and says,

Speaker 2:          03:18          what do you mean? Maybe some gentlemen, we present the fitting

Speaker 1:          03:23          and the music guys are all very, very dramatic, and then the narrator sets the scene for you,

Speaker 3:          03:29          but eating too old by that Herman here and the other one pick at least two. They're right in the middle of the west end of London.

Speaker 1:          03:34          It was done in front of a live audience and then you hear my grandfather's voice. Well, as Steven Grandpa had just told you, live has been quite Insightly. Exciting for us. He was a stutterer out back. We've had a lot more letters. There were all these things that meant it should never have worked on radio. Anyhow, anyhow, the night my grandfather was in the studio on the stage and my grandma, I'm sorry to say Leslie isn't here, she was often somewhere dramatic as in not in the studio somewhere exotic. One time she was in a dive in the diving bell. She was underwater at the bottom of a test tank. One time she was in the tower of London. Right. You're there unless they end up town. Yes, I am here and I remember pinning good it here in the Piccadilly studio and Leslie was in the Tower of London. So, so your, your grandpa's on stage and your grandma you're saying is in a tower by phone or no, she's in front of, she's in front of a microphone now. This is back in the time when microphones were the size of small melons. Very shortly there'd be a microphone set up in the Tower of London. Connected live. Yeah. My grandfather then comes on the year and sets up a series of telepathy tests that they go into enact.

Speaker 3:          04:41          I know I down to work, I will attempt to transmit that to Leslie on a line of print. I selected from a number of books on the table here in the studio.

Speaker 1:          04:50          So there was a famous one called the book test and this is where a member of the audience would come up to the stage and there'd be a pile of books and they'd randomly pick up a book randomly opened to a page and point to a line.

Speaker 3:          05:02          Would you read out the line to the listening audience? The lines elected is be abandon as the electrician said that they would have no color now,

Speaker 1:          05:16          completely random bit of tech selected out of a stack of books after the texts had been chosen and only then

Speaker 3:          05:22          I should now call in the tower of London. They would connect to his grandma Leslie in the Justin moment at the sound of the Gong, I want your complete silence, your sympathy and your cooperation. Now concentrate on the line while I attempt to transmit it to Leslie

Speaker 1:          05:40          and a Gong would sound and he'd kind of very dramatically Farro his brow. And the next thing you heard was my grandmother. It's sort of fry, old gentle voice and she start to unpick what was being transmitted to her.

Speaker 4:          06:05          It's something to do.

Speaker 2:          06:09          Okay.

Speaker 4:          06:10          And and Christian. There's something about light and electricians

Speaker 2:          06:17          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:18          Remember that line again was

Speaker 5:          06:19          the abandon. I see electrician said that they would have no column. If you concentrate on the word

Speaker 2:          06:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:30          like being Lyft, people being Lyft,

Speaker 1:          06:33          it's amazing to listen to over 60 years later listening to those tapes, I'm still on the edge of my seat,

Speaker 4:          06:39          abandoned that knocked light, concentrate on the word like light and right at the end, I think the whole line is abandoned as the electricians said, they would not be current

Speaker 5:          07:06          via abandon as the electrician said that they would have no color

Speaker 2:          07:13          [inaudible] almost every time it would be 100% correct. Totally remarkable. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:24          it just was this feeling inside you that you get going, hang on. What? When Jessie heard those broadcasts, his obvious question was how did they do that? Well, this is the question that I have wanted to know for so long and there'll be many, many theories. I mean, they used to get letters in from listeners all the time. There's this box of press clippings we found at the bottom of my grandma's closet and we started going through these press clippings and there were wild theories, like little morse code transmitters in their teeth. Yeah, I mean, one of the theories I quite liked with [inaudible] who wrote in saying there was a green man that ran between the shoulders and he knew they sought authority because he also had a green man, and so that was precisely how they did it. But you are totally convinced that this was a carefully worked out trick of some kind. Yes. That is the one part of almost certainty. I can say, oh, there has to be some secret codes. I'm tapping of the some something. Well, you're not the first person to say that. The people were constantly trying to guess what the code was. That's Jim Steinmeyer. I'm a an author and a consultant and magicians. He says that at the time, some magicians in London thought that his stammer was part of the code.

Speaker 5:          08:36          I do to not see. I can just think is

Speaker 1:          08:42          Jesse for his part ended up going through a ton of these theories as he interviewed magicians and historians read through magic books initially. One of the theories that made sense to him is that the code was in the silence that basically my grandparents and my grandma was so in sync that between each time a sound or a word was uttered, that inside their head start going through the alphabet and they'd be so ensured and so in sync that whatever letter that matched up that that would be a code. Wait, Jad

Speaker 6:          09:13          a, B, c,

Speaker 1:          09:17          Hi de Apathy. No sassy. I am wondering

Speaker 6:          09:19          a, B, c, d, e,

Speaker 1:          09:22          f. G. The next letter is going to be Jay. Yeah, of course. As soon as you do, as soon as you start playing any of these theories out on real time, you realize how ridiculous they are and if you listen to the second broadcast of the two that survived, you hear something that makes the whole idea of a code seem kind of impossible. Yeah. That was a test I did on the airplane broadcast in that broadcast is grandma. She was in a, an Arrow

Speaker 3:          09:49          flying at a great height, did a great speed toward something or other, but we're not sure where

Speaker 1:          09:52          flying around Bristol and she was in this plane at the same moment that he was on stage. Exactly. And on that time there were numbered envelopes on everyone's seat. And my grandfather said, okay, everyone brought something and put it in the envelope, seal it up. Just write a poem off the top of your head. 150 people do this. And then sit turns to one of the judges and says, okay, pick two numbers from one to 150 and then someone goes into the audience and goes and picks those two envelopes, brings them back to the stage, gives them to the judges, and then the judge picks one of the envelopes, pulls out the poem, and then holds it in front of my grandfather. And so here you have a poem chosen seemingly at random and Leslie, the grandma is several thousand feet in the air when they finally connect to her.

Speaker 3:          10:35          Best personal comment. Hello. Hello. The short way relay, Leslie is still completely isolated.

Speaker 1:          10:41          She can't even hear a word that they're saying. She never had a pair of headphones so she could never actually hear what was going on in the studio. She literally just spoken to a microphone once the technician said, Leslie,

Speaker 3:          10:51          we're ready. We're ready for you.

Speaker 1:          10:54          It's thousands of people below Sydney is there. Furrowing his brow and the poem he's trying to send her is from Keith's one line that goes hail to the blind spirit bird that will never work.

Speaker 2:          11:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:17          oh it's, it's two lines.

Speaker 2:          11:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:25          I've got it. I can get it Heyo to the live spirit bird. I'll never would I Ms. Young. Would you read out the ones written down on the piece of paper that you hold hail to the blind spirit but down? Never would. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          11:44          Crazy part. Is it in that trick, your grandpa doesn't even talk to her. There's complete silence between seed and Leslie and if there's silence there can be no coding. So you know, it was kind of this, this wonderful prices that I talked to people and even as I came up with theories, you'd listened to the tape and then realize that even the theories themselves just seem so implausible. Well, maybe it's the narrator. Do you think it's a narrator or that whatever it is, the narrator says each night, which is before your, before the game is even on somehow encoded into that, that man's introduction is, is is the answer. No, because the, because the audience hasn't yet gone and done its random act when he starts the show. There was one thing that I discovered from reading the magic books, and this is this whole idea about passing on a piece of information through a third party.

Speaker 1:          12:27          Now my grandfather never speaks to my grandma, but he says to the technician in the studio, can you please call Gilbert Sullivan in the strata cruiser and ask my wife to stand by. Then the technician calls Gilbert and says, Gilbert, can you please ask Leslie to stand by? And then Gilbert Sullivan says to my grandma, Leslie, please stand by now. That's is the only thing I can see where there's some kind of communication, but then we'll communicate something like a random sentence from a book or whatever. Exactly. And that sent essentially where the theory falls down because then what happens next is that my grandma basically successfully recites a half written crossword, which someone has put into an envelope and pass up to my grandpa. So like you go how? How standby means. That means you know, six down. I have no idea what that really, I'm back to square one again.

Speaker 1:          13:15          Oh, I can't work it out. I've got, you know the to this day, you don't know to this day, I do not know to this day. Where's the, where's the ways we know? We can't know. There's gotta be somebody who knows. Can't believe we can go into this interview. We have no way. We have no, so it's the technician. It's gotta be the technician. You gotta get to the technician because the technician is looking at her and he's doing something pilot to do is move their lips, their, that he, there's something is happening with that man's eyebrows. That's the code. It's the eyebrows. I feel like I'm just listening to this, like what's been going on in my head for about 10 12 years. So then I ask Jesse like what happened when he talked to his grandma? Total dead end. You mean like showing up around once we discovered this story around the dinner table, women visited. Hoed would always be, but, but why don't you tell us? Why can't you tell it's with family. Surely you can tell us and she would fob us often and just say, you are the judge. That is the line that I finished or that is the line they finished with every single broadcast.

Speaker 3:          14:13          Did they just say no, only thanks very much everyone and you're the judge. I will. I think [inaudible] all right, I'm that, but we'll know that just through the predicament. Pick a did it.

Speaker 1:          14:23          She wouldn't even give me the satisfaction of saying yes, it was a trick. She won't even say that clearly you are the favorite grandchild. It was probably another another. You have a cousin or a sibling who she really adored at one day without your knowing it, she whispered. No secret to her, not about to her son. Your father, what did, did, did she, did she tell him? Did she tell your dad? She told my dad something. What did she tell him? I have no idea. He will not even admit being

Speaker 7:          14:52          told something if she slipped up. Is it Jessie's dad? And I'm not even sure that she did slip up.

Speaker 4:          14:58          Um,

Speaker 1:          15:00          I see. And I approved my dad

Speaker 7:          15:04          then. Why you can't say yes, Leslie did tell me something. I'm not going to tell you, but yes, she did actually tell me something. If my mum and trusted me with something all those years ago, then I will keep that trust. Why? Because I believe in keeping

Speaker 1:          15:21          trust. My Dad won't tell my mum they've been together for over 30 years. You just have to continue. No nothing.

Speaker 1:          15:30          There is no book that's published. There's no one that came out and said, ah, I was the fellow who worked behind the scenes with the Penningtons. Let me tell you how it was done. That's Jim Steinmeyer again, they left people guessing and, and walked away. Well, the thing that got me is when I was talking to magicians and they said we can repeat everything that they did really so they can actually do, I mean like you know, one of them is in a plane and other ones in on the apparently, but they still themselves don't know 100% for sure. How my grandparents did it. If we, if we could figure this out or would you want you, it sounds like you would want to know the answer. I'm not so sure anymore. Really. We all say we want to know and we all go completely crazy and mad, but I, I, I feel like this story wouldn't have lasted for 60 years.

Speaker 1:          16:15          It wouldn't still captivate people today if they told people if they hadn't kept their line, you are the judge. I kind of feel like that's almost the greater magic than whatever magic they would do. I just feel like this is a black box that we can shine a light into it and go, okay, check that one off the list. Now we can go to the other ones. The cool thing. Now, if we can't figure it out, then you will be very happy with our program. If we can figure it out, we will call you and say, do not listen to this show because it will deeply disappointed. Well, I mean the thing, the thing I think for me that made me come to peace with not finding out and not knowing the answer was that a lot of the interviews I did with my grandma were from a few years ago and she actually isn't very well, she has dementia and she's been sick the past couple of years. And so she physically can't tell it any more. And Yeah, for me there is something about, you know, I visit my grandma now and you go, she was amazing. She not only did she make this incredible program with my grandfather, they had 20 million people listen to them, which is just incredible. When you think of the 1950s um, they've managed to [inaudible] well, what happened? Hey, no, no, no. Jess come back. No, we just went straight on the hour or is exactly, it's exactly x nine seconds ago. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          17:42          Mother a cell

Speaker 1:          17:44          phone. I'm just going to call him. Yeah. Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hi. I'm

Speaker 4:          17:50          your booking ran out just a minute ago. Yes. We noticed that. It that uh, yeah, yeah, I think we'll probably need to use the phone cause that booth now needs to be used.

Speaker 9:          17:58          Sorry. So we call Jesse back and while we didn't drag him back into the studio, actually we couldn't. Um, he did send us this tape.

Speaker 4:          18:09          Now you've held onto secret so many, so, so many years. Why haven't you wanted to reveal it to me? I think the reason I haven't ever wanted to reveal the secret is because it's a wonderful mystery and I'd like to think that, uh, after I've died, people will still say, how did they do it? Was it doing, wasn't it? It just tickles me to think about a lot of secrets, magic secrets. They get passed down from generations and they get really performed over and over again. I guess that very much becomes a part of that family. Now as a performer myself, if I wanted to bring back the pollutants, would you feel like you could hand down this magic trick to your, to your grandson to carry it on? Of course. If I had a grandson who wanted to carry it on, I'd have enormous difficulty telling him how to, I don't think it would be possible because there's an awful lot that I wouldn't be able to tell him. What do you mean you wouldn't get it to handle that man, son? It's hard to explain. Why wouldn't be able to, it's just that I wouldn't be able to. It's all I can say about that.

Speaker 9:          19:30          Our sincere thanks to Jesse Cox for so graciously allowing us to air that story and also thank you to ABC national radios, three 60 documentaries who produced the story with him? Uh, it's called keep them guessing and we've linked to the original story on our website, radio lab.org. So, well, you know, I don't think it's actually time for us to end this because I didn't tell you this. We were so interested in trying to figure out how they did that trick. [inaudible] that Soren and I, because we just wanted to find out like did somebody know how they did it? So we called this guy.

Speaker 2:          20:10          Okay.

Speaker 9:          20:11          All right. Who ruined everything? This is Penn Jillette who you probably know from Penn and teller, famous for doing magic tricks and then telling you how are done now. I don't really know what I was expecting when we called him. I, I guess I was thinking he would know what they did, but he wouldn't choose to tell us. I didn't know. But when we called them and we played him the story, as soon as he heard it, he said, oh, it's a book test, right? It's a book test. It's an envelope switch or what? And there are, you know, three or four ways to do it. What did he say? He said basically I can tell you how they did it. Yeah. Or how they might have done it, but you are not going to like it there. There go. The only Shukran in magic, there's only one and that is that the secret must be ugly.

Speaker 9:          20:55          You cannot have a beautiful secret, a beautiful secrets, that kind of thing. It's short and sweet like, Yo, he folded the hat twice. Or there's mirrors under that table. When you hear it, it's like, oh, of course, that's what they would do, and you love finding it out. Then you will whisper it to the person next to you. So in magic, what you want is an idea that is not beautiful. What do you call this as a magic trick? That stays secret is one that's so boring to tell. You don't want to tell it and you don't even want to hear it. If I have to say he's lying about this and there's gaffers tape over behind there and there, they're not actually telling you the exact truth here and it gets so our, you don't get an Aha. One of the strongest feelings you can get in the life. What are the most rewarding feelings is the feeling of an Aha. I finally understand. If you don't have a wonderful Aha, people won't figure it out. So I've got, I can tell you easily how they did that trick, but you will not get an Aha. Basically you said that you answer to this one is going to kill your joy. Yeah, it's ugly. So did he, did he tell you what they did? Yeah.

Speaker 9:          22:11          What'd he say? Well, I'll tell you, I'll tell you in just a second. You went into excruciating detail about how he thinks they did it. No a book tasks. We actually do one in our show, but the more important thing, he was so right. Once we heard the explanation and the details and all we were were both like, yeah, all right. Well, yes, with a poison dart and love how much I bugged your shit. As you can hear. He knew exactly what he was doing with us and in a way he's asking us a deeper and more of a philosophical question. I've done this to you. Will you turn around and do it to your audience? Will all I've done to you, you know, because you get to edit. All I have done is put you in precisely the position I live my life in.

Speaker 9:          23:02          You now have to make the exact same decisions that I make and I will, I will tell you, and this is just true, that I would have played this particular thing a differently with almost any other show. You know, my move on the, uh, on the chessboard with another show would be to say, uh, you know, I do have several ideas as to how this could be done, but I think I'm, uh, I'm going to be like the grandmother and go to my grave with this. Hmm. You know, and I would've just given you that a soundbite. I just have it set that we've pivoted the entire piece called, so it's like all eyes, all eyes have been directed to the next sentence. So that's a little difficult. But I want to see how you solve a problem that I solve every day. But we have like a higher call, like you're entertaining.

Speaker 9:          24:01          But we're entertaining with the caveat that we're supposed to be like telling the truth as best we understand it. So we have a slightly different set of gods and our Mount Olympus than you do it. You don't really, you don't really, because I am not suggesting that you lie. You're just going to have to tell your audience. Would you think they need to hear? And that's where he left it. So in the days after the interview week, we just got into this debate about what we should do. We obviously have an obligation to you. You listening to tell you what we know. Yes. The whole deal. Yeah. We can't pretend that we don't know something that we now do know, uh, even if it would make a much more beautiful story. So this leaves us in a conundrum. A, are we, are we entertainers or are we actually lists journalists?

Speaker 9:          24:46          So here's where we ultimately came down. We have decided not to tell you how the Penningtons did it. I mean, we are going to tell you, but we're not going to tell you here in this podcast because we have now been soiled by this truth. We learned off the record and you, if you want to be soiled, sure. Come and soil yourself. You can go to this URL, radiolab.org/the ugly truth. Don't click this radiolab.org/the ugly truth. Don't no pasta fee. Click this and we just leave it to you. You can go there or you can not. All I've said to you is that it's a trick. Yeah, and you knew that the fact that it wasn't the trick you wanted it to be?

Speaker 9:          25:36          No, he did turn sweet at one moment we were talking about the grandma. Grandma tells the grandson in the conversation at the end, she is not sure. She could explain to him how it was. That's beautiful. That is the most beautiful thing that that happens in the whole thing because I think she's telling the truth. She may not know how the trick was done and yet she was a party to it. She's the one who he says, you know, oftentimes when you're doing tricks, somebody knows everything and the other person is in the dark. Yeah. One of the, you mean like one of the partners intentionally not knows what's happening? Yeah, there are. There are tricks in the Penn and teller show, but I don't really know how they're done. It might've happened here. He may have, uh, decided that he would be the knowing one. She would be the innocent, and maybe therefore, and this is just a hunch, but just possibly everything she's saying to her grandchild instead of being a kind of dodge or a little bit of a lie, maybe it was the whole.
