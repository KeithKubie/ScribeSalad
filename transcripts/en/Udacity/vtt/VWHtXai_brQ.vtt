00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now for the answer. Let's check all that apply.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A simplified test case is easier to communicate.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is correct, because if it's simpler, takes less time, easier to understand.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
A simplified test case usually means small fixes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It may mean faster fixes, but it does not mean smaller fixes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The fix will be the same whether the test case is in its original complex form or whether it's simplified.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
A simplified test case usually means smaller program states. Yes.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If the input is smaller, then all the data structures that represent the input will be smaller as well.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And, a simplified test case usually means fewer program steps.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is correct as well, because it takes fewer steps to process the simplified input.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And there we go.
