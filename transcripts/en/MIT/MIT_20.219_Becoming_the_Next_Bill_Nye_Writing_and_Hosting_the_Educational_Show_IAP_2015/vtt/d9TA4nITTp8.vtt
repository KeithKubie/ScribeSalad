00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.260
Today is the end of week one.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.720
Day five is down.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.260
This class is very front-loaded.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.960
So I think the students
feel it, and I definitely

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.880
felt it yesterday.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.770
Yesterday was probably the
peak of just the exhaustion

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.010
of the class, and getting
used to doing that in addition

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.910
to my day job.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.930
I was frustrated because I
wanted the students to see what

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.930
I was seeing, and they weren't.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.660
And I felt like it was
because of an inability

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.880
to clearly articulate what I
was trying to get them to see.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.110
Today was so different.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.930
We started class
with having them

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.180
pitch the idea, or the
point, of their videos.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.820
And there's this nuance
between an idea of the video,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.840
the point of the video,
and what a video does.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.780
And it wasn't until
this morning that I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.040
was-- I finally was able to
articulate in my head what

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.160
was going on with the students,
which was the inability

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.160
to distinguish a
point from an action.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.520
So a lot of them were describing
what their videos did,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.670
and using that description
as the point of the video.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.270
And I feel like we finally
all make a breakthrough.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.540
Today was when it sort of
became real to everyone

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.385
because they got to
take their cameras

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.850
and actually go shoot stuff.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.760
And it was just incredibly
gratifying to overhear

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.420
them shoot, and hear them offer
each other the same pieces

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.860
of advice I would.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.990
And See them take
creative risks,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.190
and experiment
with the equipment.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.380
And to also see they really
are a good class group.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.585
They're just a really
good group of students

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:56.440
I front-loaded the class, and
I'm realizing that it really

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.160
was a lot work for them.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.660
I wanted to equip the
students as best I could

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.300
with the skills
they needed to have

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.720
so that the rest of the month
could be more about them trying

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.595
stuff on their own.

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:09.110
And I don't know how I
would re-structure that.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.110
It's something that I
have to think about a lot.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.860
I thought about that a
lot coming into the class,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.620
but it was still a lot of
work for them this week.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.560
In short, today was excellent.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.480
I saw smiles on people's
faces, and witnessed

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.770
them integrating things that
we had taught them this week.
