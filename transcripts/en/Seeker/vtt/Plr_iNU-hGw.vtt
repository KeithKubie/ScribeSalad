00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.450
Plastic is everywhere, it's in everything
-- your phone, this camera, the landfills,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:12.219
the mountains, the forest, the beach, the
ocean, sea turtles, so many fish… it's everywhere.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.369
Sup gas guzzlers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.149
If you never had to take organic chemistry
then you don't know the scourge that is carbon

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.019
-- it's in everything.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.759
Everything is a carbon and hydrogen chain.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.539
You spend your time moving electrons around,
changing bonds and hating life.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.920
Orgo is extremely important, because basically
all life contains the organic molecule carbon.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.110
I mean, molecularly: humans, plants, dogs,
cats, pizza… pretty much everything contains

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.110
carbon.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.670
The plastic polyethylene is a long chain of
carbons and hydrogens with some strong double

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.230
bonds between chunks.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.230
Petroleum?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.310
It's also just a chain of carbons with some
hydrogens around it!

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.100
Both of these things are polluters, and both
come from hydrocarbons of natural gas and

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
crude oil…

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.050
It might seem like alchemy, but what if there
was a way to take all the crappy plastic,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.080
rearrange the atoms and turn it into a fossil
fuel?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.190
Guess what, fam.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.730
Now there is.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.760
This paper is blank, we just wanted to do
something dramatic…

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.500
Anyway, a 2016 paper in Science Advances announced
they were able to turn polyethylene, into

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.120
energy -- potentially solving two polluting
problems with one variable!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.830
In their study, the researchers took plastic
from bottles, food packaging, and shopping

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.230
bags (recycling plastic number 2 or 6) and
mixed it with a catalyst breaking the long

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.520
chains of hydrocarbon plastic into an alkane!

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.159
Alkanes are a class of hydrocarbon.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.479
We often burn alkanes for energy, like methane,
propane or butane.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.700
By their chemical calculation, they got 56-percent
of the plastic to degrade into alkane oil

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.630
products -- namely DIESEL!!

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.659
Yep, these scientists turned plastic shopping
bags into diesel, with a wax byproduct.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.610
That waxy byproduct can be sold and used for
resins and coatings, and the catalyst is reusable

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.090
after the chemical reaction is completed!

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.970
To be honest, this does feel like alchemy.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.080
But it's needed.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.499
There are a lot of other plastics out there
that we need to deal with.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:13.629
The polyethylenes in this process, remember,
are only 2s or 6s, but there are dozens of

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.920
other plastics that accumulate in landfills
and oceans.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.690
According to American Chemical Council, if
we can figure out the trash-to-energy pipeline,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.859
it could create 9 billion dollars in economic
output and create tens of thousands of new

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:26.859
jobs.

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.310
And they're not the only one advocating for
this; in Australia and the United Kingdom,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.599
various startups are converting polystyrene
(number six), as well as twos, fives and sevens

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.430
to biofuels!

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.749
Global plastic production is ridiculous.

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:46.379
In 2013, according to WorldWatch, 299 million
tons of plastics were created -- 10 to 20

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.040
million tons of that ended up in the ocean,
with millions of tons ending up in landfills.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.999
In Europe, they found 26 percent of the plastics
consumed were recycled.

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:55.999
In the U.S.?

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:56.999
Only 9 percent.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.790
Take polyethylene, for example; as a product,
it comprises 60 percent of all the plastic

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.290
trash in landfills!

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.889
Once there, it breaks into smaller and smaller
pieces, but never truly disappears.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.290
Not to mention, according to the Union of
Concerned Scientists, when you pay for fuel,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.450
you're only paying for a little bit of the
cost.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.370
Both the fossil fuels themselves, and also
the side effects of the mining and extraction,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.840
transportation, and burning of those fuels
harm the planet and things living on it.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.120
This new process is still creating diesel,
but its not drilling, extracting, refining

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.870
and transporting, new crude oils.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.959
If we could break this fossil fuel chain by
circling some of that back on itself, that

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.799
would be HUGE.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.290
Could this solve our energy problems?

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.290
Not yet.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.930
Though the researchers call this "unprecedented,"
the ability to change post-consumer plastics

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.159
into diesel and waxes isn't as efficient as
just getting new diesel -- yet.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.529
Currently, the ratio of plastic to catalyst
is 30 to 1, but according to Phys-Org, the

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.969
researchers' goal is 10,000 to 1.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:02.650
But while this is the first step, there might
come a day when we look to landfills for fuel.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.199
How do you feel when someone throws away a
recyclable thing?

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.799
I die inside.

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.129
IT MAKES ME CRAZY.

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.090
Tell me in the comments.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.269
Biodegradable plastics are the hot new thing,
but do they really biodegrade -- HOW?!

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.859
Check this video to see the answer.

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.859
