00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.631
I'm Uta Francke. I'm a Human Geneticist originally from Germany as you can hear.

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.031
And I'm an Emeritus Professor here at

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:11.800
Stanford and also Senior Medical Director at 23andMe.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.652
&gt;&gt; So, we have three billion based pairs and just one copy

00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:18.061
of the human genome. And we, we've learned that, you know we have

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:21.077
two copies of the human genome of the nuclear genome in, in our

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:25.240
cells. And we've been learning a bit about the coding regions, the protein

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.460
coding regions. what, what can you tell us about the relative size of

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.210
the protein coding regions of the genome versus the sort of non coding regions?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.890
&gt;&gt; The big question was how many protein coding genes

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.320
are there in the genome? And initially, before the genome project

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.860
the, the number that's been kicked around was like 100,000.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.960
Sort of, a wild guess. And then, between 2000 and 2003,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.110
there was an official betting game going on

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.310
where people could put down a dollar and a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.290
number. And then years later, it was $5 and then it was $20 because in a way, it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.800
became more difficult. And everybody could only put on

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.500
down one bet. About 150 people put down the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.920
bet, and their range, the ranges of their guesses

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.109
went from, you wouldn't believe it. 25,000 to 150,000.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.460
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.051
&gt;&gt; So nobody had really any good idea.

00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:23.080
The mean was around 61,000 genes. And when the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.435
first draft was published they said, well we had a brief look at it and we think

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:30.235
it's between 30 and 35,000. And when it

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:32.881
was finally finished, the number had come down to

00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:37.092
20 to 25,000. And many people were surprised because

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:40.260
this is hardly any more than the, the round

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.290
worm or the fruit fly. So the humans are so much

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.558
more complex, shouldn't they have more protein coding genes? So the

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:52.846
complexity cannot be immediately dedu, deduced from the number of genes,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.440
when you don't know what these, these genes can be used for.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.230
&gt;&gt; So what percentage of the genome

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.900
is actually made up of coding region, roughly?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.759
&gt;&gt; It's only 1 to 2%. And so all this other,

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.539
you know, 90, 98 to 99% then. I mean, a lot of people who you know, are

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.290
just learning about the genome may be wondering,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.840
what exactly is the rest of that sequence doing?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.340
&gt;&gt; You see, originally people thought it was just junk.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.230
It was just a virus getting in and replicating itself.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.041
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.340
&gt;&gt; And, in recent years, people started to look at how much of that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.430
sequence is being made into RNA. How

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.970
much is being transcribed. And to everyone's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.060
surprise more than 80% is actually made into a copy of RNA. And these RNAs have

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.830
all kinds of interesting functions. For example, to regulate activity of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.540
other genes. To regulate the activity of messenger RNAs, how they are being

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.270
translated. And many different function that the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.102
RNAs have. Some of them are structural.

00:02:57.102 --> 00:03:00.306
There are RNA set as structural components

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:03.533
of the ribosome. And otherwise, outside of the

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.269
coding sequence are control regions that are

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.370
important to regulate the activity of each gene.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.180
&gt;&gt; I see. So, we learn in this lesson about messenger RNA.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.721
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.080
&gt;&gt; mRNA. And so what you're saying, there are actually other kinds of

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.500
RNAs that can be made besides mRNA that doesn't get turned into protein?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.520
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.330
And what was found out recently, that you remember

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.655
there are two strands in the DNA and the messenger

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:30.070
RNAs only made of one strand that gives the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.080
information for the protein. But what is being found out

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.540
now is that there are anti-sense RNAs that actually

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.160
the other strand of DNA can also be made into

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.390
RNA. It goes in the opposite direction. It has

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.310
no coding function for proteins, usually not, sometimes it does.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.380
But it has regulatory function. And you just can imagine, if a gene

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.230
is transcribed in the other direction, then

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.450
the transcription of the messenger RNA has

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.204
a problem. You know, it runs into, it's a train wreck, right? So

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:07.590
there was a regulation of gene activity by anti sense RNA that's one mechanism.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.890
&gt;&gt; Right. So it sounds like maybe some of the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.500
complexity of different species or complexity of cells is in part

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.560
not so much the, the sheer content. The number of genes you have,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.265
but maybe how you regulate all of those genes together to, to create something.

00:04:22.265 --> 00:04:25.880
&gt;&gt; What we are finding out now is that the genomic

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.910
regions communicate with each other. Like you can have an enhancer region

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.890
that is downstream away from the gene or even in an entrant

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.930
of another gene that then falls over, communicates with the promoter and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.200
sets in motion the messenger RNA sentences. So the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.850
whole genome is three-dimensional. It's not just a one

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.866
dimensional series of letters. There's a lot of three-dimensional

00:04:51.866 --> 00:04:55.790
arrangement and interaction that's very important for its function.
