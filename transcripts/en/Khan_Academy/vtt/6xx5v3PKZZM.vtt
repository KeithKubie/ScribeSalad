00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:03.761
- What I want to think about in this video is cell size,

00:00:03.761 --> 00:00:07.314
and in particular how small cells can get, and then also

00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.798
what tends to be the limiting factors for how large

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:11.424
a cell can get.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:14.187
And I have some pictures of cells here.

00:00:14.187 --> 00:00:16.718
This picture right over here, this picture

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.224
of pseudomonas bacteria, each of these pill-shaped things,

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.592
this is a bacterial cell.

00:00:22.592 --> 00:00:26.005
And just to get a sense of scale, the width of this pill

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:28.048
is around one micrometer.

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:32.228
So, this is approximately one micrometer, which is the same

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.852
thing as 1 millionth of a meter.

00:00:34.852 --> 00:00:37.777
Or you could think of it as 1 thousandth of a milimeter,

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:39.983
whatever helps you conceptualize this better.

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:42.955
And then the length here, this is about 5 micrometers.

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:46.949
This is approximately 5 micrometers.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.758
Now over here I have some pictures of cells that you would

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.592
find in the human body, these are red blood cells.

00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:56.213
These have a diameter of about 7 micrometers.

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.930
You see a similar scale for these white blood cells.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.625
There are some other things in here.

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.690
Over here we see a human sperm cell about to penetrate

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.638
a human egg cell, and human egg cells are some of

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:09.680
the largest cells you'd find, especially if we're talking

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.999
about spherical cells.

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.112
And this cell here, this is going to have a diameter

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:20.988
on the order of 100 micrometers.

00:01:20.988 --> 00:01:23.054
So the first question we would, and it's kind of neat that

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:25.306
all of these pictures are almost on the same scale,

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:28.998
so you can almost compare them, but the first question

00:01:28.998 --> 00:01:31.622
we'd ask is how small can a cell get?

00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:33.689
Well, if you think about it a cell is a living thing,

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.384
it's actually quite complex.

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:38.007
It has to have information, it has DNA, it has to be able

00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.351
to replicate itself, it has all of this metabolic machinery.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:46.273
So, I just did some reading and the smallest cells observed,

00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:49.036
and I think this might be the smallest cells period although

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:51.869
there might be future ones discovered that are even smaller,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.934
are actually on the order of about a few 100 nanometers.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.695
Remember, 1,000 nanometers would be the width of this pill

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:01.644
so a few 100 nanometers like maybe something like that

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:05.870
would be maybe 300 nanometers, these are the smallest

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.194
cells discovered so far.

00:02:07.194 --> 00:02:08.749
And they are bacterial cells, they were discovered at

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.978
the University of California Berkeley.

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:16.783
And we think that this is pretty close to the lower bound

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:18.803
because you've got to remember we have to store all of

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:22.216
this genetic information and all this cellular machinery.

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:25.954
So, that stuff's complex and you can only get so small.

00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:28.392
But what about the upper bound cells?

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:31.573
Well, one of the things that tends to be the limiting factor

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:34.476
and there's other things as well, but it's the ability for,

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:37.239
it's the ratio of volume to surface area.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.045
And why does the ratio of volume to surface area matter?

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.623
Well, because the surface is what interfaces

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:47.502
the cell with its surroundings.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:51.170
It has to take in nutrients and take out the waste,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.373
so each unit of surface area it has to process the inputs

00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:58.020
and the outputs for a certain volume of cells,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.481
for a certain volume of the cell.

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:03.755
And as we'll see as a cell grows the volume and surface

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.193
area don't grow together, the volume increases faster

00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:08.051
than the surface area does.

00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.023
So, as you grow, each unit of surface area has to handle

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:13.182
the processing with the environment for more

00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:14.575
and more volume.

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:17.408
At some point it can't handle it, it can't take in nutrients

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:20.496
and get rid of waste fast enough.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.423
And to make that a little bit more tangible,

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.257
let's think about it mathematically.

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:28.692
So, the volume of a sphere, let's say this is a sphere here

00:03:28.692 --> 00:03:31.479
so let me make it look a little more 3-dimensional,

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:38.258
if it has radius "r", its volume is going to be (4/3)πr³.

00:03:38.258 --> 00:03:46.246
Now, it's surface area is going to be 4πr².

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:49.032
Now let's calculate the ratio of volume to surface area

00:03:49.032 --> 00:03:50.216
because that's what we really care about.

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:54.140
The ratio of volume to surface area is, I want to do

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:09.651
surface area in yellow, is equal to (4/3)πr³ over 4πr².

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:11.787
Now, luckily this simplifies quite nicely.

00:04:11.787 --> 00:04:14.921
4 divided by 4 is 1, π divided by π is 1,

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.893
r³ divided by r² is just going to be "r",

00:04:17.893 --> 00:04:22.560
so this all simplified nicely to r/3.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.766
And if we wanted to care about units, it would be cubic

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.343
units of volume or it would be cubic units divided by

00:04:27.343 --> 00:04:31.662
square units, whichever unit we're looking at.

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:33.822
So this is going to be r/3.

00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:36.701
So, let's use this to think about what happens

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:40.160
as a cell gets much larger.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.618
So for simplicity, let's focus on this white blood cell here

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.126
and just to make the math easy let's assume that it has

00:04:47.126 --> 00:04:53.302
a radius of 3 micrometers.

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:56.251
I'm gonna do this in a color you can see, 3 micrometers.

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:59.827
So in that case, for this cell, its volume to surface area

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:05.237
is going to be, we could just say 3 micrometers divided by 3

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:12.528
but I'll put 3 micrometers divided by 3, which of course is

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:14.849
just going to be 1 micrometer.

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.264
But having a unit of 1 micrometer for volume of surface area

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:18.774
doesn't really make a lot of sense.

00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:25.461
An equivalent unit would say 1 cubic micrometer per

00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:29.895
square micrometer, because we're doing volume to

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:32.101
surface area and obviously if you let the units cancel and

00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:33.936
you do the dimensional analysis you'd be just left with

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.259
this micrometer.

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.743
But this helps us conceptualize a little bit more because

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:41.226
it says that each square micrometer needs to handle

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:44.547
one cubic micrometer of cellular volume.

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:47.519
So each square micrometer, so the square micrometer for

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.514
this guy over here is gonna be around that size,

00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:53.532
it's going to handle the processing on average for

00:05:53.532 --> 00:05:57.363
1 cubic micrometer of volume.

00:05:57.363 --> 00:05:59.662
Alright, that seems about reasonable and that's a reasonable

00:05:59.662 --> 00:06:01.357
size for a cell.

00:06:01.357 --> 00:06:06.233
But what if we were to increase things by a factor of 1,000

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.625
or increase the radius by a factor of 1,000?

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.272
So I'm obviously not drawing this to scale, but let's say

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:14.592
we find some new organism or we theorize some organism

00:06:14.592 --> 00:06:19.352
thats cellular radius, instead of being 3 micrometers,

00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:25.180
so this was 3 micrometers, it's 3,000 millionths of a meter.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.734
And just to be clear this isn't ginormous, by our scales

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:30.590
this would be 3 millimeters.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.539
It would be visible by the human eye, the threshold of the

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.953
human eye can see is about a tenth of a millimeter,

00:06:35.953 --> 00:06:37.834
which is 100 micrometers.

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:41.828
This is approximately 1/10 of a millimeter.

00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:43.732
So on the right conditions you can just barely see

00:06:43.732 --> 00:06:46.681
a human egg cell, but this right over here, this would be

00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.258
still small by our scales, but let's just think about what

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:53.159
happens to the volume to surface area.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:07:01.866
3,000 micrometers divided by 3, we'd be left with

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.652
1,000 micrometers, or even better we could write this as

00:07:04.652 --> 00:07:11.223
1,000 cubic micrometers per square micrometer.

00:07:11.223 --> 00:07:14.079
So now, each square micrometer, in this case it had to

00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:17.074
handle a cubic micrometer of volume.

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:22.066
But now it has to handle 1,000 cubic micrometers of volume.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.642
So it has to handle much more volume.

00:07:25.642 --> 00:07:27.523
And that's gonna break down, it's not gonna be able

00:07:27.523 --> 00:07:30.425
to exchange the gasses, exchange the nutrients,

00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:33.815
exchange the waste fast enough for this cell to function.

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:38.134
So this is a very important ratio, volume to surface area

00:07:38.134 --> 00:07:40.734
for cells, and actually ends up, well I'll just talk

00:07:40.734 --> 00:07:42.987
about cells in general.

00:07:42.987 --> 00:07:45.448
It actually tends to be an interesting thing as a lot

00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:50.161
of things grow, volume to surface area or mass or there's

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:51.624
a lot of other ratios that are interesting,

00:07:51.624 --> 00:07:52.785
but this is one of them.

00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:55.618
Now, the other factor that will play in is also as a cell

00:07:55.618 --> 00:07:57.847
gets larger, the machinery has to just traverse more

00:07:57.847 --> 00:07:59.612
distances, you have to transport things

00:07:59.612 --> 00:08:02.978
over larger distances which also can become cumbersome.

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.045
But the volume to surface area is a really interesting one

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:06.600
to think about, while we don't tend to see

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.805
very large spherical cells.

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:11.616
And the reason why I emphasize spherical cells is because

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:15.354
you do see cells that are longer than even this scale,

00:08:15.354 --> 00:08:17.165
like nerve cells.

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:19.719
And they get by with that, they have other adaptations.

00:08:19.719 --> 00:08:23.179
But one of them is to just be really skinny and long,

00:08:23.179 --> 00:08:25.872
so this is one way that they can maximize

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:28.357
their surface area.

00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:32.118
So, like that, this is a nerve cell.

00:08:32.118 --> 00:08:34.185
Other ways that you'll see cells that maximize their

00:08:34.185 --> 00:08:35.949
surface area is that they have a lot of things that kind of

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:38.225
stick out to maximize.

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:41.568
So, cells are clearly not all spherical.

00:08:41.568 --> 00:08:43.728
So, they could have other things that maximize their

00:08:43.728 --> 00:08:45.237
surface area like that.

00:08:45.237 --> 00:08:47.419
So there's a bunch of adaptations, but in general, modeling

00:08:47.419 --> 00:08:49.927
them as a sphere isn't a crazy thing to do and this is why

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:52.388
we don't tend to see cells much larger

00:08:52.388 --> 00:08:54.496
than a human egg cell.
