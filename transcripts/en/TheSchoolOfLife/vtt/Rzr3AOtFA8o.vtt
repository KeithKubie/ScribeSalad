00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:17.029
Democracy was achieved by such a long arduous and heroic struggle that it can feel embarrassing even shameful to be pretty

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.110
Disappointed by it

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.860
Perhaps the best guy to such feelings and to Modern democracy in general is a 19th century French aristocrat

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.420
[Alexis] De [Tocqueville]

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.379
Photo Tocqueville Democracy was a highly exotic and new political option he'd been born in

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:37.849
1805 when Napoleon was the populist dictator of half of Europe

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:44.719
But he prescient lee believed that democracy was going to be the future all over the world and so he wanted to know

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.649
What would that be like?

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.299
To find out he set out to America with a grant from the French government

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.279
he arrived in New York together with his friend who [stabbed] a boomer in may of

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.169
1831 and then embarked on a nine-month journey around the new Nation after

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.148
His journey he compiled his thoughts into one of the greatest works of political philosophy

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.199
Democracy in America published in 1835 in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.180
The book De Tocqueville was particularly alive to the problematic and darker sides of Democracy five issues struck him in particular

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.179
in France the society that the Tocqueville knew from childhood

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.939
Making money didn't appear at the Forefront of People's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.898
Minds the poor had almost no chance of acquiring wealth and the tiny upper stratum of landed aristocrats

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.649
Didn't need [to] make any more money as a result for very different reasons [money] was not the way to judge a life

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.469
However the Americans that de tocqueville met on his journey believed constantly that through hard work

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.409
It was possible [to] make a fortune and to do so was entirely admirable and right

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.219
Money seem to be quite simply the only achievement that Americans

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.858
Respected for example the top fill observed that in America people believed that a book that did not sell well

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.939
Just couldn't be any good because the only test of goodness for any item was how much money it happens to make

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.620
Democracy and capitalism had thus created seemingly equitable

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.089
But also very flat an oppressive way for humans to judge each other

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.499
In a chapter of democracy in America entitled why the Americans are often so restless in the midst of their prosperity?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.710
[de] Tocqueville sketched an enduring analysis of the relationship between high expectations and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.899
Dissatisfaction between political equality and envy he wrote when all the prerogatives of birth and fortune have been abolished

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.010
When every profession is open to everyone an ambitious man

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.210
May think it is easy to launch himself on a great career and feel that he has been called to no common destiny

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.929
But this is a delusion which experience quickly

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.829
Corrects when inequality is the general rule in Society the greatest inequalities attract, no attention

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.329
But when everything is more or less level the slightest variation is noticed that is the reason for the strange

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.080
Melancholy often haunting inhabitants of democracies in the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.989
Midst of abundance and of that disgust with life sometimes gripping them even in calm and easy

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.109
circumstances the Old Rigid Hierarchical

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.589
European system that had denied all hope of social movement to the poor was unjust in a thousand all too obvious

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.899
ways to Tocqueville recognized

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.920
But it had offered those on the lower rungs one notable

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.200
freedom the freedom not to have to take the achievements of quite so many people in Society as

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.619
Reference points, and then find themselves severely wanting in status and importance as a result

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.290
Typically we think of democracy as being the opposite of Tyranny

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.239
But de Tocqueville noticed that democracy could easily create its own specialized type of tyranny that of the majority

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.929
Democratic culture he thought often ends up demonizing any assertion of difference an especially cultural superiority

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.790
Even though such attitudes might be connected [with] real merit in a tyranny of the majority a society has an aggressive

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.480
leveling instinct

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.479
It's regarded as a civic virtue to take on anyone who seems to be getting above

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.909
Themselves and to cut them viciously down to size

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.649
The Tocqueville was disturbed by the way in which in the [united] [States] people have no distinction

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.030
Refused to think that anyone could be better than them just because they had say

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:51.839
Trained to be a doctor for seven years or study the law for two decades or written some very good books [a] healthy and admirable

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.149
reluctance to defer to people [too] easily

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.159
Encouraged an unhelpful refusal to accept any kind of submission at all and yet as the Tocqueville saw it

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:09.599
it simply must be the case that some people in society are wiser more intelligent kinder or more mature than others and

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:11.999
Therefore should be listened to with special attention

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.909
Democracy was the Tocqueville thought fatally biased towards mediocrity

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.979
You suppose that democracy would encourage citizens to have an open mind however de Tocqueville came to the opposite conclusion

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.209
That one could find few places with less independence of mind and true freedom of discussion than in America

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.849
trusting that their system was fair [and] just

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.959
Americans simply gave up on critical thinking and put their faith in newspapers, and so called common [sense] instead

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.989
Furthermore as this was a commercial society

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.500
Americans were very conscious of not wanting to step too far out of line with their neighbors who might also be customers

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.889
It was better to trot out cliches than to try to be original and never more so [than] when there was something to sell

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:10.139
although to Tocqueville says a lot of really quite grim things about Democracy and America the top fill wasn't anti-democratic or

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.579
Anti-American he was just trying to show why living in a democracy could in some key ways be really quite annoying and frustrating

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.989
He is teaching us the stoic lesson that certain pains just need to be expected don't be too surprised or shocked

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Don't come along with the wrong expectations

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.900
Politics in a democracy [it's] going to be pretty awful in some major ways. It's not that we're doing anything specifically wrong

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:40.539
It's just the price you pay and should be willing to pay when you give ultimate [authority] to everyone

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.160
you
