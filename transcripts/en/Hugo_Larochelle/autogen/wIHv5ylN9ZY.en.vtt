00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 in this capsule we will be reducing the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.410
 notion of probabilistic reasoning in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.769
 artificial intelligence then the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.429
 objectives of this capsule if those who 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.740
 will follow 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.990
 it's going to be basically coming back 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 on basic concepts in theory of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.550
 probabilities to know the notion 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.869
 random variable event 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.570
 marginal joint probity 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.310
 conditional the rule of chaining the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.199
 basic rule is the notion 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 of independence possibly 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.539
 conditional between the variables 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 random 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.860
 you really saw most of these 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.250
 water concepts and so we want to read see 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.590
 there to make a fast since we're going 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.420
 need these lot notions in the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 capsules that will follow in the rest 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.559
 of the body then the idea behind the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.559
 pro reasoning to ulysses is actually 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.379
 develop agents like youtube is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.300
 agent in a context of a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.280
 environment that relate 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.859
 deterministic therefore an environment that there 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.170
 will be possibly stochastic what that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.390
 in practice means that I am 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.549
 maybe in an environment where my 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.960
 actions can have effects that 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.260
 are not determined what are 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.430
 uncertain I could so are 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.930
 necessarily it will involve 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.049
 genres some uncertainty by 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.350
 relation to what state I am in or 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.189
 what is the state of the environment 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.189
 maybe my interaction with 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.500
 the environment even makes that 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.960
 the observation acquisition during my 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.290
 old environment but my sensors 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.090
 is going to vote for gross so is kind a little 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.270
 uncertainty about what is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.460
 the exact measure of the information that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 I acquired via my environment 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.060
 so that's some features on 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.159
 observe when one is in a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.360
 stochastic environment with 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.299
 probabilistic reasoning we are in 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 able to reason and incorporate 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.090
 this uncertainty link it to the stga 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.890
 stochastic city of my environment 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 in the reasoning of my agent here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.810
 a very small example of what we want 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.450
 say by uncertainties imagine that I have 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.150
 different holding shares which 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.510
 corresponds to taking action 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.680
 to go to the airport 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.150
 you are minutes before the departure of my flight 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.220
 is there the question is above all a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.989
 action was given for a value of 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.120
 your data is what this action is going 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.019
 allow me to arrive in time for my 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.849
 flying in practice in the real world on 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.260
 can identify several problems that 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.780
 are all problems basically 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.739
 related to uncertainty an uncertainty by 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.079
 relation to my environment 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.019
 so I could have an observable it 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.280
 and partial of my environment so 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.569
 for example before leaving I connect 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.599
 not exactly what are the 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.870
 road conditions what traffic 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.440
 no goethe institute can have some 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.129
 uncertainties related to the fact that my 100 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.120
 on its edge and so is it if I get 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.459
 information in relation to traffic via 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.700
 announcements of traffic to the radio there are 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.530
 a certain delay between when is that 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.480
 we observe the traffic there is when is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.810
 what the traffic will be announced to the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.269
 radio 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.459
 so that's the noise equivalent 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.019
 that is, a defect in 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.790
 the information that I get via but 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:20.769
 without a vagueness if you want 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.199
 also we see uncertainty in 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.699
 the facts of my actions so even though 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.269
 I really intend to 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:30.190
 make no accident or problem 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.799
 the airport ben maybe I'm going 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.290
 have a puncture or go 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.419
 maybe have breakdowns help us out 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.470
 so in this case it's not something 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.150
 thing that I control perfectly 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.730
 lauriad few certainties to know what 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.220
 that well and truly succeed a bit even 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.919
 if there is no traffic and generally speaking 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.290
 I have certainties him to the fact that the 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:52.569
 complexity of my environment that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.930
 involves my car but 1 6l full 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.150
 other users of the road network is 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.840
 so big that it's getting 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.489
 too difficult to model all this is to 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.909
 because of this kind of uncertainty 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.010
 precisely on comment what my 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.810
 environment that are the properties of 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.580
 my environment 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.099
 and so it's convoy uncertainty 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.669
 incorporated into our model directly 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:21.400
 but we will have to manipulate and 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.130
 problem with a reasoning that is 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.330
 purely logical and deterministic by 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.840
 example with the logic of first 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.220
 roles is that either I'm going to do some 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.900
 arrived a system that makes people 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.930
 draws conclusions that are and ronning 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.280
 so kind of 25 allows me to me 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:42.040
 allows with 100% of to enjoy with me 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.450
 guaranteed to arrive on time so it was 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.460
 produces something that I can not 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.740
 really guarantee as far as he 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.130
 could be an accident so much 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.389
 serious that the road network would be 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.720
 totally congested for a lot 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:58.330
 longer or game could actually 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.740
 to be unable to draw anything other than 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.510
 conclusions that are made little 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.820
 exploitable this view of taking 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.229
 of decision for my agent so I 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.540
 could perhaps draw a conclusion 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:10.120
 of the kind at 25 allows me to get to 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.400
 time but only if it does not rain if a 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:17.229
 no accident is educated so or 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.700
 auger number full conditions which that 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.490
 I'm actually not able to 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.780
 check exactly where I can 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.720
 with a conclusion of the kind ben at 1440 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.060
 allows me to arrive with big big 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.610
 this certainty of arriving in time for 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.690
 my flight but in what if it is little 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.250
 exploitable in the network this is a 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.950
 decision that is so conservative 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.320
 that it forces me to for example pass the 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.039
 night at the airport even though I could have 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.150
 take a little bit of luck is 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:52.570
 arrived at the airport with a priority 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:54.430
 still high enough so this 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.260
 that we will use instead as a tool 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.530
 to reason in a 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.610
 context we note the uncertainty or so 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.100
 in a context where we have a 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.500
 stochastic environment too much is going 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.440
 to be the probability theory we're going 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.950
 use that as a tool to take our 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.380
 decisions 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.120
 that will allow us to model the 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.610
 likelihood of the different events 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.650
 in my environment 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.360
 and that's going to require among other things that 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.139
 I formulate 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.000
 beliefs for my relative agent 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.759
 to the environment then also that I 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.030
 formulates hypotheses about what is the 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:32.650
 likelihood of some observations 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.969
 so observations that corresponds to 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.009
 events that would take place in 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:37.569
 my environment and the theory of 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.000
 problem will give me a theoretical framework 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.949
 which will allow me to put 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.319
 up to date what is my estimate of the 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:47.379
 likelihood of certain events 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.599
 for example political is well and truly 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.400
 traffic or downright politics 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.779
 the conclusion that is barely 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.150
 know what I will succeed in arriving 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:56.830
 in time so the theory of politics is going 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.000
 give me the theoretical framework will me 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.080
 allow to do this type of 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.150
 reasoning where I'm going to be able 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.189
 observe some observations then 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.779
 update my estimate of the 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.879
 likelihood of different events 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.469
 in my environment 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.949
 so that will allow me too much in my 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:13.659
 example of saying ben after watching 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:16.719
 that no traffic 

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:23.199
 what becomes the probability that at 25 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:25.509
 allow me to arrive on time and so 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:27.219
 will also see more really 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.819
 facilitated the modeling of my 

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.919
 environment 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:32.110
 since we will be able to take some 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:36.129
 phenomena that are too complex for 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:38.349
 be well described in a formal way 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.819
 and then convert them into something 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:41.409
 that we will generally call the 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:43.629
 noise ie a certain 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:45.759
 inaccuracy in relation to measurement 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.240
 exact of something in my 

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:49.300
 environment 

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.710
 so the probabilistic modeling is going to me 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.409
 to do is to simplify 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.759
 of much the modeling of 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:57.039
 the environment by taking what is 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:59.909
 complex and modeling as being a 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:59.909
 simple noise
