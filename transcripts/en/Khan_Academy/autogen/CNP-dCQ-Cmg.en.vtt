00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.893
 The first video we talked about 

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:05.112
 for diffusion and for concentration gradients, 

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:07.268
 we had a vessel containing only one kind of particle. 

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:08.696
 We had these purple particles. 

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:11.456
 In this case, the concentration of purple particles 

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:13.842
 was higher than the left side, 

00:00:13.842 --> 00:00:16.359
 than on the right. 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.187
 So, if we look at this concentration gradient, 

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.315
 he is going from 

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.848
 the higher concentration on the left 

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:26.494
 to the lower concentration on the right. 

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:28.234
 We saw what happened. 

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:30.723
 Because we have more particles here 

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:31.795
 and they bounce around 

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:33.735
 in different random directions, 

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:35.095
 there is a greater likelihood that particles will move 

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.230
 from left to right, from right to left. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.181
 We will have particle transfers and from right to left, 

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.724
 but there will be 

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:45.236
 greater likelihood of movement from left to right. 

00:00:45.236 --> 00:00:47.714
 Besides, if we wait for a while, the particles 

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.117
 will be distributed evenly in court. 

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.950
 They have moved in the direction of their concentration gradient 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.959
 and distributed evenly in court. 

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.731
 Interesting in the chart we see now is, 

00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:00.693
 that I have added a second type of particles, 

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:02.179
 these large yellow particles. 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.199
 We see the concentration gradient of these particles 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.370
 is in the opposite direction. 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.276
 We have low concentration, 

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.016
 we actually do not have any yellow particles on the left. 

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:12.872
 We do not have any yellow particles 

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.415
 to the left and 

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:17.016
 high concentration of yellow particles on the right. 

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:20.584
 Their concentration gradient is from right to left. 

00:01:20.584 --> 00:01:22.450
 The purpose of this video is 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.537
 to show that each particle moves in the direction 

00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:27.606
 of its own concentration gradient. 

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:29.577
 Unless blocked in any way, 

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:32.270
 it will move in the direction of its unique concentration gradient, 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.394
 no matter what they do 

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:36.252
 other particles. At least for most of the time. 

00:01:36.252 --> 00:01:38.314
 So, we see that the yellow particles will move 

00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:40.988
 from a high place to a low concentration. 

00:01:40.988 --> 00:01:42.312
 They will move 

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:45.116
 by diffusion from right to left. 

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:47.746
 This is not magic. 

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:48.845
 This molecule has not said, 

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:52.133
 "Oh, here are seven more of my friends, 

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:54.710
 it's a little cluttered, I feel claustrophobic, 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.487
 I will move on the other side. " 

00:01:56.487 --> 00:01:57.729
 Not that happens. 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.142
 The particles simply bounce randomly 

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:01.854
 and when in the beginning 

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.986
 we have a situation like this, there is no chance 

00:02:03.986 --> 00:02:07.485
 yellow particles to move from left to right, 

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:09.357
 because there are no yellow particles here. 

00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:13.229
 But it is likely after a certain time, some of them 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.269
 these yellow particles do 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.339
 move from right to left. 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.743
 They will continue to do so, 

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.830
 until they reach a stable configuration, 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.383
 where there is the same probability 

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:27.042
 to move the particles from left to right and right to left. 

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.306
 This will happen in both particle types. 

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:32.857
 In biology or chemistry classes 

00:02:32.857 --> 00:02:35.444
 you will often hear about things that are moving in the direction of 

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:38.047
 our concentration gradient, we can add 

00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:39.986
 in the direction of its unique concentration gradient. 

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:42.553
 As you saw, the concentration gradient of the yellow particles 

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:44.909
 is in the opposite direction to that of the purple particles. 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.848
 This is not magic. 

00:02:46.848 --> 00:02:48.870
 You just have to imagine the particles 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.193
 bouncing around in different directions. 

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:53.393
 What is the natural thing that can happen? 

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:55.380
 There will be a greater likelihood that the particles will move from place to point 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.829
 higher concentration to a lower concentration site, 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.492
 from a place with a lower concentration to a place with a higher concentration.
