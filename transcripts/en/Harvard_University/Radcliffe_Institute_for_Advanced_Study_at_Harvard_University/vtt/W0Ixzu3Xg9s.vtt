00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.750
- Hello, everyone, and welcome.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.570
I want to thank those
intrepid souls who

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.000
actually crossed
over to Radcliffe

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.490
today despite the weather.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.930
Winter is fully upon us.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.670
Thank you very much.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.000
I want to welcome you to
our science lecture series.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.620
My name is Sean O'Donnell.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.960
I'm the associate director
of academic ventures,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.370
and I help to oversee
the lecture series.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.890
I have the opportunity
and privilege

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.670
of working with Immaculata
De Vivo and Alyssa

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.330
Goodman, our science faculty
directors, whose vision has

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.970
really helped launch a year long
exploration of this idea of,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.530
what is the
undiscovered in science?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.280
There's clearly so much
more for us to know.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.410
But in practice, of
course, for scientists,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.450
that often means that they are
setting off to find one thing,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.280
and what happens when they find
something completely different?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.680
This notion of serendipity
is not just romantic,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.200
but it's also a very
practical experience.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.145
And we are really honored
today to have Professor Guatam

00:01:03.145 --> 00:01:05.050
Dantas with us
today, whose story

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.970
about his own surprising
and unexpected discovery

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.610
really redirected
his research and led

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.250
to a whole decade worth
of a new research program.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.630
I will let Professor Dantas tell
that story himself, of course,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.300
but I do want to
briefly introduce him.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.610
And I'd like to do
so, if you don't mind,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.330
by reading his Twitter handle.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.580
He is a bow tie enthusiast.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.070
He is a husband, a father,
a microbial ecologist,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.200
genomicist,
computational biologist.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.140
He's also a home brewer,
a gardener, a foodie,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.700
and pretentious
cocktail mixologist.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.340
I hope he's serving up some
wonderful cocktails for us

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
today in his stories, and
should also point out, perhaps,

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.110
that he is, at the same time,
the professor of pathology

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.510
and immunology in
biomedical engineering

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.270
and molecular microbiology at
Washington University School

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.040
of Medicine in St. Lewis.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.289
And he is no
stranger to Harvard.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.320
He was here in
George Church's lab.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.720
And he met with
our students today,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.780
and he clearly has a desire for
mentoring students, and leading

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.800
them, and directing them in this
process of becoming scientists

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.450
and inquisitive minds.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.270
And with that, I hope
that you will join me

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.580
in welcoming Professor
Dantas to the stage today.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.080
Thank you.

00:02:35.005 --> 00:02:37.380
- Well, thank you, Sean, for
that very kind introduction.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.020
And thank you to the Radcliffe
Institute for this opportunity

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.420
to come back to an old home.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.690
Before I get started, I want to
say something that I personally

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.780
believe, and I think
reflects the opinion of most

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.465
of my good colleagues, and
that is all good science

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:52.740
is team science.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.257
And if there's anything of
importance that I say today,

00:02:55.257 --> 00:02:57.090
it's because of these
fine folks that I have

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.700
the privilege of working with.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.640
I'm really here as
their spokesperson.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.440
Before I get to the
science aspects,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.200
I do want to mention
this role of serendipity

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830
in everything that
you'll hear today.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.630
So I was a postdoc in George
Church's lab from 2006 to 2009,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.000
and I came here to ostensibly
study microbial engineering

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.530
for biofuels.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.200
This idea that we could
convert plant sustainable

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.620
matter into replacements
for petroleum.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.640
And the approach that myself and
this grad student Martin Summer

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.800
took were to try
to enrich microbes

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.190
from the soil that could
survive on plant-based toxins

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.370
as their sole source of carbon,
with the hope of understanding

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.177
their genetic machinery.

00:03:40.177 --> 00:03:41.760
And we thought we'd
be good scientists

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.640
and set up an appropriate
negative control.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.490
And luckily, our naivete
led us to this idea

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.340
that, OK, the type of compounds
that no microbe should

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.140
be able to consume as
a sole carbon source

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.700
would be antibiotics.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.530
So we went to off
the shelf drugs

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.590
that we could find in George's
lab, set up the experiments,

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.380
and lo and behold, a week
later, we got very poor results

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.800
on the plant-based toxins, but
we had gangbuster growth on all

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.110
of the antimicrobials.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.970
We were surprised.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.672
Most reasonable advisors
would have said, that's great.

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:13.380
Why don't you focus
on what you're doing?

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.320
George is wonderfully
not that type.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.300
He got as excited
as we did and said,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.399
stop the biofuels work for
a while and figure this out.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:23.040
And the rest is history.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.650
Basically, everything
I tell you about today,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.620
every part of our interest
in antimicrobials,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.200
even the ones that will
seem like they were designed

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.530
from scratch with this
oppression [INAUDIBLE],,

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.560
really was because we decided
to follow up on that slightly

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.460
weird experiment.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.520
So let's step back
for a second and think

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.980
about what we're actually
going to discuss,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.130
and that is antimicrobials
or antibiotics.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.020
So the definition
of an antibiotic,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.940
just to get the
language straight,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.150
is any chemical that
either inhibits the growth

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.382
of or kills microbes.

00:04:56.382 --> 00:04:57.840
And today, I'm
going to exclusively

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.260
be talking about the group
of antimicrobials that

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.900
are antibacterials,
these compounds that

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.690
can be used to kill bacteria.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:13.650
One thing that you should
note is what they're not is

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.230
they're not antivirals.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.750
And so this is a CDC Warning
that very clearly tells you,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.300
and you really should
heed this, that anytime

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.160
you have a viral
infection, you certainly

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.350
would be doing no good
if you take antibiotics

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.770
for those viral infections.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.130
And I'll show you pretty
soon that you're probably

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.650
doing something bad.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.190
So one thing to recognize as to
why these particular drugs work

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.160
is because they target the most
key and conserved processes

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.080
of bacterial life.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.430
They destroy the bacteria's
ability to have a cell wall.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.980
So the guts bleed out
if they are impacted

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.810
by things like penicillins.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.847
Or they gunk up the ability
for them to replicate.

00:05:51.847 --> 00:05:53.930
And the reason I bring
this up, rather than really

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.760
to discuss molecular
mechanism, is the mention

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.870
that Paul Erlich called
antibiotics magic bullets,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.640
but we really should be thinking
of them more as magic shotguns

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.450
on magic nuclear bombs
because every bacterium has

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.500
this target.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.720
So when you ingest an
antibiotic, thinking

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.180
that you are going to be
targeting a specific pathogen,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.150
you're actually impacting
every single microbe

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.110
in that ecosystem.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.430
For instance, in your gut.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.430
And so we realize that even
though it might be warranted

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.770
use of this really
important chemical,

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.812
you're going to have
potential collateral damage.

00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:26.644
And it's through that
lens that, really, I'm

00:06:26.644 --> 00:06:28.800
going to be describing
work that people in my lab

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.130
have done to understand what
that collateral damage might

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.160
be, due to both warranted
and unwarranted use

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.090
of antimicrobials.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.570
One thing that we have observed
in that particular vein,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.300
especially by looking at
retrospective studies,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.490
is anytime that
antibiotics are used in,

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.590
for instance, the
human population,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.530
that those antibiotics do have
impacts on all of the good bugs

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.090
as well as the bad bugs.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.210
So down here you look
at this particular plot,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.790
and you could observe that
virtually at any point in life,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.390
at any time point,
you'll notice that there

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.500
are some kind of malady or
some sort of problem that

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.200
occurs on the human side,
even if the anti-microbial was

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.360
warranted.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.250
Now, perhaps the
greatest response

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.830
that a microbe might
have to be trying

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.660
to be killed by
an anti-microbial

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.030
is to respond to
become resistant to it.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.710
And this idea of
antibiotic resistance

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.800
is something you'll
see as a common feature

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.050
that I'll discuss through
the rest of this lecture.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.020
It turns out the history
of anti-microbial use

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.180
in the human population
is intricately linked

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.970
with antibiotic resistance.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.690
So we're here to talk
about serendipity

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.620
that the whole field
of antimicrobials

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.060
is really thanks to a
serendipitous accident

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.542
at the hands of Sir
Fleming, who happened

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.250
to have one of the
greatest opportunities

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.770
to win a Nobel Prize because
he got a little bit sloppy when

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.720
he went on vacation, right?

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.210
So he left out these plates
that we all have heard about,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:58.640
found the penicillin
mold, wiping out

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.026
this potential pathogen.

00:08:00.026 --> 00:08:01.400
But the interesting
part for this

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.480
is that this natural product
anti-microbial penicillin first

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.900
discovered by Fleming
in the 1920s--

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.330
the first actual
treatment because

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.630
of the amount of development
it took was about in the 1940s.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.690
But the first reports of
resistance to this compound

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.499
predated that by over a decade.

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:22.540
And this is something I'll
keep coming back to is

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.977
that anti-microbial resistance,
even though we heard

00:08:24.977 --> 00:08:26.810
about it in these scary
stories in the media

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.520
as being associated
with the clinic,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.960
is actually a natural
feature of all microbes.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.919
You also take the example of
the sulfonamides discovered

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.280
by this German chemist,
Gerhard Domagk.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.070
The sulfonamides were a
synthetic class of compounds.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:46.036
Their first treatment
was in the mid '30s.

00:08:46.036 --> 00:08:47.660
And this is a little
bit more intuitive

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.517
that the first
reports of resistance

00:08:49.517 --> 00:08:51.350
about four or five years
later, though we've

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.900
discovered that that was,
again, an underestimate.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.910
Resistance to those
particular compounds

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.860
was well before humans
came on the scene.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.260
And so this
particular plot shows

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.290
you the sort of zoomed
out view for every class

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.610
of antimicrobials.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.920
So what you're seeing
on the x-axis is time.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.810
You'll see along
the particular plot

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.140
every single important
class of antimicrobials

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.530
used in the clinic.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.860
And when blue shades to red
is the very first reports

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.325
of clinical resistance.

00:09:17.325 --> 00:09:18.950
Another way of
interpreting what you're

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.250
seeing on this particular
plot is antibiotic resistance

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.680
and pathogens is
not a question of

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.140
if, it's just a matter of when.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.900
Death, taxes, antibiotic
resistance, right?

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.360
All of them are
predictably going

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.420
to come up very, very fast.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.290
And this encodes an incredible
burden on the human population.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.534
Now, some of these numbers
have been challenged,

00:09:41.534 --> 00:09:43.700
so I'm not going to focus
too much on the specifics,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.610
but we do know that a
large number of people,

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.980
almost a million people
on the planet right now,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.390
die due to drug
resistant infections.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.810
And this might
scale up if things

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.410
don't change by about 2050 based
on this UK prime minister's

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.830
report from a few years
ago to maybe one person

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.990
dying from a drug
resistant infection

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.420
every three seconds
on the planet.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.240
Now, of course, the human
life is the most important

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.880
in this equation, but it
also costs a lot of money.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.270
So the US economy is estimated
to lose about $55 to $60

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.240
billion per year because
of the treatment of drug

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.390
resistant infections.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.190
If that 10 million
number is to be believed,

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.140
it also scales to
about a cumulative hit

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.710
to the global economy by
2050 of $100 trillion.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.750
So $100 trillion,
for those of you,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.290
like me, who don't have
access to that many zeros,

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.977
is about six years of
the US GDP wiped out.

00:10:36.977 --> 00:10:38.810
And I will warn you,
I'm a little bit sorry,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.590
but this is going to be a
slightly Bad News Bears talk.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.460
That exactly at this time, when
we've got this massive increase

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.390
in drug resistant infections,
exactly when we need new drugs

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.050
to be coming to
market, we don't.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.990
That's a lots of
reasons for this.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.867
So what we've decided to do
as a group is focus not only

00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:01.700
on trying to understand
how we might come up

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.590
with new
antimicrobials, but take

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.110
the parallel complementary
view of saying,

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.327
if we were to
discover key features

00:11:08.327 --> 00:11:10.160
about antimicrobial
resistance that we might

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.587
be able to counteract that could
be part of this particular pie.

00:11:14.587 --> 00:11:16.670
This gets a little bit
molecular in these details,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.650
and I'll try to keep this
at the level that is still

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.191
relevant to this
discussion, and that

00:11:20.191 --> 00:11:23.870
is to ask, now that we know that
resistance is a problem, how

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.330
is it that bacteria
evolve resistance?

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.860
When they see these
antimicrobials,

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.930
how do they make
changes in their genomes

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.030
to become resistant
to these compounds?

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.880
And to do it in the way that
bacteria evolve any property.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.420
And it's in one of two ways.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.500
One way is the way
that we evolve.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.740
That is we have--

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.500
we pass on our genes
over to a progeny.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.120
Bacteria do this by dividing.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.760
And then mistakes occur during
those replication processes.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.660
And if a particular
mistake, a genetic mutation,

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.870
happens to give your progeny
a selective advantage,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.270
it's going to now take
over the population.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.150
And say that selection happens
to be antibiotic resistant.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:03.440
Now that particular resistant
mutant, that resistant kid,

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.950
if you will, in the bacterial
population will take over.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.420
That's called vertical transfer.

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.110
But bacteria and archaea, the
other two domains of life,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.750
can do something that's
much more spectacular.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.350
Something that, unfortunately,
so far we can't do as humans.

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.740
And that is, in one fell
swoop, exchange large chunks

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.930
of DNA, the genetic material,
with their neighbors.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.930
So they don't have to
wait until they have kids.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.470
They can pass on traits to other
members in their population.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.750
And as it turns out, if those
particular pieces of DNA

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.460
encode antibiotic resistance,
in very short timescales,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.770
you can take an entirely
susceptible population

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.220
of microbes and convert them
to be multidrug resistant.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.890
And analysis that many
groups have done now

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.610
suggest and show that because
of the huge selection pressure

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.980
of surviving under
antibiotic stress,

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.430
microbes then use this
particular method.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.650
This idea of horizontal
gene transfer as

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:01.580
opposed to vertical transfer to
become antimicrobial resistant.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.350
And so what I wanted
to talk about are

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:06.620
a few stories that we've
used modern genomic methods

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.750
and computational
methods to understand

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.540
the burden of horizontal
gene transfer in terms

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.975
of who's the source of
these resistance genes,

00:13:13.975 --> 00:13:15.350
and how do they
eventually end up

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.141
in the clinic to cause
the type of problems

00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:19.490
I just talked about?

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.220
Now, one thing that we
as biomedical scientists

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.412
have learned over the
last 10 or 15 years

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:26.120
is if you're a scientist
worth your salt,

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.820
you have an "ome" at the
end of what you study.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.280
Genome, the epigenome.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.670
Not to be left behind,
we as the group

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.490
that study antibiotic
resistance were fortunately

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.110
given the resistome--

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.030
actually a very elegant
concept put forward

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.570
by Gerry Wright from McMaster
University about 12 years

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.560
or so ago--

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.650
to describe all of the genetic
material and any arbitrary

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:50.360
microbe that will
allow you to be

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.970
resistant to a
particular antibiotic.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.430
So how do you study
the resistome?

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.660
How do you study all of
these resistance genes?

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.570
Well, you could certainly
turn to the foundation

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.660
of microbiology, this idea
of domesticating the microbes

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.125
by bringing them into the lab.

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:05.750
And we should certainly
happy that this

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.330
occurs because if a clinical
microbiologist wanted

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.110
to diagnose your
infectious agent,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:11.290
this is what they would do.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.400
In the modern era
of genomics, you

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.680
could then sequence the
genome of that organism

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.810
in further resistance property.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.150
The problem, though,
is we've really

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:24.080
realized over maybe the last two
decades that most microbes live

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.440
in microbial ecosystems
all over-- in the soil,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.700
in our bodies.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:30.110
Virtually anywhere we look.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.844
And most of those have
not been cultured.

00:14:31.844 --> 00:14:34.135
So how do you study things
that have not been cultured,

00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:36.800
or that we've not been
able to domesticate?

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.540
Well, we can turn to sequencing.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.660
This idea of now looking at just
the DNA, the genetic material

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.540
in the organisms, and infer
what type of functions

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.470
they might have.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.959
In this case, the function
of antibiotic resistance.

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:50.000
So at the practical level,
this is literally just

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.330
smashing up all of the microbial
cells, harvesting their DNA,

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.920
putting them
through a sequencer,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.240
and then inferring what
the resistance might be.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.930
And this might seem like you've
got the whole part of the pie.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.990
Unfortunately, you're only
iterating on the known.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.170
So what does that mean?

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.840
It means that all
of our databases

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.270
of known antibiotic
resistance genes

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.940
have been inferred from
that small, tiny minority

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.030
of bacteria that
have been cultured.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.000
And so then when you
use sequencing methods,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.450
you're just relearning
the few tiny ones

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.080
that you've known before.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.070
So what we've done
is try to compliment

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.220
that part of the cryptic
resistome, that part of the pie

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.970
that is the undiscovered, to try
to improve our ability to not

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.460
only harvest out and
bioprospect genes

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.070
that might be a
problem in the clinic,

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.850
but also to try to be sort
of prescient about what might

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.110
eventually occur in the clinic.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.310
So what is this complicated term
called functional metagenomics

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.640
that is the method that we use?

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.220
So the method itself
was codeveloped

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:52.130
by Jo Handelsman,
who's at Wisconsin,

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.860
and John [INAUDIBLE],, who was
here at Harvard Medical School,

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.620
back in the late '90s.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.220
They discovered that much
like the natural process

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.860
of horizontal gene transfer,
if you could come up

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.950
with a method that forces
that to occur in large scale,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:12.200
then you might be able to use
model organisms like E. coli

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.560
and test their ability to
express random chunks of DNA

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.900
from any organism to
encode resistance.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.370
And the steps are the following.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.080
You extract the DNA, you clone
it in to a library in E. coli.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.150
This is an easy to
use microbe bacterium.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:32.180
You get millions of these
random chunks of DNA in E. coli,

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.390
and then you turn
back to culture.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.920
So in this case, much like
a clinical microbiologist

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.220
would do, you use Petri dishes
that have antibiotics in there.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.500
The bacteria that grow now
have a new chunk of DNA

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.180
that is a resistance
gene, and then you

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.980
figure out what's going on.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.894
What are those
genes by sequencing?

00:16:47.894 --> 00:16:49.310
What our lab has
basically done is

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.360
taken that basic engine, married
it with sequencing technology,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.800
and effectively reduced the cost
of doing this by about 1,000

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.545
fold.

00:16:58.545 --> 00:17:00.170
Now, let's say for
the sake of argument

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.930
that you completely zoned
out for those last two slides

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.390
and don't care about any
of those technical details.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.050
The only thing that you need to
take away from what I just said

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.420
is that with this
method, you can start out

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.079
with any arbitrary
group of microbes,

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.484
whether they're cultured or
not, and after pumping them

00:17:16.484 --> 00:17:18.400
through this particular
pipeline, which is now

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.000
a lot cheaper to use,
you'll get a catalog of all

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.180
of the genetic material that is
compatible with horizontal gene

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.560
transfer to make a
particular bug like E. coli

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.210
resistant to antibiotics.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.610
So we apply a
method of this type

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.150
to then interrogate all sorts of
different microbial communities

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.830
for their potential
to contribute

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:42.710
antibiotic resistance
to the clinic.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.580
So this is one way in
which we view the world.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:49.989
This cartoon schematic
of interacting habitats.

00:17:49.989 --> 00:17:52.030
And the reason I put this
up, and you'll see this

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.390
a couple times, is to recognize
partly that microbes don't

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:57.370
care about our definitions.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.040
We might define something
as a habitat boundary.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.321
Microbes can traverse those.

00:18:01.321 --> 00:18:03.070
And so what we'd really
like to understand

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.220
from an ecological perspective
is that even though resistance

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.280
really is most acutely
problematic in the clinic,

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.590
because microbes in
different habitats

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.540
could themselves
transfer over eventually

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.307
into the clinic or their
genes could transfer over,

00:18:16.307 --> 00:18:18.640
we would like to understand
all of the interactions that

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.970
are shown here.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:21.740
So I'll walk through
a couple of habitats

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.660
that we've
particularly focused on

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.415
to discover resistance genes, to
assess their risk of getting it

00:18:27.415 --> 00:18:29.740
in the clinic, and
hopefully also to mitigate

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.194
those particular risks.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.360
And I'll start out by not
going into too much detail

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.540
and just giving you a couple of
highlights that we've published

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.920
on from our investigations
of the so-called commencal

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.000
microbiome.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.310
So these are the good
bugs, for the most part,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.650
that live in and on our bodies.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.770
The one that's been studied
the best is the gut microbiome.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.620
So, again, this is the trillions
of microbes that live in us.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.960
They're basically another organ.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.510
And because they're
constantly subjected

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.850
to antibiotic pressure,
it makes sense

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.520
that they might be a source
through which pathogens

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.475
could pick up resistance genes.

00:19:05.475 --> 00:19:06.850
So one of the
things that we were

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:10.090
surprised to find in
collaboration with Rob Knight's

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.360
group as well as Maria
Gloria Dominguez'

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.460
was that through
them, we got access

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.040
to fecal samples
and oral samples

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.950
from an Amazonian tribe
at first contract.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.340
I can't tell you, how do you
convince a group of people

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.420
who've never seen the
outside world to give you

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.290
a fecal sample?

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.110
I think that's probably how our
first alien contact would be.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.110
They'll be taking
microbiome samples from us.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.640
But Erica Pehrsson, a genetics
graduate student in my lab,

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.502
accessed those samples, used
the methods I just described,

00:19:39.502 --> 00:19:41.460
and we were shocked to
find in these people who

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.740
had no history of any
antibiotic use resistance

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.142
genes against
modern antibiotics.

00:19:47.142 --> 00:19:49.600
And you'll see when I get to
the soil why this makes sense,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.060
but we thought this is an
important thing to recognize--

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.520
that resistance
against these compounds

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.130
is not something that we
invent through our use.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.460
It already exists as a natural
feature of these ecosystems.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.070
We just give selection pressure
by using the antibiotics

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.620
for them to amplify.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.750
Now, I'll give you another
example of something

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.760
that's at the other extreme
of the spectrum [? will ?]

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.490
[? be ?] no invulnerable
populations.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.320
They get a ton of antibiotics.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.300
And that is, for
instance, in this case,

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.400
preterm human infants.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.609
So we know that rates of
prematurity are going up,

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:24.150
and especially when we look at
very low birth weight infants.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.160
So these are infants that are
born about 10 weeks too early.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.230
These kids are highly
immature in terms

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.870
of their immune systems.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.810
And because of their
risk of infections,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.750
we give them a ton
of antibiotics.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.320
Well, not me.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.153
I'm not a physician.

00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:37.700
But the field.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.280
And so, for instance,
in this cohort,

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.580
which is describing kids born
in St. Louis at our Children's

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.030
Hospital, virtually 100%
of these kids born 10 weeks

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.190
to early get antibiotics
as soon as they're

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.210
born for the first
couple days of life.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.006
And as you'll see in the
plot next to the histogram,

00:20:53.006 --> 00:20:54.880
the top two drugs that
they get while they're

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.490
in the neonatal ICU
are antibiotics.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.190
Four of the top eight drugs
that they get are antibiotics.

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.670
So we step back again from
an ecological perspective

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.980
and you think about the
fact that these kids require

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.200
this commencal
microbiome to set up.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.510
What you're doing with each
of these insults is you're

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:15.640
carpet bombing an ecosystem that
should be setting up normally.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.140
So we wanted to assess what
the collateral damage might be.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.780
And so one thing
we found-- and this

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.990
was work led by Molly
Gibson, a graduate

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.110
from our computational biology
program in collaboration

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.110
with a couple of pediatricians
at Wash U, Barb Warner and Phil

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.700
Tarr.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.470
We had access to a large
cohort of fecal samples.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.940
They actually have about
75,000 fecal samples bank,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.040
which is probably the
largest collection of poop

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.540
in one particular location.

00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.310
And we access only 400 of
those in two groups of kids--

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.250
ones that had lots of
antibiotic exposure and ones

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.250
that didn't have very much.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:52.360
And the thing that I
just want to emphasize

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.360
for the non-clinical
microbiology aficionados,

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.930
the main thing that
Molly discovered

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.490
that was surprising
to us was the identity

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.740
of the bacteria that
was surviving all

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.390
of these insults in these kids.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.640
And so, again, don't worry
about the specific names,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.348
but you have to take
my word for the fact

00:22:08.348 --> 00:22:11.140
that the bugs dominating
the guts of these very

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:15.520
vulnerable kids are the bad guy
bugs on the CDC list, right?

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.660
These are not bacteria that we
associate with good gut health.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.010
They're the bugs that usually
cause nosocomial hospital

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.271
acquired infections.

00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:24.770
And perhaps now that you think
about the selection pressure,

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.110
it's not all that surprising.

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.850
Who else can survive
those insults

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.510
except the really hardcore
drug resistant bugs?

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.330
But the silver lining there
is that through a series

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.930
of computational approaches--

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.750
again, the aficionados
call it machine learning.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.430
That's partly because
it sounds fancier.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.510
It's really pattern recognition
using computer algorithms.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.540
So what Molly did was
she took all of this data

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.580
that she had gathered in
terms of who was there

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.890
in the microbiome and
their resistance genes

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.520
and trained the model, and was
fortunately able to predict how

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.020
the microbiome
would change based

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.910
on just a couple
of these features,

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.980
with about 85% accuracy.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.380
Why is that something to
consider as being important?

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.990
Because it suggests
that a potential future

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.900
of personalized medicine,
where each of us, anytime we

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:13.170
get sick, we might be able to
get our microbiomes sequenced.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:15.510
As these type of
methods improve,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.280
your physicians
might be able to take

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.400
the information about your
specific microbiome state

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.430
and tailor your antimicrobial
therapy in a way that

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.805
not just kills the infection,
but protects your microbiome.

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:29.820
So we're hoping that this
is where this will go.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.840
Now, a picture tells
a thousand words.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.720
And I can't think of anything
besides this particular

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.420
questionable parenting
event in really telling you

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.320
that resistance cross
habitats, right?

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.410
And so we decided to
take this concept--

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.650
and here's the slightly more
boring version of that slide,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.900
where, fortunately, through
a number of international

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.930
collaborations led by Erica,
who I already mentioned,

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.170
and Pablo Tsukayama, another
graduate student in my lab,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.650
we accessed samples from
a village in El Salvador

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.810
in a slum outside Lima, Peru to
look at potential interactions

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.310
between microbes and resistance
genes between people--

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.880
so we have fecal samples--

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.280
and as many
environmental samples

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.360
we could get at the same
time with GPS coordinates.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.760
So soil samples,
and sewage samples,

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.610
and subsistence
animals and pets.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.520
And, again, I won't belabor
all of that incredible data

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.010
analysis that these
folks did, and just

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:27.960
jumped to the
conclusion that we think

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.000
has impacts on public health.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.770
And that was they
were able to identify

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.190
using this analysis key hot
spots for resistance gene

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.660
exchange.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.750
So what this means is they
identified particular features,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.580
particular habitats
between these people

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.310
in the environment that have
clear evidence for having

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.040
the same resistance
genes in those habitats

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.910
in humans as well
as the environment.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.300
And we found two such
key habitats, again,

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.030
which could be really impactful
for public health in El

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.590
Salvador and in Peru.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:59.400
So across the top panel, you'll
see pictures of chicken coops

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.590
in El Salvador in the
village, and that appeared

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.810
to be one of these hotspots.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.800
So this is the droppings
from the chickens,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.120
who are subsistence animals.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.730
Had exactly the
same resistant genes

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.620
as the humans, as
well as the soil,

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.990
implicating those
chickens as a route

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.302
between moving between
humans and the environment.

00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:17.010
The reason this is
important to consider,

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:18.750
especially here
in the US in terms

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.570
of its translational
impact, is the folks

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.470
in El Salvador in this village
don't use any antimicrobials

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.300
in growing their chickens, where
almost any chicken that you

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.820
or I would eat has
probably been grown

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.520
under the pressure of
lots of antibiotics.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.110
If you think of
what's happening here,

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:37.410
consider what might be happening
when we're eating chicken

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.940
under antibiotic pressure.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.040
The story was a little
bit different in Lima

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.600
in terms of what we found there.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.810
There, we were able to implicate
the sewage treatment system

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.390
as a hotspot for such exchange.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.420
So this is a massively
crowded ecosystem.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.450
All of the effluent sewage
goes through a single treatment

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:58.230
plant that's cleaned up based on
pretty sound civil engineering

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.310
principles.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.740
And then once that
water is clean,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.270
it has to be dumped somewhere.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.430
Now, in Boston, that's
dumped in your harbor.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.070
Far out, but still
in you harbor.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.010
In Lima, being a
desert, that water

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:16.380
is used to irrigate every single
field and every single place

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.070
that requires water.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.040
And so you might now
consider that even

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.350
though the civil engineering
system was working

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.480
to destroy certain
types of microbes,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.150
because it was allowing
other microbes to thrive,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:28.680
that it picked up
resistance genes

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.530
from the human microbiome,
they are now disseminating

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:33.390
those genes all over Lima.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:37.470
So this is where, again, these
kind of bioprospecting methods

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.350
to hunt for resistance
genes comes into play

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.720
to have potential
public health impacts.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.470
So I'm going to leave
the human microbiome

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:47.840
and spend a little bit
more time on a habitat

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.790
that maybe a lot
of people may not

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:54.170
consider as a really key part of
antibiotic resistant exchange,

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.290
and that is the soil
or the soil microbiome.

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.820
So why look at the soil?

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.830
As it turns out,
there's a long history,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.430
decades worth of really
important work, implicating

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.950
the microbes in the soil,
perhaps the most diverse

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.020
ecosystem of microbes
on the planet,

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.510
in not just the
production of antibiotics,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.202
but also in
antibiotic resistance.

00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:15.410
And I'm only going to give
you three examples of work

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:17.990
by other people that
really inspire our work.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.390
One was this beautiful story
by Gerry Wright and colleagues

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.030
where they went into the
Canadian Beringian permafrost,

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.400
cored out samples that they
could carbon date to be 30,000

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.180
years old, sequenced the DNA
there, and then interrogated

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.060
that DNA for whether they could
find antibiotic resistance.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.770
And lo and behold,
they found resistance

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.250
to modern antibiotics,
providing clear genetic evidence

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.010
that resistance in
environmental microbes

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.320
vastly predates any
human use of antibiotics.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.500
So kind of putting the nail
in the coffin of saying,

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.440
resistance existed before
we came up with antibiotics

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.051
or discovered them.

00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:54.800
Another piece of
evidence that's important

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.780
is put forward by kind
of the grandfather

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.020
of the antibiotic resistance
field, Julian Davies, who now,

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.660
more than 40 years
ago, recognized

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.220
that almost all
of these compounds

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.400
that we call antibiotics
are natural products of soil

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.610
bacteria.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.160
So all of those
Nobel prizes that

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.410
were given for the
discovery of antibiotics

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.330
came from people hunting
in the environment--

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.500
This is the case with amino
glycocides, as an example--

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.520
where you found these
extracts from the soil

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.620
and realized, whoa,
they're able to kill

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.914
these particular
pathogenic bacteria.

00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:28.580
That's because of
these small molecules.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.980
And so what Julian posited,
and it's been supported since,

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.990
is that these producers must
be the original evolutionary

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.270
progenitors of
antibiotic resistance.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:42.380
And why is that?

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.230
Because these antimicrobials
target, as I said,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.976
key processes of bacterial life.

00:28:46.976 --> 00:28:48.350
So if they didn't
have resistance

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.830
at the same time as production,
they would commit suicide.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.580
So it would not be a
terribly interesting

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.230
evolutionary process
to figure this out

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.420
without having
resistance just in time.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.600
Since all of this happens
millions of billions of years

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.330
ago, they have also given
all of their neighbors

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.030
the pressure to
evolve resistance,

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.330
hence soil is the original
source of resistance.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.180
And then finally, to show
that we as humans can actually

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:13.730
have an impact in
a bad way, this

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:15.910
is evidence from
European archival soils

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.400
of about 70 years, where this
group led by David Graham

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.180
was able to measure the
abundance of resistance genes

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.900
and find that over the
years of human use,

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.550
their abundance has gone up.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.990
So based on all
of this evidence,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.450
the one thing that
you might speculate

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.210
is that for this
reason, every resistance

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:38.200
gene, every resistance element
that you find in a pathogen,

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.000
a disease causing microbe
must be the same as the one--

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.730
they must be identical to things
that you find in the clinic.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.230
Sorry.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.200
In the soil.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.710
And bizarrely, that's
not what we found.

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:49.460
So when we started
working on this

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.304
and looking through
databases, virtually all

00:29:52.304 --> 00:29:54.470
of the resistance genes
that people have worked hard

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.480
to discover in
soil microbes were

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.570
vastly different from
the type of microbes

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:00.900
that we see causing infections.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.440
So this seemed like
a bit of a conundrum,

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.290
and our hypothesis
was maybe we've

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.080
just been looking at the
wrong slice of the pie.

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.750
Now, one thing that
Gerry Wright's group

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:14.870
had done to really emphasize
that the bugs in the soil

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.850
are highly resistant was
they went and they isolated,

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.420
in the seminal paper from
2006, a whole group of microbes

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.920
that there are no other
producers of antibiotics.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.220
So all they did was
culture them up,

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.900
noted the produce
of antibiotics,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.940
and then tested to
see how resistant

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.390
are these nonpathogenic
bacteria to antimicrobials?

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:37.940
And shockingly, on
average, these bacteria

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.280
were resistant to seven
or eight different classes

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.980
of antibiotics, even though
they're not pathogens.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.860
So that's actually more
resistant than most pathogens.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.170
So now this should be used
as evidence, probably,

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:49.580
that these guys were the
guys that were producing

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.050
the resistance genes, right?

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.330
But, again, we stumbled
across this problem

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.150
where when people analyze the
genes that these producers

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.460
have, they look completely
different from the genes

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.750
that the pathogens have.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.910
So how do you reconcile
that particular disparity

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.130
between the phenotype
of high resistance

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:05.960
and the genotype of
being very different?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.709
So one way in which
you can reconcile that

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:09.620
is to say, OK, I
buy the argument

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.590
that these guys are the
original donators of resistance.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.590
But it happened so long ago,
millions to billions of years

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.470
ago, that it's not really
relevant in terms of us

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.740
treating clinical problems.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.239
So that's one hypothesis.

00:31:21.239 --> 00:31:23.030
The other hypothesis
is maybe there's still

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.200
another missing link.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.230
Maybe there are microbes in
the soil that are contributing,

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.240
we just still haven't
found them out yet.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.790
And so this now jumps over
to this crazy experiment

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.950
that we did when we
were in George's lab

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:36.950
where we said, OK, what about
these weird bugs that are

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.050
able to eat antibiotics, right?

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.750
So you've got the producers,
you've got the resistors,

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.450
and now you've got the eaters.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.370
So in this slightly, again,
ridiculous experiment,

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.280
we tried to enrich microbes in
the soil that could-- again,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.230
not just resistance antibiotics.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:55.460
They were using them as
their sole source of energy.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.230
It wasn't a terribly
elegant experiment.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.530
It was just a lot of culturing.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.440
And when we were able
to successfully identify

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.570
all of these microbes that
could eat antibiotics,

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.130
we then tested their resistance.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.572
Now, what I'm showing
you in the bottom in blue

00:32:09.572 --> 00:32:11.030
is the same data
from Gerry Wright,

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.505
where his producer organisms,
on average, resistant

00:32:13.505 --> 00:32:15.590
to about seven or
eight antibiotics.

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:18.800
Now you look at the eaters
on the right hand side.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.300
They're, on average, resistant
to 17 or 18 antibiotics

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.390
out of 17 or 18 antibiotics
of which we could test.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.490
Basically, they don't care
about the antibiotics.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.864
Actually, they do
care about them

00:32:29.864 --> 00:32:31.610
because they're eating them.

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.220
So we think now we have finally
stumbled across that missing

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.110
link.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.610
The potential that
these eater organisms

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:41.420
might be contributing to
resistance in the clinic.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.990
Now, before I get to showing
how we actually did that,

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:46.970
I'm going to jump ahead 10 years
from that original discovery,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.640
which is how long it
took us to figure out

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.830
how it was that these bizarre
bugs were eating antibiotics.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.110
How were they surviving
on the antibiotics the way

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.670
that most bugs
survive on glucose?

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.930
And so this was work that
was led by many people,

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:04.830
but primarily by Terence Crofts,
a recent postdoc in my lab.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.740
We went to about five
of these soil bacteria

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.880
and used a battery of techniques
to really pin down how the heck

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.910
they were using those compounds,
which normally kill bacteria,

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.860
as their source of food.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:22.290
And you almost brush past
it if I don't point it out.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.440
One of these bacteria
can eat penicillin

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.950
as its sole source of carbon,
but it can't use glucose.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:32.890
Doesn't like sugar,
like antibiotics.

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:36.247
And so I'm not going to belabor,
again, the molecular biology.

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.580
All I'll say is that through
a lot of different people's

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.650
contributions, we were
able to figure out

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.280
that there are three key steps
of how these bacteria eat

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.400
antibiotics.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.220
And the important part is
that the committing step is

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:48.900
an antibiotic resistance gene.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.350
So the very, very first thing
that these bad bugs need to do

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.050
is to detoxify this
toxic compound.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.140
So they break it open exactly
the way the pathogens do,

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.500
and then they digest it using
a couple of different methods.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.630
And just to show
that we really, truly

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:08.610
understood one way in which
to show that the genes that

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.469
underlie this
particular phenomenon

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.584
are sufficient for
this particular trait

00:34:12.584 --> 00:34:15.000
is you could transfer that
trait to another bacterium that

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.530
doesn't have this.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:19.810
So that's something else
that we did, led by Terence,

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.810
was we were to take all
of the inference he made

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.647
from these soil microbes,
transfer those genes into E.

00:34:24.647 --> 00:34:28.400
coli, one of these benign
microbes in the lab, at least,

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.510
and he was able
to convert E. coli

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.639
into an eater of penicillin.

00:34:32.639 --> 00:34:34.976
Now, we're not doing
this because we're crazy.

00:34:34.976 --> 00:34:36.600
Someone might ask,
why the hell are you

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.239
turning E. coli, which can,
you know, some versions,

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.010
make people sick.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.179
Why are you making
it eat antibiotics?

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:43.679
Well, in this case,
our motivation

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:45.270
was partly to prove
that we really

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:46.927
understood how it
worked, but also

00:34:46.927 --> 00:34:48.510
because it might be
used in the future

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.730
for clean up of antibiotics.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.070
Not with this basic
work, but perhaps

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.409
in the future where if you
could have microbes that

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.380
have these abilities to destroy
these antibiotics, which

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.560
can contaminate systems, like we
had seen in the sewage systems,

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.870
maybe use as a next
generation approach

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.270
to clean up, much like
we clean up our sewage,

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.400
using microbes to
destroy these antibiotics

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:11.190
before they go
out into the wild.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.850
OK.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.070
So now let's step back to say--

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.220
so that showed that
we can figure out

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.960
how to eat the
antibiotics, but what

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.700
about this fundamental question?

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.490
Are they the missing
link between the soil

00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.300
and the clinic?

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.980
And so to do that,
we step back and--

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.590
this was work done
by Kevin Forsberg,

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:30.720
a graduate in our
genetics program,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.450
and Alejandro Reyes, who
was a graduate student

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:34.950
in Jeff Gordon's lab.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.200
So they applied that
method many, many

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.840
slides ago, where
we go and discover

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.616
new antibiotic resistance genes.

00:35:41.616 --> 00:35:43.740
And they applied it to
these antibiotic eating bugs

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:45.810
and said, OK, using
this method that

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.780
doesn't require a priori
knowledge of what resistance

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.720
genes are, looking for
cryptic resistance genes,

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.387
can we discover
the missing link?

00:35:54.387 --> 00:35:55.470
And sure enough, they did.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.790
In a single experiment,
they've now increased evidence

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.150
by an order of magnitude
of the number of genes

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.600
in the soil that were exactly
the same as resistant genes

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.825
and pathogens that
cause disease.

00:36:08.825 --> 00:36:10.950
And, again, I won't talk
about the specific details

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.567
of the resistance genes in
terms of what the names are.

00:36:13.567 --> 00:36:15.900
But the key features that
certainly made us a little bit

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.780
scared was the fact that
between those 10 genes,

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.600
they knock out four or five
classes of antibiotics.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.870
We find them not only in those
bugs, but also in pathogens.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:28.380
And in that map that you see,
any country that's shaded dark

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.410
is a country that is deposited,
or someone in that country

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.230
has deposited at a pathogen,
with a resistance gene that

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.250
was identical to those genes
we discovered in US soils.

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:41.670
And to emphasize that this was
particularly problematic, what

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.410
you're seeing here
is a comparison

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.480
of all of those genes
compared to genes that

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.792
have been found in pathogens.

00:36:46.792 --> 00:36:48.750
And you'll see that there
are many genes there.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.487
So across the bottom are the
genes that come from the soil;

00:36:51.487 --> 00:36:53.820
across the top are the genes
that come from four or five

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.130
important pathogens;
and anywhere you

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.320
see gray shading,
that's identical.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.660
100% DNA identity.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.240
And what we observe here
is that not only did we

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.120
find that they're the same
single genes across these bugs,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.032
but actually they're
clustered together.

00:37:08.032 --> 00:37:10.490
So anything in red that you
see is an antibiotic resistance

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:11.220
gene.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.890
Anything in yellow is a gene
involved in horizontal gene

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:14.610
transfer.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.950
So they're the vehicles
that move genes around.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.870
So what we're seeing
here is evidence

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.080
that bugs in the soil and
bugs that cause disease

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.200
can move large chunks of
DNA between themselves

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.940
that can knock out
three, four classes

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.840
of antibiotic resistance in
horizontal gene transfer events

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.510
that can happen on
the order of minutes.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.146
So, again, now, taking
all of this together,

00:37:36.146 --> 00:37:37.770
reconcile with the
day that was before,

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:40.560
it suggests that we have
discovered the missing link,

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.060
and these are the
bugs that we might

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:45.970
want to focus on as we consider
challenges to the clinic.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.960
Now, I will again
preface all of this

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.365
I guess by saying that
we stumbled across this.

00:37:52.365 --> 00:37:54.490
This was not something we
originally set out to do,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.400
because only someone insane
would think about looking

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.920
for antibiotic eating bugs.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.070
But since we had this, and
now we had this data in hand,

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.720
we wanted to ask,
how much of this

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.060
is this the exception
versus the rule?

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:09.800
That is to say, because we have
gone to this bizarre experiment

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.790
of culturing bugs that
could eat antibiotics,

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.890
which we discovered were
these multidrug resistant

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:17.920
proteobacteria, now
Kevin, who led that study,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.440
teamed up with Sanket
Patel in the lab to ask,

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.720
again, when we stumble
across those weird bugs,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.050
are they representative
of all bugs in the soil,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.000
or are they sort
of these weirdos?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.220
And basically, the short
answer to that story

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.410
is they are weirdos.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.456
And, really, the
only important part

00:38:34.456 --> 00:38:35.830
of this sort of
complicated slide

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:38.500
was we now collaborate
with a couple of ecologists

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.170
in Colorado, Rob
Knight and Noah Fierer,

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:43.210
got access to a much
larger number of soils,

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.390
about 20 soils; applied
the same methods;

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.390
discovered thousands of new
resistance genes in the soil.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.850
But luckily, most of
those resistance genes

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:54.910
are not ones that we
found in pathogens.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.580
it appears, really, it's only
that tiny weirdo minority

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.010
there of proteobacteria
that are the ones that

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.630
are the missing link.

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.340
The other thing we
discovered is all

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.770
of those genes we found
from these bugs that are not

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:07.630
the same as in pathogens,
they don't have

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.210
those same linkages with
mobilization elements

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.806
that cause those
genes to hop around.

00:39:12.806 --> 00:39:14.680
So we know that in
pathogens, for those genes

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.299
to move between
different bugs, they

00:39:16.299 --> 00:39:18.340
require those accessory
elements to actually move

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.560
the DNA back and forth.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.560
These guys in the
soil didn't have them.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.851
So how do we put all of this
together towards something

00:39:23.851 --> 00:39:25.810
that could be impactful
for work in the future?

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:28.930
We think what we've done is
we've discovered, indeed,

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.020
that the soil is rife with
antibiotic resistance genes,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.250
probably reflecting this
evolutionary pressure

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.370
of antibiotics being
produced in the soil.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.770
But, fortunately,
most of those genes

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:42.280
are not at risk for being
acquired by pathogens,

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.210
but there are these
very specific bugs,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.020
but now we know the identity,
that we can focus on

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.820
so that we can prevent
them from traversing

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:52.500
these particular boundaries.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.810
But, as it turns
out, there is still

00:39:54.810 --> 00:40:00.450
something interesting to learn
from these particular bacteria

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.600
from the soil that have these
cryptic resistance genes.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.790
So one hypothesis that we came
up with at the time was to say,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:08.760
could these be
bellwether events?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.380
Could these genes
that we have seen

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.427
that haven't popped into
pathogenic bacteria yet,

00:40:13.427 --> 00:40:14.760
could we stack [INAUDIBLE] them?

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.360
Could we evaluate their
risk across those thousands

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.670
for the few that we
think might emerge

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.476
into the clinic in a few years?

00:40:22.476 --> 00:40:23.850
So why would you
want to do that?

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.870
Why would you want
to know what is

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:26.119
going to happen in the future?

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:28.740
It's because if you know
which ones are at great risk,

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:30.935
those are the ones you can
focus on for mitigation.

00:40:30.935 --> 00:40:32.560
The ones that you
might try to destroy,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.230
the ones that you
might try to diagnose.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.021
And this is the story
I'm going to tell you

00:40:36.021 --> 00:40:38.220
about one such class
of enzymes, and that's

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.180
against the class of antibiotics
called the tetracyclines.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.500
The tetracyclines are a
very, very important class

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.700
of antibiotics.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.890
They were discovered
in the late '40s,

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.890
and they continue to be
one of the major classes

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.560
of antibiotics used in the
clinic, in agriculture,

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.700
and aquaculture.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.510
And the way they work is they
gunk up a bacterium's ability

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:01.260
to make proteins by targeting
this thing called a ribosome.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.439
So big surprise, because they've
been used against pathogens,

00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:06.730
pathogens have figured out
how to be resistant to them.

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.688
And the two main ways
that they do that is they

00:41:08.688 --> 00:41:12.390
either pump the drug out or
they protect their ribosomes.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.160
What hadn't been
observed very much,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.890
though, was a third
mechanism of resistance,

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.600
which a lot of bacteria
use, and that is

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.786
destroying the chemical itself.

00:41:20.786 --> 00:41:22.410
And that seems to be
a pretty good idea

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.840
if you're a bacterium in terms
of wanting to be resistant.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.756
If you destroy the
chemical, it can't hurt you

00:41:26.756 --> 00:41:28.205
and it can't hurt
your population.

00:41:28.205 --> 00:41:30.080
That's how, for instance,
those beta-lactams,

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.650
those penicillins,
that's they're

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:32.900
destroyed by most pathogens.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.490
There are enzymes that cleave
them and break them apart.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:39.280
So we found evidence of
only one such instance.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.080
There was a nonpathogenic
bacterium from human guts

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.970
that had been shown to have this
particular enzymatic activity.

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.060
So we decided to say
we've got this treasure

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:51.420
trove of newly discovered
resistance genes in the soil--

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:54.390
could we find evidence that
these guys might actually

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.230
be lurking somewhere beneath
the detection threshold?

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.450
Motivating this was,
again, as I mentioned,

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:03.110
the fact that the tetracyclines
are a unique class where

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:04.860
not only are they old,
but they've kind of

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.090
gone through this Renaissance
of being modified and getting

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.552
newer and newer
versions of them.

00:42:10.552 --> 00:42:12.510
Including-- and this is
something that's really

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:13.840
important to keep in mind--

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.640
the last three drugs that were
approved by the FDA in the US

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.380
as antibiotics are
all tetracyclines.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.420
One in August of 2018 and
two in October of 2018.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:28.350
They're a really important
emerging class of antibiotics.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:30.480
One other thing to note
is that those drugs that

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.320
are coming to market have not
been considering, obviously,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.990
a resistance mechanism that
has not been seen in the clinic

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.660
yet.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.390
So we want to make
sure we can enable

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.300
the protection of these
particular compounds

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.730
by seeing whether there,
again, is this lurking

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.080
danger against them.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.830
So to do that, Kevin, who
had done the soil work,

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.870
basically discovered
this new class of enzyme

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.080
across the soils.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.990
I won't walk you
through all of the data.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.270
All I'll say is that
he was able to show

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.180
that about 10 such
enzymes existed

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.940
that can destroy the
tetracyclines and a whole bunch

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.530
of soil bacteria.

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.701
They were completely novel.

00:43:05.701 --> 00:43:07.200
They were not
related, for instance,

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.770
to the ones that had been
seen in the human gut before.

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.400
And the only gene or enzyme that
we could find in any database

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.240
that they were similar
to was a gene legionella.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.830
So legionella causes
legionnaires' disease.

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.350
It's a soil derived
pathogen. And sure enough,

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.890
this was something lurking
in the genome of legionella

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.330
that no one knew was a
resistance gene, that we were

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.750
able to now show can cause
legionella to no longer respond

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.920
to tetracycline therapy.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.690
So that's all well and good.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.580
What is the clinical relevance?

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.910
So it turns out Drew Gasparrini,
who recently graduated

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.820
from my lab, went through
all of those selections that

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:44.340
had been performed in my
lab across many, many, many

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.400
different habitats from human
fecal samples, and soils,

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.460
and sewage samples from
El Salvador and Peru,

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.310
and started looking to see
whether maybe more of these

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:54.310
are there.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.700
So just a quick
cursory survey, he

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.910
found that there were 70 more
such enzymes that existed just

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:01.860
in our freezers.

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:05.250
And in this case, good for
our funding and really bad

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:08.610
for humanity, just in
the time that we started

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.850
working on this,
those resistance genes

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:14.550
started popping into pathogens.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.340
Exactly what we had
speculated would occur.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:20.040
Really hoped that it
wouldn't, but it did.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.040
So this is why we've now decided
to take a very concerted effort

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.790
to understand those enzymes,
understand the vulnerabilities

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.050
to hopefully destroy them.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.591
And so that's exactly
what we've been

00:44:29.591 --> 00:44:31.440
able to do, turning
back to something

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.530
that we've learned
from the penicillins.

00:44:33.530 --> 00:44:36.120
So one way in which
the chemists have

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.690
helped rescue the penicillins
a little bit is to recognize

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.420
that, yep, the penicillins
or the beta-lactams

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.300
are degraded by this
particular professional enzymes

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:46.620
called beta-lactamases.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.120
So if you can come
up with chemicals

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.550
that break the resistance, you
can reactivate the antibiotic.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.655
So this is the idea for
a beta-lactam, which

00:44:54.655 --> 00:44:57.650
is the antibiotic, and a
beta-lactamase inhibitor

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.690
combination, so
breaking the resistance.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.260
So we said, hey,
why not try that?

00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:04.010
Let's try to find
compounds that kind

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:05.990
of look similar to
the tetracyclines that

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:09.350
might be able to gunk up those
tetracycline disrupt cases.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:12.570
And, again, this is where
serendipity comes into play.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.830
You may not believe me, but the
very first compound we tried

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:17.930
had that property.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.582
And it happens to be a compound
called anhydrotetracycline.

00:45:21.582 --> 00:45:23.040
The name is not
all that important.

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.456
But again, what
we're able to show

00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:26.720
is that if we add
anhydrotetracycline

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.250
into the mix when
these enzymes are

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.080
working to degrade
the tetracyclines,

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.660
they don't work anymore.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.730
And what you're seeing
here is something

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:37.460
that's a little bit more
relevant to the clinic.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.000
There's a way in which to
measure the resistance that

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.800
is encoded in our
organism by looking

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.900
at how well it will grow in
the presence of the antibiotic.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.810
So on your left hand
side, you have seen

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.490
what's called an Etest strip.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.230
This is basically
a piece of paper

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:53.420
that has an antibiotic
across a gradient

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.210
that you put on a lawn
of growing bacteria.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.900
If the bacteria can't grow close
to it, they're susceptible.

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.585
They've being killed
by the antibiotic.

00:46:01.585 --> 00:46:03.710
If they grow really close
to it, they're resistant.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.835
You can see in the first
panel the bacteria growing

00:46:05.835 --> 00:46:07.520
really, really close to it.

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.490
So this is E. coli with
one of these enzymes

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:11.900
growing close to tetracycline.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.670
They don't care that
tetracycline's there.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.150
We add this newly discovered
inhibitor, and lo and behold,

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.490
tetracycline can work again.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:23.304
And so we are now really
heartened by this discovery.

00:46:23.304 --> 00:46:25.720
And through collaboration by
a couple of other researchers

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.450
at Wash U, an organic
chemist, Tim Wencewicz, who

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.830
trained with Chris Walsh
here, and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.650
a structural
biologist, we have now

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:37.910
been able to take this initial
sort of prediscovery almost,

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:43.550
make new synthetic analogs
to that originally discovered

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.070
inhibitor, and now
we've been able to make

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.490
even more potent inhibitors
of these particular enzymes.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.640
And, again, now that we
were spending more time

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:54.980
looking at more and
more of these genes,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:57.560
what we're seeing here
about 20 or so of the genes

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.540
that we've been
working on so far.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:03.020
The ones in red are
the ones in the soil.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.780
The ones in blue are ones
that now we've discovered live

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.240
in the guts of healthy humans.

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.460
One of the things
that's, again, motivating

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.530
us to sort of work
fast on this is,

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.840
I already told you,
one of these enzymes

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.857
in the soil we
found in legionella.

00:47:16.857 --> 00:47:18.440
Just last year, we
discovered that one

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.250
of these enzymes that destroys
every single tetracycline we've

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.170
thrown at these
particular enzymes--

00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:28.140
including the compounds that
were just approved by the FDA,

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.840
they destroyed those too.

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.500
That gene or that enzyme we
found in a cystic fibrosis

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.100
patient sample in pseudomonas.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.540
So that's really scary.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.390
But the good news is our
hypothesis came true.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:43.290
By focusing four or
five years earlier

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.990
and trying to find
those inhibitors,

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:48.200
we now have inhibitors
that can resensitize

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.020
that pseudomonas isolate
to those latest generation

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.860
tetracyclines.

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:53.560
OK.

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.770
So I'm going to end my
talk now in the next couple

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:01.720
slides with a simple question--
why are we not dead yet?

00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.580
With everything
I've just shown you,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.290
why are we not
dropping like flies

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:07.930
every time some highly drug
resistant bacterium comes

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:08.710
around?

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.810
And, certainly, the CDC has
this almost Pokemon card deck

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.880
of bad guys that tells
you you should really

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.880
be scared, you know, in
terms of their hit points.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.790
You've got acinetobacter
and carbapenems, resistant

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.230
antibacterial pseudomonas.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.688
These beautiful pictures of
things that if they get in you,

00:48:25.688 --> 00:48:27.190
they're going to
kill you, right?

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:28.990
So what can we do about this?

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:30.670
I showed you one strategy.

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:32.770
Do we have anything
in our arsenal

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.830
to be able to fight back against
these multidrug resistant

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:36.840
organisms?

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:39.320
So it turns out there are
some strategies outside

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.170
of just coming up
with new antibiotics

00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:42.400
that we might be able to use.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:48.100
And this is where we turn to
some evolutionary biologists

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.170
and systems biologists
to think sort

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:53.350
of out of the box a
little bit to figure out,

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:56.370
what are general
strategies we might have

00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:00.550
to do to kind of flip the
table on the drug resistant

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:01.690
organisms?

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:06.340
And so one idea is called
a selection inversion.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.660
So what does that
term actually mean?

00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.650
It means trying to come up
with some kind of magic sauce

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:14.950
that transiently allows
the drug's susceptible

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.410
version of the organism,
the one that you can kill,

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.244
to outcompete the drug
resistant version.

00:49:20.244 --> 00:49:21.160
Why would you do that?

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.440
Because as you're shown
here, normally you've

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.560
got the susceptible and the
resistant guys mixed together.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.140
In this case, the yellow
bugs are susceptible,

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.904
the blue bugs are resistant.

00:49:30.904 --> 00:49:32.320
Normally what
happens is you bring

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.080
in the antibiotic, sure
enough, the susceptible ones,

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.034
by definition the yellow
ones, get wiped out;

00:49:37.034 --> 00:49:37.950
the blue ones survive.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:40.360
And now you've got a drug
resistant population.

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.180
Selection inversion,
this magic sauce,

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.930
is somehow going to suppress
the blue resistant guys

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.599
to let the yellow
ones take over,

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:49.390
and then you kill them
with the antibiotic.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.620
So how do you do that?

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.720
There are a few strategies
that been proposed.

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.320
One is drug cycling.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.330
So if you were
able to find drugs

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:00.730
that work in very different
ways, what you might do

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:04.840
is use drug A until you get a
resistant population to drug A,

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.684
and then much like crop
rotation, you switch to drug B.

00:50:07.684 --> 00:50:09.850
Because those resistant
mechanisms don't necessarily

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.790
talk to each other, you can go
back and forth, back and forth,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.104
and kill off these differently
resistant populations.

00:50:16.104 --> 00:50:17.520
This is only,
unfortunately, going

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.210
to work for a short
period of time

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.430
because, as I showed
you in the soil case,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:24.040
sometimes multiple
resistance genes can transfer

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:25.420
at the same time,
and then you've

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.730
lost this particular ability.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.250
So another strategy
is to recognize

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:34.570
that drugs of different classes
sometimes can combine together

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.380
to be better than the
trivial sum of their parts

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:39.496
through a property
called synergy.

00:50:39.496 --> 00:50:41.620
So what you're seeing here
in this particular panel

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:44.580
is normally you take a
population that if you hit it

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.390
with drug A, it doesn't care.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.950
Individually hit it with
drug B, it doesn't care.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.400
But when you combine
drug A and B together,

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.980
there's something magical
about that combination where

00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:56.830
they potentiate each other,
and they can synergistically,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.810
in combination,
kill those bacteria.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.260
So that strategy two.

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:02.770
And then strategy three,
which I think is actually

00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:04.960
the most elegant, is
this concept called

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.540
collateral sensitivity.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:09.970
So we try to explain
what that term is.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:13.450
Imagine for a second that
as a bacterium becomes

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:16.660
resistant to one class
of drugs, class A,

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:20.080
the mechanism that it
uses to become resistant

00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:21.910
opens up an Achilles heel.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.210
Something about what it's doing
to become resistant to drug A

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.890
opens up a vulnerability
against drug B.

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:29.710
That's the collateral
sensitivity.

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:34.060
Because of resistance one, you
become susceptible to drug two,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.260
if you will.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.770
A St. Louis summer analogy,
for collateral sensitivity,

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.130
is imagine for a second you want
to go out into the St. Louis

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.130
summer and you don't want to
be hit by mosquitoes or bitten

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:50.740
by mosquitoes, and you also
don't want to drop dead

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.730
because of the heat.

00:51:51.730 --> 00:51:53.105
Now, imagine that
what you decide

00:51:53.105 --> 00:51:56.020
to do is to make sure that
you don't want to get bitten

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.480
by those mosquitoes, you
put on a big moon suit

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.850
and you walk out into
the St. Louis summer.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.490
You've certainly protected
yourself against that mosquito,

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.530
but you're going to drop
dead because that moon

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:07.900
suit is going to suffocate
you in terms of the heat.

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.434
That's the kind of weak analogy
for collateral sensitivity.

00:52:11.434 --> 00:52:12.850
So I'm just going
to end by saying

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.700
we were able to implement this
against one of these scourge

00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:18.920
pathogens, methicillin-resistant
staph aureus, or MRSA.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:22.480
So MRSA is a deadly bug.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.510
It kills something like
11,000 Americans when

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:26.760
it gets into the bloodstream.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.830
It's resistant to the important
class of beta-lactams,

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:30.731
these penicillins.

00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:32.980
And so we thought, could we
use some of those features

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.050
that I told you about
before in combination

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.630
to try to knock out MRSA?

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:40.600
And so in this story, Pat
Gonzalez, a graduate student

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.300
in genomics in my lab, was able
to find a combination of three

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.510
beta-lactams, so that same
penicillin category, completely

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.500
FDA approved generic
drugs that on their own

00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:54.480
are completely
useless against MRSA.

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.420
But somehow in combination,
they work together

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.730
to overwhelm MRSA's
defenses and are

00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.500
able to wipe it out through
this process of synergy.

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.840
But perhaps more
importantly, they

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.880
had this process
or this property

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.500
of collateral sensitivity.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.500
That is to say, if MRSA
becomes resistant to any one

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.570
of those drugs, it
now becomes more

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:17.460
susceptible to the other two.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.640
And why is that important?

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.051
Because if you imagine you're
a bacterial population,

00:53:21.051 --> 00:53:23.550
you've got these three drugs
around, you think you're clever

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:25.080
and you become resistant to one.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.580
Now you've got two
other drugs still

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.370
around that are much better at
killing you, which locks them

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:30.324
against resistance.

00:53:30.324 --> 00:53:32.490
And we tried very hard to
make these guys resistant,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.900
and we couldn't.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.420
And that was fortunate.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.900
And then, finally,
in collaboration

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:40.590
with Mayland Chang and Satish
Adusumilli, researchers

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:43.050
at University of
Notre Dame, we tested

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.990
to see whether this really
interesting test tube result

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.300
could actually translate
into an animal model.

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.120
So they happen to have
an animal model of really

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:53.670
severe bloodstream
infections with MRSA,

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.927
and were able to fortunately
show by working with them

00:53:55.927 --> 00:53:57.760
that this completely
cleared that infection,

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.640
this triple antibiotic
combination,

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.200
within 24 hours of treatment.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.320
And so we're pretty jazzed
about this because, again, this

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:07.590
is composed of
three generic drugs,

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.060
and so we have a
lot of information

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:09.990
about how they work.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:12.920
Fortunately, they all co-deliver
in the same way currently.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.110
And so we're hopeful that this
might be one particular quiver

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.590
in the arsenal against
this deadly infection,

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.540
but also sets up
a paradigm of how

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:25.140
we might be able to repurpose
other existing drugs to come up

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:29.260
with at least stopgap measures
against infectious diseases.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.010
So with that, I'll
end by not addressing

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:34.124
this particular
elephant in the room.

00:54:34.124 --> 00:54:35.790
And that is to say,
everything I've said

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.160
is focused kind of on
human use of antibiotics,

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.470
but in this country
still, it's estimated

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:43.350
that something like 80% of
antimicrobials by weight

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.566
are still used in the
rearing of food animals.

00:54:46.566 --> 00:54:48.690
And I would argue, without
getting into that debate

00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:50.730
just right now,
that that's perhaps

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:53.089
not a great use of
this natural resource.

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:55.380
And there are different ways
in which to mitigate that,

00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:57.030
but I just want to say that
this is something I have not

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:58.404
discussed today,
but I think it's

00:54:58.404 --> 00:55:00.750
very germane to this
particular discussion.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.000
With that, I also say that
sometimes I look like this,

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.200
but sometimes I also look
very Missouri with my lab.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.410
And I'd be remiss not to,
again, say that, really,

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:12.624
anything of importance that
I might have said today

00:55:12.624 --> 00:55:14.040
is because of the
wonderful people

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.950
that I have the privilege
of working with.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:17.900
Both the people my
lab; alumni who've

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:19.470
gone on to bigger
and better things;

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.390
people at Wash U and
around the world;

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:24.000
and, obviously, the
funders that are

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.520
generous to support this work.

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.250
And if there's one the PSA
thing that you remember

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.410
when you leave today,
it's this-- please

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.947
don't use antimicrobials
for viral infections.

00:55:33.947 --> 00:55:35.280
I'm happy to take any questions.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:45.380
- Thank you very much.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.480
That was great.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.909
I have a question
about teaching.

00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:50.200
So part of the reason that
we started this Undiscovered

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.140
series was to talk about
how we have to teach science

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.210
and how we have to
acknowledge these kind

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:56.550
of unexpected findings.

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:59.200
So I'm just curious,
in your teaching now,

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.410
genetics is a constantly
evolving, relatively new

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:03.350
subject.

00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:06.070
How do you incorporate this
kind of thinking when you teach

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.640
especially undergraduates?

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.140
- Yeah.

00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:09.310
That's a very good question.

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:12.430
And I think there are already
great measures in place.

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:15.700
And doing this at
Wash U where part

00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:19.120
of our undergraduate curriculum
has a discovery element

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.050
right off the bat.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:22.510
So there's this amazing
thing called phage hunters,

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:25.750
which a lot of universities
around the country

00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:26.620
have committed to.

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.369
And anyone interested,
even if they're not

00:56:28.369 --> 00:56:30.340
declared biology majors,
they have this sort

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.890
of experience based
class where you'll still

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.870
learn the fundamentals
of microbiology,

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:36.760
and bioinformatics,
and sequencing,

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.000
but they'll do it by going out
into the field, for instance;

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.570
harvesting soil; getting their
own phages, the viruses that

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.860
infect bacteria; going
through the isolation process;

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.380
going through the sequencing
process; and the annotation.

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.560
So I think sometimes
the best way

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:57.490
to teach the sort of wonders of
science is to actually perform

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:58.660
the science yourself.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.935
Not everyone has the
opportunity to immediately join

00:57:00.935 --> 00:57:02.050
a research lab.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.020
So I think engaging
students very, very early

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.480
on in discovery based science--

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.730
it's, of course, exceptionally
important to teach them

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:11.500
the value of hypotheses.

00:57:11.500 --> 00:57:14.630
But also to have that
kind of exciting moment

00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:16.960
to say, no matter what you
do in a phage hunters class,

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.419
you're going to
find something new.

00:57:18.419 --> 00:57:19.959
And then once you
have something new,

00:57:19.959 --> 00:57:21.970
you can test a particular
biological question.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:25.250
So that's one aspect that
we find pretty useful.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:29.770
The other is my lab always
hosts a pretty large cadre

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:33.430
of high school students
and undergraduates all

00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:35.067
through the year.

00:57:35.067 --> 00:57:37.150
Sometimes the people in
my lab complain about this

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.700
because we have a dozen students
that come in additionally

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.570
in the summer.

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.580
But I try to convince
people that you're doing

00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:44.000
this for multiple reasons.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.140
There's no other way to maintain
the steady pipeline of students

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.970
interested in science
without allowing them

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:50.800
to do the science themselves.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.180
And also, the only way to learn
to be a mentor is to mentor.

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.400
And so that's why I strongly
encourage every single person

00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.790
in my lab, independent
of what career

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.910
stage they're at, to take on an
undergraduate or a high school

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.262
student to be able to see
what it is like to teach.

00:58:06.262 --> 00:58:08.220
I think those are two
ways in which could work.

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.570
- Thank you again.

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:12.560
That was fantastic.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:16.220
So the general mechanism
of drug resistance

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:22.490
or the way the bacteria
has become the superbug

00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.010
is pretty well understood,
thanks to you and others.

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:30.230
So what is the
practical solution

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:33.770
other than to tell people not
to take antibiotics and sort

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:38.180
of sit out the cold is something
that most people are not

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:41.090
going to, in practice, follow.

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:43.920
So, in general, what
would you suggest?

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:44.420
- Yeah.

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.860
There are a few things.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:49.340
Actually, I would say
that education campaigns

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.420
in countries that have tried
to pretty openly discuss

00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.760
when it is appropriate
to take an antibiotic--

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.215
Canada is an example--

00:58:57.215 --> 00:58:58.090
have been successful.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.231
It's just that the
timelines of turning

00:59:00.231 --> 00:59:02.480
people's opinions around are
not on the order of weeks

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.030
or months.

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:04.520
They could be years.

00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.520
And so I think
reframing antibiotics

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.820
as a natural resource, as
something that's finite

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.490
and as something that really
requires a sort of conservation

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.630
mentality, and then tie
that to the fact that there

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:20.000
is collateral risk when
you sort of willy-nilly

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:20.840
take an antibiotic.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.890
I think a large part of
being able to turn that table

00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:26.873
to sort of preserve
those antibodies for when

00:59:26.873 --> 00:59:28.670
we need them is education.

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.170
When I say education,
I just don't

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.630
mean to the consumers
of the antibiotics,

00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:35.990
but also to empower
physicians, pediatricians,

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.780
for instance, to
say, here's why--

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.544
ultimately, you're
still going to have

00:59:40.544 --> 00:59:42.710
to respond to the really
aggressive parent who says,

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:43.620
I don't really care.

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.060
I want this drug for my kid.

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:45.710
Fine.

00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:48.650
But if you can spend maybe
a few minutes to explain

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.570
to the parent, here's why.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:51.340
Here's a brochure.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:53.090
Here's something that
you should consider.

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.040
Here's the risk that
your kid, five years down

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.320
the line because of this
unwarranted antibiotic,

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.470
has a greater chance of
something bad happening.

01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:04.100
I think that is a large
part of change in practice,

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:06.110
I think, for turning
the tide there.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.650
I think the other also is sort
of better reporting structures.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:12.950
So we, in clinical fields
and biomedical fields,

01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:15.320
have to report every
single antibiotic use.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.350
We still have no
legislation in this country,

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:20.120
and it's never been
the case, where

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.850
any agricultural
use of antibiotics

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:25.290
needs to actually be reported
on quantitative scales.

01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:29.000
And I think that's a problem.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.240
- Thank you for your nice talk.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.970
I just wonder if, given
the current technology

01:00:33.970 --> 01:00:39.070
of human manipulation of
genes, especially gene editing,

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:46.300
so convenient and widely used
by humans, I just wonder,

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.810
does this in any way
affect the antibiotic

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:54.940
in a gene's evolution,
the speed of changes?

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:55.720
- Yeah.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.020
So let me just restate your
question so I understand it.

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:01.060
If you're asking whether
the ability to gene

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.655
edit in a human genomic context
has impact here, I don't know.

01:01:05.655 --> 01:01:08.571
- Not only human,
but all the other--

01:01:08.571 --> 01:01:09.070
- Right.

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:10.990
So the same methods
that people have

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:13.150
heard in the media,
these CRISPR systems that

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:16.420
can go out and very precisely
edit various aspects

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.390
of any genome, there
is a lot of promise

01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:22.030
to use methods of that
type to perhaps go

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:25.180
after the resistance genes
themselves in the bacteria.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.830
So one way in
which to counteract

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.840
the emergence of
resistance might

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.270
be directed targeting of
those resistance genes

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.116
and to blow them up.

01:01:32.116 --> 01:01:34.240
And there's been some
really, really promising work

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.370
from a lot of researchers
here in the Boston area

01:01:36.370 --> 01:01:39.396
to show a decent proof of
concept that that can happen.

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:41.770
And the reason that those
might be really elegant methods

01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:45.700
is because the reason resistance
has a really high potential

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.850
of arising is because
you're challenging the life

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.370
of the bacterial population.

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.410
It's a life or death decision,
so there's immense selection

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.300
to be able to become resistant.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.510
In principle, if you were to
destroy the resistance gene,

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.780
then you might be able to
get nonresistant versions

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.100
of those bugs to survive,
and the selection pressure

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.300
might not be as high.

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.350
So, yes, absolutely.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.270
I think those gene
editing methods

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.280
might be very useful as part
of the arsenal in the future

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.100
to help mitigate this problem.

01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:15.960
- Hi.

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.918
Thank you for the talk.

01:02:16.918 --> 01:02:17.995
It was very interesting.

01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:21.250
I have a bit of a technical
question about the strategy

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:25.210
that you use for discovering
potential new antibiotic

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:29.110
resistance mechanisms by
transferring them into E. coli.

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:32.290
Some genes will definitely
be and have been discovered

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.540
in this way, but
there definitely

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.982
could be genes that even
if you put them in E. coli,

01:02:36.982 --> 01:02:39.190
they're not compatible with
the machinery of E. coli,

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.481
they wouldn't actually protect
it from the antibiotics,

01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:43.550
but they would some
other bacteria.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.236
Do you have any
way of estimating

01:02:45.236 --> 01:02:47.110
the proportion of how
much you're missing out

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:48.590
versus how much you're finding?

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:48.730
- Yeah.

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:49.938
That's an excellent question.

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:52.510
And so even to expand
on that, E. coli

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:56.320
is in this group of organisms
called gram-negative bacteria,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.930
and there are a whole class
of really important pathogens

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:00.370
that are gram-positives.

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:03.250
And the reason this detail
matters is those drugs

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.260
don't work against the
gram-negatives at all.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:08.080
So E. coli is intrinsically
resistant to those antibiotics.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.012
We would never discover
any resistance genes

01:03:10.012 --> 01:03:11.470
against those
important antibiotics

01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:13.480
like vancomycin and linezolid.

01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:15.550
So one way of which to
address that problem

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.770
is take exactly the
scheme I showed you

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:21.880
and swap out E. coli for
another host bacterium that

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.770
has the properties
you care about,

01:03:23.770 --> 01:03:25.579
and do the same type of screen.

01:03:25.579 --> 01:03:27.370
But then the direct
answer to your question

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.010
of the estimate of how
much we might be missing

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.780
is, again, we think
that as biased

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.139
towards particular bacteria.

01:03:33.139 --> 01:03:34.930
So the way we've
estimated that in the past

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:36.980
is we've done that
same experiment,

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.990
but with a DNA
material that goes

01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:44.980
in from defined bacteria of
particular types, for which we

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.270
already know what the
resistance genes might be,

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:49.330
and then see which
ones come through.

01:03:49.330 --> 01:03:51.937
And, again, what we see is that
there are two layers of bias.

01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:53.770
One layer of bias,
obviously, is against any

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.690
of the gram-positive bugs.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:57.730
Those mechanisms just
don't come through.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:01.610
And then we also have a little
bit of bias towards, again,

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:04.940
that kind of GC-content
and codon bias

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.300
that could have things
that appear to be

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.590
more distant from E. coli.

01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:10.720
But the good news
with E. coli, and I

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.880
think we got kind of
dumb lucky with this

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.890
in terms of it being
this model organism,

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:16.500
it is pretty promiscuous.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:19.090
So its transcriptional and
translational machinery,

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:21.640
the ability of DNA into
RNA, RNA into protein,

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.570
is sufficiently promiscuous that
a lot more genes come through

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:28.180
than if you were to, say,
use just by arbitrary nature

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.160
some other microbe.

01:04:31.930 --> 01:04:33.129
- Thank you for your talk.

01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:34.920
Could you explain more
about the difference

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:39.970
between drug cycling and the
collateral susceptibility?

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:43.240
Because it seemed like,
from what I understood,

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.000
the collateral susceptibility--

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.900
one drug resistance open
susceptibility to another,

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:52.421
so wouldn't you just
be cycling drug B or C?

01:04:52.421 --> 01:04:52.920
- Yeah.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.700
Great question.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:57.960
I should have said that none of
those are mutually exclusive.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.240
So, in fact, people
have suggested

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.430
that when you do
drugs cycling, you

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:05.910
should use collaterally
sensitive drugs.

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:09.510
It's just that you could also
then use collateral sensitivity

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:10.450
in combination.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:13.440
So you can combine any one
of those different methods

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.570
to be able to come up
with novel ways in which

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.740
to repurpose drugs.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.380
So drug cycling is just
a very general concept

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:22.230
of using multiple drugs one
after the other like crop

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:23.057
rotations.

01:05:23.057 --> 01:05:25.140
Whether use collaterally
sensitive version or not,

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:26.195
it might still work.

01:05:26.195 --> 01:05:27.570
If you happen to
use collaterally

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:30.720
sensitive versions, it might
work a little bit better.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.880
But you could also use
collateral sensitivity

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.330
without any cycling, basically,
by using it in combinations.

01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:41.000
That's really the clarification.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.500
- Thank you.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.860
It was a great talk.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:46.760
I had a question, however,
about the inhibitors

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.490
of the mechanism that
inactivate the tetracyclines.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:53.920
Because, by analogy, with the
beta lacatamase inhibitors,

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:57.860
all you do is you select for
mutations in the resistance

01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.640
gene.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.510
So presumably, that
will also happen.

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:01.010
- Yeah.

01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:02.010
That's a great question.

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:05.030
And probably the most honest
answer to your question

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.590
is, eventually, the bacteria
will win with any single drug,

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.190
right?

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:12.600
They are just evolutionarily
smarter than we are.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.101
So how do we try to extend the
lifetime of a new compound?

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:18.350
One thing we've done, and I
didn't show the data here,

01:06:18.350 --> 01:06:20.870
is we focus on our
structural approach.

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:23.660
So we're solving the structures
of all of those enzymes

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.210
with both substrates
and inhibitors bound,

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:29.840
and trying to rationalize why
the inhibitors are working.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.430
And by rationalizing
that, then we

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:34.910
can use more sophisticated
structural methods to say, hey,

01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:37.400
maybe we can lock these
particular positions

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.520
in these inhibitors through
synthetic design, such

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.252
that it's less easy for those
particular enzymes to mutate.

01:06:44.252 --> 01:06:45.710
So, in a way, and
this is something

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:48.740
that's a great part
of biology, anytime

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.939
you think you've found something
good, you try to break it.

01:06:51.939 --> 01:06:53.480
And once you break
it, you understand

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.450
what the risk of the later
on medication might be.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:57.620
So we're doing two things.

01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:59.750
We're adaptably
evolving those enzymes

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:01.959
to be even better not because
we want to release them

01:07:01.959 --> 01:07:03.458
into the environment,
but because we

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:04.980
want to know what
the risk might be,

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:08.390
trying in an amino-acid-specific
way in the structure

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.970
to understand how
mutable they might be,

01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:12.860
and then designing
our inhibitors

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:15.650
through chemical synthesis
to allow that not to happen.

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.110
Again, that's never going
to be the end of the story,

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:21.890
but it'll give us a longer
therapeutic window, we think.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:22.720
- Thanks very much.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.600
I'm just rather sad that my
era as a working scientist

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.610
happened before all of
these modern techniques

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.820
were available.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:31.776
But anyway, it's great
that you're using them.

01:07:31.776 --> 01:07:32.276
- Thank you.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.720
- OK.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.650
Thank you so much
for the presentation.

01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.330
I really appreciate it.

01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:45.000
My concern during
the oral presentation

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.200
was that the antibiotics,
while fighting diseases,

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.260
they actually fight
even our bodies.

01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:55.770
And we cannot even go
back to the evolution.

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.510
We're just moving forward.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.910
And my concerns are two, though.

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:03.180
The first concern is
that with evolution--

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.390
I mean for bacteria
and all the diseases,

01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:08.340
evolution is the
same for a human.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:11.190
I mean, not practically or
specifically, but I mean,

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:13.210
it exists.

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.410
And when antibiotics
go to our body,

01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:20.040
they fight our body as well
as they fight the bacteria.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.990
And I'm concerned that--

01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:26.176
do you believe that we should
[INAUDIBLE] antibiotics,

01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:28.800
or we should try a way
to find a [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.850
that something more biotic
into our body that instead

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:35.520
of fighting our body,
support our body

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:39.090
and together with the
body to fight the disease?

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:42.420
- I think that's
a fantastic point.

01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:45.810
We've been kind of stuck
in this warfare mentality

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:48.899
with microbes because
that worked back when

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:50.520
the antibiotics were found.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.020
And they worked
really well, we're

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.670
happy that they
worked when they did,

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:55.800
but they're going to
have collateral impacts.

01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.770
Now, it's true that there
are some toxicities involved

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:01.460
with antibiotics, but
for the most part,

01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:03.210
the doses that we use
a lot of antibiotics

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:04.470
are relatively safe.

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:05.970
But we still have
this issue that we

01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:08.005
are taking these
chemicals that are going

01:09:08.005 --> 01:09:09.630
to have all of these
collateral impacts

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.670
at least on the
other good bacteria.

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:13.990
So the neat part of
microbiome science,

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:17.189
all of this focus on microbial
ecosystems and communities,

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:20.819
is beginning to let us learn
from that in terms of saying,

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:23.279
how is it that microbes
naturally interact?

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.779
They interact in communities.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:25.979
They work with each other.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:28.859
Sometimes benignly,
sometimes in conflict,

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.520
but it's still at
a community level.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.520
So can we learn from
those principles

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.819
to come up with new therapeutics
of the future that are not

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:37.899
purely these offense molecules?

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:40.620
And there's amazing work being
done right now in basic science

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:44.090
and also in industry to
do things like design--

01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:46.790
either design a probiotic,
specific microbes

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.069
that can be engineered to
deliver particular products

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:53.550
or to modulate other
microbes, and also

01:09:53.550 --> 01:09:57.720
other types of chemicals that
are not offense molecules,

01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.850
but they might allow
one particular microbe

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:02.560
to grow a little bit better
than another type of microbe

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.800
so that potentiators
or maybe good bugs,

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.090
they can crowd out bad bugs.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.420
So I think you're
absolutely right.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:10.710
The therapeutics of the
future will not simply

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:13.650
be offense molecules
of the types we've had.

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:15.720
They will include
them to some degree

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:18.420
because no matter what I say
about collateral damage and all

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.220
of that stuff, if
you're infected

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:22.349
with the plague
bacterium, you shouldn't

01:10:22.349 --> 01:10:24.390
worry about wringing your
hands about whether you

01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:26.990
should take antibiotics or not.

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.130
Your [INAUDIBLE] is
not going to respond

01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:32.820
to some touchy-feely
FMT for instance, right?

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.860
You're going to have
to kill that bug.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.530
But for the future, for
other types of infections

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:40.980
that require a little
bit more moderation,

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:43.930
I think there are
incredible new avenues.

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.040
And I think, for instance, one
of the really cool features

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.420
of the microbiome
that I'm really

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.240
attracted to as a
future therapeutic is

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.360
its direct interface with
the human immune system.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.840
So we can modulate microbes
even at a community perspective,

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.070
be able to very carefully
tickle the immune system,

01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.450
to then trigger it at
the appropriate time

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.110
to be neither underreactive
nor overreactive,

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:07.890
and go after specific pathogens.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.605
May be an incredible therapeutic
avenue for the future.

01:11:10.605 --> 01:11:12.520
And I didn't have time
to talk about this,

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.520
but we have a big arm in
our lab of our engineers

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.970
who are working on
probiotic engineering,

01:11:17.970 --> 01:11:21.540
both bacterial probiotics as
well as fungal probiotics,

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.970
to do exactly the type of
things I just talked about--

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.680
deliver enzymes
that are specific

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.590
for metabolic disorders,
but also to, for instance,

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:31.770
display very specific
tags on their outside,

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:35.010
on their surfaces,
specific to bad bugs

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.810
to be able to take them
out of the ecosystem.

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:40.620
- Now, my only
concern was that we

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:43.401
were so focused on
destroying the problem

01:11:43.401 --> 01:11:45.150
and we were not talking
much about safety,

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:46.350
and that was my concern.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:47.420
So thank you so much.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:51.720
- Hi.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:56.490
Regarding what you said
about the use of antibiotics

01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:59.130
in agriculture,
obviously, that's

01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.930
in large part due to
the fact that it just

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:04.230
makes process of animal
husbandry much easier and more

01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:05.620
efficient.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:08.310
However, there is a
lot of evidence showing

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:11.580
that there is a lot of
deleterious effects emerging

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:15.450
because we are using
antibiotics for that,

01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:19.240
and it's hurting our ability
to fight disease in humans.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.800
So do you see any
potential ways that we

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.050
could reduce the
use of antibiotics

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.636
in a way that makes
sense economically

01:12:26.636 --> 01:12:29.010
for these companies, or do
you think legislation is going

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:30.720
to be the major mechanism?

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.150
- No, I think that's a
brilliant question also

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.960
because the agricultural
industry in the US

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.020
is an exceptionally important
part of our economy.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.790
And I think just
wantonly banning

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:44.500
the use antimicrobials
is not going to work.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:46.510
In fact, we've seen
experiments in this ilk

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:48.240
in Europe, for
instance, where we'll

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.009
ban the so-called nontherapeutic
use of antibiotics.

01:12:51.009 --> 01:12:53.550
You know, wash your hands of it
and think everything is good.

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.280
And then what'll
happen is the industry

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.600
is incentivized to change
the concentrations of what's

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.070
called a therapeutic use.

01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.170
Then the drug use goes back up.

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:03.570
So I think working
with the industry

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:05.640
and coming up with
solutions to mitigate

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.380
and come up with
alternatives, actually,

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.480
I think the best
alternatives right now

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.030
are back to microbiome science.

01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:14.250
Why are these
antimicrobials working

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.830
to make these animals
that much better in terms

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:18.180
of their productivity?

01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.250
It probably has something
to do, eventually,

01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:23.700
with something on the host or
something on the microbiome.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.550
So there's some really
exciting work already going on,

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:30.990
certainly, in academia, but
also in a few small biotech

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:33.780
companies, where they're trying
to understand whether you can

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:37.620
deliver probiotics or particular
features in terms of, again,

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.260
compounds that are not
antimicrobial, but might give

01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:43.410
boost to particular microbes
that allow the animal to be

01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:45.030
a little bit more productive.

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.820
And now you've given
your young farmers

01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:50.220
an option that
allows them to still

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.810
have meat that costs less,
and so it's more productive,

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:56.850
but then saves the
antimicrobials for us.

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:00.600
So I'm not saying that's a
panacea in terms of a solution,

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.550
but it is one way
in which we can

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:04.665
use all of this incredible
work that's going on

01:14:04.665 --> 01:14:07.650
in microbial ecosystems,
understand the mechanism of why

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:09.480
the antibiotics work
