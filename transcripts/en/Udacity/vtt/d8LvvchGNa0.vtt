Hi, I'm Luke Wroblewski.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.380
I'm a product director at Google, and
the experience I have that's probably

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.160
most relevant here is I wrote a book
called Web Form Design, and in

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.960
there I looked at all the little details
and nuances that make forms work online.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.360
I think what you just said about
thinking purposefully about

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.150
forms is the key.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.120
All right, don't treat these things
as one offs that you have to do.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.390
Don't just copy a pattern out there and
assume that it works.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.130
Actually take the time to think
what are you asking people,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.390
how are you asking them that?

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.790
And if you put in a little bit of
effort, you'll have a lot of impact and

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.440
that's kind of the whole
essence of form design.
