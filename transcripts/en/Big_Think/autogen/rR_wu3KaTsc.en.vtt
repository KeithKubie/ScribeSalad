it will then intercept an asteroid and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
it will then intercept an asteroid and
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.770
it will then intercept an asteroid and
bring it back to orbit around the moon

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
bring it back to orbit around the moon
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.349
bring it back to orbit around the moon
then it could be mined as it orbits

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359
then it could be mined as it orbits
 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.479
then it could be mined as it orbits
around the moon or as its brought back

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489
around the moon or as its brought back
 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.509
around the moon or as its brought back
to the planet Earth and so this is now
