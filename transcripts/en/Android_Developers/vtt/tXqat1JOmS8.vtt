00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.390
PRAFULLA RAWAL: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.310
I'm Prafulla, and I'm a Product
Manager on Google Play Instant

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.800
Team.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.840
It is so good to
see you all here.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.190
And thank you for making it to
the last session of the day.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.160
Last year, here at I/O, we
announced Android Instant Apps,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.990
and we made them available
to all app developers.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.400
Today, I'm very
happy to announce

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.330
that we are extending the same
platform to all game developers

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.620
as well.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.280
We call it Google Play
Instant, where apps, and now

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.860
game developers
as well, can build

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.250
Instant native experiences
for their users.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.570
In this session today, we are
going to talk about two things.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.200
One, how app developers
across different app verticals

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.610
are finding success with
Google Play Instant.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.630
And two, how easy it is
to get started if you

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.850
want to build an Instant App.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.670
Tomorrow, there is
a similar session

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.400
focused on game
developers, which I highly

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.980
encourage you to attend.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.170
So let's talk about apps.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.760
Our users-- they
love native apps,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.420
be it watching video,
favorite TV shows,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.310
or having a smooth checkout
experience while shopping

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.350
or buying flight tickets.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.000
It is not a surprise
then that users

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.270
spent 87% of their mobile time
in apps, compared to only 13%

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.830
in apps.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.050
One would imagine
then that if users

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.150
are spending so
much time in apps,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.070
then they must be
finding and installing

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.480
lots of cool new apps.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.980
Well, it's quite the opposite.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.960
The same report shows that
more than half of the users

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.270
install no apps in
any given month.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.700
Why?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.510
Well, app discovery is hard.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.790
As app developers, you
all can relate to the fact

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.700
that getting users
to find your app

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.790
is filled with huge challenge.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.440
And after that, for
users, installation

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.690
is another challenge.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.970
To understand these
challenges better,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.330
we ran several user
studies, and we

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.270
found that the process
of installation

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.650
is filled with friction,
questions, and concerns.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.890
Let me share with you
some of the actual quotes

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.770
from our users.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.330
"Apps-- they take up
space on my phone,

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.900
and my phone runs slower,"
said one of our users.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.430
"If I'm just ordering
pizza, I don't

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.570
want to have to download
an app," said another.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.020
Many of them say
that installation--

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.390
it feels like more steps
between me and the information

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.100
that I want.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.440
And at Google Play
Instant, we totally

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.140
relate to these
concerns and have

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.641
been working hard to remove
these steps between users

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.140
and apps.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.820
Before we deep dive into
details and look at how,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.188
let's see Instant App in action.

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:50.681
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.950
Yes, that's the magic
of Google Play Instant,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.030
and you can experience it from
almost any Android device that

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.490
is running Lollipop or above.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.905
In fact, thanks to
our OEM partners,

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:18.790
such as Samsung,
Sony, LG, and others,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:23.410
we have now enabled more
than one billion devices

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.170
to run Instant Apps.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.480
And with all these
devices enabled,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.930
we have expanded the
discovery of your app

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.670
to well beyond Play Store.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.320
So let's look at some of
the examples in more detail.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.570
Search-- one of the most
powerful discovery surface.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.600
In this example, our
early partner realtor

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.990
has enabled majority
of their URLs

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.320
to launch an Instant
App so that when

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.220
user taps on any
of the search URL,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.970
they land right into this
fluid, immersive experience.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.280
Ads-- another great
discovery surface.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.370
When user sees an ad of this
interesting game such as Clash

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.640
Royale, they don't need
to worry about installing

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.740
the game first.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.840
With one tap, they can start
playing this immersive,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.910
feature-rich came right
from wherever they are.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.700
But discovery of
your app does not

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.430
need to be limited to
traditional surfaces

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.430
like search or web.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.730
In this case, the third example,
one of our media partner,

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.480
Vicki, who's in the
crowd today, noticed

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.690
that a lot of the users we're
finding the content that they

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.020
offer in Play Movies app.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.810
But once users find
the content, they

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.910
hit the same install friction.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.350
It was a no-brainer
for them to start

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.520
replacing the install
wiki button with watch

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.350
on wiki button.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.870
So that in one tap, users can
start watching the content

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.860
that they were after.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.240
So we saw how
Instant app improves

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.700
the discovery of
your app and make

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.750
your native app available
to more and more users.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.090
But sitting in the crowd,
you might be thinking,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.860
all that is fine.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.660
But how is this going to
help me drive installation

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.760
that I really want?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.970
Well, that is where
Instant App really shines.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.520
Let me show you how.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.240
Let's say your
friend recommends you

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.570
a cool shopping app, Hollar.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.070
You find the app
in the Play Store,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.100
and it does really
look interesting.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.630
But wait a minute--

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.380
this is also the moment where
the commitment anxiety kicks

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:00.880
in.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.660
We've all been there.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.320
We ask ourselves questions
like, do I really

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.600
need to install this right now?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.100
Is this going to give me all
the stuff that I'm after?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.690
Why can't I do window
shopping, as I do in real life?

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.740
Well, and a lot of users try
to do that window shopping

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.270
by installing and
then uninstalling.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.100
They don't need to
do that anymore.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.210
Once you publish your
app as an Instant App,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.100
we immediately and automatically
enable the Try Now button

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.750
in the Play Store.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.520
For e-commerce apps, this is
indeed like window shopping.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.390
For games app,
this is a great way

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.010
to play a game before
you decide to install it.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.530
And our users-- they love
this non-commitment option.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.050
As an outcome, some
of our partners

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.740
are seeing instillation
uplift up to 19%.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:08.890
While exact uplift
depends on many factors,

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.960
one thing is very clear--

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.840
Try Now removes
commitment anxiety

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.560
and engages users, who
were hesitant to install

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.020
your app in the first place.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.560
So if you want to start
simple with Instant Apps,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.270
and if instillation uplift is
how you define your success,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.190
then journey is straightforward.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.800
We will show later
in the session

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.360
that with few lines of
configuration changes,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.890
you can enable the Try Now
experience for your app

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:43.390
as well.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.330
But once you have
an Instant App,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.510
it does not need to be
limited to the Try Now

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.820
button in the Play Store.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.490
The same Instant
App can be launched

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.000
from a banner on your website.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.520
And as we talk
about banner, first,

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.070
let me ask you a quick question.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.530
A quick show of
hands if you have

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.770
come across a banner
that asked you

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.130
to install an app on a website.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.220
Well, that's quite a lot
of you, and they are indeed

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.230
very common.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.590
But the Install button
on these banners--

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:31.120
it triggers the same
commitment anxiety.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.100
Can our users experience
the app, just like Try Now,

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.220
before they decide to install?

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.690
No points for guessing that
because, of course, they can.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.910
The Instant App
can change the web

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.990
to app banners to web
to Instant App Banners.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:54.640
The Install button can now
be replaced by open button.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:00.700
And in one tab, user can land
into this immersive experience,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:05.320
delivered by the Instant
App that you've built.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.610
And as you see on the
last image on the right,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:13.420
they still have
option to install.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.880
But there are no added benefits.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.020
One, users have already
experienced your app,

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.090
so they are more informed.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.630
And two, you, as a
developer, control

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.960
the look, feel, positioning,
timing of this installation.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.750
And you can really
integrate this well

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.260
with your user journey.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.550
Some partners have reported
that the installs that they

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:46.030
get from instant App are more
valuable to their business

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.527
than the install that
they get organically.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.910
So we saw how
Instant App expands

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.640
the discovery of your app to
new services, like Search, ads,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.910
and more.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.040
We also saw that how
Try Now and web banners

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.040
can get you started
super quickly

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.970
and give you installation
uplift that you want.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.710
But beyond discovery
and installation,

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.370
we are always working
with all of you

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.650
to unlock critical user
journeys for your app.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.330
One such feature
we are launching

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.560
is notifications in beta.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.870
For many user
journeys, notifications

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.970
are a key extension of
your app functionality--

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.570
when your cab arrives, when
your food gets delivered,

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.860
or when your package ships.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.740
I'm very happy to announce that
with this notification beta

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.570
and program, we can start
unlocking those core use

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.410
journeys.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.860
And you can sign up for this
beta program using the URL

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.860
displayed on the screen
g.co/instantapps/notification.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.980
We would love to learn and
implement some good use

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.932
cases for notifications.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.010
So in summary, we
strongly believe

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.570
that once your Android
app is Instant,

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:23.160
the potential and
possibilities are unlimited.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.150
Let me leave you with a video
of one such possibility, where

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.710
one of our partners, Tapcart,
is building an augmented reality

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.280
shopping experience right
from the search results.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.170
After the video,
my colleague, Raj,

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.690
will come on the stage
and share with you

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.260
many success stories that we
are seeing with our Instant App

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.980
partners.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.282
Thank you.

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:48.754
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:29.460
RAJ AJRAWAT: Awesome.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.600
Thank you, Prafulla.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.830
Thank you, everyone,
for being here today.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.460
My name is Raj Ajrawat, and
I'm a Product Specialist

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.444
for the Android platform
here at Google Play.

00:14:38.444 --> 00:14:40.860
Today, I'm going to walk you
through a lot of the business

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.350
impact that we're seeing with
developers that are launching

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.500
Instant Apps, and hopefully,
inspire you guys to also build

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.490
an Instant App as well.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.340
It's been incredibly exciting
to see all the different types

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.040
of Instant Apps that have been
launching since we announced

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.020
Instant Apps last year.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:01.160
Across all the different
categories in the store,

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.220
though, we've actually
seen some really

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.470
interesting and
immersive experiences

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.630
coming from a few
particular categories,

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:13.310
including travel and local,
e-commerce, games, and media,

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.410
including things like
video, audio, and news.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.910
Now, the common
thread amongst a lot

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.760
of these different verticals
is that all of these partners

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.700
are delivering extremely
rich, immersive, and native

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.035
experiences to their users.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.569
For example, if I'm searching
for a weekend getaway,

00:15:31.569 --> 00:15:33.610
and I want to be able to
take a look at the house

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.910
that I want to book or watch a
video or take a virtual tour,

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.130
it's really great to do
that in a native experience

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.880
quickly and then
be able to book.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.040
Or perhaps I'm actually
trying to buy something,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.040
and I want to take a look
and see if it actually

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.160
fits me as well, like you
saw with that Tapcard video.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.900
Or if a friend shares
with me a link so

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.750
that he can play with me and
see which player is actually

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.910
the best player for
a particular game,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.490
I don't want to have to wait
to go to the store and install.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.690
I can start playing in
that particular moment.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.000
And of course, if a friend
shares a link to a video,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.030
and we want to be able to
laugh about a particular thing,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.490
I can do that quickly, without
having to wait for a page

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.130
to load or an app to install.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.290
Across all these
experiences, we want

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.050
to empower users to have
a frictionless checkout,

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.880
a frictionless log in, and
a frictionless experience.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.840
Now, I'm really happy to
see the business uplift

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.090
that we're starting to see
from all of our partners,

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.430
and we can generally
categorize that uplift

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:39.690
across three different areas
including installs, conversion,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:40.500
and engagement.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.680
Let's dive a little bit more
into the installs number.

00:16:49.539 --> 00:16:51.080
So what's been really
striking for us

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.180
since we launched
Google Play Instant is

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.160
the fact that many
partners are actually

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160
seeing a huge boost to
their organic installs

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.320
by launching an Instant App.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.640
One of our partners, NOS.nl,
a Dutch news company,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.450
actually saw a 30%
boost in installs

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:10.790
by launching their Instant App.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:14.660
Another partner of ours,
realtor.com, a real estate

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.150
company based here
in the US, actually

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.384
saw a 13% boost in
installs from Instant Apps.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.319
Let that sink in for a second.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.050
Instant Apps is
now a major source

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.170
of installs for your business.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.260
Simply put, if you're not
deploying an Instant App

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.290
right now, you're actually
losing out on installs,

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.820
and it's affecting your overall
user acquisition strategy.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.770
We really can't stress
this point enough,

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.510
and we want to make sure
you understand that there's

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.550
going to be ways where
you can drive more users

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:51.350
to come to your app as a
result of Google Play Instant.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.260
Now, thinking about
conversions, we actually

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.030
saw from one of
our partners, Wego,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.150
that they saw a 27%
increase in conversions

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.570
from their Instant App.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.950
Wego is a flight search
engine based out of Asia.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.560
And as you saw from
earlier, Haller,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.450
one of our e-commerce
partners, actually

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.020
saw a 20% increase in
conversions overall.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.820
Now that they are
both seeing success,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.680
we're actually
advising both partners

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.715
in ways in which they can drive
more traffic to their Instant

00:18:21.715 --> 00:18:24.260
App, so they can continue
to capture that increase

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.260
in their conversions.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.530
When we spoke to one of
our media partners, Viki,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.600
a popular Asian TV
drama app, they actually

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.860
saw monetizable watch
time increase almost 5X

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.360
from 9 minutes to
almost 47 minutes.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.550
That's a huge increase
in the amount of time

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.466
that they're getting
from users, where they're

00:18:46.466 --> 00:18:48.840
able to capture them and make
them extremely loyal users

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:49.890
overall.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.870
And what they're
also reporting to us

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.360
is that the users that are
downloading and installing

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.730
from their Instant
App are actually

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.940
much more impactful and
much more loyal users.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.440
They subscribe more.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.030
They watch more.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.710
And they register more often.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.090
I want to take a moment
here and deep dive

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.875
into one of our partner's
success stories.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.310
As you know, Vimeo was one of
our first Instant App partners

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.020
to launch.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.036
They're a video platform
for creators to post videos.

00:19:24.036 --> 00:19:25.660
When they first
launched, they actually

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.180
saw engagement go
through the roof.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.150
They saw over 130%
increase in engagement,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.040
compared to other channels.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.037
That means they were capturing
some serious power users

00:19:36.037 --> 00:19:37.120
through their Instant App.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.730
When we also worked with
them to get their Instant

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.740
App out the door, they found
that they only had about 50%

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.650
of their URLs enabled for
search, which meant that there

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.420
was an opportunity
to actually drive

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.500
more users from those URLs
that are indexed already

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.150
to their Instant App.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.280
And today, they're
actually at about 80%

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.780
of their URL coverage in 2018.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.770
What is the result
of all those efforts?

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.730
They're now actually seeing
almost 15% of their installs

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.560
coming from their Instant App.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.420
And again, our goal
is to try and see

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.262
how we can continue to
drive even more traffic

00:20:14.262 --> 00:20:16.595
so that they can continue to
capture all of these users.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.870
No matter how you cut the data
across all these verticals

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.390
and across all
these experiences,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.780
you're simply just seeing more
installs, more conversions,

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.880
and more engagement.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.769
I'd like to now hand over the
stage to my colleague, Ignacio,

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:36.310
who's going to walk you through
all the ways in which you can

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.518
actually implement these
features to get your Instant

00:20:38.518 --> 00:20:39.100
App launched.

00:20:46.169 --> 00:20:47.460
IGNACIO BLANCO: Thank you, Raj.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.460
Hello, everyone.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.940
My name is Ignacio
Blanco, and I'm

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.610
an Engineer Lead on the
Google Play Instant Team.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:55.560
You heard from Raj and Prafulla.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.100
Developers are finding
success with Instant Apps.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.630
What I'm going to
show you now is

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.360
how simple it is to implement
some of these features,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.050
as well as how easy it
is to enable this success

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.040
for your Instant Apps.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.110
I will cover three
stages of development.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:16.840
First, how you
reduce your app size

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.140
so your app can be Instant.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.890
Second, enable traffic-- how you
can make your app be directly

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.780
launched by your users.

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.210
And third, measuring success--

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.510
how your happy users can drive
up the metrics you care about.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.960
Let's talk about
reducing your app size.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.750
In order for an app to be
Instant, it has to be small.

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:44.070
But we heard from you developers
that reducing app size

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.660
is really, really hard.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.740
However, there are today
100-megabyte installable apps

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.324
that have an Instant App.

00:21:52.324 --> 00:21:55.900
I'm going to walk you
through three techniques you

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.180
can use to reduce your app size,
configuration APKs, the Google

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.020
Play Core library, and
the 10-Megabyte Program.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.100
With configuration
APKs, you just

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.990
need to make a few
config changes on Gradle,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.600
and you can save significant
amounts of size on your APK.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.580
The way configuration
APKs work is

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.660
by partitioning your native code
and resources across locales,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.480
ABIs, and densities.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.847
Additionally, we are opening
up today the Google Play Core

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:29.554
Library.

00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:30.970
With the Google
Play Core Library,

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:35.390
you can download on-demand
features at runtime.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.800
What this allows you to do is
to build a small entry point

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.250
experience and then download
up to 10 extra megabytes

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.620
on the background.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.210
Now, these two
techniques should be

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.560
sufficient for the
majority of developers.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.730
However, we are also
opening up today

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.090
a 10-megabyte program in beta.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.740
What this allows you to do
is to build Instant Apps that

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.320
have a 10-megabyte entry point.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:07.040
So if you're interested, please
go to g.co/instantapps/10MB.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.430
What this will give you is try
now immediately, as well as

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.795
deep linking from your website.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:17.310
Now, if you were following
the keynote yesterday

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.750
and the presentations,
you may be

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.700
wondering if this is related
to the Android App Bundle.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.960
And you're right--
the Android Bundle

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.140
allows you to
build smaller apps,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.820
open similar from
other organization,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.010
and helps you download
features on demand.

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.900
So no matter where
you're coming from--

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.420
whether it's by adopting
the Android Bundle

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.150
or building your first Instant
App, we got you covered.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.530
Tools and documentation
will be available shortly

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.780
to guide you through the path.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.040
So I just showed you how you
can reduce your app size.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.700
Notice that talk about
how you can enable traffic

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.508
to go directly to
your Instant App.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.390
I'm going to show you
two simple things on how

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.960
you can get traffic to be sent
directly to your Instant App.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.870
First is how you can
enable the Try Now.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.280
Second, I'm going
to show you how

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.065
you can get these
web to app banners

00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:08.190
that Prafulla talked about.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.040
So when we launched
Try Now last October,

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.380
developers have
been enabling these

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.410
by simply adding to
your Android manifest

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:23.520
a metadata tag with a URL that
points back to the Instant App.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.370
You have your main
launcher and a meta tag.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:29.950
This provides you Try Now that
you have been seeing so far.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.395
Now, to make it even
simpler and also

00:24:32.395 --> 00:24:35.970
to support partners that don't
have web presence like games,

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.220
we went one step
forward, and we totally

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.280
removed the need
for URLs, as well as

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.015
for asset link verification.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.470
So this is your manifest
now without Try Now.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.800
What you have to do is simple--

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.090
nothing.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.720
So starting today,
we removed the need

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.540
to have your URLs in
your manifest at all.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.570
You can publish an Instant
App without any URLs.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.310
If you do this,
you immediately get

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:07.395
Try Now, as well as
the web to app banners.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.353
So earlier in the talk,
Prafulla showed you these web

00:25:15.353 --> 00:25:18.230
to app banners and asked if you
have seen them, and you said,

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:19.200
yes.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.880
What he didn't show you was how
easy it is to implement them.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.090
Get ready-- done.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.090
Just append launch equals true
to the deep link on the Play

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.870
Store.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.030
And if you have an
Instant App, those banners

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.320
will now take the user
to the new journey,

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.740
where from the Open button,
they just launch directly

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.738
on the Instant App.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:44.180
So far, we covered
reducing your app size

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.660
and enabling two simple
traffic sources, which

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.310
are really powerful.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:49.930
The next step is
how you can measure

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:55.420
the performance and the
success of your Instant App.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.940
I'm going to walk you through
two tools that we have,

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.130
and we have extended to
support Instant Apps--

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:06.890
the Google Play Console and
the Google Search Console.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.350
One of the questions that
developers usually ask us

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.470
is how many installs is
my Instant App driving.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.740
Well, we have Build This
on the Google Play Console,

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.660
and you can access this today.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:21.140
Simply go to Statistics,
configure your report,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.180
select the Instant App
metrics you care about,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.710
such as launch and
conversion events.

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.340
And finally, if you care
about which referrer

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.320
is sending traffic
to your Instant App,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.450
select referral platform.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.940
The results-- really good.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:39.530
My app on number one is
getting 150,000 sessions just

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:42.010
between April and May.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.910
Or number two, you
see that the ad

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:49.040
campaign that we set up on April
10 is also doing pretty well.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.770
More launches are driving
more installs just

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.990
from Instant Apps.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.840
Now, if you want to see which
specific traffic sourced,

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.580
from the ones that
Prafulla talked about,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.430
such as Search, Browsers, or
Try Now is helping us here.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:08.070
What you see is Try
Now is effectively

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.720
giving me 80% of my installs
just from my Instant App.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.527
Now, what I just
showed you should help

00:27:15.527 --> 00:27:17.610
you understand the performance
of your Instant App

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.070
from the Google
Play Consoles side.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.260
If you are integrated
with Google Search,

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.570
we have also worked
with the Search Team

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:27.180
to give you these kind of stats.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.180
What you see here is
the overall performance

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.760
of your search integration
with your Instant App.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.050
You can see clicks,
impressions, and average CTR.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:39.580
You may also be wondering,
which specific queries

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:41.820
or which specific URLs
are driving traffic

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.190
to you Instant App.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.020
We build that, too.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.520
Down in the bottom,
you can switch

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.310
between queries and pages,
and that will give you

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:54.120
the fine detail of
impressions, clicks, and CTR

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.600
for both queries and URLs.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.670
This should help you
further understand

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.190
your search integration.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.220
So to summarize what
we covered today

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.400
is how you can reduce your app
size by using configuration

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.980
APKs, how you can download
on-demand features using

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.690
the Google Play Code Library.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.800
And finally, we talk about
the 10-Megabyte Program.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.636
We then talked about enabling
traffic for your Instant App

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:23.980
through Try Now, as
well as from deep links.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.650
And finally, I show you
how you can understand

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:29.560
the success of your app from
both the Google Play Console,

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.101
as well as the Google
Search Console.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.740
I want to thank you all
of you for being here.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.550
Please visit us at the
Sandbox Tent C tomorrow.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:44.045
Enjoy the rest of I/O and
have fun at the concert.

00:28:44.045 --> 00:28:48.265
