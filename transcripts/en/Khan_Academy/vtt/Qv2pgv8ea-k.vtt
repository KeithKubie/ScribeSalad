00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:02.449
- [Voiceover] Adjust
the leading coefficient

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:03.970
and vertex coordinates to make

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.442
the blue parabola match
the orange parabola.

00:00:06.442 --> 00:00:08.655
Now we've already seen how we can go

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:11.535
about shifting these parabolas.

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.096
If we subtract something from y,

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:17.176
it actually shifts the
parabola up by that amount

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:18.756
and we've already talked about that

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:21.956
in the video on shifting
and scaling parabolas.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.336
But let's actually see it in practice

00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.836
cause this is actually going
to allow us to experiment.

00:00:25.836 --> 00:00:28.077
We'll see if we increase this,

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:30.757
that's actually shifting it down.

00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:32.511
While if we decrease it, it shifts it up.

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.900
But we actually do have to shift it down

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.258
for this example.

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.369
Now at least the y-value of our vertexes,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.419
vertices look the same.

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:43.996
Similarly, when we shift the,

00:00:43.996 --> 00:00:47.037
whatever we are squaring,
whenever we, if we shift,

00:00:47.037 --> 00:00:50.570
if we subtract a value here,
it shifts it to the right,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.091
while if we add a value here
it shifts it to the left.

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.031
Let's verify that.

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:55.871
If we subtract a value here,

00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:57.911
it shifts it to the right

00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:01.058
and if we add values here
it shifts it to the left.

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:02.358
Just like that,

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:05.579
it looks like I've been able
get our vertices to coincide.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.339
This vertex right over here is

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:12.295
at the point x=-4, y=-3.

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:13.765
It's no coincidence.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.267
x=-4 makes this zero

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.344
and y=-3 makes this zero.

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:22.565
But these parabolas still don't match up.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:26.217
This yellow parabola
seems to increase faster.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:28.987
The scaling factor right over here seems

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:30.788
too low for our blue one.

00:01:30.788 --> 00:01:32.257
Let's increase it.

00:01:32.257 --> 00:01:33.078
There we go.

00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:36.598
If we put a two there,
it's growing fast enough.

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:39.039
If we put three there
it's growing too fast.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.166
If we put a zero there,

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.319
it's a flat line and
then it becomes negative.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.860
Let's bring that back

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.146
to just +2.

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.301
And we are done.
