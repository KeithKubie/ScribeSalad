00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:05.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.210
EMILY FORTUNA: And
I'm Emily Fortuna.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.640
Our next guest is a real
pioneer, an engineer,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.728
physician, and NASA
astronaut, Dr. Mae C. Jemison.

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.020
What an honor to have you here.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.520
MAE C. JEMISON:
Thank you very much.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.443
It's exciting to be
here today, as well.

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:17.610
It's a beautiful, sunny day.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, it is.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.507
EMILY FORTUNA:
Definitely, very bright.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.590
You've had an extremely
impressive career spanning

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.280
so many different fields.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.610
What do you see as
through-lines throughout all

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.630
these different fields?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.630
MAE C. JEMISON: So when
I think about the things

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.220
that I've done from having
been a chemical engineer

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.190
and a medical doctor,
and then an astronaut.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.770
And then as soon
as I left NASA, I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.570
started an international science
camp called The Earth We Share,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.710
was environmental studies
professor, 100 Year Starship.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.340
Throughout them is the
idea that we're connected.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.360
And how do we use our
technological prowess,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.630
our resources, to help
better the world writ large?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.840
And I know that sounds
kind of Pollyannish,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.430
but my revelation,
as I've grown up,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.520
as I've looked around the world,
as I've lived different places,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.200
it's that this planet
has incredible resources.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.660
But they're finite--
the resources include

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.100
people and their talents that
exist everywhere in the world.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.170
It includes our plant
life, our animal life,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.792
not just the things you can
dig up out of the ground.

00:01:20.792 --> 00:01:22.500
And we have to protect
those, and we also

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.290
have to understand
that we share them.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.420
And if I go a
little bit further,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.990
it's like pushing the
envelope, not being satisfied

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.600
with this is complacent.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.500
I always have to
challenge myself.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.470
And perhaps, I push
and grab on things

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.950
that are really
different or difficult.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.250
But for me, the energy
comes with trying something

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.890
that I don't know that I can
absolutely accomplish it--

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.660
that it's going to require
something new for me, that it's

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.205
going require me to grow.

00:01:56.205 --> 00:01:57.195
EMILY FORTUNA: Awesome.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:01:59.112
TIMOTHY JORDAN: During
your presentation here,

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:03.285
you spoke about your 100
Year Starship initiative.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.160
And to introduce
it, and I love this,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.759
you spoke about how
Mars is too close.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.230
Why is that, and why should
we set our sights further out?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.070
MAE C. JEMISON: So I'm going to
be perfectly honest with you.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.160
When I was growing up, I
assumed that by the time

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.820
I became an astronaut--

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.820
actually, I didn't even
want to be an astronaut.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.590
I just assumed
I'd go into space,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.440
but that I'd be
going to Mars or one

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.600
of the moons around Jupiter,
Saturn, or something.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.190
That's what I thought, because
we had all these things that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.040
were happening.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.180
In fact, we had probes on
Mars when I was a little kid.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.480
So of course, we'll be
doing something more.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.210
The reason I talk
about 100 Year Starship

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.510
from the perspective
of it's more audacious

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.310
than Mars is because Mars
doesn't push us hard enough.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.130
We've been on Mars
multiple times.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.660
We've got Mars' address, right?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.870
We can figure out the
technological timeline

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.500
to do Mars, the technologies
that are needed.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.000
The reason we
haven't gone to Mars

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.040
is not so much an
engineering challenge.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.750
It's a public commitment.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.240
But what's going
to really push us

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.040
is thinking about
interstellar, which

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.840
also captures our imagination.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.000
That doesn't mean
that we don't do Mars.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.080
It means let's do something
that's big and audacious,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.060
and keep that in our eyesight.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.750
So 100 Year Starship
was seed funded by DARPA

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.120
to make sure we have
the capabilities

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.160
for human interstellar flight.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
But the real underlying
current there is innovation.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.270
How do we get the radical
leaps in knowledge,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.260
in technologies,
in human systems

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.220
that would allow us to go
to another star system?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.730
Now, that's the real
piece, because each one

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.340
of those challenges that we
meet can be applied to life here

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.270
on earth, right today.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.250
You can't go to
another star system

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.900
with humans using the
kind of energy systems

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.733
we have today for
space exploration.

00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:03.150
You know, the chemical rockets,
and propulsion, and stuff.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.420
We're going to have to generate
tremendous amounts of energy

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.590
through either a fission,
where you break an atom apart,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.740
fusion, like what powers
a sun, our anti-matter.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.730
We do fission now, but
it's not well contained.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.470
We don't know how to
control it, store it.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.290
Imagine if we could just
learn how to store this,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.797
what tremendous value it would
have for life here, on Earth.

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:29.880
When you think about going
to another star system,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.390
you have to be autonomous.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.430
So you have to carry
your food with you.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.910
It's a hard journey.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.410
But if you get to
going fast enough,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.160
so it's reasonable
within human lifetimes,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.250
you're going to have to
carry everything with you.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.950
You're going to
have to learn how

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.000
to grow your food,
your medical systems.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.280
And right now, when
we're on earth,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.840
we rely on this wonderful
biodiversity of the soil--

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.810
the microbiome in the soil
and all of those things--

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.340
to grow food.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.495
We need to understand that.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.120
We need to know how
to keep it healthy.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.020
We need to take that with us.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.630
And so there are
all these pieces--

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.850
financial
infrastructures-- we have

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.040
to change to be able to do
something that's long term.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.150
And if you stop and
think about that,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.060
those are all things we need
to survive on this planet.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.740
EMILY FORTUNA: Space
exploration seems

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.430
inevitable with the requisite,
what you call, Team Earthlings.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.718
But at the same time, it seems
like we could be moving faster.

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:25.260
What do you think
is holding us back?

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.360
MAE C. JEMISON: I think
it's public commitment.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.390
It's really that we
haven't included people,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.770
and so folks don't see how
space technology impacts

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.860
their day to day lives,
even though it does.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.170
I live in Houston, Texas.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.460
We track hurricanes, and
that's what we know about.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.330
We knew about the
hole in the ozone

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.640
from space information and data.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.250
So it's constantly a
pervasive in our lives,

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.130
but we haven't told
the story very well.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.588
And when I say we,
that's, I guess,

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:58.800
a royal we about space folks.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.910
And you tell the story better
by having people involved.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.998
What was riveting
people when Mars landed?

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:05.790
That they could-- you
know the Mars Lander?

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.850
Remember, everybody was
looking and cheering.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.142
It's because they could see it.

00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:10.890
They could be a part of it.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.320
And I think that's the piece.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.940
And I think that's a piece with
all science and technology--

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.918
when it's accessible, and
when people understand

00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:19.710
that it's part of their
lives, and it's not

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.840
this mysterious thing.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840
EMILY FORTUNA: And they're
energized and excited

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.355
towards working
towards that goal.

00:06:24.355 --> 00:06:25.230
MAE C. JEMISON: Yeah.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.140
And I think one of the
things that space offers us

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.350
and also other
technology innovations

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.230
offer us is that we get
to do bigger things.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.420
And I think people like
an adrenaline rush.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.660
But wouldn't we like to do good
things with adrenaline rush?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.700
Right now, we manufacture
adrenaline rushes in ways

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.370
that are not necessarily so--

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Productive?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.096
MAE C. JEMISON:
Productive, there you go.

00:06:51.096 --> 00:06:52.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Sure.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.700
How does this
relate to your theme

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.390
of Look Up and the Skyfie
apps that you produced?

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.270
MAE C. JEMISON: So Look Up
came from 100 Year Starship,

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.610
and we wanted to connect
people with space.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.860
And we also wanted to deal with
the issue of human behavior.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.980
How do we get the
best out of us?

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.070
And we thought, let's ask
people to go out and look up.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.380
Like when was the last
time you looked up?

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.630
Remember as a kid,
looking up at the clouds--

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.390
and it just made you feel good.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.190
And then I remember,
as a child, thinking

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.110
that there are other children
on the other side of the planet

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.460
who are looking up as well.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.080
And what do they see?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.580
I know they see the same moon.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.550
In some instances, they see
slightly different stars.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.070
But we're all-- it was just
one of those connecting things.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.310
And so we started
to work on, how

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.530
do we create a campaign where
one day, around the world,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.370
we'd all look up?

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.110
So of course, we had to
make an app for that,

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.990
and that's where the
Skyfie app came in.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:55.680
So sky selfie, and the idea
is to take an image, a video,

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.690
a text, or whatever--
when you look up,

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.310
what does it make you feel?

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.640
Post it, and we would
put it on a globe

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.050
that you can twirl around.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.220
And you can see what
everyone else is doing.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.420
And it's time tagged, data
tagged to where you are.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.720
And you get to see what
other people are looking at.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.100
What we came up with is that
we want to do different events.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.580
So we started on
October 18, one day.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.250
I'm proud to say we trended
number five on Google,

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.950
which is great.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.720
But in one day, we're able
to garner lots of enthusiasm

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.039
and support around the world.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.423
Of course, it took a lot of
work to build up to that.

00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:36.090
And now, we're
continuing to work on it,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.445
and we're going to do one also
around the 50th anniversary

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:40.320
of the lunar landing.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.370
So I'd like everybody
to-- can I do this?

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.790
The Skyfie app is
completely free.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.320
No in-app purchases.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.420
I know that's like,
what is wrong with her?

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.260
No, it's because we want
people to connect and use it.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.360
And it's available on Google.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.540
It's available on iOS systems.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.760
And the idea is to
really just connect us.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.750
And I think, as we
were talking before,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.900
just the act of looking
up from your phone

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.820
changes your perspective.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.700
You get bigger.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.950
You look out.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.960
Just the act of looking up
from your desk or your work,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.370
or sometimes, I'm
walking down the street,

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.290
I'm looking at the ground.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.850
Looking up, it frees us.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.140
It gives us energy.

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.248
EMILY FORTUNA: So I
have one more question.

00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:25.040
This is on behalf--

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.390
MAE C. JEMISON:
Wait, wait, wait.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.225
You're going to blame Timothy?

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:34.221
EMILY FORTUNA: Timothy asked
me to ask this question.

00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.996
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Between the two of us,

00:09:35.996 --> 00:09:38.447
the bigger "Star Trek"
nerd is probably me.

00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:39.530
MAE C. JEMISON: OK, shoot.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.770
EMILY FORTUNA: So I know
that Nichelle Nichols

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.330
is a huge inspiration to you.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:50.840
And I personally believe
that representation in media

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.310
is super important.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.000
And I want to ask how
you got your guest

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.400
appearance on "Star Trek?"

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.470
MAE C. JEMISON: So
let me just start off

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.670
by saying when I was growing
up, I loved "Star Trek."

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.790
I was in Los Angeles before I
was accepted into the astronaut

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.730
program.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.300
And I used to get
my hair cut in LA.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.470
And the person who cut my
hair was Stefon Dominguez,

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.200
who was a hair dresser
in all these movies

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.110
and things like that.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.010
And he knew LeVar Burton.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.740
And Stefon and I were
talking one day, and he said,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.868
Mae, you should
be on "Star Trek?"

00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:28.660
And I said, really?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.140
He said, oh, I'll
mention it to LeVar.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.182
So he mentioned it LeVar.

00:10:31.182 --> 00:10:32.640
I got a call one night.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.830
I was at home.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.970
And it's like, hey, Mae.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.110
This is LeVar Burton.

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.040
Would you be interested
in being on "Star Trek."

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040
That's what Stefon said.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.153
And I was like, yeah, sure.

00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:44.570
This is when the
glasses come off.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.467
Yeah, sure.

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:49.550
And they wrote a part for
me as Lieutenant Palmer.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.290
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.998
MAE C. JEMISON: And
that's what happened.

00:10:51.998 --> 00:10:56.420
Basically, it was an
episode LeVar was directing,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.790
and it was really, very neat.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.260
And I was able to go around.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.740
And so I've been one of the
"Star Trek" buddies since then,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.300
and was even able
to help them when

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.380
they premiered the
"Star Trek Discovery"

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.612
last year, in New York.

00:11:10.612 --> 00:11:11.945
EMILY FORTUNA: That's wonderful.

00:11:11.945 --> 00:11:12.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.090
EMILY FORTUNA: So cool.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Before
we go, is there anything

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.000
else you'd like to
tell our viewers?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.050
MAE C. JEMISON: Well, all this
discussion we're having now

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.770
is really around science, and
technology, and some of those

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.710
issues.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.760
And it's really important
that we understand

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.890
that we research science
and problems based

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:37.380
on the people who are there--
their ambitions, their dreams,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.730
their goals, their fears.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.280
And so it's really
important that we

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.730
have as many people as
possible doing that work.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:47.960
We design technology and tools
based on the people we are.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.930
It's important that we have
lots of people involved.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:56.030
And we fail to develop and
use so much of the talent

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:57.180
in this country.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.660
So I spend a lot of my time
around science literacy.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.930
And I think it's
vitally important

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.630
that every child
have an opportunity

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.630
for an excellent education,
that every child is

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:09.650
science literate.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.330
As adults, that we
don't sort of say, oh,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:13.850
I don't know about that.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.290
That's not cute.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.250
We need to make sure
that we're fully engaged,

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.370
and that's my task to
be inclusive and bring

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.647
lots of people along.

00:12:23.647 --> 00:12:24.730
EMILY FORTUNA: Here, here.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.476
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:26.851
EMILY FORTUNA:
Dr. Jemison, thank

00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:29.000
you so much for joining
us on this show, today.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.560
MAE C. JEMISON:
You're very welcome.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.700
Thank you.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:32.600
I get to shake hands.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.500
I always shake hands.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.583
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:37.750
