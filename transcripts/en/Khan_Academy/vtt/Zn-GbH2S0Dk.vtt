00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to my presentation on level

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.115
three linear, yeah, level three linear
equations.

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:08.280
[LAUGH] Okay.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.510
So let me, let's, let's make up a problem.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.709
Let's say I had X plus 2x plus 3 is

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:25.170
equal to, minus 7x minus 5.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.530
Well, in all of these linear equations,
the first things that

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.600
we, the first thing that we try to do is,
get all

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.480
of our variables on one side of the
equation, and then get

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.620
all of our concept terms on the other side
of the equation.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.950
And then it actually will become a level
one linear equation.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.050
So, the first thing we can do is we can
try to simplify each of the sides.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.240
Well we, on this, on this left side we
have this X plus 2x.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.610
Well, what is X plus 2x?

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.870
Well that's like saying I have one apple
and now I have two apples.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.090
So here I have one X and now I have two
more Xs that I'm adding together.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.650
So that's equal 3x, 3x plus 3 is equal to
minus 7x minus 5.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.310
Now let's bring the 7x over onto the
left-hand side.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.840
And we could do that by adding 7x to both
sides, 7x.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.733
This is a review.

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.882
We, we're adding the opposite.

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:21.290
So, it's negative 7x, so we add 7x so
that's why.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.620
And we do that, become the right side,
these two will cancel.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.390
And the left side, we get 10x plus

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.390
3 equals, and on the right side, all we
have left is the negative 5.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.040
Almost there, now we're at a level, what
is this, a level two problem.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.940
And now we just have to take this 3 and
move it to the other side.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.590
And we can do that by subtracting 3 from
both sides.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.150
That's a 3 minus 3.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.390
The left-hand side, the 3s cancel out,
that's

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.550
why we subtract it in the first place.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.010
And you have 10x equals and then minus 5
minus 3, well that equals minus 8.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.970
Now, we just multiply both sides of this
equation by 1 over 10, or

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.480
the reciprocal of 10, which is the
coefficient on x, times 1 over 10.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.860
You could also, some people would say,
well, we're just

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.020
dividing both side by 10 which is
essential what we're doing.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.226
If you divide by 10, that's the same thing
as multiplying by 1 over 10.

00:02:22.226 --> 00:02:25.580
Well, anyway, the left-hand side, 1 over
10 times 10.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.930
Well, that equals 1, so we're just left
with x equals negative 8 over 10.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.830
And that can be reduced further.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.440
They both share the common factor 2.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.360
So you divide by 2.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.760
So it's minus 4 over 5.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.620
I think that's right, assuming that I
didn't make any careless mistakes.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.288
Let's do another problem.

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:54.321
Let's say I had 5,

00:02:54.321 --> 00:03:01.133
that's a 5x minus 3 minus

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:06.474
7x equals x plus 8.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.778
And in general if you wanna work this out
before I give you

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.340
how I do it that now's a good time to
actually pause the video.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.028
And you could, you could try to work it
out and then,

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:19.548
play it again and, and see what I have to
say about it.

00:03:19.548 --> 00:03:22.284
But assuming you wanna hear it, let me go
and do it.

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:23.450
So let's do the same thing.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.390
We, first of all, we can merge these two
Xs on the left-hand side.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.710
Remember, you can't add the 5 and the 3
because the 3

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.160
is just a constant term while the 5 is 5
times x.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.720
But the 5 times x and the negative 7 times
actually can merge.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.570
So 5, you just add the coefficient.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.160
So, it's 5 and negative 7.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.110
So, that becomes negative 2x minus 3 is
equal to x plus 8.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.760
Now, if we wanna take this x that's on the
right-hand side

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.810
and put it over the left-hand side, we can
just subtract x from

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.002
both sides.

00:04:01.002 --> 00:04:04.030
The left-hand side becomes minus 3x minus
3 is equal

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.550
to, these two Xs cancel out, is equal to
8.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.050
Now, we can just add 3 to both sides to

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.810
get rid of that constant term 3 on left
hand-side.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.649
These two 3's will cancel out.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.300
And you get minus 3x is equal to 11.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:29.510
Now, you just multiply both sides by
negative one-third.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.670
And once again, this is just the same

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.750
thing as dividing both sides by negative
3.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.320
And you get x equals negative 11 over 3.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.870
Actually

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.670
let's, let's, just for fun, let's check
this just to see.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.354
And the cool thing about algebra is if you
have enough

00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:50.296
time, you can always make sure you got the
right answer.

00:04:50.296 --> 00:04:52.450
So we have 5x, so we have 5 times negative
11 over 3.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.380
So that's, I'm just, I'm just gonna take

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.660
this and substitute it back into the
original equation.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.410
And you might wanna try that out, too.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.190
So you have minus 55 over 3, that's just 5

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.860
times negative 11 over 3, that's a 3,
minus 3.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.625
And what's 3?

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:17.920
Three could also be written as, minus 9
over 3.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.428
I'm skipping some steps, but I think

00:05:23.428 --> 00:05:28.440
you, you know your fractions pretty good
by this point.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.730
So that's minus 9 over 3.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.420
And then, minus 7x is the same thing, as
plus 77 over 3.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.090
Because we have the minus 7 times minus
11, so it's plus 77.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.240
And, and the equation is saying that
should equal minus 11 over

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.650
3, that's what x is, plus an 8 is nothing
more than 24 over 3.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.340
Let's add this up.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.570
Minus 55 minus 9, that's minus 64, if I'm
right, yeah, that's minus 64.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:08.780
And then, plus 77 minus 64 plus 77 is 13.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.084
So the left-hand side becomes 13 over 3.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.540
And on the right-hand side minus 11 plus
24,

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.840
well that's 13 and we still have over 3.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.836
So looks like we got the right solution.

00:06:20.836 --> 00:06:23.610
It checks out.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.180
So the correct answer was minus 11 over 3.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.220
Hopefully you're ready by now to, do some
level three problems.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.230
The only thing that makes this a little
bit

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.620
more complicated than level two is you
just have to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.030
remember to merge the variables in the
beginning, and, know

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.840
that you could subtract variables or
constants from both sides.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.070
Have fun.
