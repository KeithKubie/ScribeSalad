00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
India is going to become a superpower in the

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.129
next 20 years.
Because the reason is the younger generation

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.680
now which is getting
educated before -- 40 years, before that literacy

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.000
was [INAUDIBLE].
Now that literacy is going to be 75 percent

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.710
in the next three or five
years.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.550
And with the literacy and education coming
in and economic condition

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.469
going up, and all the ability of the government
policies that are in

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.410
place, that is the relaxation in many of the
areas like [INAUDIBLE] and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.090
trade policy and foreign trade policy.
And then youngster people coming in with the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.360
mobile things, like they
have Internet, like they've mobile phones,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.110
like all these things.
So all old impediments are over.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.739
So we can find that India moving to a economic
condition as [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.449
homes are coming down, and all the ability
of the world is coming up

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.640
with India, and we are definitely possible
that in India will

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.580
definitely become a superpower in the time.
