00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.738
- [Instructor] Times in our
dealings with powers series.

00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:04.416
We might wanna take the derivative,

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.209
or we might want to integrate them.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.183
And in general, we can
do this term by term.

00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:10.468
What do I mean by that?

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.180
Well, that means that the derivative of f,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.203
f prime of x, is just
gonna be the derivative

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:17.778
of each of these terms.

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:21.615
So that's gonna be the sum
from n equals one to infinity.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.000
And let's see, the
derivative of x to the n

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.683
is n times x to the n minus one.

00:00:26.683 --> 00:00:29.785
So I could write this as n
times x to the n minus one

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.128
all of that over n.

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:34.093
And these ns will cancel out,

00:00:34.093 --> 00:00:36.427
so this is just going to be,

00:00:36.427 --> 00:00:40.081
this is just going to
be x to the n minus one.

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.230
So this is taking the
derivative with respect to x.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170
Similarly, we could integrate,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.045
we could integrate and we could evaluate,

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:52.962
we could evaluate the
integral of f of x dx,

00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:57.785
and this is going to be
equal to some constant plus,

00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.618
if we integrate this term by term.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.580
And so this is going
to be equal to the sum

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.949
from n equals one to infinity.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:07.660
And let's see, we increment the exponent,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.833
so x to the n plus one,
and then we divide by that.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:15.165
So times n plus one times
this n right over here.

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.425
So this is a common
technique that you will see

00:01:18.425 --> 00:01:20.179
when dealing with power series.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.296
And we're gonna go a little
bit more into the details,

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:25.038
because you can only do this for x values

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:29.122
within the interval of
convergence for the power series.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.958
And as we will see, the
interval of convergence

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:36.148
for these different series
is slightly different.

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:37.872
The intervals are very similar,

00:01:37.872 --> 00:01:40.866
but what happens at the
endpoint is different.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.192
So I encourage you, pause this video,

00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:45.886
and see if you can figure out
the interval of convergence

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:48.066
for each of these series.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.614
This is the integral
of our original series,

00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:53.750
and this is the derivative
of our original series.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.732
So let's start with our original series.

00:01:55.732 --> 00:01:58.734
Let's figure out the
interval of convergence.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.378
So we could do that using the ratio test.

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:04.573
So the ratio test, we
would want to do the limit,

00:02:04.573 --> 00:02:08.740
the limit as n approaches
infinity of a sub n plus one,

00:02:10.295 --> 00:02:14.761
so that's gonna be x to the
n plus one over n plus one,

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.248
divided by a sub n, so
that's x to the n over n.

00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:21.217
So we want to take the
absolute value of that.

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:25.384
That's gonna be the limit
as n approaches infinity.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.147
Let's see, this is, if
you divide this and this

00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:31.922
by x to the n, that's gonna be a one,

00:02:31.922 --> 00:02:34.487
and this is just going to be an x,

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.650
and then this n is going to end up top.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.150
So this is going to be xn over n plus one.

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:46.527
And this is equal to the limit
as n approaches infinity of,

00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:49.374
let's see, if we divide the
numerator and denominators here

00:02:49.374 --> 00:02:50.374
by one over,

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.492
if we divide by both the numerator
and the denominator by n,

00:02:54.492 --> 00:02:58.325
we're gonna get x over
one plus one over n.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.745
And what is this going to be?

00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:04.008
Well, this term's gonna go to zero,

00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:08.035
so this is just gonna be equal
to the absolute value of x.

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:11.553
And the ratio test tells us
that this series is convergent

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:15.138
if this right over here is less than one,

00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:18.075
it's divergent if this
is greater than one,

00:03:18.075 --> 00:03:20.702
and it's inconclusive if this equals one.

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:22.682
So we know, let's write that down.

00:03:22.682 --> 00:03:25.849
We know we are convergent, convergent,

00:03:27.313 --> 00:03:28.480
convergent for

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:34.201
the absolute value of x less
than one when this thing,

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:36.254
when it is less than one.

00:03:36.254 --> 00:03:39.216
We know that we are divergent

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:42.706
when this thing is greater than one,

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:45.096
when the absolute value
of x is greater than one.

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:48.621
But what about when the absolute
value of x is equal to one?

00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:50.163
That's where the ratio test breaks down

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.320
and we have to test that separately.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.148
So let's look at the scenario where

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:56.648
x is equal to one.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.567
When x equals to one,
this series is the sum

00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:06.763
from n equals one to infinity
of one to the n over n.

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:08.796
Well, that's just gonna be one over n.

00:04:08.796 --> 00:04:12.050
This is the harmonic
series or the p-series

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.684
where our p is one.

00:04:13.684 --> 00:04:17.290
And we've seen in multiple
videos that this diverges.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.632
So when x equals one, we diverge.

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:21.888
What about when x equals negative one.

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:25.795
When x equals negative one,
this thing becomes the sum

00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:28.878
from n equals one to infinity

00:04:28.878 --> 00:04:32.161
of negative one to the n over n.

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.883
And this is often known as the
alternating harmonic series.

00:04:35.883 --> 00:04:38.404
And this one by the
alternating series test,

00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:39.766
this one actually converges.

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:42.430
And we've seen that in multiple videos.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.224
So it turns out the
interval of convergence

00:04:45.224 --> 00:04:47.244
for our original thing right over here,

00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:49.350
our interval of convergence,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.350
interval of convergence,

00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:56.425
convergence here,

00:04:56.425 --> 00:04:58.342
is we can, x can be,

00:04:59.886 --> 00:05:02.083
so it could be, x can be

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.949
greater than or equal to negative one,

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.311
or I could say negative one
is less than or equal to x,

00:05:06.311 --> 00:05:09.864
because if x is negative
one, we still converge,

00:05:09.864 --> 00:05:12.844
but then x has to be less than one,

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.796
because right at one we diverge,

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:17.029
so we can't say less than or equal to.

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.676
So this is the interval of convergence

00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:20.066
for our original function.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:22.182
What about the interval of
convergence for this one

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:24.708
right over here when
we take the derivative?

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:27.287
Well, when we take the derivative,

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:31.454
this is, this is the same
thing as x to the zero

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:36.503
plus x to the first,

00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.382
plus x to the second,

00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:41.179
and we go on and on and on.

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:42.381
Now you might recognize this,

00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:46.340
this is a geometric series
with common ratio of x.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.173
Geometric

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:50.130
series,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.147
series, where our common ratio,

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:57.232
often noted by r, is equal to x.

00:05:57.232 --> 00:05:59.556
And we know that a
geometric series converges

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:02.761
only in the situation where the,

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:04.933
where our common ratio,
where the absolute value

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:06.849
of our common ratio,

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.849
so converges, converges,

00:06:10.896 --> 00:06:13.294
only in the situation
where the absolute value

00:06:13.294 --> 00:06:16.212
of our common ratio is less than one.

00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:18.390
So in this situation, when
we took the derivative

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.150
for f prime of x, our
interval of convergence

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.768
is almost the same.

00:06:22.768 --> 00:06:25.685
So here our interval of convergence

00:06:28.623 --> 00:06:32.092
is going to be x has to be between

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:34.161
negative one and one,

00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.112
but it can't be equal to negative one.

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.795
At negative one we would actually diverge,

00:06:38.795 --> 00:06:40.385
and at one we would diverge.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:42.742
So notice, these are almost the same.

00:06:42.742 --> 00:06:46.869
If we view these as
series centered at zero,

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:50.191
the radius of convergence is the same.

00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:54.116
We can go one above, one
below, one above, one below.

00:06:54.116 --> 00:06:55.578
And that's in general truths.

00:06:55.578 --> 00:06:57.061
We take derivatives as integrals.

00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:58.894
But the endpoints of our interval

00:06:58.894 --> 00:07:00.758
of convergence can be different.

00:07:00.758 --> 00:07:02.693
And to continue to see this,

00:07:02.693 --> 00:07:05.808
I encourage you to use the ratio test

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:08.391
to figure out one, what is the,

00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.969
well, use the ratio test plus
using the boundary conditions,

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.126
figure out what the
interval of convergence is

00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:20.477
for the antiderivative,
for the integral here.

00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:21.778
And what you will see is

00:07:21.778 --> 00:07:23.994
the radius of convergence is the same.

00:07:23.994 --> 00:07:26.877
We can go one above
zero and one below zero.

00:07:26.877 --> 00:07:27.969
We have to be in that interval.

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.521
But as you will see, this one converges

00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:34.857
for x equals negative one or x equals one.

00:07:34.857 --> 00:07:36.402
I'll just cut to the chase here.

00:07:36.402 --> 00:07:40.427
So, interval of, let me
write that in yellow.

00:07:40.427 --> 00:07:44.594
The interval of convergence
for this top one converges,

00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:49.934
converges for negative one is less than x,

00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:52.172
is less than or equal to one.

00:07:52.172 --> 00:07:54.628
So notice, they all have the
same radius of convergence,

00:07:54.628 --> 00:07:58.757
but the interval of convergence,
it differs at the endpoint.

00:07:58.757 --> 00:08:01.207
And if you wanna prove
this one for yourself,

00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:03.399
I encourage you to use
a very similar technique

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.266
that we use for our original function.

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.421
Use the ratio test, you're
gonna come to this conclusion

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.565
right over here, and then test the cases

00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:15.346
when x is equal to one and
x is equal to negative one.

00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:17.549
And you will see when x
is equal to negative one,

00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:20.431
you have an alternating p-series,
so that's gonna converge.

00:08:20.431 --> 00:08:23.151
And then when x equals one,
you're gonna have a p-series

00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:26.820
where the denominator has
a degree larger than one,

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.597
or something similar to a p-series.

00:08:28.597 --> 00:08:30.973
And you can establish
that it will also converge

00:08:30.973 --> 00:08:33.056
in that scenario as well.
