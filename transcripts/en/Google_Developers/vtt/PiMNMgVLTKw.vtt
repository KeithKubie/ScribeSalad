CLAIRE FREEMAN: Hi,
my name's Claire.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:09.680
I'm the founder of My
Plus One and Airspruce.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.120
My Plus One is a web platform
that connects travelers

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.160
with the most interesting
locals and places

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.260
to stay in five cities.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.934
And Airspruce is
a new service that

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.100
allows people to have their
Airbnb or other property

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.950
listing written by a
professional travel writer.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.100
I'm going to talk to
you today about PR

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.070
and share some tips with you.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.920
There's some great
new tools out there

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.110
to make reaching the media
really easy and more affordable

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.390
than it was before.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.300
And I'm also going to run
through how to write and create

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.600
a press release and some
tips for doing that.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.910
So building good
relationships with the media

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.490
is really important for
getting your startup heard

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.970
and receiving press coverage
in publications, which

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.660
can help the business
grow so much.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.140
I launched My Plus One a
few years ago in Berlin

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.030
as Plus One Berlin.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.990
And there was a lot of
media attention, which

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.269
was fantastic for helping
the business grow.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.140
It was featured
in over 50 online

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.060
and print publications, such
as "The New York Times," "Conde

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910
Nast Traveler," and "Wallpaper."

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.400
And what really
helped with that is

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.460
having these great
images and a great story.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.100
So I'm going to talk through
how to write and create

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.430
a press release.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.410
I'm going to do this
in five stages just

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.860
to clarify exactly what to do,
and give you some tips on how

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.740
to make it really attractive
for the journalist receiving it.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.970
So the first thing to think
about is really your message.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.640
What makes your startup
different from all

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.530
the other startups?

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.130
You've really got
to think about what

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.500
you want the journalist to
know, what's really key.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.040
And for this, you might want to
write down your elevator pitch.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.430
Because this really
summarizes the strengths

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.280
of your business and what it is.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.890
So the first step when you're
writing a press release

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.021
is to make sure you have
the logo of your startup

00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:01.770
at the top of the page,
and then obviously

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.860
"Press Release"
written beneath that.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.630
The top of the press release is
really the most important area.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.729
Because journalists
are really busy people.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.510
They won't have time to read
through the whole release.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.500
And they'll probably only
read the first paragraph

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.000
and the title.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.340
So you've got to make
these really, really good.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.450
With the title, keep it short.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.100
I think between three
and five words is good.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.630
And then have the date that
you're sending out the press

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.850
release, and also where
your startup is located.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.870
Right, so in this press release,
which I wrote for Airspruce,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.150
you can see at the top of
the press release I included

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.580
the Airspruce logo, and then
beneath that the words "Press

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.630
Release."

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.720
Then, when you go into the
title, I made it really short.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.050
There's only three words.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.580
I think, in summary, Airspruce
makes listings much easier

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.140
to create, to write.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.460
So it's just
"Listings Made Easy."

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.110
And then, because
it was a launch,

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.040
that's really newsworthy
for journalists.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.510
So if you are writing
a press release

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.680
about the launch
of your startup,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.160
make sure that's
really highlighted

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.250
in the title and
the first paragraph.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.100
OK, so in the first
paragraph of a press release,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.140
it's important to have the date
you're sending out the press

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.260
release and the location
of your startup.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.190
In the first paragraph,
just try and summarize

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.510
exactly what your startup
is, or what your message is.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.042
And make sure to include
a link to your website

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.000
so the journalist can
easily just click on that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.320
and go and view your website.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.070
So here I've really written
what Airspruce is in a sentence,

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.120
as that's really the
essence of the startup.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.460
And it also says the date
that it was launched.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.350
And it's got a link to
the Airspruce website.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.950
So with the rest of
the press release,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.005
structure it so the most
important information

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.340
for the journalist
is at the top.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.090
And then it gets kind of more
detailed but less relevant,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.560
I guess, as you go down.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.280
So in the second
paragraph, you might

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.810
want to include
information about the team,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.540
about prices, about how it
works, and things like that.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.910
And then you can
go into more detail

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.220
as you go further down
the press release.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.430
But really try and include
all the key information

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.290
at the beginning.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.610
Then in the third paragraph,
I gave even more detail.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.400
So as you can see, as we're
going through the press

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.360
release, writing it,
it gets more detailed

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.370
probably as it goes on.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.180
And we've got some information
in the third paragraph

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.480
about what is included
for the 50 pounds

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.830
that the person spends.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.050
So what exactly do we offer?

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.045
And this goes on to say
more benefits of who

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:51.841
is the target market
for Airspruce.

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.340
It's great for people who don't
have the time or the writing

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.230
skills to create a listing.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.985
It's also useful for people
that have their listing written

00:04:59.985 --> 00:05:03.070
in another language
and want it translated.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.560
And then I speak a bit about
the team of travel writers.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.650
So we've got a great
team of travel writers.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.150
So I thought it
was good to include

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.450
some information
about who they are.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.750
So the traveler editor, he
used to be at "Wallpaper,"

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.000
and some great
freelance journalists.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.690
And then lastly,
there's just a bit

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.440
of information
about how Airspruce

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.910
can help with
other writing jobs.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.000
So in the second paragraph
of the press release,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.070
I talk more about how Airspruce
works and what's involved.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.430
In the next paragraph, I
talk about what exactly

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.790
people get for their
50 pounds, so what

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.120
the writer will do
to their listing.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.240
In the next paragraph, I
talk about who Airspruce

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.450
is ideal for, so for
people that maybe

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.780
don't have the time
or the writing skills

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.980
to create their own listing.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.720
In the next
paragraph, I talk more

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.290
about the team of
travel writers and what

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.540
their positions are or were.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.910
And in the final
paragraph, I talk

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.580
about how Airspruce can help
in other ways, such as creating

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.510
a house manual for
guests on Airbnb.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.390
At the end of the
press release, make

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.200
sure you have the
word "Ends," and then

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.250
beneath that a Notes
to Editors section.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.750
In this section, just include
your contact information.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.420
So if a journalist
wants more information,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.610
or has questions,
or wants images,

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.680
they can contact
you really easy.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.270
In this section, you could
also include a little summary

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.830
of your startup or
business as well.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.660
After you've created
your press release,

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.915
then you can put together
a list of the journalists

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:38.670
that you want to send
your press release to.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.730
And in this, it's
really important

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.140
to make your list of
journalists very relevant

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.840
for your press release.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.182
So if your startup
is food related,

00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:49.640
you don't want to be sending
your press release to a sports

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.780
journalist.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.310
And it will annoy
journalists if they

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.190
get press releases that
aren't relevant to them.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.470
So there are some tools
for finding journalists,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.740
such as JustReachOut, which is
a new tool that you can use.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.410
With JustReachOut,
you can search

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.820
for journalists that write
about particular subjects.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.050
You could also use Twitter.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.280
So you can search for
publications on Twitter

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.154
and find contacts
that way as well.

00:07:16.154 --> 00:07:17.320
So there are different ways.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.480
And then once you
have your list,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.130
if you're sending out the
press release by email,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.290
then I would recommend
writing individual emails

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.120
to the journalists with just a
short email about the startup,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.840
about what you're
sending, a snappy subject

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.510
line about what your
press release is about.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.100
And then attach the press
release in PDF format

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.165
to the email so they could
easily then open it and print

00:07:44.165 --> 00:07:47.449
it off if they want
to read it later.

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:49.240
It's good news at the
moment, because there

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.960
are a lot of new
tools out there that

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.890
make contacting or reaching out
to journalists a lot cheaper

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.020
than it's traditionally been
when you had to hire a PR

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.850
consultancy and spend a
lot of money doing that.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.430
So some new tools
that I would recommend

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.530
are GoPRit, which is a startup.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.170
And you can send email
pitches to select journalists

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.210
about your startup.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.870
And you can also send tweets
out to those journalists,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.060
which is great.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.610
There's another good
one called JustReachOut,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.080
which helps you find
journalists that

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.240
write about a
particular subject.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.970
And then you can
also contact them.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.440
So this is great when you
create your list of journalists

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.851
that you want to send
your press release to,

00:08:34.851 --> 00:08:36.559
because you can find
ones that are really

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:40.970
relevant for your
startup and your story.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:46.600
Another good one is pr.co, which
can help you create and write

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.450
a press release and send it out.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.450
And that's an overview of
how to write a press release,

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:56.270
and how I wrote a press
release for Airspruce.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.860
And I hope it's
helpful for all of you.
