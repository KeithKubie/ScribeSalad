00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.982
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.390
-(SPEAKING IN ANOTHER LANGUAGE)

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.595
-Welcome back to our
afternoon session.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.470
My name is Alyssa Mt.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.200
Pleasant.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.990
This year I'm a fellow at
the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.820
where I'm finishing
my historic study

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.270
of Haudenosaunee community in
the post-Revolutionary War era.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.760
I'm a historian by
training and a member

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460
of the faculty and
Native American

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.189
and Indigenous Studies at
the University of Buffalo.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.490
It's my honor to introduce our
keynote speaker, Robert Odawi

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.130
Porter.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.840
He is a member of the
Heron clan of the Seneca

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.720
Nation of Indians, who
served as the 67th president

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.820
of the nation.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.110
I first met Rob
a number of years

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.200
ago when I was a graduate
student at Cornell University.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.580
And a quick aside to that,
Cornell-- for those of us

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.910
in the Ivy League, we know that
Cornell is the only university

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.530
that offers a graduate
program in Native American

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.550
and Indigenous Studies.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.320
But moving on.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.820
Back to Rob.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.060
[LAUGHING]

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.900
Rob, at that time
when I met him,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.060
was directing the Center
for Indigenous Law

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.280
Governance and Citizenship
at Syracuse University.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480
His work at Syracuse,
where he founded a research

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.440
based law and policy
institute that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.370
focuses on indigenous nations
and their interactions

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.720
with settler
colonial governments,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.670
is just one facet of his wide
ranging career in Indian law

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.840
that began when he was a student
here at Harvard Law School.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.200
In addition to serving as
a tenured law professor

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.140
and developing research
centers at Syracuse

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.050
and the University of
Kansas School of Law,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.920
he has worked in tribal
courts and legal systems

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.930
serving as Chief Justice for the
Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.160
advising the Prairie Band
Potawatomi Nation of Kansas

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.300
and working as attorney
general of the Seneca

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.229
Nation of Indians.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
He's the author of numerous
law review articles.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.910
He has testified
before the US Congress

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.590
and he has served as an
expert witness in matters

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.580
before US and tribal courts.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.790
Currently he is a senior adviser
at Dentons, the world's largest

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.040
law firm.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.660
Rob Porter brings incredible
depth and breadth of knowledge

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.030
to our conversation today.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.790
This is knowledge developed
through an inspiring legal

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.060
career.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.380
It is also grounded in
Haudenosaunee understandings

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.920
of nation to nation
relationships.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.330
The Seneca Nation is one of six
nations of the Haudenosaunee

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.810
Confederacy who came
together under the guidance

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.930
of an individual known
as the peacemaker.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.470
The peacemakers' leadership and
vision united these nations,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.510
providing a framework
for the people

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.240
to unite in peace,
power, and righteousness.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.560
Some of you may be aware
of this form of governance,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.340
which is often
described in English

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.280
as the great law of peace.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.220
This form of
governance was in place

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.100
when colonists first
arrived in North America.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.090
The protocols that
Haudenosaunee people practiced

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.710
among themselves and with
foreign tribal nations

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.560
also shaped their diplomatic
relationships with colonists.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.540
These protocols later
informed interactions

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.900
with the emerging
United States government

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.730
in the decades following
the Revolutionary War.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.260
They were critical to the
Treaty of Canandaigua,

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.900
which was signed in 1794.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.190
This treaty, which reinforced
the nation to nation

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.370
relationship between the United
States and the Six Nations

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.820
remains in effect to this
day, and every November 11th,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.480
Haudenosaunee
people grab-- gather

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.010
in Canandaigua, New York,
to celebrate and commemorate

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.370
this treaty.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.976
It is incredibly significant
to Haudenosaunee people.

00:04:13.976 --> 00:04:16.640
It is an agreement that
the people struggled

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.180
to negotiate during the
difficult, tumultuous years

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.560
of the early American republic.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.360
And it is an agreement
that Haudenosaunee people

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.890
have labored to protect
and enforce ever since.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.650
When we think of native
peoples and native politics,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.080
the work we undertake
in the present day

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.170
is always linked to much
longer, larger experiences

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.980
and traditions.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.370
In the same way that the
ancestors who negotiated treaty

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.640
agreements with colonial
governments did so with an eye

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.270
to the past, to
contemporary circumstances

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.590
and to emerging generations,
so do the people

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.840
at today's gathering.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.040
And it's very good to
be here with all of you.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.040
This afternoon
Robert Porter will

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.120
speak to some of the ways legal
advocacy and legal education

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.390
helps us all move forward.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.396
Rob Porter.

00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.560
-Now I thank you very much.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.500
I'm very honored to have
a chance to be here today.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.400
It was 30 years ago
that I came here

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.560
for law school, which seems
unbelievably long time ago.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.200
But I want to thank the dean of
Radcliffe Institute and Harvard

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.900
Native Program, because it
is always a great opportunity

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.290
to get back to Cambridge
and to have an opportunity

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.410
to get back into
this world of ideas

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.390
and influence and the future.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:53.051
And to that extent,
I really also want

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.300
to just acknowledge the
native students who were here.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.570
When I've had a chance
to speak at a university

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.760
campus in the past,
I think you've

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.410
done tremendous
things over the years

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.514
even though there's further
to go here at Harvard.

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:06.930
But when I was here 30 years
ago, there wasn't much at all

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.805
and we were eating those
crappy potlucks over

00:06:08.805 --> 00:06:12.700
at the education building,
with all the potato chips

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.450
and stuff that we would bring.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.780
And I really-- I'm
really thankful for that

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.790
because the few native students
of us who were here at the time

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.070
30 years ago really needed
each other and the faculty

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.380
members that we had to help
us were very important.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.530
So I want to speak to
the students a little bit

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.430
today about some of the
things I have to share.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.930
A little story about when
I was running for office

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.170
in 2010 as the candidate for
President of the Seneca Nation.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.890
A couple of our elders
were very, very worried

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.290
and concerned about me.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.650
You're licensed by the state
of New York, our most dreaded

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.760
adversary.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.100
How can we trust you with
the license of the state

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.320
government?

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.460
That's a good question.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.870
I mean you-- I had
to have that license

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.280
to be the nation's
attorney, but that

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.531
didn't seem to be the problem.

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:09.863
And one of them indians said,
"Well, I'll tell you what.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:11.350
I think I'm going
to support you,

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.260
but it's really an experiment
to see what happens."

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.100
So I have been thinking about
that a lot over the years

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.480
and I think what it meant
was that in many ways,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.150
I still think of myself
as an experiment.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.640
I grew up in the Allegheny
territory of our nation

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.520
and I wasn't the only kid
who had a white father,

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.840
it just felt that way
in terms of the issues

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:33.990
that I was dealing with.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.040
And my family was very well
anchored in our community.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.530
My grandfather had been on
the council for 40 years,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.660
was one of our-- just historic
leaders on the council.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.720
My mother was our very
first education director

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.550
of our nation and she had just
terrible battles with people

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.095
in the late '70s, as she was
trying to deal with education.

00:07:53.095 --> 00:07:56.140
And I didn't know anything about
this at the time, being a kid.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.910
But this whole idea being
educated in our nation

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.590
was an unbelievably two edged
sword, and for many people,

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.980
really just a one edged
sword, a bad, bad edge.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.360
Because everything that
the colonists have ever

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.380
done that was really
driven in long term agendas

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.440
came through education, came
through the boarding schools.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.040
And I think that the panelists
that preceded me really

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.520
did a great job at sort of
laying the foundation of really

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.260
the historic.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.230
And I can't cover 500 years
of history in this speech,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.620
nor could the earlier panelists.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.480
But I think that history is
very much a part of who I became

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.539
and who I am today.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:35.580
And so it was a struggle.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.429
It was very much a struggle.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:37.490
And I want to share
that a little bit

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.870
with you because there are
certain episodes that happened

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.400
in my life that really no
one would ever believe,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.680
that my tribe went through
during the early years

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.760
of my work with them.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.310
And then I want
to try to pull out

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.200
a little bit of meaning
in relation to the work

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.610
that I've been
lucky enough to be

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.322
able to do for my nation--
within the Seneca Nation--

00:08:56.322 --> 00:08:57.780
and some of the
work that I've done

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.700
over the years working in the
outside legal and political

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.360
system.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.806
So the very first
journey-- with respect

00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:08.430
to my own personal
life-- really came--

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.150
I had some great
professors at Syracuse

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:11.880
where I went to school.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.440
I had my family.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.280
But, to be the first Attorney
General of the Seneca Nation

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.740
when I was 28 years
old wasn't an accident.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.714
And I had largely forced
myself on my tribal government

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:23.880
saying that, "You know what?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.365
You paid for a good
chunk of my education

00:09:26.365 --> 00:09:28.490
and the whole idea was that
we'd come back and work

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.090
for the tribe."

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:31.940
Well here I am!

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.470
I've been-- I've been at a
law firm for three years.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.010
I don't know everything by
any means, but I want to help.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.060
And boy, it was hard to get a
job working for my own nation.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.444
And it was-- for those of you
who have a close proximity

00:09:46.444 --> 00:09:47.860
to tribal government
politics, you

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.290
know what I'm talking about.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.469
And it was hard.

00:09:50.469 --> 00:09:52.010
And I ended up doing
some things that

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.030
were somewhat unconscious about
trying to get my time in front

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.540
of the council and trying to
find a way to get appointed.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.600
And eventually the council
approved my contract

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.040
to be the attorney general.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.560
I was approved 15
to one, except there

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.740
was no money attached to it.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.220
They said, "Well someday
we'll get some money

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.360
and then we'll hire him."

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.060
And I thought these guys
are so clever, you know.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.520
But I didn't stop.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.160
And I think that's where it
was some combination of being

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.510
stubborn and selfish
and just directed,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.490
that I wanted to
help my tribe and I

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.720
wasn't going to say no to that.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.960
And it really was a
common denominator.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.640
But I tell you,
working for my nation

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.410
when I was that young made
me realize how little I knew

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.530
about my own nation
and our legal history

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.190
and our political
history, but also

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.760
how ill-equipped my American law
school education down the road

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.964
here had prepared me for working
in that legal environment.

00:10:42.964 --> 00:10:44.630
The most significant
thing that happened

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.190
that really changed my life
significantly was in 1992.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.090
Our nation was really
in war against the state

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.830
of New York over the taxation
of cigarettes in our territory.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.750
It's about a treaty right of
free commerce and our treaty

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.890
that Alyssa mentioned
earlier about the free use

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.390
and enjoyment of our
lands, our people take that

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.480
very seriously that we are
not to be interfered with

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.554
and that we negotiated
our treaty at a time

00:11:09.554 --> 00:11:11.345
when we were equals
with the United States.

00:11:11.345 --> 00:11:13.080
And, but for us
and our warriors,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.200
there would be no United States.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.240
That's how we remember that
treating and that history.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.420
It's a deal.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.960
You leave us alone.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.390
We give you peace.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.750
And frankly at the time,
people negotiated that

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.950
and discussed it in 1992.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.250
Well, here's the way
the legal thinking

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.500
goes of the Seneca in conflict.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.740
Our treaty is with
the United States.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.650
It's not what the state
of New York, so we

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.690
can go to war with them.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.970
And it was an unbelievably
tensio-- a contentious time,

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.660
but that's what I started
to really see and learn

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.510
about how power is used
against native people.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:56.110
Men-- really men with guns--
who are surrounding your nation,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.160
trying to kill your economy.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.995
And I was in the middle
of the negotiations.

00:12:00.995 --> 00:12:02.370
I was working with
our officials.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.770
I was dealing with the
governor's offices.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.270
I was dealing with
the state police.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.140
And it was a very
formative experience

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.590
and it lasted in the span of
a week, but ultimately we won.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.600
And the state, the
police, the governor,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:20.700
and their entire apparatus
of attack was withdrawn

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.970
and our people
declared and succeeded

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.570
in gaining a victory over
the state at that moment.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.260
So ever since that time, I have
been experimenting and trying

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.270
to find the way in which
the power of native people

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:37.020
can be galvanized and mobilized
without actually having

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.980
to block the New
York state thruway,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:41.800
without actually
having to engage

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.790
in that kind of
disobedience and resistance

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.000
because we should
have that power.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.880
We do have that
power and that power

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:54.350
is needed on a day to day
basis to help our nations.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.221
There were other more
unfortunate experiences

00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.720
that happened during
that first term

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.290
when I was the Attorney General.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.600
And we had a civil war.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.020
And we had a civil war that by
the sort of scale of humanity

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.030
and this scale of what
goes on in the world

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.630
even today was not vast.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.910
But when Senecas kill each
other, that's a civil war.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.500
And we had a terrible
battle emanating out

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.320
of a-- out of an
election process.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.070
And it was really about
gambling, casinos,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.240
and the struggle for
that, and the degree

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.350
to which our people did not
want that, but-- but some did.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:33.795
And it was a terrible
time to be there

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:36.050
and to see it,
what was happening.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:40.930
It eventually culminated
in some degree of peace

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.020
and my term had left, had ended.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.200
But it was an awful thing.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.970
And when I started teaching
at the University of Kansas

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.990
and my wife and I
were there to start

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:53.510
a new chapter of
our lives, it really

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.529
stimulated a lot of thinking.

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:57.070
And my first article
that I had wrote

00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.294
was about the destructive force
of the American legal system

00:14:00.294 --> 00:14:02.710
and the way in which people
are pitted against each other,

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.010
people in conflict.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.060
Which really only
makes it worse,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.630
but doesn't solve problems or
heal people or bring people

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.940
together.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.560
And I still think
about those things,

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.110
although I don't often have
a chance to work on it.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:15.930
But that really was
a formative moment

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.740
and having an opportunity in
my life-- a very rare moment--

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.630
to be a law professor at
an American university,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.810
to have the time, to have
the ability to teach,

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.240
to have the ability
to think and write.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.210
And that's where I,
too, for the first time,

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:34.320
was exposed to the
x-file, the secret master

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.510
plan for native people.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.011
And I'm 20.

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:38.510
What?

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.540
32 years old, and no one
had ever really told me

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.820
about this secret master plan.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.790
It's actually written about
quite nakedly, you know,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.070
about the plan to
exterminate the Indians.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.159
And it was shocking
in a way that I

00:14:50.159 --> 00:14:51.450
hadn't learned that previously.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.070
But why would the
American government--

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.790
why would the American
legal system-- really

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.300
encourage its own
people, much less

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.190
the natives to
learn about things

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.530
like the Doctrine of Discovery?

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.230
There's much more
to be had to keep

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:06.110
people ignorant of these things
than to explain to them, oh we

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.500
only hold title to
this entire country

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.750
by virtue of this fiction that
the Christian nation somehow

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.370
owned this land because
the savages are not

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.560
considered to be real people.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.460
You know, that's an unbelievably
shocking thing when you're

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.125
a professor, a student
of law, and you're

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:26.000
trying to understand
the logic and the reason

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and the legitimacy of it,
and the entire legal system,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.150
as it relates to native people
is founded upon a fiction.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:34.150
It's absolutely false.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.670
So for the law students in
particular, native students

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.540
in general, and everybody
for sure, don't forget that.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.850
And I can't say that it can
be done and fixed tomorrow,

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:46.190
but it is an important
foundation to remember.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:50.690
Now, this whole thing
about the experiment.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.660
So I grew up on our territory,
the Allegheny territory,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.482
and then somehow
I got to Harvard,

00:15:56.482 --> 00:15:58.190
and then I went to a
Washington law firm,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.180
then I went back home again.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.080
And I was there then
I went back out, back

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.750
to the world of
the law professors.

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.990
And then I went back again.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.030
And so it's a quest
to find out what's

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.760
the best path, what's
the best way to try

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.400
to make a difference, to
try to make a difference.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.340
And right now, you
know, I can't say

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.860
that I know the answer for
sure, but I'm doing it again.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.910
And when I ran for
office as the president,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.810
it was the most
challenging time.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.740
And I don't really
sometimes know

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.321
how I did it other
than I worked hard

00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:33.820
and I talked to a lot of people
and I asked them to trust me

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.687
and to give me a chance
to lead our nation.

00:16:36.687 --> 00:16:38.270
But it was a different
thing because I

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.270
didn't like the way a lot
of the tribal government

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.395
policies were structured
and I wanted to change it.

00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:44.910
And the people I
thought supported that.

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.570
But it's a tough system.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.370
And I have a few more thoughts
to share about that at the end.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.890
But it's something
that's about, is

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.850
it inside your tribe, that's
the most important place

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.380
to be, or outside
the tribe to try

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.890
to influence the course
of events going forward?

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.410
Because it's a colonial system.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.940
I used to call it Federal Indian
Control Law because it's not

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.940
about some neutral thing.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.329
It's about control
and everything

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.420
about the Doctrine of Discovery
and the domestic dependent

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.860
nationhood and the Acts
of Congress and the Acts

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.800
of the Supreme Court
are largely about no,

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.190
about what you
can't do if you're

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.980
a native people and
a native government.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.530
And so it is about control.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.790
It's about regulating
indigenous peoples.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.580
And I've never thought
of it as neutral.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.680
I've never thought
about it as something

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.830
that you should
be simply studying

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.110
for its intellectual value.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.160
It's a weapon.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.680
It's a tool that's used by
the colonial legal system

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.337
and the colonial society to
control indigenous populations.

00:17:45.337 --> 00:17:47.670
So that's what I want to talk
a little bit about is some

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:51.940
of the pros and cons of
these different platforms

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.260
of engagement.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.190
And maybe there are more
opportunities and challenges

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.100
because I can't
say at this point

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.070
that it's a really bright line.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.760
But a little bit
about why should you

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.641
engage within your
indigenous community?

00:18:06.641 --> 00:18:08.390
And this might be a
message that goes more

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.520
towards native
people who are here,

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.660
especially those
in the university.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.250
Because I tell you it's pretty
comfortable in relative terms,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.800
to live in this outside world.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.510
People generally respect you.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.790
They're nice to you.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.780
You can go get 16 different
kinds of pizza if you want to.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.610
And going to your
Indian reservation

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.420
doesn't have a lot of that.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.280
It's a tough place to be, almost
everywhere in Indian country.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.460
So to leave this kind
of life-- and I was just

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.690
telling a friend on the way
over here-- in the hotel

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.980
that we're staying
in right now, in 1987

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.830
when they were hiring first year
law students, second year law

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.510
students at Harvard, it was
filled with American law firms

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.740
looking to pay an
awful lot of money

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:55.500
for Harvard Law School talent.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.250
And the market was so
unbelievably strong.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:00.560
It was unbelievably warping
that my first summer

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.330
job was making three
times as much money

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:05.240
as my mother did as
our education director.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.260
And I thought frankly,
to be honest with you,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.610
I really wanted to try that.

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.850
You know, because I think it's
important to understand what's

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.640
going on in American law firms.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.820
Well no, the money
was good, too.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.260
And so I learned
a lot about that.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.710
And yet, what is it
about tribal life?

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.645
What's going on there?

00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:27.804
Well from my perspective,
that's where it begins.

00:19:27.804 --> 00:19:29.970
When you talk about the
right of self-determination,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.511
when you talk about
your sovereignty,

00:19:31.511 --> 00:19:34.770
when you talk about your
existence as a native people,

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.380
it begins right there
with the people.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.680
You can't manufacture that
from Washington or Albany

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.140
or anywhere else.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.000
If you're talking about the
survival of your people,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.370
the strength of your people,
it has to exist at that level

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.750
where the people are.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.160
And maybe that's
obvious, but you'd

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.520
be surprised the
degree to which there's

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.320
some delusional thinking about
somehow you can fix things

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.200
from elsewhere.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.920
Some delusional thinking of
which I've even engaged in.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.470
But much of it is that it has
to be local, so you see it.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.210
When I got involved with
a law reform project,

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.720
one of my first things was to
help change our constitution

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.460
to create a new Court of
Appeal, to be able to separate

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.150
our judicial elections
from our general elections

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:22.600
to try to de-escalate some
of the politics of choosing

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.090
judges.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.040
And in that time in
that window no one else

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.870
could do that for us.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.810
In terms of trying
to make things

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.247
better for the people,
the Seneca people,

00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:35.080
in terms of how we were
governing ourselves.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.788
There's no federal
official you can call.

00:20:36.788 --> 00:20:38.490
There's no NGO you can call.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.999
You could only do that yourself.

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:42.290
So that's the upside, that's
the attraction is that you

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.250
can actually see progress.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.330
And there's so many people
on a day to day basis

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.569
who work in Indian country
tribal governments.

00:20:48.569 --> 00:20:50.110
Some of the toughest
work that's done

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:54.370
deals with children and
families, families in distress.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.650
And they are people who
make unbelievable sacrifices

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.480
and deal with the most
unbelievable tragedies

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.550
oftentimes, but they're
making a difference.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.400
They're finding a way to improve
people's lives at the ground

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.610
level.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.610
This isn't just a
battle that occurs

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.000
against a blac-- a blank slate.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.600
We're inheriting this
unbelievable legacy

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.100
of colonization.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.900
And the efforts that were taken
by the American government,

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.360
in conspiracy with a lot
of other actors in terms

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.020
of this process, to really
destroy indigenous societies.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.800
So you have a lot of
people like my family

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.390
who were raised in
boarding schools

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.560
for which my grandmother
was beaten as a small child

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.250
because she was speaking
the Seneca language.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.970
And that had a real
consequence in terms

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.690
of the degree to which
my family maintained

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.670
an inherent connection
to our culture.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.070
And those have a broader
psychological effects

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.500
in the way people
today are living

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.000
and the-- and their health,
their mental health,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.410
their physical health.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.535
Those experiences-- we
call it historic trauma.

00:21:58.535 --> 00:22:00.535
And it's something our
health care professionals

00:22:00.535 --> 00:22:02.280
and our leaders are
trying to work on

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.100
to find a way that you can't
just give someone a pill

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.290
or give them a band-aid
if they're in pain.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:10.830
Sometimes you have to crawl
into their inter-generational

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.030
existence to find out
what happened to them.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.530
And I don't know that that's
completely true everywhere else

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:17.160
in the world, but
we're colonized

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.190
people and these experiences
of boarding schools

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.200
and systematic efforts to
destroy our societies require

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.120
some very intimate, on the
ground activity to improve it.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.990
So that's a reality of our
lives that self-determination,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:34.810
our sovereignty, our
existence as a people

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.060
happens at the local level and
you can't do it anywhere else.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.860
A related benefit, or at
least important component

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.190
to just tribal
political engagement,

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:48.309
is at the protection
and defense function.

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:49.850
How do you protect
yourself if you're

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.980
a tribal nation, a small
tribal nation in the world?

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.730
A few years ago
when I was teaching,

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:58.750
I tried to get the law
school administration

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.260
to buy in to the idea that
I should teach a travel

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.220
course over in Europe, and that
I should go to the Vatican,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.830
and I should go to Monaco, and
I should go to Lichtenstein

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.690
to examine and explore how
these small sovereigns of Europe

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.680
sustain themselves.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.281
[CROWD LAUGHING]

00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:15.880
-That I should go
during the summer.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.546
[CROWD LAUGHING]

00:23:16.546 --> 00:23:18.960
-And that I should have-- I
should have three weeks or so

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.730
with my family.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.044
At the law school's expense of
course, to take a few students

00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:25.585
and understand and
study these issues

00:23:25.585 --> 00:23:27.960
with these small sovereigns.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.499
They didn't buy it.

00:23:29.499 --> 00:23:30.290
They didn't buy it.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.480
But it's still an
important question

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.600
to ask, is how do those
small sovereigns survive

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.750
in the world as
their own sovereigns?

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.010
And so too with us?

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.760
How do we make it?

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.130
How do we survive?

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.600
Well, we've had some great
battles in my nation,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.270
as many nations do.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.690
But this really
sort of beat down

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:51.700
the path of realizing
that a lot of what

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.830
we think about the
way the law works

00:23:53.830 --> 00:24:01.540
is really a mistake or at least,
at best, it's misdirected.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.970
There's nothing in the
treaties of the Seneca

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:06.350
Nation or the
Haudenosaunee, there's

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:08.390
nothing in the legal
system of my nation

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.250
that says, "We hereby consent to
the plenary power of the United

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.840
States."

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.260
Now American jurists--
the Supreme Court--

00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.500
have been writing about
that for generations,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.190
that American law is based upon
this notion of plenary power,

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.273
The Doctrine of Discovery.

00:24:25.273 --> 00:24:28.490
We don't-- we've never
embraced any of that.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.520
So guess what?

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.071
It doesn't exist in our nation.

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:34.570
And I actually wrote
a whole article

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:38.480
about how frankly American
law is mostly advisory

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.990
as it relates to the actions
of a tribal government.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.832
If you're a tribal government,
which by treaty have consented

00:24:43.832 --> 00:24:46.040
to the application of American
law to your business--

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.980
and some tribes have--
well then you're stuck.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.990
But most of have not.

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.280
And that's called
jurisprudential sovereignty.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:57.010
That's the ability to decide
your own legal relationship

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.550
with the United States.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.030
And so if you go back to
whether it's the conflict

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.530
zone with the state of New
York over interpretation

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.740
of our treaty right, our
nation has as much right

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.730
to interpret our
treaties as we see fit,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.540
as does the state or
the federal government.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.030
Sometimes they're in tension.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.999
Sometimes they're in conflict.

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:15.540
But you don't resolve
them by running

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.010
to the courts of
the United States.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.360
You settle them and resolve them
through negotiation, if at all.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.180
It's a treaty.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.830
It's not meant to be
legally adjudicated

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.220
in the courts of one side over
the other as a general matter.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.760
So we won some of these battles.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.910
Not just the thruway thing,
but something as sexy as making

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.605
sure that the EPA cannot force
you to get a federal permit

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:41.980
for the construction of your
waste water treatment plant.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.280
Waste water treatment
sovereignty.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.910
Very important.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.879
But that's exactly
what they did.

00:25:51.879 --> 00:25:54.170
My wife, when she was the
president of our construction

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.530
company, was working
on the development

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.100
of this important improvement
in the waste water

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.830
treatment of our community.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.670
And the council had borrowed the
money to be able to pay for it

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.720
and the EPA showed up and said,
"You're going to get a permit."

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.845
And we said, "No we're not.

00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:11.800
We don't get permits from you
to do business in our own land.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.650
Where in the treaty
does it say this?"

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.821
So we fought with them for
a couple years over this.

00:26:15.821 --> 00:26:17.320
Now keep in mind,
no one was looking

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.280
to pollute our own
lands and waters.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.565
We had actually exceeded
the standards that's

00:26:22.565 --> 00:26:24.220
set by the federal
government, but it

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.970
was the issue of the permit.

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.429
And it took them
a couple of years,

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:28.886
but eventually we
got a letter back

00:26:28.886 --> 00:26:30.460
that says, "We
decided to recognize

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.187
your permit that the
council issued for you

00:26:33.187 --> 00:26:34.770
and we would like
to sit down and have

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.130
a discussion over maybe just
a few refinements of that."

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.630
Great!

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.270
Let's have a discussion.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:40.550
That was a big win.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:41.650
That was a big win.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.980
That with respect to
business activities

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.710
and governmental activities
in our own territory, that we

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.980
would not have to be subject
to the environmental regulation

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.974
of the United States.

00:26:50.974 --> 00:26:52.890
That was our business
and if the United States

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.360
has an issue or a problem,
we'd be glad to talk about it.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.890
That's what
sovereign nations do.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:59.589
So that's a perspective.

00:26:59.589 --> 00:27:00.880
And I see it from time to time.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.780
Unfortunately not often enough.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:09.270
And increasingly the lawyers
have grabbed hold of the issue

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.480
and are reading from their
provision of the US Code

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.440
and are paving over their
client's own freedom

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.685
to make a different decision.

00:27:17.685 --> 00:27:19.310
I wrote a whole
article about that too,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.601
not that anyone's ever read it.

00:27:20.601 --> 00:27:23.070
But it's just something that
actually is rooted in the idea

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.903
that when you're an
American trained lawyer,

00:27:24.903 --> 00:27:26.620
you're largely not
taught that there's

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.560
an entire other
legal system that you

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.270
have to be respectful of and
that you have to deal with.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.720
And frankly if you're taking
your ethical obligation

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.180
seriously, you have to give
life to that legal foundation,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.780
the tribal legal foundation,
as much as you do

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.260
the American legal foundation.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.960
So a little bit of the
downside of the tribal life,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.080
the tribal political life,
the tribal engagement life.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.950
And I saw this--
for those of you

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.760
who are ever working in
tribal government and decide,

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.630
you know I think I
want to run for chair

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.880
or I want to run for president.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.870
Your world goes from seeing
things in black and white

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.250
to seeing things in unbelievable
technicolor and vibrancy.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.900
It's much more
complicated, much harder

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:09.760
than you could ever imagine.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.410
And I have so much respect
for the tribal leaders

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.450
in place today and in the
past and those yet to come,

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.230
because it's really hard
to govern a tribal nation.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.050
There's so many
different interests.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.140
There's so many
different problems.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.130
And I think that the intensity
of the politics-- for those

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.070
of you who've ever been on
a city council-- or maybe

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.400
the standard is if your
constituents actually

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.430
know where you live,
then you know how hard

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:38.780
it is to be a political leader.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.850
I mean these guys in Washington,
these women that travel in

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:44.420
and they do their business
and they leave, that's great.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.930
It's when they go
back home where

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.030
people know where they live that
it gets tough, because then you

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.980
gotta deal with folks on your
doorstep and at the supermarket

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.960
and tribal communities
are very same way.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.400
And they are-- generally is-- my
experience-- native people are

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.440
not shy about telling you
what's wrong with what

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.880
you're doing in terms of
your responsibilities.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.190
And I think taking that dynamic
and then adding in the fact

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.440
that the reality in most cases
and certainly the perception

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.610
is that political rewards,
political economic engagement

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:22.290
is a zero sum game that I
can only win if you lose.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:23.680
And that might be
true generally,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.380
not just in native communities,
but there's an awful lot

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.410
of really intense conflict.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:33.860
Jobs, contracts,
economic activity

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.390
that is being sought by some.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.049
It's at the expense
of somebody else.

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:41.590
And the reality is that in many
places in any country, that's

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.450
really still true where
most of the dollars

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.640
come from federal
appropriations.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.840
There are no new
jobs being created.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.780
There are no new dollars
flowing into the community.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.450
And I didn't realize it when
I had tried to bring in,

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.200
well not just
myself historically,

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.730
but other people
from our community,

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:58.146
the children and
grandchildren who

00:29:58.146 --> 00:29:59.990
had gotten their
college degrees,

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:02.240
try to bring them
into our government.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.620
It was perceived by
many-- to some extent it

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.950
was true-- it was a zero
sum game because jo--

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.700
those jobs didn't go to people
who may not have been qualified

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:10.675
for those jobs.

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:13.640
And it was very contentious,
it was a very hard business

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.270
to have to make those decisions.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.280
So with that exciting
news, let's move on

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.740
to engaging with the
colonial political system.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.740
Because as much as there are
strengths and weaknesses, when

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.180
your system, the
political system

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.650
is intertwined with the
United States, in some cases

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.909
it's very, very direct.

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:33.450
There are many Indian nations
and tribes in the United States

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.530
that have constitutions
that require

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:43.130
that the Secretary of the
Interior approve their laws,

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:46.140
approve the amendments
to their constitutions.

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:49.710
This is not a federal legal
requirement by any means,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.440
but it is a symptom,
a consequence

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:56.280
of those early Indian
Reorganization Act governments

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.490
where the bureaucrats
embedded these provisions

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.110
in the tribal
constitutional drafts

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.650
that were being proposed,
where they embedded themselves

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:08.280
in the power structure.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.070
And so you're dealing literally
with this intertwining

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.720
of politics and law
between the tribal

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.890
and the federal government over
control over what's going on.

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.510
I worked with a tribe on trying
to change their constitution

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.440
to remove these
provisions because there

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.084
is no federal
requirement for them.

00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.250
And a tribe, if it wants
to get rid of the Secretary

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:30.625
of the Interior from
its ordinance approval

00:31:30.625 --> 00:31:33.365
and from it's constitutional
approval process,

00:31:33.365 --> 00:31:35.417
it can do that.

00:31:35.417 --> 00:31:37.250
Well, the bureaucrats
don't often like that,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:41.690
and it took seven years
of advocacy and patience

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.300
and fighting with the
Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.090
to get their constitution,
to get their election

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.010
approved so they could
remove those provisions

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:49.830
from the tribe.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.786
So the government sometimes
just doesn't want to let go,

00:31:53.786 --> 00:31:55.160
and that's part
of the challenge.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.130
That when you engage
with that system,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.940
you've got to find a way
to make a difference.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.616
So I think that's really one
of the first and most important

00:32:02.616 --> 00:32:03.990
reasons to get
involved in what's

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.020
going on in the
federal government,

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:09.450
is that it gives you an
opportunity to repair and fix

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.050
some of the historic colonial
activities of the United States

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.620
as it relates to native peoples.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.110
I thought John Dossett
earlier did a really great job

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:20.180
highlighting a variety
of different statutes

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.650
and initiatives.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:23.130
And if you were to
go back through,

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.505
you could do a law review
article about each one of them,

00:32:25.505 --> 00:32:28.470
about the degree to which
those statutes-- like

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:30.660
the Violence Against
Women Act, for example--

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:36.340
that are designed to repair
colonial intrusions, the depo--

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.100
the deprivation of jurisdiction
of tribal governments

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.330
over non-Indians, repairing the
degree to which native women

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.470
primarily are victimized
within their own communities

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:49.480
by non-Indian men.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.080
That this was about
repairing and fixing

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.620
some of the problems that exist
with the native communities,

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.880
maybe most if not all.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.320
But it's being done at the level
of the United States government

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.110
where you're thinking, we can't
solve the problem by ourselves

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.420
on the ground, we have to
go to Washington because we

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.900
need to fix those
laws that are in place

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.400
in order to repair this
problem, fix this problem.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.990
So that's why I think that
when you talk about maybe

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:22.810
reorienting the agenda
of the United States,

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.462
it's really a matter-- and I
think Richard Guest brought

00:33:25.462 --> 00:33:26.920
this out in his
presentation-- it's

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:31.120
about the trajectory of how
federal policy has changed.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.850
It was only 50 years ago
that the formal Indian Policy

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.040
of the United States
was called termination.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.710
We're going to terminate
indigenous people

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.680
as separate people.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.620
And it really started with
the Citizenship Act of 1924.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.970
And I should tell you
now I'm definitely--

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.954
along with most of the
members of my nation--

00:33:51.954 --> 00:33:53.370
opposed to the
idea that we should

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:57.340
be voting in American elections
because citizenship was not

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.590
given to us as some
notion of liberating

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.150
our political existence.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.710
It was a tool of
assimilation and oppression

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.400
to make sure that
we were absorbed

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.010
into the American
polity at the expense

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.570
of our tribal sovereignty.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:13.270
And it boils down to the
fact that a nation does not

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.739
enter into treaties
with its own people.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.820
And I heard it from
folks that if you vote,

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.800
if you participate at that
level in the American political

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.770
system, then what
you're really doing

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.830
is you're jumping
to the other side

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.199
and then there was no one
left to speak for the treaty

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:31.949
Indians.

00:34:31.949 --> 00:34:34.060
The reason why I know
that's true to some extent

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.050
is that that's what the
adversaries of sovereignty say.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.659
You're all citizens now
and the minute the Congress

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.440
did that, your treaty
rights disappeared.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.710
So it's something to be
very concerned about,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.790
and I respect that
different native people

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:51.165
and different tribal governments
make different decisions

00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:53.980
about what's best for how to
articulate their view forward.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.771
But it's something at
least in our nations,

00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:57.680
we generally don't do.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.430
That doesn't mean
we don't engage.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:03.150
And diplomats-- you know
it's kind of lobbying.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.350
John pointed out, lobbying.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.620
It's, you know, diplomacy.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:06.120
Right?

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.430
We're-- we're on diplomatic
missions when we go

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.080
to Washington, and we go to
Albany to deal with other

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.820
diplomatic representatives,
like members of Congress

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.130
and senators.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.710
And there's a way
to make progress.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.010
And I think it's
really great that there

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.447
is progress being
made on a number

00:35:22.447 --> 00:35:23.530
of these different issues.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.176
And that's kind of
back to the experiment,

00:35:26.176 --> 00:35:28.300
what I have really been
trying to do the last three

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.690
years since I left
office, is to be involved

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:34.910
with some major battles,
to protect and defend

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.700
the sovereignty and the
freedom of our nations.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.110
John had mentioned in his
presentation which I thought--

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.230
I wanted to just take a
little bit more time-- is

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.620
a recent battle that
related to protecting

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.520
native people and the benefits
that tribal governments provide

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.340
to native people from the IRS.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.594
The Tribal Government General
Welfare Exclusion Act.

00:35:55.594 --> 00:35:57.510
And this was something
that I was lucky enough

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.470
to work on behalf of
one of my clients.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.800
But if you can believe
it, right, for 10 years

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:06.740
the IRS was auditing tribes,
auditing individual Indians,

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.790
forcing tribal governments
to give 1099s to elders

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.060
for their hip replacements.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.000
Pay tax, Granny!

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.110
That's what the IRS
was saying and that

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.330
was what was happening.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.710
And no-- no one talks
about their audits.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.890
So this was kind of
going on for 10 years

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.400
that there was this--
oh you got audited too?

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.020
You're getting audited?

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.630
We got audited twice.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.520
And when you started
piecing it together,

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.320
people-- native
leaders were realizing

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:35.230
this was a systematic problem.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.907
That kind office
over at the IRS that

00:36:37.907 --> 00:36:39.990
was trying to help us with
our payroll tax records

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.520
was actually in the
business of auditing us.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.100
So the first mobilization
occurred with respect

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.290
to the Affordable Care
Act and tribal health

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.140
care benefits were
immunized and that

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:52.200
was a big-- that was a big win.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.090
And then the whole
process was really

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.700
taken to a complete
level that we

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.220
need to fix this problem
for all benefits.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.370
As tribal governments
have the responsibility

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.790
to serve native people,
have the resources to serve

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:05.320
native people,
tribal governments

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.690
should not be subject
to tax, income tax,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.810
nor should their
people for the benefits

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.160
that are being provided.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.340
And so there was a
two pronged process

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.090
going on in 2013 and in 2014.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.410
One was engaging
directly with IRS

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:21.740
to try to push them to
develop their own policies

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.950
and the other to
pursue legislation,

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.250
to go to the Congress.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.410
And there's a certain
internal debate and discussion

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.880
about building coalitions,
about finding a way

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:37.210
to sort through the what's the
right policy approach to take.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.150
That's a democratic process.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:42.750
There are tribes all over the
country, tribal organizations

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:46.260
that are constantly working on
a number of different issues.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.430
But we were able to get focus.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:53.180
We all agree we should stop and
find a way to protect ourselves

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.490
from the IRS.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:56.780
And we found members of
Congress totally willing

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.990
to help us do that
and it was a big win.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.350
We ultimately got a bill
through the Congress.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.450
No hearings.

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:05.950
No real votes.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.140
Voice vote, both houses.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.570
And I think that's
where you see the power.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.160
I mean it wasn't quite
Seneca's on the highway,

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.440
but to me it was.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.110
It was.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.160
We got a bill
through the Congress.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.990
This will protect native people
forever by having it in the tax

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:25.130
code that the IRS cannot tax the
benefits that our governments

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:25.980
provide.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.621
And so it makes a
difference, exciting

00:38:27.621 --> 00:38:29.370
that when you can do
things that will make

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:32.330
a difference for Indian
people in Washington,

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.580
you want to hang onto
it and embrace it

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.970
because it can and will
happen if you're not the best.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.315
A couple thoughts on just
the downside of the system.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.910
The level of hostility
to tribal sovereignty

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.000
is something that you
may be familiar with,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.610
but depending upon
where you are in America

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.190
it starts with gross ignorance
about what tribal sovereignty

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.150
is and what treaties are.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.360
It blends in a little bit
to the casino confusion.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.270
Well you all have casinos
now and have all the money,

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.670
so why do you need to have
federal appropriation's

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.360
dollars?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.700
And that's just such
a wrongheaded, skewed,

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.550
misinformed perspective because
most places in Indian country

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.030
remained unbelievably
impoverished

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.170
and have not had the benefit
of tremendous gaming wealth.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.020
But that influences
and it's something

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:24.537
that really is a part of the
way in which a lot of Americans

00:39:24.537 --> 00:39:26.870
still think and their officials
still think about what's

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:28.570
going on in Indian country.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:32.330
And I think frankly, some
folks are fairly informed.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.430
They're very educated
about tribal sovereignty.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:37.870
They just hate it.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.250
They just think it's
wrong that there should

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.080
be such a thing as separate
sovereign tribal nations

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.890
within the United States.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.140
And there are groups and
there are members of Congress

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.760
who in their own way do what
they can to undermine that

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.040
and to oppose us when it
comes to the preservation

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.420
of our nations.

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.700
I don't want to talk
oftentimes publicly, too much

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.330
about what's going on in
the American elections,

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.600
but we are very much at the
cusp of an unbelievable wave

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.080
of American nationalism
that we haven't

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.140
seen since World War II which
ushered in the termination era.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.440
And if you look at the
historical parallels,

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.696
I think as native people we
have to be very concerned

00:40:16.696 --> 00:40:19.070
about what's happening in the
American political election

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.470
this time around.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.419
Because among other
things, is it really

00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:24.960
going to be the case
that we're going

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.370
to have this same level of
respect, of our treaty rights,

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.460
of our lands, of
our governments?

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.400
I'd be very worried
about that, and I

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.477
think that we should be aware
of the historical parallels

00:40:36.477 --> 00:40:38.060
that the last time
something like this

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.643
happened it was
during the termin-- it

00:40:39.643 --> 00:40:41.880
began the termination era.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:50.197
So these are somewhat general
thoughts about where to engage.

00:40:50.197 --> 00:40:52.280
So the question might be
to get-- to sort of start

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.470
to close here is-- all right.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.670
So it's been 30 years since
I got out of law schoo--

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:02.260
or since I started law school
and I'm still working on it

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.640
in terms of this experiment
about where best to engage.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:10.510
So I would say as a general
matter, clearly both.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:14.770
I mean you need to have
people on the ground,

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:19.540
in the community, within the
tribal government working hard

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:22.610
to make things better
and I'm a little worried

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:26.590
about that for my own
tribe and maybe all tribes.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.530
Because one of the
things about American--

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.120
being colonized
by Americans-- is

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.970
that the American
way of life is rooted

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.420
in a certain
aspiration of happiness

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.890
and freedom, personal freedom.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.540
It's not really an
ethos that's rooted in,

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.820
you should sacrifice
and suffer to be

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.470
a-- to be an American citizen.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.990
It's just the opposite.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.160
And I think a lot of folks,
it's easy to be drawn into that.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.010
TV sends us these
message, the media.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:56.990
And to say, well, I want to
go work with my tribal nation

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.140
which is not always fun
and which is hard to do,

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:02.090
and it doesn't have 16 different
kinds of pizza nearby--

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:06.580
is not a really
fun life sometimes.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.260
But if you don't do it,
especially those of you

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.020
who are natives,
those of you who

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:12.686
have a role-- even
if you're not native,

00:42:12.686 --> 00:42:14.670
there's roles to
play-- if there's

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.160
nobody on the ground
of strength and means

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.470
and fortitude and virtue,
then our governments will

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.540
wither away and
they'll die off, and we

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.320
will be left to the forces that
would seek our destruction.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.485
So who knows whether I'll
ever get back involved.

00:42:30.485 --> 00:42:32.110
I really don't think
it'll ever happen.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:33.850
I feel like I've
paid in my dues,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.680
and I know my family
feels the same way.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.680
But I think it's an
important point to focus on.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.930
And I think with respect to
the American political system,

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.050
I mean it's made-- it's changed.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.120
It's so different, even gaming.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:49.960
The last time, you
know, the government

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.660
really even studied the
question, say of our economies,

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.540
was during the Reagan
administration.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.800
And so there's a lot to be done
yet about improving economy,

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.760
about finding ways to
help tribal governments

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.870
deal with what's happening
within our nations.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:04.835
Focus.

00:43:04.835 --> 00:43:06.960
If you're going to be
involved in either direction,

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.640
you have to focus on
what your task is.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.470
You can easily be
distracted and drawn

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:13.870
into all kinds of
different agendas.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:16.880
There's a lot of folks who talk.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.950
Not a lot of people
who get things done.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.510
And if you want to be
involved, you really

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.680
need to want to get things done.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.590
Stay disciplined.

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:26.871
Stay focused.

00:43:26.871 --> 00:43:28.370
And sometimes that's
hard and I tend

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.290
to think that-- I really think
that my legal training has

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:34.910
helped me a lot over the years,
in terms of helping focus

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.730
and really laser in
on particular problems

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:41.760
in a way that might
help get things done.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.000
Work hard.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.480
And this was
mentioned earlier too,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.080
working hard, about finding
a way to focus on the task.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.550
There are people out
there who shame me

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:51.910
in terms of their work ethic.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:53.344
It's unbelievable.

00:43:53.344 --> 00:43:55.010
Leaders especially,
who've been in place

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.282
in some cases for
decades, dealing

00:43:57.282 --> 00:43:58.490
with all of these challenges.

00:43:58.490 --> 00:44:00.012
I don't know how they do it.

00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:01.970
But thank goodness that
they do because there's

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.060
so many challenges
that this effort.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:06.440
And that's not always the case.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.840
I was just reading the other day
that the current generation is

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.298
having a hard time holding on
to their investment bank jobs

00:44:11.298 --> 00:44:13.900
on Wall Street because
it's kind of boring

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.020
and it's really hard
work and gosh, you know,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.770
that $150,000 or $200,000
a year just isn't that

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:22.220
much to hang on to those jobs.

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:23.770
And that's a real message.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:25.860
I was reading that,
somewhat shocked.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.360
So doing things where it's
not always the most lucrative,

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.740
or it's somewhat of a
challenge, is really important.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.490
But if you work hard
at it, you can really

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:36.180
achieve tremendous goals.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.400
So as I conclude, I
want to just maybe bring

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.240
this all together and just
offer a suggestion on what

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.620
might be the most
important thing that we

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.860
could be working on.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.965
And I think it's controversial
for some, but at the moment

00:44:48.965 --> 00:44:50.340
it's where I think
it's important

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:53.330
and that's improving
tribal economies.

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:57.410
That our economies
have been devastated.

00:44:57.410 --> 00:44:59.860
And I start from the assumption
that all native people

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.405
were rich, that we were wealthy,
that we lived within the land.

00:45:04.405 --> 00:45:05.655
We lived within our resources.

00:45:05.655 --> 00:45:07.950
We lived within our people.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.390
We fought and had
conflict with each other,

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.740
but we had what we needed
and we had the notion

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.520
that this was a good life.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.247
And most of that has been taken
away, confiscated, stolen.

00:45:19.247 --> 00:45:21.580
Whether it's the IRS taking
our money because they think

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.360
we're citizens of
the United States,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.520
whether it's development
companies looking to gain title

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.480
and resources to
tribal lands-- you

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.250
know-- whether it's
folks up in Alaska

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:37.060
who had the entire country, but
ended up with only 10% of it

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.310
and just a small
fraction of the wealth.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.740
These economies
have been destroyed.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.585
And when you talk about
how best to help people,

00:45:44.585 --> 00:45:47.080
it invariably comes back to
whether they have the money

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.310
to do anything about it,
whether it's fully implementing

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.510
the powers under the
Violence Against Women

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.320
Act in your tribal
courts, whether it's

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.572
helping your elders or dealing
with children in distress--

00:45:57.572 --> 00:46:00.030
if you don't have dollars, if
the tribal government doesn't

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.350
have dollars to be
able to find a doctor,

00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:06.480
to find a care provider,
to find some way,

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.655
then tribal
governments can't help.

00:46:08.655 --> 00:46:10.617
And you can't wait around.

00:46:10.617 --> 00:46:12.700
So some of the folks that
I work with have largely

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.140
been saying if the federal
government can't give us

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:17.360
the dollars that
we're entitled to-- I

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:21.460
love Karen's notion that we
were already sort of prepaid,

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.890
so where's our money?

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.990
You know?

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.920
If you can't pay up,
give us our freedom back.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.550
Get your regulators
out of our pocket.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:31.680
Get your taxman
out of our pocket.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.820
Give us the control that
we need over our lands,

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.030
and then we'll find a
way to create businesses

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:40.370
and create jobs and do what we
can to help our tribal people

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.860
have a better life.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.430
And so at the moment,
that's where I'm at,

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.620
in terms of helping to find
ways for native people,

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.980
native governments,
entrepreneurs, create jobs,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.150
find revenue, change federal
laws that inhibit growth.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:56.740
John's argument or presentation
on the Indian trader

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:59.380
statutes-- a fairly
unsexy statute

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.690
in the annals of federal
statutes-- you know,

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:03.500
the one that said all
the non-Indians had

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.458
to have a license before
they could do business

00:47:05.458 --> 00:47:08.550
with the Indians-- can
actually be a great tool

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.700
to protect us from
ill-gotten gains going

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.411
to the state and
local governments,

00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:15.410
and we can preserve those
dollars for ourselves.

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:18.560
It's not sexy sometimes,
but it's really important

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.980
I think that we find a way
to help tribal governments

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:23.834
and native people restore
economy so that then they

00:47:23.834 --> 00:47:26.000
can make the choices that
they need with the dollars

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.890
that they generate to repair
some of the mistakes that have

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:31.990
been made, some of the agendas
that have been inflicted on us,

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.500
and ultimately to
pursue the goal

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.317
and lifeblood of the
people that they represent.

00:47:38.317 --> 00:47:40.400
So I want to thank you for
your time, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:43.580
And I want to be able to share
with you any further thoughts

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.080
on this now or later.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.310
But I thank you again for
the opportunity to be here.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:47.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.234
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.140
-Hello.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.040
Thank you very much.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:47:59.706
-You're welcome.

00:47:59.706 --> 00:48:03.450
-You spoke a lot about having
great economic viability

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.910
for these different tribes.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.790
How do you think the tribes
using their resources

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.480
to generate those profits
needed to pay for the programs

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.610
they need can factor
into that goal?

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:14.740
-How do they need to do it?

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:21.080
Well, I don't know of any
tribal nation that has

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.790
a tax base of any significance.

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.490
There are a few tribes
that collect taxes,

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:28.045
but the basic business
model in the American state

00:48:28.045 --> 00:48:29.420
and federal and
local governments

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:34.740
is that you tax income, you tax
businesses, you tax property

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.750
and that doesn't exist
within any country

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:38.850
as a general matter.

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:43.280
So tribes run
businesses-- casinos

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.950
being the most significant
and prominent--

00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:50.250
but could be a grocery store,
could be a gas station.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.737
-In terms of natural
resources like wood or timber,

00:48:52.737 --> 00:48:54.570
what do you think that
would factor into it?

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.778
-Well, I think that there's
an increasing recognition

00:48:56.778 --> 00:48:59.120
that renewables are better.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.270
There are many that
don't have renewables

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:03.950
and much of their
economy sometimes

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:09.330
is based upon hard rock
mining and other business

00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.660
activity that exists really
everywhere in the world.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.290
My nation for many,
many years probably

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.857
was kept afloat by gravel
mining in our territory.

00:49:17.857 --> 00:49:19.690
And eventually we've
had some recent debates

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.815
over moratorium on that
because we just don't think

00:49:21.815 --> 00:49:23.950
we should be doing it anymore.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:29.300
So sovereignty sometimes
manifests itself in behaviors

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.680
that you may not
like, but a tribe

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.820
has authority with respect
to its own territory

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.920
to do what it sees
best for itself

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.960
and that may include
that kind of development.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.620
-Thank you.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:40.120
-Sure.

00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:42.990
-Hi.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.050
I'm Anne Flaherty.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.760
I teach political science
at Merrimack College,

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.420
and I also grew up
in upstate New York

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:53.020
and watched the 1992
conflict unfold.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.630
So I was glad that
you mentioned it.

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:57.860
But in recent years,
the state of New York

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.390
has gone back to
attempting to assert

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:03.065
its right to tax cigarette
sales on reservations.

00:50:03.065 --> 00:50:04.190
And it's not just New York.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.920
It's other states, too.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.700
So my question was, how
can states and tribes

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.830
forge a more
cooperative relationship

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:17.400
when there is ongoing
conflicts like that?

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.980
-Well, it depends on
finding good-hearted folks,

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.560
good-minded folks within
the state government.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:27.110
And again, in an effort to
solve problems-- sometimes

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:28.840
it's just ignorance.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:34.100
And in the way dollars flow,
rarely in a tribal nation

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.700
does the dollar
flow more than once.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.910
It comes in, and
then it's immediately

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:42.370
leaving the territory,
grocery store, car dealership,

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.600
or whatever.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.440
And when you realize that if
we did that in my nation--

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:48.990
we did an economic study
and we demonstrated that

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.099
through direct employment,
through contractors,

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:52.640
and through other
economic stimulus--

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.985
we were contributing
over a billion dollars

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:58.120
to the regional economy, which
is an awful lot of non-Indians

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.040
who became taxpayers.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:03.980
A non-Indian employee at the
casino who has enough money

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.410
to buy a house is
paying property taxes,

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:08.380
they're paying sales
tax on their purchases,

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:11.420
they're paying tax on their
income because they have a job.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:13.590
And I think for a
lot of folks that I

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:16.290
saw from the time I was
first in tribal office

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.930
in the early '90s--
just a dozen years

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:22.140
later when we had the
casinos-- educating these folks

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.080
and making them
realize, it's a win-win.

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.730
Every time a tribal nation has
land that's not subject to tax

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.949
and turns it into something
productive, it helps everybody.

00:51:31.949 --> 00:51:33.990
And I think that's the
path forward, is hopefully

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.320
finding good-minded,
good-hearted folks in state

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.080
government who can appreciate
that it's a win-win.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:39.761
-Thank you.

00:51:39.761 --> 00:51:40.260
-Sure.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:42.990
-Hi.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:44.590
My name's Leland
Pacheco Morrill.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.480
I'm Navajo and Santo
Domingo pueblo.

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.040
And I kind of want to address
the Cobell Agreement which

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.850
also is-- kind of supersedes
the land buyback program,

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:57.150
which is part of the
Dawes Act, which is what?

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.670
120 years ago?

00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.950
150 years ago?

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:04.650
And then also, the Nebraska
versus Parker where the Omaha

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:05.770
Tribe did actually win.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.900
But that was actually
based on alcohol tax,

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.710
and then it was
redrawing the lines

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:16.070
of the actual property of a
reservation system in Nebraska.

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.690
Now each one-- both of those
aspects of it-- one of them

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:24.650
is to try to reconnect
fractionated lands.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:26.595
And the only reason why
I even know about this

00:52:26.595 --> 00:52:29.900
is because the Navajo tribe
actually came to Los Angeles,

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.530
to an urban setting,
to actually talk

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:35.600
to natives in Los Angeles
regarding the land buyback

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.970
program because so
many of them owned land

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.000
on a reservation
they don't live in.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.610
And so, but-- but the
land buyback program

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:51.340
is-- was introduced kind of
to give back an economy, back

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:53.900
to fractionated land.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:57.060
But also then, you have
the Nevad-- Nebraska Parker

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:59.120
case that was trying
to take away land.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.589
Do have any comments
on those at all?

00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:04.130
-I feel like this
is kind of Jeopardy

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:09.060
where I'm getting asked, please
form your answer in a question.

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:10.280
[LAUGHING]

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.550
-You have touched upon a
whole array of after affects

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:16.450
of, again, the
colonization agenda.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:18.190
All these fractionated
reservations

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.400
and all these divided
land interests,

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.550
and it's really pretty
straightforward.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.250
You can't really
do much with land

00:53:24.250 --> 00:53:26.440
that you don't have
jurisdiction over.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.890
So the current
administration really

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.260
should get a lot of applause
for channeling resources

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.070
into reacquiring, allowing
tribes to reacquire

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:36.850
these lands within
their territory,

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:38.350
so they can self-govern
and they can

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.460
find a find a way to--
but it's a long process.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.340
I mean, in some cases you have
hundreds of ostensible owners

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.720
of parcels of land.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.770
And on two occasions,
the Supreme Court

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:50.520
has invalidated
efforts by the Congress

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:53.170
to allow the lands to
be consolidated back

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.170
into the power of the tribe.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.410
So it's a very hard thing.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:59.490
But it also raises a bigger
question which might be,

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.850
where-- what's the source
of economic opportunity

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:02.730
for tribal nations?

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.520
I was literally at a
conference a couple of days ago

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.680
having a conversation
with a tribal leader

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.590
and I said, "Well, you
realize that the income earned

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:13.490
by a tribal government
anywhere in America,

00:54:13.490 --> 00:54:17.780
including off territory,
is immune from income tax?"

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.000
Didn't know that.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.880
So what that means is that
there are potential business

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.850
opportunities for a tribal
nation off territory

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.190
for which at minimum,
there's no income tax

00:54:30.190 --> 00:54:31.740
for the benefit of the tribe.

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.930
That's a pretty
significant advantage

00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:35.534
in relation to other businesses.

00:54:35.534 --> 00:54:37.200
So I think your
question is a great one.

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.610
It's an unbelievably
complicated issue,

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:41.110
but there are
efforts as you since

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:42.948
heard about how to solve it.

00:54:42.948 --> 00:54:43.904
OK.

00:54:43.904 --> 00:54:44.811
Yeah?

00:54:44.811 --> 00:54:45.310
-Hi.

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.530
My name is Karina Kesserwan.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.320
I'm a lawyer in Quebec, Canada.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.980
And you talk about treaties
and interpretation of treaties

00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.456
and jurisdiction over treaties.

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:55.080
And I'd like to know
if in your opinion

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.684
a treaty can be later appealed
by one of the parties.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:10.115
-Well I think, I mean the answer
is yes because it's a treaty.

00:55:10.115 --> 00:55:11.780
It's an agreement.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:15.280
And it isn't necessarily that we
like Lone Wolf versus Hitchcock

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.700
which says that you can
abrogate an Indian treaty.

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.750
But my own people
seriously debated that

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.390
during our '92 war.

00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:25.825
Should we actually go back
to pre-treaty conditions?

00:55:25.825 --> 00:55:26.325
Warfare.

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:31.742
You know, it was a debate,
and we didn't do it.

00:55:31.742 --> 00:55:33.200
And there-- but
there was actually,

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.660
what would happen if we did?

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:37.260
And so I don't know
if there'll ever

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.760
be circumstances in the
future where that matters,

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.070
but it's an agreement.

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.360
And I suppose if you really
take agreements seriously,

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:47.565
you have to respect the
sovereignty of both governments

00:55:47.565 --> 00:55:48.190
to that treaty.

00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:53.750
-Rob.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:54.610
Thank you so much.

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:55.210
That was fantastic.

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:55.510
Thank you.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:56.135
That was great.

00:55:56.135 --> 00:55:59.160
