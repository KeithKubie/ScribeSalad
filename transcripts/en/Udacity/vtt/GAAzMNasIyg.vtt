00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.090
Welcome to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.720
Today were going to this might be the
last one of the lectures on just sort of

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
this collection of stuff, that I, maybe
not be thought of core computer vision,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.200
but just stuff that I thought
you guys should be exposed to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.440
one way or the other.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260
Also want to give a shout
out to a Kelsey Hawkins,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.440
who helped produce some
of the material here.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.030
So that's opposed to all the other
people that I stole things from,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.450
since Kelsey's actually my student and
put this talk together,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.990
I thought I would, I would do that.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.589
But today I want to talk to you a little
about, a little bit about depth sensing.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.516
I would say that this is tremendously
driven by the fact that there's a lot

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:38.140
of work recently in Computer Vision
dealing for robotics.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.602
The re, recovery of depth previously had
been a bi, back in the 60s, 70s, and

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:46.330
80s, had been a big focus
in Computer Vision.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.390
Then things sort of moved away
into more certain motion things,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.291
labeling stuff, processing a video
to extract stuff, and, and

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:55.150
of course processing all
the images on the web.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.320
But in the last decade or so, with the
growth of robotics, there's this goal to

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.489
be able to visually extract information
from the scene for a robot.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.050
And a lot of that
information that's desired

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.880
is about the geometry
of what's out there.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.920
Where is there stuff,
where is there not stuff?

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.730
What things are on the table?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.430
How would I pick them up off the table?

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.790
So that sort of given a resurgence
to the interest in recovering

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.040
geometry that's out there.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.440
And, of course, recovering geometry
is a fundamentally difficult problem

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.920
in Computer Vision.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740
You know, here is a picture.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.810
You look at this, monocularly, and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.590
you see a surface with
some geometry on there.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.100
There's a certain ambiguity,
perhaps, as to what's in front and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.220
what's behind, but
there's a question of,

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.295
well, how do you get a single image to,
to understand this kind of stuff?

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:45.275
You, of course,
have all these problems that intensity,

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:48.435
image intensity changes as
a function of the illumination.

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:52.940
But here's an image of same scene
lit from different colored light.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.990
And, of course, it provides
a different image to be processed.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.800
And yet, the geometry is identical.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.810
We've talked about this before,
challenges of scale.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.210
Here's an interesting picture.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.210
When you look at this table,
you see a bunch of, white bowls, cups,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.419
et cetera, whatever.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.290
But if we actually were to sort of
take a look at just in this patch

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.400
right there, [LAUGH] clearly
there's not a whole lot of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.800
interesting variation going on there for
image processing to handle.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.670
And, you know, somehow it basically has
to be able to, to somehow figure out

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.740
from the basic extraction of this shape
that there's this cylinder on the table.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.780
And that's generally a hard thing to do.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.010
We also have trouble that,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.040
color is not all that discriminative
sometimes, of what's there.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.480
So there's sort of a,
a similarity between the foreground, and

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.742
the background.

00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:39.330
What we'd really like is
we'd like some representa,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.510
something that gave us
the shape directly.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.600
And so, that we would see
something that looks like this.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.020
And then it won't surprise you
that this is where we're headed.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.000
So here is a bunch of
objects on a table.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.960
And, you know, it'd be nice if the
system could just know that this was one

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.650
surface, and that this was another
surface, and these were the objects.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.380
And, what we're going to do is we're
going to talk about 3D sensing.
