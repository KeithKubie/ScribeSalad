00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.560
Duchamp's great ambition was a very, very bold one.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.580
It wasn't how to be a better artist, it was
how to redefine the question

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
of what is it to be an artist.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.881
He himself said in an interview that probably
his greatest contribution, among many, to

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:23.000
the art of that century was the idea of the
“readymade.”

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.050
A readymade work of art is something that
Duchamp came up with in the teens, nineteen-teens.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.200
And it was the idea that literally he could
go to a store, choose an item, or maybe a

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:46.600
couple of items, and put them together, set
it up in his studio, and call it a work of art.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.440
This means that all of these notions that
had gone for centuries, with the idea of an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.240
artist, such as that you were a skilled painter
or that you knew how to carve or to mold,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.160
all of these ideas associated with the beauty
of a creation or with the suddenness of inspiration

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.160
are gone.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.880
He, of course, was a painter when he started
out.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.180
First making impressionist pictures.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.220
Then after Picasso led the way with Cubism,
he made a variety of cubist paintings.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.250
After he had been painting for about a decade,
he decided, "You know, what's the point if

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.520
I'm one more very good or even excellent painter?

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.820
I'm not changing the world."

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.080
He bought a bicycle wheel and a kitchen stool,
put them together, the wheel on top of the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.400
stool, and kept it in his studio.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.130
And from time to time, he would rotate the
wheel.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.409
One of the first readymades he made when he
got to New York, where he was encountering

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.539
snow, was a work that he called "In Advance
of the Broken Arm."

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.320
Oftentimes, the readymades had a title that
was part of the work of art.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.520
Bought it at a hardware store on the Upper
West Side, took it to his studio, hung it up.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.120
That was a readymade.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.520
People, what should I say, tend to romanticize
quite a bit the meaning.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.080
What's the choice behind the wheel and the
stool?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.560
Is it sedentary and motion?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.020
Is it round and round?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.580
You can go on and on, and it brings out some
really, kind of almost like parodies of what

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.120
art historians or critics might say.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.160
But Duchamp maintained that it wasn't a matter
of aesthetics and that it really was a matter

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.480
of the artist's brain.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.940
And when he said that this was one of his
greatest contributions, if not his greatest,

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.220
to the art of the century, I think what he
was going for was the idea that all of this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.580
took away the artist's or the viewer's retina
as the most important thing.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.380
And Duchamp called painting “retinal art,”
and it was sort of like it was all about what

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.120
you would see with brush stroke and color.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.440
Duchamp is trying to say retinal is substituting
a lot for just dumbness.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.300
Almost like religion is the opiate of the
people.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.580
Let's get away from that and let's get some
ideas going.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
This one is called "Why Not Sneeze, Rose Sélavy?"

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.200
Its title is a question.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.680
Rose Sélavy was his pseudonym, his female
alter ego name.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.700
Totally puzzling question, "Why not sneeze?"

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.440
What we've got is a birdcage with some marble
sugar cubes, a cuttlefish bone, and a little

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.360
thermometer—put together all of these store
bought items, put together in a collage of objects.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.120
When you see readymades from place to place
in various museums, I think almost virtually

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.560
none of them, just a very few, maybe a handful,
survived from the teens themselves

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.280
or the early '20s.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.660
And thereafter, what you're seeing most everywhere
else are re-editions of them that he made

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.720
in the '40s, '50s, or '60s.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:21.220
The '50s and '60s were a time that he actually
made them anew, in part because this is after

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.880
a couple of decades of relative non-celebrity,
his art became of great interest to young artists again.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.400
People like Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg
became fascinated by the model of an artist

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.940
who was not just concerned with craft and
with the idea of hard work, but who just liked

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.380
the idea that an idea could be a work of visual
art.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.960
With pop art, with minimal art, and with what
we now have come to call conceptual art in

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:04.920
the 1960s, all of this depended, to an immense
degree, on the precedent of Duchamp in the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:13.160
teens, having said to the world, "What matters
for a work of art is what's going on

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.740
the choices that are being made, the decision
that an artist makes.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:28.160
Then he declares, or she declares, something
to be a work of art, as an idea, as a concept.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.700
And that's all that it needs, in fact, to
be a work of art."

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.620
And it's amazing.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.560
When I go on tours through these galleries,
with visitors, they're looking at all kinds

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.160
of abstract, pretty difficult-to-decipher
paintings on canvas

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.540
and they're taking it really well.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:58.460
When we come to here, still 100 years later,
invariably I get “why is that art?”

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.500
And I think that's one of the great tributes
to Duchamp having succeeded at what he was

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.800
setting out to do.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.620
He got people to question what otherwise is
something that they just take for granted

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.500
without a second thought.
