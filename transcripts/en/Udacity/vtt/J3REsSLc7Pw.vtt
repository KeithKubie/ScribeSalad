00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the big question is here,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
how on earth are we going to do this?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Because this seems extremely difficult to show,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so we would have to find a problem for which we can

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
prove that any other problem in NP can be reduced to it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Luckily for us or actually more luckily for me,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this work has already been done about 40 years ago

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
by showing a problem called Boolean

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
satisfiability, or SAT for short, to be NP-complete,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and this result is one of the most famous results in theoretical computer science,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is why we're going to investigate it in detail

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and also investigate the proof together.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The result is called the Cook-Levin theorem.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This theorem is named after Stephen Cook and Leonid Levin

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
who discovered it independently of each other in the 1970s,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and by showing that, they provided exactly this NP-complete seed problem,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
namely SAT,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which could then be used to show that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
a number of other problems are NP-complete as well.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I'm then going to show you how Cook and Levin

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
proved that SAT is NP-complete,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and once we have shown that SAT is NP-complete,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we can go back to the problems of Alice, Bob, and Carol

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and see if those problems are NP-complete.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Before we go deeper into the SAT problem and proving the Cook-Levin theorem,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
here's one more quiz to make sure that you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
understand where we are going with this.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So once we have shown that the SAT problem is NP-complete,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
how would we then show, or at least try to show,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that the vertex cover problem, independent set, and clique are NP-complete?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Would we have to show that any input for SAT,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and I'll soon tell you what that input exactly is,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
can be transformed into an input for one of these problems,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and by these problems, I mean vertex cover, independent set, or clique,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
or would we have to show that one of the three problems up here

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
can be expressed as an input to SAT?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Or would we have to show that all three

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
problems can be expressed as an input to SAT?

00:01:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So please check all of these which are correct.
