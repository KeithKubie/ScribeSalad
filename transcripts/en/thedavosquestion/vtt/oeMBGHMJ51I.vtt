00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt;Nic Francis: I think we're going. We going.
He's says we're definitely going.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.370
Um, so do I think the economy is going to
recover? Probably not in 2009. But in terms

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.029
of whether it will slow down ____ or not,
I think it will. But maybe it won't. Maybe

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.589
what it will do is insure that we make very
good decisions because there's less finance.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:27.529
One of the things that we are fixated on is
things like encapture, sorry, carbon capture

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.579
and storage or how do we make coal clean.
We think about and talk about nuclear power

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.590
stations, we talk about renewables. But actually
if we don't meet our goals on climate 50%dwill

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.329
come from energy efficienty. It's the cheapest
thing to do, it's the quickest thing to do

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.019
and we can do it right now. So, therefore,
with a shortage of captial it makes more sense.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.809
So maybe we might act quicker. So maybe it's
a good thing.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.090
Bye. This is how I turn it off. No this one.
He's telling me again.
