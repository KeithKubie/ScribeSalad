00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:10.343
- Let's listen to some music,

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:11.478 align:start size:84% position:16%
you got a playlist--
- Oh yeah.

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:12.412
- That you like?

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.147
- All my music is good, man.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.482
Just put it on random.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:16.950
- Alright.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.351
Rock it out.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.619 align:start size:94% position:6%
- This is an audio
journal of my experiments

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.121
on my own human condition.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.556
(laughs) Forgot
this was on here.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.391
Let's skip ahead.

00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:25.225
- Oh no, no, no.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.459
No, no, I wanna...

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.128
I wanna hear your
thoughts on things.

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:31.664
- Tasted my own urine today to
make sure I was still human.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:32.799
Yeah, let's just skip ahead.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.201
- What the fuck is this?

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.937
- It's just some voice memos.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.340
My experiments are going well.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.375
I'm hours into my
daylong commitment

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.145
to stare at myself
in the mirror nude.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:47.947
I'm beginning to see
my reptilian self.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.282
I am the lizard.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.884
I am the lizard.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.286
I taste the bug on my tongue.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.456
- Don't touch it.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.290
- I just--

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.825
- Don't touch it.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.394
- I have committed myself to
understanding what a woman

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.030 align:start size:81% position:19%
feels like when
she is penetrated.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.532
I want to fulfill
this commitment

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
but the matchstick
won't fit in my penis.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.404
Too square.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.706
- Too square?

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.241
How 'bout...

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.076
Forget it.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.313
- My penis.

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:21.981
- I understand.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:22.816
- Is too square.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:23.650
- I understand...

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.717
What?

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.620
(Jordan screaming)

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.258
- Why? Why? Why?

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:37.197
(intense screaming)

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.969
No!

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.505
No, no, no, no, no, no!

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.407
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.177
I'm so fundamentally lonely.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.013 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm adrift in an
indifferent universe.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
Only Keegan tethers
me to reality.

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:59.586
I'll take a drive
with him tomorrow.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.690
I wonder if he senses how I
feed off of his lifeforce.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.228
Different Keegan.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.897
(beatbox music)
