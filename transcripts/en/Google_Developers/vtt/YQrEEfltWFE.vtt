00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
JJ BEHRENS: Hi.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.655
I'm JJ Behrens.

00:00:01.655 --> 00:00:02.910
JOE FERNANDEZ: And I'm
Joe Fernandez.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.065
JJ BEHRENS: I'm an engineer
on the DART team.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:06.120
JOE FERNANDEZ: And I'm an
engineer on the Android team.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.710
JJ BEHRENS: So when we're not at
work, we're just a bunch of

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.890
normal guys.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.340
JOE FERNANDEZ: Exactly.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.800
We like to do things
normal guys do.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.590
Like, I like to fix things
around the house.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.650
JJ BEHRENS: I have a
house full of kids.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.770
JOE FERNANDEZ: It's true.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.940
JJ BEHRENS: So when Joe needed
to water his lawn, he did what

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.690
any sensible engineer
would do.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.250
JOE FERNANDEZ: Exactly.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.490
I'd build something.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.340
JJ BEHRENS: You start with
an Arduino board.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.600
JOE FERNANDEZ: Right.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.740
And I wanted it hooked up to my
phone, so I had to write an

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.390
Android App.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.690
JJ BEHRENS: You throw in a
little bit of Python and

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.130
Google App Engine.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.990
JOE FERNANDEZ: And we wanted
to make watering the lawn a

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.880
little bit more fun.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.510
So we added just a little
extra twist as well.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.750
JJ BEHRENS: I wanted to show
that DART could be used for

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.500
real world apps.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.200
JOE FERNANDEZ: It's true.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.830
And we really do have a
real world app that

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.360
actually waters my lawn.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.270
JJ BEHRENS: So let's
show you Irrduino.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.660
JOE FERNANDEZ: And so let's
introduce you to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.530
the Irrduino system.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.152
It's based on open
source hardware.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:57.260
The core board on it is the
Android Development Kit, which

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.480
is actually an Arduino Mega
Board with a little bit of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.080
extra stuff on it.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.870
I also added the Ethernet
board on top of this.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.050
This lets me hook it up
to my home network.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.980
So I can send RESTful web
commands to it and control my

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.800
sprinklers through
that system.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.385
The electronics involve
the relay systems.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.640
So these relays actually connect
to the higher power

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.810
circuits that control
the valves.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.391
These are wired into my actual
sprinkler system, which still

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.150
works, by the way.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.955
It lets me turn on the valves
on and off for a specific

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.570
amount of time.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.260
I don't actually use this
that much anymore.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.040
Because now I can actually
control this

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.974
stuff from my phone.

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:39.040
I've got a specific app that's
called an Irrduino sprinkler

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.955
controller.

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:42.050
And this lets me send those
web commands that I talked

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.190
about to actually turn
on the sprinklers

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.600
from anywhere I want.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.400
I can be at work.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.550
I can be on vacation.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.450
I could be in the back of my
yard in the exact place where

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.470
I won't get wet when I
actually turn on the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.500
sprinklers.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100
So here's a real quick
demonstration of the app

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.960
running on my Galaxy
Nexus phone.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.000
This is a standard app.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.610
There is nothing specific
to my project about it.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.750
All I have to do is set a
specific time that I want a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.280
sprinkler to run and then push
a button to actually run that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.530
set of sprinklers.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.260
This uses asynchronous tasks to
send the internet commands.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.610
And it's all interrupt driven,
so I can turn it off at any

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.170
time or interrupt it and tell
it-- oh, actually I want the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.770
other side of the lawn
to be watered.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.910
And if I like, I can just shut
the whole thing down.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.140
OK.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.690
So let me give you a quick
demonstration of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.150
the Irrduino system.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.460
I've got my phone app-- my
Irrduino app-- running here.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.535
Inside the garage the control
is actually hooked up to the

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.120
valves on the sprinkler
system.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.440
And all I have to do to turn it
on is just push a button.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.470
[SPRINKLER SOUNDS]

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.040
So what's happening is I'm
sending a REST web command

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.930
from my phone through
the internet cloud.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.980
And it's hitting my controller
in the garage here.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.150
And it's activating the
solenoids to turn on the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.780
valves and throw water
on my lawn.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.410
And I can actually turn
it off too by just

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.870
pushing another button.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.000
JJ BEHRENS: Aside from an
Android application, we also

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.430
built in a web application
to control Irrduino.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.820
This is based on Python
and Google App Engine.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.300
You can select a particular zone
and water it for a set

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.840
number of minutes.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.260
You could also get system status
or turn off everything.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.380
The Log tab gives you a list
of all the recent sprinkler

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.390
runs executed by the Irrduino
controller.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.550
The Reports tab has
two reports.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.520
The first shows the number of
gallons used in each watering

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.030
zone per day.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.190
The second report shows
daily watering

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.880
cost across all zones.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.090
So we could see a dollar
amount per day.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.330
The About tab contains what
you might expect it to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.580
contain, along with one
little surprise.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.110
Rather than build another social
game, I decided to

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.750
build an application that would
have a more profound

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.140
impact on the world.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.110
This is a DART application
that actually

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.710
waters Joe's lawn.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.430
If I click on the lawn, the
Droid will fly over and

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.710
actually water the lawn for
a short amount of time.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.475
You could click on multiple
spots on the lawn, and it will

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.850
cue up the jobs.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.780
I sure hope there aren't
any kids out front.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.700
So thanks for checking
out Irrduino with us.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.620
