00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.730
It was to be one of the strangest chapters
in the storied history of the Beatles.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.340
In most Beatle controversies, John Lennon,
the most outspoken and controversial Beatle,

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.020
was usually at the bottom of it, but not this
time.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.420
George Harrison “The Quiet Beatle” brought
on the 1963-64 Jelly Bean controversy that

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.750
was to drive the Beatles batty.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.960
In a 1963 television interview, George told
the TV host that Jelly Babies were his favorite

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.520
treat and that John had “stolen his Jelly
Babies”.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.020
OK, no big deal, right?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.110
The Beatles were soon inundated by boxes of
Jelly Babies sent to them by their fervent

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410
fans, but that was to be expected.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.540
But within a few short days, when the boys
started taking the stage for their concerts,

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.550
their adoring worshipers started throwing
Jelly Babies onstage, almost as a sacrificial

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.880
offering, to please their idols.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.460
The sweet treats were thrown both “to”
and “at” the boys.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.550
The Beatles hated it right off the bat.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.570
In a rare letter from 1963 that George wrote
to a 15-year-old girl fan named Lynn Smith,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.670
George bluntly stated he and his band mates
thoughts and opinions on the subject:

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.659
We don’t like Jelly Babies, or fruit gums
for that matter, so think how we feel standing

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.870
on stage trying to dodge the stuff, before
you throw some more at us.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.570
…besides it is dangerous.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.049
I was hit in the eye once with a boiled sweet,
and it’s not funny.”

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.520
One can easily perceive George’s un-muted
anger at the proffered sweets.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
But that was in England, the worst was yet
to come.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.490
For those of you uninitiated, Jelly Babies
are soft little sweets, the British counterpart

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.790
to the American Jelly Beans, but much softer.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.651
The Beatles came to America in February of
1964 and probably felt relief that now that

00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:45.670
they were in the good old U.S.A., the Jelly
Baby tossing was over and done with.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.890
But it was about to get worse.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.729
In the Beatles first U.S. concert, in Washington
D.C. on February 11, 1964, the boys were again

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.940
pelted- but this time, by the much more bullet-like
Jelly Beans, again impelled by their devoted

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.940
fans.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.210
George was to relate the D.C. Jelly Bean tossing
to a New York reporter afterwards:

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.460
…that night we were absolutely pelted by
the f*****g things.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.470
They don’t have soft Jelly Beans there,
they have hard Jelly Beans.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.010
To make matters worse, we were on a circular
stage, so they hit us from all sides.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
Imagine waves of rock-hard little bullets
raining down on you from the sky… if Jelly

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.040
Beans traveling about 50 miles an hour through
the air hit you in the eye, you’re finished.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040
You’re blind, aren’t you?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.750
We’ve never liked people throwing stuff
like that.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.620
We don’t mind them throwing streamers, but
Jelly Beans are a bit dangerous, you see!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.020
… Every now and again, one would hit a string
on my guitar and plonk off a bad note as I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.099
was trying to play.”

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.160
Ringo, being the band’s drummer, had it
a bit easier than the others and was slightly

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.110
safer, as he could crouch and hide behind
his drum kit.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.680
Poor George, John, and Paul had to stand right
in the face of the fire, with no protection

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.540
other than their guitars.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.870
The Jelly Bean projectiles were to continue
throughout the Beatles’ first American tour.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.860
In fact, in August of ’64 at the Cow Palace
in San Francisco, the concert had to be stopped

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.360
twice because of the hail of Jelly Beans.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.660
A number of Jelly Bean tossing fans were thrown
out of the September 6th concert at the Olympia

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.120
Stadium in Detroit.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.530
After the concert, Paul said of the Jelly
Beans, “It has become a bit of a trademark

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.510
with our shows, but we’d prefer they’d
throw nothing at all.”

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.500
Fortunately for the fab four, the fad eventually
ran its course and the candy attacks slowly

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.500
dwindled out.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.500
And, who knows?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
Maybe the result of his off-the-cuff remark
about loving Jelly Babies was what caused

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:49.040
George to become “The Quiet Beatle”. 😉
