[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.970
JENNA TAYLOR: So today, we
are super excited to have

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.560
Jami Curl of Portland's QUIN.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.462
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:00:14.462 --> 00:00:15.670
JENNA TAYLOR: Candy is magic.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.880
And I think we've got the
modern-day Willy Wonka with us

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.379
today.

00:00:18.379 --> 00:00:20.278
So join me in welcoming
her to Google.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.094
JAMI CURL: Thank you.

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Thanks
for being here.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.838
JAMI CURL: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:26.838 --> 00:00:28.170
I'm happy to be here.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.920
JENNA TAYLOR: So what
are you going to do?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.570
JAMI CURL: Well,
I would like first

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.820
to just tell you a little bit.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.350
I'm sure you like have gathered
what we're doing here, which

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.460
is that at QUIN, and sort
of in my life philosophy,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.840
we make candy with real food.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.006
That's like the bottom line.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:46.630
So you have mass-produced
candy, which has chemically made

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.520
stuff taste like real food.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.980
But what we do with
candy is use real food

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.016
to make candy that tastes like
real, real food, essentially.

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:56.140
JENNA TAYLOR: And real
quality ingredients are core

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.610
to Google's food philosophy--

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.480
JAMI CURL: That's what I heard.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.255
JENNA TAYLOR: --which is
part of the reason we wanted

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:00.421
to partner with Jami, right?

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.709
We believe in like an 80/20
balance, healthy and indulgent

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:04.209
in life.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.010
So there's a place for candy.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.290
But we really believe it
should be the highest quality

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.460
ingredients, cared for
in the best possible way,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.800
and you'll get the most
delicious end product which I'm

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.280
pretty sure we're prove today.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.450
JAMI CURL: I hope so, yes.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.381
So throughout the
book, which is in front

00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.130
of some of you, which
is this book that we

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.360
have called "Candy is Magic"--

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.443
JENNA TAYLOR: And available
for sale in the back--

00:01:24.443 --> 00:01:26.620
JAMI CURL: --available
for sale in the back.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.930
And we use-- so what
we're going to do

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.480
is go through these
different recipes that

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.160
use the strawberry.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.265
You guys live in a great
place for strawberries.

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:38.420
JENNA TAYLOR: And it's about to
be strawberry time around here.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.920
So perfect.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.300
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.470
And that said, the recipes
we're going to do today,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.845
if you wanted to do this when
it wasn't strawberry time--

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:47.620
like in Oregon, strawberry
season is like two days long--

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.730
so for most of the year,
we get frozen strawberries

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.567
from farms that,
during harvest season,

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:55.150
harvest all the
strawberries, and then

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.060
freeze them for people
like me who then go and buy

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.530
big buckets of frozen
berries essentially.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.486
So the nice thing about it
is that any of the fruit

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:06.110
stuff that's in here, if you can
buy it frozen, you can use it.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.479
It totally goes right into
the recipes in the same way

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.020
that it does.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.680
JENNA TAYLOR: Good to know.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.060
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.518
The way that we do it, though,
to use real fruit to turn it

00:02:12.518 --> 00:02:15.490
into candy is that all the
fruit has to be roasted first

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.890
to remove some of the
moisture that's in the fruit

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.270
so that you can kind of
control the outcome of candy

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.149
a little bit better.

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.690
So that's where
we're going to start,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.560
which is essentially this
sort of roasted strawberry

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.510
with lemon.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.950
So we have here
some strawberries.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.800
This recipe is in the book.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.420
Oh, look, you're
following along.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.590
Good googler.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.340
Good googler.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.210
AUDIENCE: Page 37.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.530
JAMI CURL: Yes, it is
page 37 in the book.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.440
And essentially, this is super
easy, because all you're doing

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.490
is taking fruit, putting it on
a pan, adding some stuff to it,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.380
throwing it in the
oven, and allowing it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.810
to roast until it gets to--
this is perfectly done.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.180
This pan here is
a great example.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.510
It has some really
darkened edges on it.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.630
So you can tell the
strawberries have shrunk down.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.270
Obviously, what's left
there is a lot of very

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.730
intense strawberry
flavor, because you take

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.270
the strawberries
whole, fine, even

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.847
the big ones, like this giant
guy, you can leave it big.

00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:16.680
And then you put a
little lemon juice on it.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.970
And the lemon juice brightens
the flavor of the strawberries.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.260
And then you're going to
add sugar to it, as well,

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.635
and a little bit
of vanilla bean.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.725
Just a little.

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:28.350
JENNA TAYLOR: Is this
the kind of thing

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.030
you could do in advance
and then keep it

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.442
if you didn't have time
to do the whole recipe?

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:34.650
JAMI CURL: Say you are
growing your own strawberries,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.320
and you have the
strawberriest thumb of anyone

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.940
you know, and you have--

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.830
your 2017 harvest of
strawberries is very--

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.500
your yield is huge, you can
make this puree ahead and then

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.120
freeze it, and
then, you can make

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.150
with it, ice cream,
strawberry marshmallows,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.305
strawberry lollipops,
like a bazillion things.

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:54.930
So just keep it around
in your freezer.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.013
The other thing you can
do, which we'll talk about

00:03:57.013 --> 00:03:58.590
is you can keep it
in your freezer--

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.670
or your fridge for
a couple of weeks,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.800
but your freezer kind of
indefinitely-- and let it thaw.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.133
Then you can mix it into
yogurt, or your cottage cheese,

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:06.157
or anything that you
like berries mixed into.

00:04:06.157 --> 00:04:08.240
JENNA TAYLOR: So this is
going to become a kitchen

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.450
all-star for everyone.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.080
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.484
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.650
JAMI CURL: OK, so then you
put a little bit of sugar

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.344
on those berries.

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:18.010
And then there's a little bit of
vanilla bean that goes into it.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.470
And you would put that on there.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.520
And then this is a
little kitchen magic

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.520
because you would put
this into your oven that's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.630
been pre-heated.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.220
Are you ready for it?

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.720
Wait for it.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.050
And then magically, ta-da!

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.330
You have this.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.246
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:34.162
Right, yes.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:35.710
It is magic.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.180
It's definitely magic.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.390
So then once you
have these berries,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.219
you puree them in a blender.

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.510
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you want
all this good stuff in there?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.910
Or do you try to keep the
more caramelized parts out?

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.640
JAMI CURL: I'll tell you that
in the recipe in the book, when

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:56.220
you do puree it, you
basically put the berries in.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.864
And it depends upon the fruit.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:05:00.030
Not every fruit is the same
way, because some of it,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.060
you would strain out a
little bit of the juice,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.810
because it's going to
be too juicy to have

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.490
the candy turn out correctly.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.020
But these look good
enough to where

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.520
you would just put everything
that's on here in the blender,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.220
yes.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.140
OK, so that step is pretty easy.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.940
So I would like you all to
engage your imagination.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.460
I have put these berries
into the blender,

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.030
and I have turned it on.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.014
And I have let the blender
run for one full minute.

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.930
JENNA TAYLOR: It's an
extremely quiet blender.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.540
It's a new technology.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.360
JAMI CURL: Do you hear it?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.250
And then it turns into this.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.640
It's like a velvety,
delicious strawberry puree.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.030
Can everyone see it?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.850
OK, good.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.140
So then we'll save the
noise of the blender.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.697
So what we've got is we've put
the ingredients on the tray.

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:45.780
We've roasted the berries.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.779
They turn out like that.

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:47.580
It's beautiful.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.121
You put it in here,
and you blend it.

00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:52.530
And then voila, beautiful.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.350
So the first thing
that you can do

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.450
is make ice cream
if you wanted to.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.210
And I think everybody
likes ice cream.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.230
So in the book, there's a sort
of base recipe for vanilla bean

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.670
ice cream.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.010
And you can then--

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.360
if you're really following
along, this is on page 100.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.610
But you basically use this
easy vanilla ice cream base

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.500
to make a lot of
other ice creams,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.420
including strawberry ice cream.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.850
And it's super easy,
because all you're doing

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.450
is making a cream that
has vanilla bean in it,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.550
like mixing cream and
vanilla bean together,

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.280
sort of like these.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:37.849
And then you heat this
cream up in a pan,

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:38.890
which we'll do over here.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.600
It looks like a lot
of vanilla bean.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.210
And I'll tell you that I like
a lot of vanilla in everything

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.470
that I make--

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.060
cookies, cakes, everything.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.460
And I make like
pretty normal cookies.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.980
I used to own a
bakery, actually.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.042
And I baked for like nine
years as the owner of a bakery.

00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:58.000
And people were like,
the cookies are the best.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.980
You make the best
cookies in the world.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.020
And the real secret--
oh, thank you--

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.870
is that it just has a
lot of vanilla in it.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.860
So if you want to make like,
real world-class bakery

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.630
cookies, just add more vanilla
than the recipe calls for.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.024
And people will be like, this
is the most amazing thing

00:07:14.024 --> 00:07:16.008
I have ever had.

00:07:16.008 --> 00:07:20.137
And it's like, well thank you.

00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:21.470
JENNA TAYLOR: Secret ingredient.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.632
JAMI CURL: So
you've got this on.

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:27.590
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm glad
you know how to do that.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.360
JAMI CURL: They
gave me a lesson.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.480
JENNA TAYLOR: I
still don't ever.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.813
JAMI CURL: I was given a lesson.

00:07:30.813 --> 00:07:33.154
JENNA TAYLOR: I've
done this 100 times.

00:07:33.154 --> 00:07:34.820
JAMI CURL: OK, so
that actually leads me

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:35.670
to this really good thing.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.860
So you're all like,
you know, what I

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.120
don't have is a candy factory.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.840
So cool, we have this book now.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.680
But how are we going to have the
fancy stuff to make the candy?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.470
We don't use anything fancy
to make the candy at all.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.370
We use induction cooktops
and six human beings.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.600
And we make $20,000
lollipops in four days,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.560
like one person can
do that, because how

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.140
we run production is
we don't let anyone,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.030
A, have a choice over what candy
they make, which is terrible.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.050
It's not that good for morale.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.660
JENNA TAYLOR: But
it's all candy.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.510
JAMI CURL: It is all candy.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.993
And it's a very--

00:08:06.993 --> 00:08:08.460
JENNA TAYLOR: Is
there candy drudgery?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.293
JAMI CURL: A little.

00:08:09.293 --> 00:08:12.680
It's a very sweet
environment, yes.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.380
But it is really a great
idea production-wise--

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.920
and I'm sure all of you in
this room understand process

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.900
and the importance of it--

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.830
we establish a real expert
in one area of candy-making.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.980
So one person makes lollipops.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.740
And because that person does it
over, and over, and over again,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.630
then they turn into
this like human machine,

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.250
which is what I'm aiming for.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.469
So it's better than it sounds.

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:35.760
JENNA TAYLOR: Lollipop machine.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.710
JAMI CURL: Yes, yes.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.760
So that person can then
become so skilled at it

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.730
that when we get a giant order
for lollipops, we don't panic.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.170
Instead, it's like yes.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.140
We can handle this.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.610
We will make your 35,000
lollipops in two weeks

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.000
with one person doing
it, which is amazing.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.290
But we can do it.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.790
And it's because
of this repetition.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.900
So anyways, back to the, you
don't need a lot of equipment.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.270
So to make the candy, all the
recipes in the book, the most--

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.590
the trickiest thing
that is nice to have

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.000
is a thermometer, because
that helps with hard candy,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.860
gumdrops, and marshmallows.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.930
But the rest of
it, as you can see,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.324
it's just like stuff you
have around your kitchen.

00:09:14.324 --> 00:09:15.740
We're going to
look at this later.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.570
But this is a candy funnel.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.300
But you can use a glass
measuring cup instead of this.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.940
And I'll show you when we
get to the lollipop part.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.990
So it's not this huge
investment in a ton of equipment

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.700
that you only use
for candy-making.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.000
It's like you have a
pot, you have some bowls,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.170
you have a blender.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.000
Maybe you have an
ice cream maker.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.100
And then you don't really
need many other things.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.660
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the recipe you're making.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:39.437
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:09:39.437 --> 00:09:41.270
AUDIENCE: So there's a
lot of vanilla bean--

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.520
you have a lot of seed in there.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.145
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:44.900
AUDIENCE: Using
paste, vanilla paste?

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.570
JAMI CURL: We use vanilla
beans that have just

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.550
been put into a coffee
grinder and have been

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.230
pulverized, the whole bean.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.890
So the pod and the seeds inside.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.140
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.210
JAMI CURL: But you can
also scrape a vanilla bean

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.250
and put it in-- however
you choose to do it.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.230
AUDIENCE: So much more
flavor in the skin though.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.690
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.189
Yes.

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:02.210
Exactly, yes.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.570
OK, all right.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.940
So basically, to make the
vanilla ice cream base,

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.090
you get this cream heated up.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.204
And then you add sugar.

00:10:13.204 --> 00:10:14.120
And one really great--

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.142
JENNA TAYLOR: It does smell like
the most delicious ice cream

00:10:16.142 --> 00:10:16.870
base in the world.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:17.578
JAMI CURL: It is.

00:10:17.578 --> 00:10:19.490
The thing about it--

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.990
I'm sure that several
of you in here

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.280
have made ice cream before.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.806
And this isn't the type of
ice cream that you have eggs,

00:10:24.806 --> 00:10:27.180
and you're doing tempering,
and you're adding things to--

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:32.000
this is honestly just cream, and
fruit, and vanilla, and sugar.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.410
So it is totally
delicious because there's

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:37.340
so much fat in it.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.889
I was just saying on the--

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:43.430
JENNA TAYLOR:
High-quality fat is OK.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.080
JAMI CURL: I was just saying
on the way here in the car,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.180
that when you make the chocolate
ice cream that's in the book,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.560
it doesn't even
melt. You can let

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.250
it sit out for like two hours.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.960
And it's still the
shape of the scoop other

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.710
than it's like room
temperature ice cream,

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.871
when it's like a whole other
experience of ice cream

00:10:57.871 --> 00:10:58.370
totally.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:59.765
AUDIENCE: So you
really are Willy Wonka.

00:10:59.765 --> 00:10:59.910
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.050
She's totally Willy Wonka.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.646
She makes non-melting ice cream.

00:11:02.646 --> 00:11:03.520
JAMI CURL: Thank you.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:03.960
Thank you.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.460
JENNA TAYLOR: And
the secret is fat.

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.590
JAMI CURL: Yeah, well, yes.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.670
Isn't it to everything?

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.390
I swear.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:09.920
But I--

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.330
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:12.830
Yes.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.110
It is and it's
the texture of it,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.270
when you eat it right away
is like, totally delicious,

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.340
smooth, so creamy, and lovely.

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.810
But like a month from now, if
you keep it in your freezer,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.030
it won't have that same
feeling, because there's

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.520
nothing in it to extend the
life of it, no like xanthan

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.830
gum and all that
crummy stuff to keep

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.340
it to have the same mouthfeel.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.570
So when you do make this ice
cream, make it in the morning,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.070
put it in the freezer
so it hardens,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.800
and then serve it for
dinner that night.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.550
And none of the recipes
have a huge field,

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.680
so you don't have to
worry about having this--

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.260
I mean, there's no such
thing as too much ice cream,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.400
I don't think.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.462
So pretty easy that way.

00:11:47.462 --> 00:11:48.420
JENNA TAYLOR: Plus one.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.750
Totally agree.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.730
JAMI CURL: All right,
so once this is heated,

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.070
you add your sugar in.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.276
And this is like one of the tips
that I can give you on this.

00:11:58.276 --> 00:12:00.650
You're looking for the sugar
to melt. And one of the ways

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.710
to see that it's melted is if
you sort of pull the pan aside,

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.430
and then let some of the
cream drip off your spoon,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.180
then you can see if
it's dissolved or not.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.600
So you're just looking for
the sugar to become dissolved.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.610
And once it has dissolved, then
got this easy vanilla bean ice

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.460
cream base, which is what you
need to make strawberry ice

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.550
cream with.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.940
So if you're following along--

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.470
some of you are--

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.170
the strawberry ice
cream is page 102.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.970
So this is super easy
because then all you

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:32.930
need is this vanilla ice cream
base and some strawberry puree.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.580
And then you turn it into ice
cream, which is also awesome.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] powder?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.970
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.020
vanilla bean powder is
a great way to do it.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.320
And you make your own by
just putting a vanilla bean

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.790
in a coffee grinder.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.380
And even if you leave
the vanilla bean

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.730
out on your countertop
for a couple of days

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.855
so it dries a little bit,
if you have an especially

00:12:51.855 --> 00:12:53.907
sort of sticky one,
then you just put it, in

00:12:53.907 --> 00:12:54.740
and it grinds it up.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.954
But you can also buy
vanilla bean powder.

00:12:57.954 --> 00:12:59.370
Now listen, when
I wrote the book,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.157
vanilla bean powder
was around $50 a pound.

00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.740
You're not going to
buy a pound of it.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.550
You're going by a tiny bit.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.290
But then last week,
we got an email

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.623
from our person who we get
our vanilla bean powder from,

00:13:08.623 --> 00:13:13.050
and vanilla bean powder has
gone up to $285 a pound.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.915
So I--

00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:15.040
JENNA TAYLOR: Don't buy it.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.921
JAMI CURL: I didn't write
the book with the knowledge

00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:21.045
that it was that expensive.

00:13:21.045 --> 00:13:21.370
JENNA TAYLOR:
Gold-plated vanilla bean.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.800
JAMI CURL: So when
you get to that part

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.925
and then you go look it up
online, and you're like,

00:13:24.925 --> 00:13:28.970
this lady is insane, I'm
not actually that crazy.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.520
But it has become a--
it's a slight deterrent.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Vanilla
struggle is real these days.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:34.680
It's really intense.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.810
JAMI CURL: Yes, yes.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.230
OK, so doesn't that smell nice?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.450
And it's nice and hot.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.783
JENNA TAYLOR: It smells amazing.

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:42.740
JAMI CURL: So you've got
this vanilla bean cream

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:43.430
base that way.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.880
And you will chill it.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.510
And once it's
chilled, you magically

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.604
have this, which is that
that has been cooled down.

00:13:50.604 --> 00:13:52.770
It's a little bit brown in
color because the vanilla

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.910
has seeped all through it.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:01.190
And what you would do at that
point is you've got over here,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.930
honestly, you just
take this base--

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.530
who wants to come
with me to do this?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.071
You can come.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.690
And you add the
strawberry to it.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.790
Then you would mix
it all up, possibly

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.665
a whisk could be a
better job for that,

00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:27.010
a better tool for the job.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.551
AUDIENCE: Is that
just a single batch

00:14:28.551 --> 00:14:29.717
of the roasted strawberries?

00:14:29.717 --> 00:14:31.389
Is that about what
it would yield?

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:32.637
Any? how many?

00:14:32.637 --> 00:14:34.220
JAMI CURL: This is
sort of a sampling.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.110
But the bowl that
I had before, yeah.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.277
It's like between
a pint and a quart

00:14:41.277 --> 00:14:42.860
of the roasted
strawberries, depending

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.919
upon how much moisture you get
out of it, how big your berries

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:47.960
were, that kind of thing.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.100
Yeah.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.808
AUDIENCE: Did you
strain the strawberries

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:55.030
after you pureed it all?

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.130
JAMI CURL: Fruit-wise, it
depends upon the fruit,

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.960
because some strawberries
are super juicy,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.250
blackberries are a
super juicy fruit.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.050
Peaches are not as juicy.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:06.820
So if there's a ton--

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.805
in the recipes of the
book, it indicates,

00:15:08.805 --> 00:15:10.930
like this would be a good
time to strain some of it

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.760
out so that it's a
little bit more--

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.770
so you can control the
outcome of your candy.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.470
But some strawberries--
like this,

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.970
I wouldn't have strained the
strawberries that we have here,

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.010
just because they're--

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.380
you can sort of see there's
not a ton of liquid left.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.779
OK, all right.

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:33.070
So now that you've got the
strawberries and the vanilla

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.760
together, this is chilled.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.030
That's one important thing.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.830
And then you have your ice
cream machine attachment,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.186
or fancy countertop
ice cream compressor

00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:49.560
machine, which,
if you have that,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.519
I'll come over after this is
done and We'll make ice cream.

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.810
Or when you get done with work.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.674
Whenever.

00:15:54.674 --> 00:15:56.340
And then you're going
to add it in there

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:57.930
to your ice cream-maker.

00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.595
Let it's spin.

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:04.240
And basically, you're
just going to let

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.410
this go until it turns into
ice cream, which is never

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.080
a bad thing.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:16.682
And then, yes, from that
point, after this spins,

00:16:16.682 --> 00:16:17.640
put it in your freezer.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.740
Let it harden up so that
it's sort of scoopable.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.722
And then I would say, eat it
within the week or the day

00:16:24.722 --> 00:16:26.430
that you make it,
because you can't wait,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.265
because you know
it's so delicious.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.110
OK.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.621
So do we want to eat ice cream?

00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:37.620
We're going to wait to
the end to eat ice cream?

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.190
OK.

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.240
You can't have it yet, you guys.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.490
JENNA TAYLOR: You can have it.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.217
You just have to wait.

00:16:44.217 --> 00:16:46.800
JAMI CURL: One of the things--
that's actually a really good--

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.530
JENNA TAYLOR: You
have candy already.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.950
Eat your candy.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:48.840
JAMI CURL: You do have candy.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.240
One of the things that I
love about candy the most

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.750
and making all the things
that come from candy

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.900
is that it does teach
a lot about process.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.550
And it does teach you a lot
about patience, for sure.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.260
We're going to be
patient for ice cream.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.949
That's what I'm saying this.

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:08.490
All the recipes that
we make at QUIN,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.230
and all the candy
that you're enjoying,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.660
and everything in the
book, I made all of it up.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.230
And I didn't come like from the
candy company down the street

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:18.839
and get a new job, or like
make my own candy company up,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.700
because they wanted
to change the way--

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.720
I made it all up.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.270
I had a bakery for nine years.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.640
And that was a good time.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.910
It was fun.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.330
It was a lot of work, because
it was like a retail bakery.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:35.190
So every day, we had fresh
product, nothing day-old.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.260
Just a ton of work to do it.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.830
And I had 30 employees
in a couple of locations.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:45.720
And it was real
dedicated situation.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.120
And I started making
candy because I

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.440
was bored with cookies, and
cakes, and muffins, and scones,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.000
and morning stuff.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.850
So I made a batch of caramel.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.630
And it worked.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.630
And that was the thing--

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.300
I was like, OK, this is great.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.240
Like, you can cut it, and put
it in a wrapper, and sell it.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.592
So we sold it at the
counters of the bakery.

00:18:05.592 --> 00:18:07.050
And then the next
candy that I made

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.130
was a lollipop, which
we're going to make next.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.470
And the idea of taking
something that is a liquid

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.020
and transforming it into
something that holds up

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:23.040
on a stick, I was like,
I'm a wizard, because I

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.090
used real fruit in it.

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.770
And that's sort of
how the philosophy

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.145
behind the way
that we made candy

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:29.400
came into play, because
I did it all in a bakery.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.524
And there are strawberries.

00:18:30.524 --> 00:18:33.580
And here is like a refrigerator
full of fresh dairy products.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.240
And so it was easy
to come up with candy

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.180
that used the stuff that was
around me, A, I'm pretty cheap.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.950
And I don't like to
spend a lot of money

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.910
if I don't know something
is going to work.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.281
So I don't invest in a lot
of equipment or anything.

00:18:45.281 --> 00:18:45.780
You'll see.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.490
We do it all very, very by hand.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.452
So that is--

00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:49.910
JENNA TAYLOR:
Strawberry lollipops.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.451
JAMI CURL: Yes,
strawberry lollipops.

00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:54.012
JENNA TAYLOR: Using the
same strawberry puree?

00:18:54.012 --> 00:18:54.720
JAMI CURL: Right.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.230
So you have your
roasted strawberry puree

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.840
that you have put
in your refrigerator

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.190
or in your freezer.

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.480
And you made your ice cream.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.760
And now you think,
what else can I make?

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.420
And what else you can
make is candy, lollipops.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.480
So the strawberry
lollipop is beautiful,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.280
because we didn't
really strain any

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.670
of the seeds out of the puree
so that you can see them when

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.927
you hold it up to the light.

00:19:19.927 --> 00:19:21.510
You have the blackberry
lollipops now.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.020
So you can kind of get the feel
for what I'm talking about.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.810
So this is pretty
easy for candy making,

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:33.207
because you take sugar,
glucose, and water.

00:19:33.207 --> 00:19:34.290
And you add it to the pot.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.030
But I'm going to tell you
a little bit about glucose

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.870
before we do that.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.290
So glucose is this thing
called an interfering agent.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.900
And when you melt sugar-- which
you have to do with a little

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:46.410
bit of water so that it
will completely dissolve--

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.930
after that has happened,
sugar is always

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.827
fighting to turn
back into a crystal.

00:19:50.827 --> 00:19:52.410
So basically, what
candy-making really

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.134
is, is controlling sugar
from recrystallizing.

00:19:55.134 --> 00:19:56.550
That's like the
bottom line of it.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.479
So what glucose does is, say two
little bits of sugar in a pot,

00:20:02.479 --> 00:20:03.270
and they've melted.

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:06.480
But one is like, oh I really
liked being a crystal.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.520
And the other one is
like, I liked it, too.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.660
Let's form a gang.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.801
And so they come together,
and then they form a crystal.

00:20:13.801 --> 00:20:16.300
And then all the other sugars
are like, that's a great idea.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.597
I want to do it, too.

00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:18.930
And then they all recrystallize.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.320
But what the glucose does is it
comes right between those two

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.040
renegade bits of
sugar and interferes

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.270
in them crystallizing.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:31.630
So the glucose that
we use is French.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.700
So it's very fancy.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.355
JENNA TAYLOR: Super
fancy glucose.

00:20:34.355 --> 00:20:35.730
JAMI CURL: But
the reason that we

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.460
use it is because it
comes from Europe.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.160
So it's guaranteed
to be non-GMO.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.930
And it is basically
derived from the potato.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.460
So it's not corn syrup.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.190
It's not also potato
syrup, because by the time

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.140
it ends up as glucose,
which is essentially

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.050
like an invert sugar,
none of the parts

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.750
that made it exist anymore,
because it has been

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.310
so transformed into what it is.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.580
Yet, amazingly enough, it's
still a natural product.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.279
So we can use it.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:06.570
JENNA TAYLOR: And is that
something we just get online?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:06.990
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.950
You can buy it online.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.280
You can get it at any
cake-decorating store.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.384
Even like Michael's, the craft
store, in the Wilton aisle

00:21:14.384 --> 00:21:16.550
where they have the fondant,
and the little rollers,

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.925
and the cutters, and all that,
you can get it there, too.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.225
Do you have Chef's
Warehouse here?

00:21:23.225 --> 00:21:23.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.540
JAMI CURL: Anybody know about--

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:25.748
Do you have Chef's Warehouse?

00:21:25.748 --> 00:21:27.140
Do you have Chef's Warehouse?

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:27.765
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:27.765 --> 00:21:28.720
JAMI CURL: Yeah?

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.220
Yeah?

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.910
So you can do a will-call at
Chef's Warehouse where any

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.232
specialty product--

00:21:33.232 --> 00:21:35.690
as long as you pay for it ahead
of time and go pick it up--

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:38.360
you can get like any, even
5 gallons of olive oil

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.330
if you need to.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.150
But you can get
glucose through a--

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:41.210
Yeah.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.001
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:43.540
AUDIENCE: What
does it taste like?

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.331
JENNA TAYLOR: What does
glucose taste like?

00:21:45.331 --> 00:21:47.330
JAMI CURL: It doesn't
taste as sweet as sugar.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.773
Do you want to taste it?

00:21:48.773 --> 00:21:49.877
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:49.877 --> 00:21:51.710
JENNA TAYLOR: You know
you want to taste it.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.940
We have a tasting spoon.

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.814
Test them.

00:21:54.814 --> 00:21:56.480
JAMI CURL: And then
you can report back.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.320
JENNA TAYLOR: You
tell the group.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:57.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.853
JAMI CURL: You're welcome.

00:22:02.797 --> 00:22:04.770
AUDIENCE: It's like not
sweet pancake syrup.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:04.980
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.646
JENNA TAYLOR: Unsweetened
pancake syrup.

00:22:06.646 --> 00:22:09.620
JAMI CURL: It's the consistency
of like a syrup in general.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.220
Yes.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.840
So there you go so.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.540
Sugar and close
together equal sort of

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.970
like a medium-sweet thing.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.200
So if you were to eat--
like we have some candy that

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.030
we'll compare later--

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.800
to make mass
produced candy, they

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:26.020
use high-fructose corn
syrup and sucrose normally

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.310
as a combination.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.170
That is sweeter
than actual sugar.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.900
And that's one of the reasons
that mass-produced candy

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:37.760
is so addictive, because
it creates something that

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.250
is unnatural in the real
world, because it is actually

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:41.720
sweeter than sugar.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.370
We have some candy
side by side that we

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.830
can compare, especially
noticeable with the Starburst

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:49.580
and the strawberry Dreams
Come True side by side.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.100
It's amazing.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.660
To me it's amazing.

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.160
I mean, I'm also
like a total nerd.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:55.820
JENNA TAYLOR:
Let's go with that.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.781
I think "amazing" is
an appropriate word.

00:22:57.781 --> 00:22:59.030
JAMI CURL: It is amazing, yes.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:03.170
So we have in the pot,
sugar, the glucose, which

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.362
is not-sweet pancake syrup.

00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:07.570
JENNA TAYLOR: Technical term.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.720
JAMI CURL: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm--

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.220
and water.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.455
Then we turn it on.

00:23:22.455 --> 00:23:23.830
I know you guys
probably all know

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.847
how to use your stovetops
at home, how they turn on.

00:23:27.847 --> 00:23:28.680
JENNA TAYLOR: Maybe.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.205
Maybe not.

00:23:29.205 --> 00:23:30.150
JAMI CURL: Yes?

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:35.500
And so then at this point
what you want to do, is poke.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.670
Don't stir.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.740
And the reason you
poke and not stir

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.810
is because any unnecessary
agitation to the pot

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.750
could cause the
glucose to sort of lose

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:48.937
its footing in its
interfering process

00:23:48.937 --> 00:23:51.270
and could still result in
something that's crystallized.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.186
So you just sort of poke
it in until the sugar

00:23:53.186 --> 00:23:53.895
is uniformly wet.

00:23:53.895 --> 00:23:55.269
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's fascinating.

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:56.980
I hadn't heard that before.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.910
Poke, don't stir.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:58.576
JAMI CURL: Poke.

00:23:58.576 --> 00:23:59.740
Don't stir.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.600
If I could get a
tattoo of something,

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.652
that's what it would be.

00:24:03.652 --> 00:24:05.110
JENNA TAYLOR: A
pretty good tattoo.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.530
JAMI CURL: Well, OK.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:08.280
That's a good one.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.370
JENNA TAYLOR: You'd spend a
lot of explaining that one.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.485
It's really about candy-making.

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:11.740
I swear.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:12.830
JAMI CURL: See, it is.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.190
It is.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:17.555
As a 90-year-old--

00:24:17.555 --> 00:24:18.650
A good one, too.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:19.540
That's a-- yeah.

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.950
OK so we're poking it.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:24.910
And we're going to basically
put this over medium-high heat

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.860
and just let it come to a boil.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.320
And one of the good
things here is that--

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.100
this isn't a part of
the process to rush.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.430
You want to let it be
over medium-high heat

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:43.080
so that it will come to
temp, melt all the sugar,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.040
the glucose can
start doing its job,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.830
all work together like
that so that eventually you

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.710
come to a very nice
crystal-clear candy

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:52.070
at the very end.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:57.059
So let's let this
come up to a boil

00:24:57.059 --> 00:24:58.350
What do you want to talk about?

00:25:00.815 --> 00:25:02.190
JENNA TAYLOR: Put
me on the spot.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.470
I was watching.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.950
I wasn't coming up with ideas.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.154
No, is there some way
you could mess this up?

00:25:07.154 --> 00:25:07.820
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.340
JENNA TAYLOR: What
should we not do?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.339
JAMI CURL: OK, the first
thing you should not do

00:25:11.339 --> 00:25:12.530
is be afraid of it.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.700
That's the very first thing.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Don't be scared.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:16.888
JAMI CURL: Don't be scared,
because the making candy is not

00:25:16.888 --> 00:25:19.520
unlike making like a pot
of soup or some tomato

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.930
sauce for your pasta.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.940
All you're doing is putting
ingredients in a pot

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.840
and heating it up.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.580
It's easy.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.029
The thing that
scares most people

00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:28.820
is like the part where
you get to the point

00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.980
where you have to
use a thermometer.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.520
So to be honest,
accuracy is really

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.940
great in candy-making, which
is why we weigh everything.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.560
Everything is sort
of done by the gram

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.431
so that it's very, very
precise, because it

00:25:41.431 --> 00:25:42.430
helps with your outcome.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:44.138
And what I don't want
to do is like write

00:25:44.138 --> 00:25:48.110
a book that has like, a little
of this, a little of that.

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.510
And then it doesn't turn
out for the home reader.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.760
I don't know about you, but
I read a lot of cookbooks.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.170
JENNA TAYLOR: Super frustrating.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.730
JAMI CURL: And I get very
frustrated when you've

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.770
spent the time and
the money, and you

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:00.131
have invested this part
of yourself to do it,

00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:01.130
and it doesn't turn out.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.257
So I like to be very precise.

00:26:03.257 --> 00:26:05.840
JENNA TAYLOR: It's appreciated
from the consumer side, surely.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.715
JAMI CURL: Well, yes.

00:26:06.715 --> 00:26:09.310
But then you get people who
are like, why is it so fluffy?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.930
JENNA TAYLOR:
Because it's candy.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.650
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.000
JENNA TAYLOR: It's like science.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:14.804
Be precise.

00:26:14.804 --> 00:26:16.220
JAMI CURL: Yes so
don't be afraid,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.010
because that will be your first
step in sort of messing it up,

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.760
because you're just
defeating yourself

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.019
by starting out scared.

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.060
JENNA TAYLOR: Olivia has
a question really quick.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.420
JAMI CURL: Yes?

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.713
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:26:27.713 --> 00:26:30.390
So last two times I
made caramel or toffee,

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.030
I literally burned
myself really badly,

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.700
because I just can't remember
that the candy is hot,

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.356
because it doesn't
steam or anything.

00:26:38.356 --> 00:26:39.877
So how do remember?

00:26:39.877 --> 00:26:41.960
JENNA TAYLOR: How do you
remember your candy's hot

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.084
so you don't burn yourself?

00:26:43.084 --> 00:26:44.930
AUDIENCE: Like on my
arm, it's really bad.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.602
JAMI CURL: Whoa, OK.

00:26:46.602 --> 00:26:47.810
JENNA TAYLOR: No, It's funny.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:49.475
Actually, the first time
I ever made caramel,

00:26:49.475 --> 00:26:50.433
it looked so beautiful.

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:52.100
I was like, oh totally
burned my finger.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.724
JAMI CURL: While it
was inside the pot?

00:26:53.724 --> 00:26:55.857
JENNA TAYLOR: No, like
after I laid it out.

00:26:55.857 --> 00:26:56.690
JAMI CURL: Oh, yeah.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:59.030
That's really-- I mean it
takes a long time to cool.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.260
So it is very hot.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.240
We should make something--
a sign for you.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.470
JENNA TAYLOR: The answer
is we'll make you a sign.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:07.980
JAMI CURL: Yes, like hot.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.460
JENNA TAYLOR: Watch out.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:08.960
It's hot.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.479
JAMI CURL: Hot, hot,
hot pan, hot something,

00:27:12.479 --> 00:27:13.520
because that's the thing.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.186
Maybe just get it
sort of into your head

00:27:15.186 --> 00:27:17.180
that it actually does
take a long time to cool.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.220
The caramel that we
make, we actually

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.635
usually let it cool
overnight before we cut it.

00:27:21.635 --> 00:27:23.510
And it's not because
it's hot the whole time,

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.301
but it actually just
helps in setting it up

00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:26.482
so it's easier to cut.

00:27:26.482 --> 00:27:27.440
But we pour it into a--

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.314
JENNA TAYLOR: But we're
back to patience now.

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.180
JAMI CURL: Yes, we are, which
is one of the best teaching

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.250
tools about candy is patience.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.710
Trust the process
and be patient.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.380
OK, is that helpful?

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.880
Do you want me to come over?

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.924
AUDIENCE: Yes, I do.

00:27:41.924 --> 00:27:42.950
I have induction.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:43.700
JAMI CURL: You do?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:44.409
I like induction.

00:27:44.409 --> 00:27:46.116
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you
induction and an ice

00:27:46.116 --> 00:27:47.012
cream-making machine?

00:27:47.012 --> 00:27:50.420
Now you're stacking
up the reasons.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.149
JAMI CURL: All right, and then
what else can you mess up?

00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:55.940
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.773
What else do not do?

00:27:56.773 --> 00:27:58.310
JAMI CURL: Undercooking.

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.830
I wouldn't undercook the candy.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.820
We're going to cook this to
a temperature of 315 degrees.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.770
That doesn't mean
like 310 because it

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.326
got like close enough to 315.

00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:10.450
JENNA TAYLOR: It means 315.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.325
JAMI CURL: Yeah, 315.

00:28:11.325 --> 00:28:13.940
But if you go over,
that's going to be OK.

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.055
So that's like the
thing, 315 for sure.

00:28:16.055 --> 00:28:17.930
But if you stick your
thermometer in the pot,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.676
and you see it's like
319, that doesn't

00:28:20.676 --> 00:28:22.550
mean you should throw
away what you're doing.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.460
Just proceed and be confident.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.896
JENNA TAYLOR: But if it
says 310, keep going.

00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:30.020
JAMI CURL: Keep going, yes.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.040
JENNA TAYLOR: Be
committed to the temp.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:31.520
JAMI CURL: Exactly.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.090
Yes.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.760
commit to the 315, exactly.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.530
JENNA TAYLOR: So
don't be afraid.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.120
Don't undercook it.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.880
What else?

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.601
Keys to success.

00:28:41.601 --> 00:28:42.850
JAMI CURL: Don't undercook it.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:50.620
And while you're waiting
for your candy to cook,

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.660
swirl the pot.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:54.432
JENNA TAYLOR: So
poke, don't stir.

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:54.932
Swirl.

00:28:54.932 --> 00:28:57.010
JAMI CURL: And
after the sugar has

00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:58.540
become sort of
uniformly wet and you

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.490
have it boiling a little
bit, just swirl the pot.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:04.000
Swirl it.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.680
JENNA TAYLOR: Gently give the
pot a little wax on, wax off.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.500
JAMI CURL: And that's mostly
to distribute the heat

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.630
so that when you go to
take the temperature,

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:11.680
you're taking a
temperature that's

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.480
hopefully uniform
throughout the whole pot.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.320
JENNA TAYLOR: So this
is the kind of thing

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.730
you should not walk away from.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.855
JAMI CURL: Well, you know,
I was just going to say,

00:29:17.855 --> 00:29:21.694
while this is cooking, you
could do this one other thing.

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:23.610
JENNA TAYLOR: As long
as it doesn't boil over.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:25.859
JAMI CURL: This doesn't mean
like go to the other room

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:28.090
and switch the clothes from
the washer to the dryer.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.840
I don't mean that.

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.170
I mean you could go--

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.040
JENNA TAYLOR: Stand
right here near it,

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.220
so you can still see it.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.660
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.040
There's two ways to sort
of shape the lollipops

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.180
once you have the syrup cooked.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.670
You can use molds.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.070
Or you can use a nonstick mat.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.900
So the nonstick
is how we started

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.990
making all of the candy,
all the lollipops at QUIN.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.930
We did not have molds at all.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.820
The mold costs
around like $1.15.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.990
This is how crazy am.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:57.640
But I would not
buy them, because I

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.380
was like, who knows if
these lollipops will work.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.200
Let's just do it on
the nonstick mats.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.980
So you can kind of see this
organic shape in the book.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.010
The cover of the book features
perfectly molded lollipops.

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:13.690
But the lollipops, say, on page
118, are more organic in shape

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.120
because those have just
been poured out on a mat.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.570
So while this is coming
to tamp, what you could do

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.045
is take your lollipop sticks
and set them out on your mat

00:30:23.045 --> 00:30:25.420
so that they're ready to have
the candy poured over them.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:30.335
Or you could fill your
mold with the sticks

00:30:30.335 --> 00:30:31.210
while you're waiting.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.560
AUDIENCE: In a
mat like a Silpat?

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.643
JAMI CURL: Yeah, a Silpat.

00:30:33.643 --> 00:30:34.400
Yep, exactly.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.296
Super easy.

00:30:35.296 --> 00:30:36.670
You can sort of
fill it in there.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.320
And you know what
makes it even easier

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.830
is if you grab a piece
of parchment paper

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.237
and take something
that's 1 and 1/2 inches

00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:45.070
round, because that's
around the size that's

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.000
kind of nice for your mouth.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.262
Use a Sharpie and draw
those circles spread out

00:30:49.262 --> 00:30:49.970
on the parchment.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.970
Then put the Silpat
over the top of it.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.190
Then place the stick
sort of in the circle.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:55.780
Then you have like
a guide so that

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.819
you don't make like an
unwrappable, giant--

00:30:57.819 --> 00:30:59.110
I mean, you can make huge ones.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.610
No problem.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.342
It's just a little
harder to wrap those.

00:31:01.342 --> 00:31:02.300
Can you guys hear this?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.260
This is actually
really good advice.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:08.360
If you're going to pour your
lollipops out on a Silpat,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.870
Jami was saying you can draw
circles on parchment the size

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.009
you want, put the
parchment under your Silpat

00:31:13.009 --> 00:31:15.550
so you have kind of a guide as
you're pouring out your candy.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.466
Yeah, because you can
see, it through the mat.

00:31:17.466 --> 00:31:19.850
And it makes it where
you have a guide--

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.056
for size, exactly.

00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:22.180
So you could do big, small.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.360
But cellophane, which is
what we wrap the candy in,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.050
like you've seen it, you can
get it in all various sizes.

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.300
So just make sure the lollipop
size you're making sort

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.570
of matches the cellophane
that you're going to use.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.175
We use like between
4 and 5 inches.

00:31:36.175 --> 00:31:38.716
AUDIENCE: Are the lollipops too
sticky to just do it directly

00:31:38.716 --> 00:31:39.704
on the parchment paper?

00:31:39.704 --> 00:31:40.370
And that's why--

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:41.310
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.690
Yes, yes, yes.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.441
They're almost too sticky even
just for the regular lollipop

00:31:47.441 --> 00:31:47.940
mold.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.481
The funny thing
about a lollipop mold

00:31:49.481 --> 00:31:52.840
is the first time-- you
buy a mold like this,

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.130
you get it on the internet.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.150
And it's around $1.15.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.734
And you get it you get
your first one in the mail,

00:31:58.734 --> 00:31:59.650
and you're like sweet.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:01.930
And you make your candy, and it
does not come out of the mold

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:02.460
at all.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.186
And you're like, what did I do?

00:32:04.186 --> 00:32:06.310
So then you're like, well,
maybe I'll oil the mold.

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.180
So you oil the mold.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.550
And then it comes out and
then you clean the mold.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.910
And then every lollipop you make
after that always comes out.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.700
It's like they just need like
they need to be broken-in.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:16.500
JENNA TAYLOR: They
need to be cured.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.820
JAMI CURL: Yeah, you have
to cure the lollipop mold.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:19.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Good to know.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.183
JAMI CURL: So these
will all come out.

00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:24.190
But we have had a lot
of sticky, sticky stuff.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.910
OK.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.743
So the same thing that
we're doing right now

00:32:26.743 --> 00:32:29.260
is used for a lot of
the lollipop recipes

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.490
throughout the book.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.130
OK, one other thing--

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.470
maybe you can see--

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.190
if you get a little sugar that's
stuck to the side of your pot

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.200
and you want to just
poke it down in, you can.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.990
You could use a pastry brush
dipped in a little water

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.950
to do that.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:48.350
Or you could just sort
of not be afraid of it,

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.110
and let it do its thing.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:54.370
So it's been boiling or
bubbling for a little while.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:33:00.190
So we could take the temperature
of it to see where it's at.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:05.080
If we got to choose
superpowers in life,

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.600
I would like to be able to
tell temperature with my eyes.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.250
I would also like to
hold things in my hand

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.840
and know how much they weigh.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.330
If we're talking about what
our dreams are, those are mine.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.340
So this is around 225 degrees.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.430
And it's been cooking
for what, 8 minutes?

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.388
JENNA TAYLOR: Not even.

00:33:27.388 --> 00:33:28.320
Probably 5.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.920
JAMI CURL: OK, all right.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.010
JENNA TAYLOR: So how
long does it take

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.920
to make a batch of lollipops?

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.480
Is this an afternoon?

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:42.980
An hour?

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.021
JAMI CURL: Oh, an afternoon
from start to finish.

00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:45.637
Yes?

00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:47.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:49.938 --> 00:33:51.354
JENNA TAYLOR: A
little bit louder.

00:33:51.354 --> 00:33:52.626
AUDIENCE: Do you use
a candy thermometer?

00:33:52.626 --> 00:33:53.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you
use a candy thermometer?

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.526
JAMI CURL: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:54.526 --> 00:33:56.750
Well this is like a digital
thermometer that goes up

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.200
to 400 degrees, I think.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200
My preferred brand is the
ThermoPop from ThermoWorks.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.820
But you can use any--

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.910
it doesn't have to be like
a big candy thermometer

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.590
that like sticks on
the side of the pot.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.923
JENNA TAYLOR: Can it be, though?

00:34:10.923 --> 00:34:13.280
JAMI CURL: Well, I actually--
those, you can use.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.281
But I would say, don't
say don't let it just

00:34:15.281 --> 00:34:17.239
sit on the side of the
pot, because then you're

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.630
just taking the temperature
from one area in the pot.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.250
I like to be able to sort of
swirl the pot a little bit,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:25.458
and then take the temperature
directly in the middle.

00:34:25.458 --> 00:34:26.940
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:27.716
Noted.

00:34:27.716 --> 00:34:29.090
JAMI CURL: We
actually teach when

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.340
we hire new people at
Quinn which is actually

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.960
not that often, thankfully.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.719
We teach like a whole afternoon
of temperature-taking,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.279
because everybody
on the team has

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:40.820
to do it the same way or else
we have all different outcomes.

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.630
So they hate me, because I'm
like, OK today's the day.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.882
Get you thermometers.

00:34:45.882 --> 00:34:47.090
JENNA TAYLOR: It's important.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.048
JAMI CURL: Yeah, it is.

00:34:48.048 --> 00:34:49.550
It is.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.449
Yeah.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.600
So obviously, the side
of your pot it hot.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.060
Don't stick your hand down in
there, because it is boiling.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:01.190
One thing that about it is that
because it has sugar in it,

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.740
it's sticky.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.620
So if it does get
on your skin, it's

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.610
not as easy as it is to wipe
boiling water off yourself,

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:08.900
because it will stick to you.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.050
So take care of that.

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:13.752
OK, we're going.

00:35:13.752 --> 00:35:14.377
We're going.

00:35:14.377 --> 00:35:14.960
OK, what else?

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.024
Do we have questions?

00:35:17.024 --> 00:35:18.000
Yes.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.808
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
to the point,

00:35:25.808 --> 00:35:29.170
do you take it off
[INAUDIBLE] before or right

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.030
when it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.613
JAMI CURL: No.

00:35:30.613 --> 00:35:31.877
315 for sure.

00:35:31.877 --> 00:35:34.460
315 for certain, because you're
going to take it off the pot--

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.070
I mean, you're going to
take the pot off the stove.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:39.500
And then you're going to add
to it the strawberry puree

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.080
and a little bit of strawberry
flavoring, and whisk it.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.010
So that will cool it down.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.910
JENNA TAYLOR: Commit to 315.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.180
Let it get all the way there.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.942
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:35:49.942 --> 00:35:51.400
JENNA TAYLOR: What
other questions?

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.775
AUDIENCE: Let's
say you do happen

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:55.990
to get sugar on yourself, what
is the best way to get it off?

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.400
JAMI CURL: Go to the sink, and
put water on it right away.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.240
JENNA TAYLOR: ASAP.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:00.906
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:36:00.906 --> 00:36:01.927
AUDIENCE: You will cry.

00:36:01.927 --> 00:36:03.010
JAMI CURL: What'd you say?

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:03.990
AUDIENCE: You will cry.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:05.530
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:06.390
He will cry.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.111
Yes?

00:36:07.111 --> 00:36:09.075
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to burn [INAUDIBLE]??

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:15.780
JAMI CURL: What
was the question?

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.363
JENNA TAYLOR: Is it
easy to burn this,

00:36:17.363 --> 00:36:20.430
because sugar without the
glucose burns really easily?

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.090
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.480
I mean, you would notice
that it's becoming burned,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.130
because it will
change from being

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.400
clear to becoming caramelized.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.130
So if you did walk away, and you
came back, and you saw the pot,

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.088
and you see that it's
caramelized a little bit,

00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:36.930
then you're getting
close to burning it.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.570
So yes, definitely possible.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:45.690
JAMI CURL: It's time that it's
on the heat and temperature.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.180
This, we're going
to cook this to 315.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.400
When you want something
that's really deep and richly

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.650
caramelized, it's only 330, 335.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.146
So there's not a
huge difference.

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.520
JENNA TAYLOR: So
the neighborhood

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.990
of burning this is
only like 15 degrees.

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.470
JAMI CURL: Yes, exactly.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.269
JENNA TAYLOR: Fair.

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:03.810
Anybody else?

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.345
Because we got like 90
degrees to go on this thing.

00:37:07.345 --> 00:37:08.554
JAMI CURL: We do.

00:37:08.554 --> 00:37:09.785
AUDIENCE: We're going
to pass out ice cream.

00:37:09.785 --> 00:37:10.340
JAMI CURL: Oh, good.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:10.839
OK.

00:37:10.839 --> 00:37:12.540
JENNA TAYLOR: Ice cream!

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.810
Great, thanks, chef.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:14.681
JAMI CURL: Great.

00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:15.472
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:37:15.472 --> 00:37:18.118
AUDIENCE: How quickly should
you eat your [INAUDIBLE] candy?

00:37:18.118 --> 00:37:18.894
Do they stay--

00:37:18.894 --> 00:37:21.060
JENNA TAYLOR: How quickly
should you eat your candy?

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.643
JAMI CURL: With our retail-- we
sell candy across the country.

00:37:23.643 --> 00:37:24.960
And we say six months.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.400
The marshmallow recipes
that are in the book,

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.200
less they are better
within about eight weeks,

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.340
because they are--

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.820
fresh marshmallows are like
just the most delicious thing.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.720
So we do recommend
eating them quickly.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.440
But the rest of the candy
is around six months.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.860
It's not that it goes bad.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.500
It's just that it's the most
enjoyable within six months.

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.744
JENNA TAYLOR: That's
a good amount of time.

00:37:51.744 --> 00:37:53.910
JAMI CURL: I can tell you
this one thing about candy

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:55.110
that I like to tell people.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:55.985
JENNA TAYLOR: Please.

00:37:55.985 --> 00:37:59.580
JAMI CURL: When you notice
that sugar is crystallizing--

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.780
so if you have ever had
a roll of Lifesavers,

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.570
and you've kept the Lifesavers
in your bag or your pocket

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.890
or whatever, and you open
the package a little more,

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:11.370
and you notice that the
one or the two on top

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.320
have sort of a
white crust on them,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.440
that is sugar recrystallizing.

00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.330
It doesn't take a lot.

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.330
And it's just that the package
of Lifesavers has been opened.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.280
So the candy can absorb
moisture from the atmosphere

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.350
or whatever it is.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.020
Yeah, it's pretty dry here
most of the time, right?

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:29.400
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, ish.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.040
JAMI CURL: Ish?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.580
Because we made candy in
Portland, and because it

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.680
rains all the time.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:36.570
So we do have dehumidifiers
in our kitchen

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:38.490
just to keep moisture
out of the air.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.020
But you will always
have better luck

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.890
with hard candy on
a dry day than you

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.000
do on a really wet day.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.610
JENNA TAYLOR: Like a macaron.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:44.245
JAMI CURL: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:44.245 --> 00:38:46.161
JENNA TAYLOR: Can't make
them when it's humid.

00:38:46.161 --> 00:38:47.934
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:50.100
AUDIENCE: Growing up, did
you have a favorite candy?

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.090
JENNA TAYLOR: What was your
favorite candy growing up?

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:51.923
JAMI CURL: Oh, yeah.

00:38:51.923 --> 00:38:53.670
I loved all candy.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.030
But it depended upon if I
had to buy the candy myself

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.459
or if someone else
was buying it.

00:38:58.459 --> 00:39:00.000
If someone else was
buying the candy,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.090
I would always choose like
chocolate, delicious candy bars

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:06.270
that were all caramel chocolate,
cookie-type crunchy stuff.

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.740
If I was buying the
candy with my own money,

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.950
I always bought something
that lasted a long time,

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.090
because I was like--

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.780
the economics of it, I'm like,
I want either a jawbreaker,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.900
because they lasted forever,
or Fun Dip, because it seemed

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.050
to me, you get like, three
sticks of candy and the powder.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.700
And it was just--

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:25.440
seemed like a better deal.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.577
JENNA TAYLOR: I love that
that's your perspective.

00:39:27.577 --> 00:39:28.410
JAMI CURL: Oh, yeah.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.127
I like economized
everything as a child.

00:39:30.127 --> 00:39:31.460
JENNA TAYLOR: Well you still do.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:32.200
You were talking about--

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:32.400
[LAUGHS]

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.524
JAMI CURL: Yeah, it's true.

00:39:33.524 --> 00:39:35.890
Books, like if I had to buy
a book with my own money,

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:37.590
I would buy the
longest book, because I

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:38.950
was, like this is worth--

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:41.860
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a good
investment in your time.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:42.560
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:42.860
JENNA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.430
JAMI CURL: Yeah, and you
get more for your money

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:45.240
with a longer book.

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] now
that we're [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:49.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Ice
cream-related questions now

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.370
that you're eating ice cream?

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:51.036
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:39:51.036 --> 00:39:52.974
JENNA TAYLOR: Sure.

00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.890
AUDIENCE: Do you know
what the fat content is?

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:55.540
JAMI CURL: No.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.830
AUDIENCE: Do you know
what the fat content is?

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.871
JAMI CURL: Whatever the--

00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:59.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.870
JAMI CURL: Yeah, this
is like a definite,

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.910
I would say, cheat on ice cream.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.534
It's just to kind of show
you the possibilities.

00:40:06.534 --> 00:40:08.200
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
frozen deliciousness.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.866
JAMI CURL: Yes, so
you could technically

00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:13.420
make all of the fruit
purees in the book

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.730
and just use those in
any ice cream recipe

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.930
that you like to make.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:19.044
So this is like--

00:40:19.044 --> 00:40:21.085
JENNA TAYLOR: So if you
have an ice cream recipe,

00:40:21.085 --> 00:40:23.680
you can still just add the fruit
puree and do the same thing.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.550
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.790
Yes.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:25.706
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:40:25.706 --> 00:40:26.350
Great.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.295
So if you have a favorite,
do that, add the puree.

00:40:29.295 --> 00:40:30.100
I like that.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.891
JAMI CURL: Exactly.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.309
JENNA TAYLOR: This
thing is like inching.

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:36.308
JAMI CURL: It really is.

00:40:36.308 --> 00:40:37.880
JENNA TAYLOR:
Inching up the chain.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.130
JAMI CURL: It's really trying.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.720
But we can also just, if
we wanted to skip ahead,

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.060
we could fake the
end of it probably.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.420
So yes, what's going to
happen once this does reach

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:52.970
the proper temperature is
we're going to add fruit

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.622
and in a little bit
of strawberry flavor.

00:40:56.622 --> 00:40:58.830
JENNA TAYLOR: Talk to us
about the strawberry flavor.

00:40:58.830 --> 00:40:59.900
JAMI CURL: OK, I will.

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.570
So we have our flavors
formulated for us

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.060
by a natural food producer
that is actually located here

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.180
in California.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:09.400
And so we buy it in very,
very large quantities.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.410
And it's all made
with fruit extracts.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.440
And the same with any of the
candy that has like a color

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:20.340
added to it, we use,
it's like, beet powder,

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.120
turmeric-- those types of
things that are all natural.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:28.790
So you can find online
a natural flavoring.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.290
You just need to
make sure that it's

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.790
suitable for high-heat
applications.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.789
JENNA TAYLOR: Thank you.

00:41:32.789 --> 00:41:34.020
JAMI CURL: Oh, thank you.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.588
Yeah.

00:41:35.588 --> 00:41:37.713
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
recommended online retailer

00:41:37.713 --> 00:41:39.629
for consumers?

00:41:39.629 --> 00:41:42.670
JAMI CURL: To get this stuff?

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:44.920
It depends upon--
you can get all of it

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.010
on Amazon if you wanted to.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.870
I mean, it's easy.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:53.520
Or there is a place in Las
Vegas called Chef Rubber or Chef

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:54.310
"Rub-air."

00:41:54.310 --> 00:42:01.150
And they sell every like cake,
candy, mold, tool, ingredients,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:03.920
like all sorts of stuff.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.520
But I would bet that in
this area of the world,

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.520
there's probably some sort of
amazing wholesaler of this type

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.770
of stuff that you can shop at.

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:14.177
I'm sure of it.

00:42:14.177 --> 00:42:15.510
JENNA TAYLOR: This is delicious.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.135
AUDIENCE: The only
fear with wholesales

00:42:17.135 --> 00:42:18.920
is you have to buy
wholesale quantities.

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.840
JAMI CURL: It's not usually
like Costco, because usually you

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.220
can get a small amount.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.100
I mean, you can get like
one bucket of glucose

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.156
or one little bag
of cocoa powder,

00:42:27.156 --> 00:42:29.030
because they won't make
you buy a case of it.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.890
They'll break up a case for you.

00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:39.246
AUDIENCE: For your caramels,
do you measure the temperature?

00:42:39.246 --> 00:42:40.210
Or [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.830
JAMI CURL: No. that's
a great question.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.780
We do it by sight.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:44.980
JENNA TAYLOR: So do you
measure the temp of caramel

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.775
or do it by sight?

00:42:45.775 --> 00:42:46.400
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.770
So it's the one
candy in the book

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.480
that I don't use
a thermometer for,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.220
because I have found,
in teaching people

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.160
how to make caramel
at work, that panic

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.560
sets in around the
time the sugar starts

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.850
to reach the done point.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:00.900
And people go crazy.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.020
So I figured out
that if we eliminate

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:07.340
trying to move the pot to keep
the hot spots moving around

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.730
and eliminate the idea of trying
to swirl it, hold the blah,

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.539
freak out, to teach
people to do it by color.

00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:15.080
So in the book,
there's a color chart

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.180
that sort of shows
where it starts out

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.420
and the journey that it takes to
being slightly cooked, halfway

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.970
there, completely finished,
and then the point that you

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.420
add the cream and butter.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:26.240
So it's all done by sight.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.910
And the color that we aim for
sort of like a dirty copper

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.260
penny to be finished.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.909
And then you remove the sugar
from the heat, add the fats.

00:43:34.909 --> 00:43:36.950
Some of the recipes in
the book use coconut milk.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.075
But it's usually heavy
cream, butter at that point.

00:43:39.075 --> 00:43:40.259
And then you whisk it.

00:43:40.259 --> 00:43:41.675
AUDIENCE: So you're
ideally trying

00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:45.222
to get one specific color,
not like a little range.

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:45.930
JAMI CURL: Right.

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.176
One specific color
throughout the pot.

00:43:49.176 --> 00:43:52.580
AUDIENCE: Do you typically use
stainless steel or [INAUDIBLE]??

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.770
JAMI CURL: For caramel,
we use stainless steel,

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.710
but only because
it's less expensive.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:02.959
But so many candy makers
use big copper pots for it.

00:44:02.959 --> 00:44:04.500
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a quick question?

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:04.830
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:05.311
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:44:05.311 --> 00:44:07.769
AUDIENCE: The little grainy
bits in [INAUDIBLE],, are those

00:44:07.769 --> 00:44:10.130
from strawberries [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:11.270
JAMI CURL: I don't know.

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:14.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.770
AUDIENCE: Strawberries.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.444
JENNA TAYLOR: Strawberries.

00:44:18.444 --> 00:44:19.860
AUDIENCE: I think
it's strawberry.

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.860
JENNA TAYLOR: It's the
strawberry, I think.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.520
JAMI CURL: Yes, strawberry.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.090
I believe so.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.460
Maybe the vanilla--
the strawberry, though.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.340
JENNA TAYLOR: Seems
like the strawberry.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:29.680
JAMI CURL: Strawberry.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.179
Yeah.

00:44:40.657 --> 00:44:42.240
Two days from now,
this will be ready.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:42.690
JENNA TAYLOR: Right?

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:43.356
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:44:43.356 --> 00:44:45.640
OK, so maybe what we're
going to do is pretend now.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.600
We're going to stick to the--

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:46.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Kitchen magic.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.630
JAMI CURL: This
is like TV magic.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.260
Oh, my gosh.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.170
This thermometer said 315.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.790
So this is all done.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:58.080
So at this point, what you'll
want to do is, it's at 315.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:59.610
You turn your heat off.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.730
You remove your
pot from the heat.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.000
And you take your--
well, you get a whisk.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.125
You have your whisk.

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:07.380
You add your flavoring.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.205
You add the puree.

00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:26.150
What was that?

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.629
JAMI CURL: Strawberry.

00:45:28.629 --> 00:45:30.420
JENNA TAYLOR: Natural
strawberry flavoring.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:33.220
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.890
Made for high-heat applications,
if you're shopping for it.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:38.500
And then you get those
two things in there,

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:39.927
and you whisk this together.

00:45:39.927 --> 00:45:41.260
JENNA TAYLOR: It smells amazing.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.100
JAMI CURL: Doesn't it?

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.230
JENNA TAYLOR: It reminds me
of a Strawberry Shortcake doll

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.875
from when we were little.

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:45.130
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:46.160
That's a good smell.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:46.436
JENNA TAYLOR: Dating myself.

00:45:46.436 --> 00:45:47.600
But that's exactly
what it smells like.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.650
JAMI CURL: That's a good smell.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.983
JENNA TAYLOR: It's a strong
scent memory from childhood.

00:45:50.983 --> 00:45:53.200
JAMI CURL: OK, so then
once you have that done,

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.890
if I journey down here, will
everyone be able to see?

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:02.830
Or shall I-- you'll have a
funnel or your measuring cup,

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:04.080
whichever you prefer.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:08.790
And you just take the
hot, beautiful candy.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.340
And you pour it in there.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.290
And while you have
your funnel full

00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:17.870
and you still have some
of the candy in the pot,

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:19.720
you can set it down.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.530
Don't recook it.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.880
That's the only thing
that I can tell you.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.740
So if this hardens a
little while you're

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.050
waiting to funnel
your candy out,

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.000
do not take what's
in the pot reheat it

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.490
to where it's boiling, because
then it will crystallize.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.110
You just got to
leave it like it is.

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.600
And then as you get
better at either

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.300
using a full funnel or a full
measuring cup so you can do it,

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.640
then your yields will
increase and increase

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.300
as you get better
at making lollipops.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.040
OK, this is my favorite part.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.260
I have a real stance
when I funnel candy

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.050
that I get made fun of
for all the time at work.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.730
But it's very like--

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.560
and usually, I'm like,
don't talk to me.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.000
I'm doing like 200 lollipops.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.280
This part's really fun.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:00.640
You take the funnel,
or you could also

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.670
do the measuring cup, and
you essentially-- this

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.950
is a $7 object, also.

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.790
So it's not like a million--

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.790
And the most amazing thing
that we have found out

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:15.630
is that almost every
specialty candy-making item

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:20.050
that is sold America is
made in the state of Ohio.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:22.730
They are really serious about
their candy and their tools.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:27.400
So you just lift up on the
plunger and then close it.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.404
And then you have that
really pretty lollipop.

00:47:29.404 --> 00:47:30.570
And then you just repeat it.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:35.420
Do you want to try it?

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.260
JENNA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.186
JAMI CURL: So here's
what I can tell you.

00:47:39.186 --> 00:47:40.560
JENNA TAYLOR: OK,
stance, though.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.018
JAMI CURL: You can
always add more,

00:47:42.018 --> 00:47:43.470
but you can't take any away.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:44.665
So go slow.

00:47:44.665 --> 00:47:45.290
AUDIENCE: Oooh.

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:46.880
JAMI CURL: Wow, look at you.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.713
AUDIENCE: Looks like
she's done this before.

00:47:48.713 --> 00:47:51.272
JAMI CURL: Yeah, it's like
we practiced, but we didn't.

00:47:51.272 --> 00:47:52.272
JENNA TAYLOR: Food team.

00:47:54.279 --> 00:47:55.320
JAMI CURL: Oh, thank you.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:56.040
Is that one good?

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.928
JENNA TAYLOR: Just [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.540
JAMI CURL: Something that I like
to do with the lollipops is I

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:08.180
like to take the
Dreams Come True,

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.830
which is the fruity,
chewy candy that you have,

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:14.200
and take a little bit of it, and
put it on the end of the stick.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.850
And then put the
stick in the mold.

00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:17.930
And the pour the
hard candy over it.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.402
And then you have like a hard
candy with a chewy center.

00:48:20.402 --> 00:48:21.610
JENNA TAYLOR: That's awesome.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.026
JAMI CURL: And it's super fun
to mix the flavors that way.

00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:25.660
So you could have
strawberry hard candy

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.890
with a tangerine center, or
like a super sour hard candy

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.260
for the lollipop with
lemon in the middle.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.450
Really delicious
is the chocolate

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.772
on the stick with coffee
lollipop around it.

00:48:36.772 --> 00:48:37.480
That's very good.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:37.750
JENNA TAYLOR: Yum.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:38.680
JAMI CURL: Those recipes are--

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:39.880
AUDIENCE: How do you
do a super sour--

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:40.330
JAMI CURL: How do you do it?

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.129
AUDIENCE: --hard candy
that's sugar-based.

00:48:42.129 --> 00:48:43.420
JAMI CURL: Oh, let me tell you.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:44.950
I just figured this out.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:48.940
She asked how you do a hard
candy that's super sour.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.040
So if you add citric
acid to something,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.570
that obviously makes it sour.

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.960
But if you just continue to
add citric acid to candy,

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.890
the citric acid starts
eating all of the stuff that

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.240
has the sugar sort of hold up.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.520
So we have made
candy that we want

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:07.440
to be super sour with citric
acid, come back to it two days

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.000
later, and it's
liquid in the package,

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.274
because the citric acid
just eats everything.

00:49:12.274 --> 00:49:13.690
So we have figured
out that if you

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.590
combine three ingredients
that make things

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.370
sour into one sort of slurry,
then make candy with it,

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.310
you can make things
hugely, hugely sour,

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:28.870
because none of the three have
enough in the recipe ratio-wise

00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:30.390
to break anything down.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.620
AUDIENCE: So does that
mean the sour candy

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:33.966
typically has less sugar in it?

00:49:33.966 --> 00:49:36.377
JAMI CURL: It's the same
amount of sugar, actually.

00:49:36.377 --> 00:49:37.960
AUDIENCE: So it's
like the citric acid

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.650
is masking the sugar content?

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:42.677
JAMI CURL: Yeah, citric acid,
malic acid, and sodium citrate

00:49:42.677 --> 00:49:44.260
are the three things
that work for us.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:44.770
You did it.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.115
JENNA TAYLOR: I did.

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:47.406
JAMI CURL: You should come
to Portland and work for me.

00:49:47.406 --> 00:49:50.200
I know I can't pay you as much
as they probably pay you here.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.790
But this is like perfect.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:52.970
AUDIENCE: The cost of
living is a lot lower.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.595
JAMI CURL: It's a
little bit different.

00:49:54.595 --> 00:49:55.650
So the magic--

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:56.500
JENNA TAYLOR: I'll come
and stage with you.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.000
I'll just come and hang out.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.571
JAMI CURL: OK.

00:49:59.571 --> 00:50:00.070
All right.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.380
So let's pretend that
one of these is--

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.202
I would actually love it.

00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:05.285
JENNA TAYLOR: Candy magic.

00:50:05.285 --> 00:50:05.550
JAMI CURL: What?

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:06.015
AUDIENCE: Can I try it?

00:50:06.015 --> 00:50:06.280
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.390
Who wants to try this?

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.190
Actually, does anyone
else want to try it?

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.690
Yes.

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:10.240
OK.

00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.454
Let's form a little--

00:50:12.454 --> 00:50:13.120
let me see here.

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.350
Put that in this.

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:17.050
Put the funnel in that.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:17.680
There we go.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.410
And let's put what was
on the stove in this.

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.280
Oh, other thing I can tell you--

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.260
as soon as you get
done with this part,

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.400
put this pot in the sink
and run water on it.

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.430
Otherwise you'll be doing
the dishes all night

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:39.138
long, because it will
really stick to it.

00:50:39.138 --> 00:50:42.017
Otherwise, you can fill this
up with water and let it boil.

00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:43.850
And then it will boil
with sticky stuff off.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.570
OK.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:50.300
AUDIENCE: Had that extra just
been sitting on a not hot--

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.300
JAMI CURL: That's right.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.060
Yeah.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:54.265
OK, do you want me to
talk you through it?

00:50:54.265 --> 00:50:54.837
AUDIENCE: No.

00:50:54.837 --> 00:50:55.420
JAMI CURL: Oh.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.164
No I don't need you
to talk me through it.

00:51:02.164 --> 00:51:03.830
JENNA TAYLOR: You got
to get the stance.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:04.329
That's why.

00:51:04.329 --> 00:51:07.000
JAMI CURL: Yeah, if you
get on where you can-- yes.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.330
And the key is always remember.

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:10.914
AUDIENCE: It's really full.

00:51:10.914 --> 00:51:11.580
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.526
The funnel is full.

00:51:12.526 --> 00:51:14.400
But always remember,
you can always add more.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.630
But you can't take any away.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.755
So it is kind of nice, too.

00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:19.190
AUDIENCE: I just failed
my job interview, guys.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.220
JAMI CURL: You didn't.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:24.480
You actually did-- look
at your other five.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.160
Your other five are perfect.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.600
OK, Yeah, don't touch it.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.130
Don't touch it.

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:29.630
It is hot.

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:32.670
OK who wants to do-- who
wants to try it also?

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:33.791
Who else wants to do it?

00:51:33.791 --> 00:51:34.290
You ready?

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.640
OK, yeah, come on.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.040
Let me talk you through it.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:38.580
All right.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:42.245
AUDIENCE: So the
stance is down here?

00:51:42.245 --> 00:51:43.650
JAMI CURL: The
thing about it is,

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.230
you can choose your own
individual stance once you

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:48.900
get into it, you'll
know what your stance

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:50.370
is, personal stance.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:50.989
OK.

00:51:50.989 --> 00:51:52.530
So you'll obviously
want to make sure

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.140
that the sticks are
in the circles, right?

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.810
And the best thing
I can tell you

00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:00.660
is that you just add a
little so that you can

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.670
get a feel for how the flow is.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:03.950
Lift up the plunger slightly.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.658
You don't have to pull
it all the way up.

00:52:05.658 --> 00:52:07.511
Just a little, and
then it'll flow out.

00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:08.010
Yeah.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:09.426
JENNA TAYLOR: So
we've technically

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:13.210
got like five minutes left
in our actual food talk.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.970
What else did we
want to talk about?

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:17.750
Perfect.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:18.750
JAMI CURL: Look at that.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.380
So good.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.630
Your stance is really good.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.480
JENNA TAYLOR: It's
because of the stance.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.740
JAMI CURL: It's really good.

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.780
Also, it doubles
as your workout,

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:26.190
because you're squatting.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.957
JENNA TAYLOR: Got it.

00:52:27.957 --> 00:52:29.290
JAMI CURL: Yeah, you're so good.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:29.820
Yep.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:30.520
Look at that.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:31.560
JENNA TAYLOR: Do we want
to have everybody taste

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:32.809
candy side-by-side?

00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:33.600
JAMI CURL: Oh, yes.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.221
Do you want to do that?

00:52:35.221 --> 00:52:35.970
Would you like to?

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:36.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:37.050
JAMI CURL: OK.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:40.710
Does everybody have the
kit, and the pencil,

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.360
a little bag of candy?

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:42.900
Yes?

00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.390
Everybody does?

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.410
No?

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:50.470
JENNA TAYLOR: There are more
down here if anybody doesn't.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.216
Will you hand me
some of the papers?

00:52:52.216 --> 00:52:54.840
JAMI CURL: But also, we need to
taste the strawberry lollipops,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:56.711
right?

00:52:56.711 --> 00:52:57.210
Don't we?

00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:57.998
I think we do.

00:52:57.998 --> 00:52:59.164
AUDIENCE: Do they harden up?

00:52:59.164 --> 00:53:02.467
[INAUDIBLE] I mean, you could
pick them up quite quickly.

00:53:02.467 --> 00:53:03.300
JAMI CURL: Oh, yeah.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.592
10 to 15 minutes, totally done.

00:53:04.592 --> 00:53:06.550
JENNA TAYLOR: And here's
our comparison sheets.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.160
JAMI CURL: And this is the--

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.800
these are strawberry
lollipops that we just made,

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.160
just magically transformed.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:13.820
Yes.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.195
JENNA TAYLOR: And how long--
do those have sit overnight?

00:53:16.195 --> 00:53:17.880
JAMI CURL: No, just
like 15 minutes.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:19.030
It's really easy.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.988
JENNA TAYLOR: Right on.

00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:22.676
JAMI CURL: OK, and then we'll
wrap one if we have time.

00:53:22.676 --> 00:53:23.675
You guys take all those.

00:53:23.675 --> 00:53:25.140
Let me get this off my hand.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:29.400
OK the candy comparison--

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.960
this is something
that I like to do

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.240
to show people sort of
the real differences

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:41.660
between mass-produced
candy and handmade candy.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.820
OK, so the first
that you have there

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:49.380
is the Dreams Come True, which
is the pink wrapped candy,

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:53.310
and the other fruity candy,
which is the Starburst.

00:53:53.310 --> 00:53:57.360
So I only do these
two side-by-side

00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.800
because so many people
say that they're similar.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.140
But they're not that similar
because the Starburst contains

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.677
17 ingredients, and the Dreams
Come True contains five.

00:54:07.677 --> 00:54:08.760
JENNA TAYLOR: Enough said.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:11.470
JAMI CURL: And it uses beet
to get it the pink color.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:13.350
And we use the natural
flavoring to give it

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:14.850
the natural flavoring.

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.010
And the reason that it
doesn't stick to your teeth

00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:19.890
and is so smooth and
delicious when you bite it

00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:22.170
is because it contains
real dairy butter.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:24.180
So in a Starburst, it
doesn't have any of that,

00:54:24.180 --> 00:54:26.459
so it is a little
like chalky and gross.

00:54:26.459 --> 00:54:28.000
Is anyone going to
eat the Starburst?

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.878
Does anyone eat
Starbursts regularly?

00:54:29.878 --> 00:54:30.342
AUDIENCE: Not regularly.

00:54:30.342 --> 00:54:31.742
JENNA TAYLOR: I mean, regularly.

00:54:31.742 --> 00:54:32.630
Halloween.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:33.630
JAMI CURL: That's great.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:34.530
That is great.

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:35.540
That was great.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] other
colors of Starburst and Dum

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:39.030
Dums that you have to
buy in order to get--

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.738
JAMI CURL: Oh, do you
want me to tell you

00:54:40.738 --> 00:54:41.790
what we did to get those?

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:45.090
So you can buy Dum Dum
single flavors directly

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:46.740
from the manufacturer.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:48.540
But the Starburst,
I just went around

00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:52.320
to all the bulk grocery stores
and picked the pink ones out so

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.557
that I could bring them--

00:54:53.557 --> 00:54:55.973
JENNA TAYLOR: And everybody
who bought Starburst was like,

00:54:55.973 --> 00:54:57.476
what in the heck?

00:54:57.476 --> 00:54:59.350
JAMI CURL: Where are
all the strawberry ones?

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:00.760
JENNA TAYLOR: Because
pink is the best flavor.

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:01.440
JAMI CURL: Yeah.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:04.290
Yeah, so that's how I did
it, just to be honest.

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:08.010
OK, so the Starburst is
obviously this very tough,

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:10.360
hard brick when you squeeze it.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.920
The Dreams Come True it's very
like smooth and delicious.

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:19.680
The Starburst contains a ton
of gross stuff, like red 40.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:24.270
In America, we use around 20
million pounds of food dye

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.850
every year in our
food system, which

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.310
is like the grossest thing.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.610
It has been linked to
hyperactivity in children,

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.690
obviously.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:36.720
Some people believe that
food coloring causes cancer,

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.180
or it's a contributing
factor to cancer.

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.690
So obviously, if you can
make handy the right way,

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:42.690
you would want to do it.

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.350
OK, so the caramel, this is one
of my favorite to talk about.

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:48.120
We make caramel with
sugar, a little bit

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.260
of glucose, heavy cream, and
butter, sea salt, some vanilla.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.060
So simple, totally delicious.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.940
Caramel that's made
for mass-production

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.820
is made with this stuff
called lipolyzed butter.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:03.580
And it is taken from
the gullet of a cow

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:06.850
so that they can say that
it's a dairy product.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:09.190
But it has actually been
so chemically treated

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:14.440
that you need like a pinprick
of it in any ratio of something

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:17.650
you're making to impart
dairy-like flavor.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:20.860
It's the grossest,
grossest product.

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.650
And it's made by the
millions of gallons,

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.270
because so many
people put it stuff.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.260
But they say "natural
dairy flavor" on the label.

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:29.840
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah,
that's disgusting.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.010
JAMI CURL: And it's
actually this disgust--

00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:32.230
so we don't use that.

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.430
We make it with real stuff.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.400
AUDIENCE: Do they do that
so it's faster to produce?

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.320
JAMI CURL: It doesn't spoil.

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.490
It leads to a longer shelf
life is the real thing.

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:44.200
So all of mass-produced candy is
made as cheaply as possible so

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.880
that at last for years.

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.650
That's like the
main thing with it.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.187
Yeah.

00:56:49.187 --> 00:56:50.770
JENNA TAYLOR: So the
ultimate takeaway

00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.170
is we can just make our
own delicious candy.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.100
JAMI CURL: Which is
exactly why I'm here, yes.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:55.600
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:56.225
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:56:56.225 --> 00:56:56.980
OK.

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.771
The lollipop, do you
want to talk about it?

00:56:58.771 --> 00:57:00.880
Obviously, fake
coloring in the Dum Dum.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.510
But the cherry lollipop
is so great and beautiful.

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:05.587
Hold it up to the light.

00:57:05.587 --> 00:57:07.420
You can see the cherry
skins that are in it.

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:09.170
All the cherries that
these were made with

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.209
were grown in Oregon
for us that we bring in.

00:57:11.209 --> 00:57:13.375
And we do the same thing
we did with the strawberry,

00:57:13.375 --> 00:57:14.632
but with cherries.

00:57:14.632 --> 00:57:16.690
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:17.470
So fun.

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:20.264
Are there any final questions?

00:57:20.264 --> 00:57:21.758
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:25.000
JAMI CURL: Yes.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.784
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] now?

00:57:27.784 --> 00:57:30.570
[INAUDIBLE] beginning?

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.820
JAMI CURL: You
know what you could

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:34.300
do-- this is very tedious.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:35.760
But maybe you are tedious.

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.140
I'm very tedious.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.050
You could take a
little bit of the candy

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:42.870
and pour it in the mold
that doesn't have the stick.

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:45.660
Then set the thing down
inside, like the flower

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.800
petal or the herbs or
whatever it is, gold leaf.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.450
Then put the stick
on top of that,

00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:53.880
then fill it in with
candy the rest of the way,

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.701
sort of like a three-step
layer, three layers.

00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:58.200
Yeah.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.500
JENNA TAYLOR: That's fair.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.780
Anybody else?

00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.172
Everybody has so much candy.

00:58:03.172 --> 00:58:03.880
You're all happy.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:04.990
JAMI CURL: Yes,
have a lot of candy.

00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:06.070
JENNA TAYLOR: Thank you so much.

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:07.660
JAMI CURL: Thank
you for having me.

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.810
[APPLAUSE]
