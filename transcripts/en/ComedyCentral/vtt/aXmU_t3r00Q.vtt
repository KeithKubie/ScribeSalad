00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.636
 (exciting rock music)

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.074
 - My name is Fortune Feimster,

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:10.710
I am originally from a tiny town

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.812 size:84% position:42%
  in North Carolina
  called Belmont.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I didn't start comedy
 in North Carolina,

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:17.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I started when I
 got to Los Angeles.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.453
Because I figured, why not start

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.121
 where it's really difficult.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:25.324 align:start size:88% position:13%
I actually started in
sketch comedy and improv

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:26.559 size:88% position:44%
 at the Groundlings.

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.828
 Somebody came to one
 of my improv shows

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.530
and was like, you're a stand-up,

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.465
why are you not doing stand-up?

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.801
 I don't know if it's
 'cause I look weird,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.271
 or if they're like, oh, you're
 not going to do anything else

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.240
 in life, so you might
 as well tell jokes.

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.409
 I'm just really happy
 that I made it here.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.445 size:84% position:42%
  I was almost late
  catching my plane

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.415 align:start size:88% position:13%
 'cause I was teaching
 a yoga class.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.185
He's like, that did not happen.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
You're right, I did
not teach a yoga class.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start position:0%
  I went to one, obviously,
  look at this, boom!

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:00.493 size:88% position:44%
 Ah?

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.163
He's checkin' out my yoga booty.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.132
 It was pretty awesome though
 because the yoga teacher,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.468 align:start position:0%
  she let me do the modified
  version of everything.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
 So like, the class
 would do downward dog

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.139 size:88% position:44%
 and she'd let eat raviolis.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.076
 I didn't know that I was gay,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.779 align:start position:0%
 and so when I was at college,
 my mom, she'd call me up

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.747 align:start position:0%
 and say, I don't understand
 why you get so upset

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050
 when your friend Michelle
 goes out on dates with guys.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:27.353
And I was like, because
she's my best friend!

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:30.189 size:88% position:44%
 And I'm like, super
 intense about it.

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:34.060 align:start position:0%
 And it's the most real joke
 that I think that I have

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:38.598 align:start position:0%
  because it stems from
  years of just not knowing,

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.667 align:start size:88% position:13%
 legitimately not
 knowing that I was gay

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.037
 and being so weirdly intense

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:50.109 align:start position:0%
about my friends that I secretly
kind of had this crush on.

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:51.811 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And she really just
 did not get it,

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and I was just like,
 you don't know!

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.715
We're so close!

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:00.386 align:start size:88% position:13%
  And everybody else
  was like, duh.

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:01.587
 When I told my mom I
 was gay, she was like,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.223 size:84% position:42%
  really, what do you mean?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:06.692 size:88% position:44%
 I'm like, what do you mean?

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.494
 I'm like, look at me.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:11.097
 Now my mom's way supportive,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.533 align:start position:0%
 not that she wasn't supportive
 of me being gay then,

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
  but now she's like
  overkill, like,

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.304 align:start position:0%
 she's the president of
 PFLAG, it's this organization

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.806
of parents of lesbians and gays,

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:24.677
and she's like everyday posting
on Facebook about gay rights

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.246
 so I have to be the
 one that's like, mom,

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.650
 you need to, can you
 just tone it down?

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.218
My mom's a bit of a lightweight.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.086
 It takes her one whiskey sour,

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then she's
 completely toasted.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.793 size:84% position:42%
  She's like, yeah,
  that's my style,

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.429
I wanna hang out with your mom.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.065 size:88% position:44%
 You can always tell
 when my mom's tipsy

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start size:88% position:13%
 because she'll stick
 one finger out,

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:52.105 size:84% position:42%
  just like this, and start
  dancing just like this.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.077
 Just judging people
 while she's dancing.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:03.716
 (exciting rock music)
