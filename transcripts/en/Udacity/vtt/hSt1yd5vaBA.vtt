00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To get a better sense of how timing works, I've defined a procedure "spin&lt;u&gt;loop."&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Spin&lt;u&gt;loop starts by initializing the variable i to zero, and then it goes through a loop n times.&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Each time through a loop it just adds 1 to i.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That will run for longer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
By picking the value of n, we can make it go through the loop any number of times.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's try that.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We'll try running the loop a thousand times.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, we get no result and the time it took is 0.0001 seconds--about a 10th of a millisecond.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's try it with a larger number of executions.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, I'm going to increase the number of iterations by 10.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The value of n is multiplied by 10.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
If we see that now the time is higher. The time is increased to about 6/10 of a millisecond.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We can keep increasing the time.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's try looping 100,000 times, and we see the time increases.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The time increased by about a factor of 10 between looping 10,000 times and looping 100,000 times.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We'll try one more time. Let's go for 1 million.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If we go for 1 million times, now we're up to 0.05--

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
5/100 of a second or 55 milliseconds to loop 1 million times. Still pretty fast.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We're going through that loop 1 million times. It's still much less than a second.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
What's important is we can see that the time changes depending on the input.

00:01:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
As we increase the input to spin&lt;u&gt;loop, the time increases accordingly.&lt;/u&gt;
