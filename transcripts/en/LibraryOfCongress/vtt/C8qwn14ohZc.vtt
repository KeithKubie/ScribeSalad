00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.290
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.740
I'm John Cole.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
I'm the Director of the Library
of Congress' Center for the Book.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.090 position:56%
That's the office that helps promote
books and reading and the Center

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.420
of the Book and the Young Reader
Center, which is part of the Center

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.910
of the Book welcome you
to the Library of Congress

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.690
for our sixth annual Jonah
Solkoff Eskin Memorial Program.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.260 position:56%
This very special program honors the
memory of Jonah Eskin, son of Barney

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.040
and Marsha Eskin, who have paid
for, who have funded this event.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.160
I would like the whole
Eskin family to rise

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.510
and let's thank them
for their generosity.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:11.730
[ Clapping ]

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.570
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, I should
have said the three members

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.040
of the Eskin family, but we are
so appreciative of their help

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.660
for this annual talk and program.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.570
The talk has morphed into
a wonderful program today

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.590 position:56%
and this particular program calls
attention to our National Ambassador

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.150
for young people's
literature program.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.970
This is program was
initiated in 2008.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.650
Gosh, we're going to reminisce
about this in a few minutes,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.480
but it doesn't seem
that far back to me.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.540
In collaboration with our partner,
the Children's Book Council,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.660
which is located in New York,
which is the trade foundation

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.100
for children's book publishers
and they have a foundation

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.290
which really administers
the program for all of us.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.450
It's called "Every Child a
Reader" and of course the purpose

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.590
of the program itself is to
heighten National awareness

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.460
about the importance of books
with young people and children

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.490
and the entire literature body
of materials that are available

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.880
to our young people today.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.800
The three living Ambassadors,
yes, yes they are.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:42.270
Jon Scieszka, Katherine
Paterson and Kate DiCamillo.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.380
They are going to join
me in a conversation.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.540
It will be followed, our talk
will be followed by a tribute

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.440
to the third National
Ambassador, Walter Dean Myers,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.800
the late Walter Dean Myers
and Walter will be remembered

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.600 position:56%
by his son Christopher Myers,
himself a writer and an illustrator.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.520
We're so pleased, let's
give Christopher,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.460
you'll hear from Christopher soon.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.530
We are so please to have so many
young people joining us today

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.780
from areas throughout the
district, Maryland and Virginia

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.920
and it's a great pleasure to
have more than 200 students

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.040
from the following schools.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.900
When I read your name,
please raise your hands.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.340
From Washington, D.C., Hyde
Addison Elementary School.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.320
Where are you?

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.620
There you go.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.620
You have good seats in the center.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.260
Brent Elementary School.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.880

Charter School.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.180
Are you here?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.480
Let's hear from you a little bit.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.780
A little cheer.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.210
There we go.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.210
John Eaton Elementary School.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.820
Alright and the Alice
Beale Middle School.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.390
There we go.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.340
I'd like to hear again from the
Hyde Addison Elementary School.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.920
You weren't in the spirit.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.550
There we go.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.870
Ok. Now, we've accounted
for the D.C. schools.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.680
It looks like the moderator
goofed about the Virginia schools,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.460
but for Maryland we
have Holten Arms School

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.150
and Virginia will be
represented the next time

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.020 position:56%
around when we have this.The
National Ambassador program provides

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.650
for a two year appointment by
the Librarian of Congress based

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.370 position:56%
on recommendations from a selection
committee representing many segments

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.960
of our National book committee.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.680
Excuse me, National book community.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.930
The selection criteria include the
candidate's proven contributions

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.370 position:56%
to young people's literature and
their ability to relate to children.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.760
Our partner, as I mentioned
already, The Center for the Book

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.040
and Young Readers Center's partner
is the Children's Book Council

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.440
and today I'll also would like to
you meet John Coleman, believe it

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.460
or not, the newly appointed
Executive Director

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.890
of the Children's Book Council.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.530
John, would you please stand?

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.510
Let's give him a hand.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.370
[ Clapping ]

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.970
&gt;&gt; John Cole: This other John
will also be part of the ceremony

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.280
in January when we make the
announcement at The Library

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.720
of Congress of the new
National Ambassador

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.820
of the young people's literature,
but that's way in the future.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.400
Today we have a rare opportunity.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.280
We have brought together
the Ambassadors who know

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.950
about our program, have
experienced it and we're going

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.350
to get their perspective
about their experiences.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.840 position:56%
How their role has affected their
and, actually, affected their lives.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.770
Now, if they have any
recommendations

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.630
for improvement they
can talk to me later.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.110
Ok. Our format is going
to be quite simple.

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.850
We will have roughly a
30 minute conversation

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.510
with the Ambassadors on the state.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.880
After which, we will
hear from Christopher,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.470
the son of our missing
Ambassador, Walter Dean Myers,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.140
who sadly passed away in July
2014 and whose last book,

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:58.000
"On a Clear Day" was published
posthumously in September 2014.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.440 position:56%
After Christopher's remarks, he will
join us on the stage and we'll open

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.470
up the conversation to our audience
for a 20 minute or so Q &amp; A,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.760
question and answer session.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.700
Because our program is being
videotaped for a later webcast

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.200
on The Library of Congress webpage,
we ask that you hold your questions

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.140
until that period in the
program when we ask for them

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.960
and you will wait for someone
to give you a microphone

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.630
so we can record the questions as
well as the answers, of course.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.260
Finally, if you ask a question,
you are giving us your permission

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.330
to be part of the webcast
and here is the real final.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.190
If you've not done so already,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.030
please turn off all
the electronic devices.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.550 position:56%
It's now my pleasure to introduce
you a second time to the Ambassadors

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.810
and say a little more about each of
them and I have to be very careful

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.900
to do this in chronological order.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:03.550
Our first Ambassador, as you'll
soon see, there's a great deal

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.990
of interaction and a
little bit of jealousy going

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.340
on among our Ambassadors and
we'll do our best to bring that up

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.030
and I'll try to keep it subdued
so they don't overdue it.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:21.050
The first is Jon Scieszka,
who served from 2008 to 2009.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.540
Jon wrote his first picture
book in 1989, "The True Story

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.180
of the Three Little
Pigs", ok let's hear it.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:39.820
It has sold over three
million copies

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.740
and then translated
into 14 languages.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.750
In addition to many picture
books, his series include,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:57.220
"The Time Warp Trio",
"Truck Town", "Space Heads"

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.120
and a science series,
"Frank Einstein".

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.350
Jon's memoir, "Knucklehead:
Tall Tales

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:18.780
and Mostly True Stories Growing Up
Scieszka" was published in 2008.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:29.370 position:56%
Jon is the founder of "Guys Read", a
web based literacy program for boys

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.490
and its mission is to help
boys become self-motivated,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:38.310
lifelong readers and Jon himself
is an editor and contributor

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.400
to the "Guys Read" book series.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.700
Katherine Paterson.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:57.320
Our second National Ambassador
served from 20010 through 2011.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000
Katherine is a two time winner

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.380
of The National Book Award
and The Newbery Medal.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:07.070
Katherine's accolades also include
the Hans Christian Andersen Medal,

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:12.060
The Astrid Lindgren Award and The
Governor's Award for excellence

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.970
in the arts, which was given to
her by her home state of Vermont.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.910
And The Library of Congress
has given Katherine,

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:31.730
as part of our bicentennial
celebration in the year 2000,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:37.050
she received a Living Legend Award
from The Library of Congress.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.510 position:56%
Katherine's memoir, which I just had
the pleasure of finishing reading,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:51.860
"Stories of My Life" was
published in 2014 and a film based

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.550
on her National book
award winning novel,

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.510
"The Great Gilly Hopkins"
has been made

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:03.690
into a film starring Glenn Close,
Kathy Bates and Octavia Spencer.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.490
Give her a hand.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.670
So, she's multi medium.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.200
Our current Ambassador,
Kate DiCamillo.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:30.030
She began her term after
Walter Dean Myers term.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:35.850
She began in 2014 and it will
conclude at the end of this year.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.510
Kate has won two Newbery Awards.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:50.940 position:56%

for young people's literature
in 2001 for "The Tiger Rising"

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:10.990
and won the Boston Globe Horn
Book Award in 2006 for fiction

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.690
for "The Miraculous
Journey of Edward Tulane".

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:23.240
Her platform and each Ambassador
has a choice to pick a theme

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.710
or a platform to emphasize
during their two years.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.620 position:56%
Her platform has been, Stories
Connect Us, which stresses the value

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.400
of character and storyline, which
are so appealing in her work.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.980
Two of her books have become films.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:48.800
In 2005, "Because of Winn Dixie"
was released and the animated story

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.800
of "The Tales of Depereaux"
came out in 2008.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:02.700
Along with her many novels, her
chapter books and picture books,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.230
she plans a yet to be title
novel for readers ten and older

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.910
which is due out in
the spring of 2016.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.510
A final welcome for
all three Ambassadors.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:23.570
[ Clapping ]

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.620
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Now, I would
like to start actually

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.580
with our current Ambassador, Kate.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.530
Kate this is a nice question,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.660
I think that others may have
some kinds of thoughts about,

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.440
but what was it about
the Ambassadorship

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.550
that meant the most to you?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.960
You are still in it, I realize.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.570
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I was
going to say, am I done?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:50.540
I have had so many incredible
experiences and I was

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.990
so intimidated to do this.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.230 position:56%
I wouldn't say that I was reluctant,
but I was afraid because you have

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.140
to come to The Library of
Congress and you get a medal,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:06.140
which Jon wears all the time still
and I had to wear a dress and see?

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I
just happen to have it.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.130
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Right?

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.430
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I'll
just put it here.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:16.490
&gt;&gt; John Cole: There
went my second question.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.790
Let's go back to Kate.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.090
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Oh, ok.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:22.760
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: But it has
been a huge joy to do this

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.900
because it has put me in so many
rooms where I have connected

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.410
with so many readers and I have
seen the power of reading together.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:38.760
So, this thing that I went out to
promote that stories connect us,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.550
just instead changed me
profoundly and connected me.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.320
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You feel as though
it's worked for you as the author.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.400
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Yes, as
a reader, as a human being.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.280
It has connected me
to so many people

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.360
and it has really been
a powerful thing.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.300
So. Jon didn't learn anything.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Outside of
showing this wonderful medal,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.840
do you want to show the medal now?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.300
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well, I
think that would be too much

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.550
to show it too often, but I
do wear it down to the deli

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.110
to get bagels in the morning.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.380
&gt;&gt; John Cole: What
rewards looking back...

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Other
than the bagel?

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.780
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Other than
the award and the bagel.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.360
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Actually, very
similar to what Kate experienced.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.660
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: No, no.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.960
Make up your own answer.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.040
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: No, I was going to
say the same thing the whole time

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.510
because I know it will be poetic.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.960
I was just going to say I
loved getting all the stuff.

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.130
Starting with the helicopter.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.510
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I promised
him a helicopter

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:42.740
and the best I could do
was a rather small one

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.150
that I could fit in my pocket.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.960
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, it's
actually the reason I said yes.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.230
&gt;&gt; John Cole: But Jon, do you
hear a whir up above anywhere?

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:53.150 position:56%
Maybe there's hope for a National...

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.320
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well, I kinda
love, I remember the phone call

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.260
when they asked, like someone just
called out of the blue and said,

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.050
do you want this thing,
the National Ambassador,

00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:01.350
would you think about it?

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.190
And I honestly thought it was a
prank call, was my first response.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.160
My second response was, are you
looking for Katherine Paterson?

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.410
I said I don't think you want me.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.010 position:56%
I'm the stinky cheese and
knucklehead guy, but then I went out

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.430
and I had that same experience
where I went out and talked to kids

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.080
and I was trying to engage
reluctant readers and just found

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.520
out that they weren't
actually reluctant,

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.210
they were particular readers.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:34.270
And it was an education to me to
go just go oh, I actually just got

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.510
that all wrong, but I
was glad to have a sash

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.720
and my helicopter and my limousine.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.020
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And a cape.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.650
He had a cape.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.140
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Right
and my fanfare.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.290
Kids wrote some original
music, which I love.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.590
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Let's
come back to that.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.890
Katherine.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.190
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: What do you
mean let's come back to that?

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.490
Do you want me to play it?

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.790
&gt;&gt; John Cole: No, no, no.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.950
I want to make sure everyone talks
a little bit about the rewards.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.440
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Who gave
a better answer though?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.370
Do we win points?

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.340
&gt;&gt; John Cole: It's
not a point thing.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.790
I'm not keeping score.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.420
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Katherine
hasn't spoken yet though.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.980
That will be the best answer.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.220
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Katherine's next?

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.520
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: We'll
be quiet then.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.820
&gt;&gt; John Cole: No, no.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.400
Just from your perspective,
were there surprising rewards

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.080
that came from this experience?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.380
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Well,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.380
I think the most fun I had
was when I was a prize.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.680
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Alright.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.510
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: They
offered a prize to the teacher

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:33.200
who gave the best plan
of what she would do

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.400
if the National Ambassador would
come to her school and I was won

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.020
by a second grade teacher in a
small school in Maine and I live

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.830
in Vermont and I thought great,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:51.050
I don't have to go the ends
of the earth to do this.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.560
What I forgot was that it
was the middle of winter

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.310
and I had a friend driving me and
we wouldn't pay an attention to GPS

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:08.050
because we knew better and we were
on the top of Mount Washington

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:14.670
and the GPS kept saying go back, go
back because we were in the middle

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:20.110 position:56%
of a snow storm on Mount
Washington and there was no internet

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.750
or phone reception except the GPS

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.900
from my car kept saying
go back, go back.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.200
We couldn't go back.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.560
We couldn't see to go forward.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.140
It was a blizzard and Vermont had
been beautiful the minute we got

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.440
through New Hampshire.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.740
I don't want anybody
from New Hampshire

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.570
to get their feelings hurt, but as
soon as we got out of New Hampshire

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.230
into Maine, it was
beautiful weather again

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.940
and it was a beautiful
time at that school.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:51.670
The teacher was so great explaining
how books had changed her life

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.040
as a child, starting out
with the Little Golden Books

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.090
and she had a copy of
the Little Golden Book

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.670
because her mother would let
her brother and her take turns

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:07.730
about choosing the Little
Golden Book and she said,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.380
but I wasn't very generous
because I see I've scratched

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.860
out my brother's name
and written mine,

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.010
but she had gotten the whole
town involved in this celebration

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.040
of books and so the parents
came, the city fathers came,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.210
school superintendent came,
everybody came to the school

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.090
and did all kinds of book
related things all day.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.180
It was just a glorious experience

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.860
and I thought these are the
teachers we have out there

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:48.460
and we should honor them and
pay them properly for one thing.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.290
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I should
explain to the audience,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.020
that during the two year
period with the consent

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.330
of the individual Ambassadors,
we try to spread them

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.010
across the country and
with these three plus

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.990
with Walter Dean Myers we hit
some of the spots in the country

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:10.420
that normally have travelling
authors, don't benefit from it.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.300
When we started the program,
the idea was for certain,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.530
the Ambassador would
come to The Library

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.310 position:56%
of Congress National Book Festival,
which they all have and for certain,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.440
they would go to New York for
the Children's Book Council

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.890
to be involved in the launch
of children's book week,

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.410
which by the way we are
also part of right now

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.850
and we are also considering
this The Library

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:36.350
of Congress launch of
children's book week.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.890
And I do recall, in particular,

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.560
we sent you to some
very interesting places.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.290
Anyone want to volunteer a place
that they will never forget

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.690
and they would like to go back to?

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.730
Or you can take it just
the first half hour.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.030
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That's
a lot of questions.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.330
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I know too much.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.420
Let's say unforgettable place.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.720
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well, I just said Maine.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.020
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I'll say Maine.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.250
You already said that.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.550
Kate, you say something.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.000
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I'm going
to go to Alaska in June

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.470
and I've never been so I'm
looking forward to that

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:14.060
and we had an amazing time in
South Dakota that was just...

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.360
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Isn't
that quite a book fair?

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.410
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: That
was absolutely incredible.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.230
&gt;&gt; John Cole: It's the South
Dakota Center for the Book which is

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.410
in the Humanities Council
has a knockout book festival

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.880
and did you go to which city?

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.420
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I
was in Sioux Falls.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.720
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Sioux Falls.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.150
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: And
I live in Minnesota,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.890 position:56%
so South Dakota's not that far away.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.540
I had never been and that's the
thing about the Ambassador program.

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:44.390
It's not where you're normally
like going and it was amazing.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.900
Absolutely amazing.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.200
&gt;&gt; John Cole: And Chris I remember
your dad went to South Dakota

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.070
as well and it turned out
to be such a popular spot

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.230
that we moved them each, two
of the Ambassadors through.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.850
The Children's Book Council
does kind of the bookying,

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:05.150
if the Ambassador is willing to go
much beyond, and you all have been

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.190
for which we're very grateful, but
you know it's an individual choice

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.470
on how much traveling you
can do and want to do.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.180
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well,
I was even most amazed

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.130
by a place even closer to home.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:19.270
Went to a place in Manhattan
that was a subway ride away

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:23.300
on the lower east side where 75
percent of the kids were homeless,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.170
but they were all writing books.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.770
I got to see the books they wrote

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.020
and I actually didn't
even read any of my books.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.640
We read all of their books
and it was a great moment

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.630
of like oh this is a visit.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:35.930
This is a visit.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.030
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Jon, I remember
you're being the first Ambassador,

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:43.580 position:56%
we were fussing about how to promote
it and we had at the ALA mid-winter,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.560
we actually had a big raffle
and people could put their name

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.850
of their school and why they wanted
to get a visit from the Ambassador.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:53.970
Now we got off of that
after the first time.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.440
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That
was just awkward, yes.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.670
I paved the way for you guys.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.140
I went to birthday parties.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.370
I think a couple Bar Mitzvahs.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.450
John had me in a parking lot.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.890
I opened a bridge, a Costco.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.530
They named a school after me,
but no one could spell it.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:16.250
&gt;&gt; John Cole: But we had a special
time with Katherine in Vermont

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.780
because you remember Guy and I
both came up for a special talk

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:23.890
that you gave and to having
her Vermont connections,

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.730
I gave the people of Vermont
a chance to really participate

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.600
in a home state that we quite
haven't had the chance to do

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.880
with the rest of you it's
true, this program progresses

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.400
and of course the Ambassadors
are chosen by our jury each year

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.690
where we're going to become even
more National than we've been.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.170
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well, I love
the opportunities we go just

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.470
with the title.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.240
Like to be in the New
York Times Newspaper.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.540
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Right.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I went on Martha
Stewart for no apparent reason other

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.300
than being the Ambassador.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.210
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: What did they
tell you the apparent reason was?

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.510
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I don't know.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:02.490
I came out of the audience
and I made cookies together,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.840
kind of, for a little bit.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.680
And then she asked me my
tips on how kids could read

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.580
or she gave me her tips actually.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.820
It was kind of a Martha
Stewart thing.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.880
Who thought closed captioning
on t.v. would be good?

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.830
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Where was she
when she gave you those tips?

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.200
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Prison actually.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I set you up for that.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.120
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That's the
only thing I could think of.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.030
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Katherine's
going to speak.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.470
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah,
let Katherine talk.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.610
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: It's
better if Katherine talks.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:31.910
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
See how old I am.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.860
The oldest National
Ambassador anyhow.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.250
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: The
oldest stateswoman.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.700
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
The elder stateswoman.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.000
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: The
more mature one.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.500
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: But
the great thing about it was

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.990
when I first started
in this business,

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:47.400
the reporters who had drawn the
short straw and would have to come

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.150
and interview me would always have

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.840
to explain before they
began the interview

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.640
that they usually interviewed
important people.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.370
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: They're
bringing it down a notch for you.

00:24:57.370 --> 00:24:58.670
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Yeah.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.740
Yeah and they got the short
straw so they had to do me

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.800
and what's the difference between
a children's book and a book

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.290
for adults and do you
do all the pictures

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.860
and you know that sort of thing.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:14.540
And this time because I'm so old,
the reporters had read my books

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.180
when they were children and the
interviews were just wonderful

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:24.710
because we had a great time talking
about things we all knew about.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.620
And I just thought that was the
big bonus of being an elderly,

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.590
a very elderly National Ambassador.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.130
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You can
say, having been around.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:35.180
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Having
been around for a long time.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:37.520
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well, Kate did
you get on some weird things

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.480
like radio and television?

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.510
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I didn't
go on the Martha Stewart show.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.220
I mean she's not called me.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.520
What weird things?

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.820
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I don't know.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.120
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo:
What have your heard?

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I heard
a lot of you on the radio?

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.980
And Desperate Housewives
I thought I saw you.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.090
Is that not true?

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: That is not true.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.990 position:56%
I mean I've done all kinds of things

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:04.250
that I would not normally
have come my way, I think

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.440
and Katherine I'm not
an elder stateswoman,

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.700 position:56%
but I've been doing this long
enough now that adults appear before

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.370
who say I read your book when
I was growing up and it's one

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.980
of the most profound
things in the world.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:24.410
It is. I don't know of anybody
who has read "The True Story

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.500
of the Three Little Pigs" when they
were a kid and now is an adult.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.080
Do we have somebody like that?

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.380
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:31.680
That's 25 years ago.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.980
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Wow!

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.520
It's probably not as profound and
moving for him as it is for me.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.820
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: It's
a little profound.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.120
Not much.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.420
&gt;&gt; John Cole.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.720
How about the most fun moment?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:46.280
Can a fun moment be separated from
some of these more serious moments?

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.580
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Oh yeah.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.090
My favorite one was I was
traveling with Dave Shannon

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.720
who was a very goofy
guy wrote "No David".

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.080
Where that's the whole book.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.980
So, David and I came to a school is
California and just before we walk

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.770 position:56%
in the auditorium, the teacher said,

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:06.330
they've composed an
Ambassador fanfare for you.

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:12.720 position:56%
So, the kids had made a whole
dandanadantada and Dave and I walked

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.540
into this thing and I got to
make Dave my vice Ambassador

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.020
so he walked in front of me...

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.320
&gt;&gt; John Cole: What?

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.620
What?

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.920
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: It's
in the fine print.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.220
I made him carry my bag in...

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:25.520
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
And charge a vice.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.130
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: And just walked
in and we did it like three times

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.430
because it was so much fun.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.760
And then on the way out, that's
when Dave explained to kids

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.670
that you just don't say hello
and goodbye to an Ambassador.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.790
You have salom.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.980
I know you didn't follow
up much with that.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.560
You just made the kids go ohhh.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.720
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I
guess I missed out on a lot

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.810
by not asking for adulation.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, you just ask.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:52.990
What could go wrong?

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:56.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, Katherine, the
best moments I remember with you was

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.140
in Louisiana when we were both
at the Louisiana Book Festival

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:05.580
and your husband John
was there and your talk,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.880
if you recall was actually in
the State Capitol building.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.560
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Huey
Long's State Capitol wasn't it?

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.860
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Hmm?

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.160
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Huey Long's State Capital.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.460
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Huey Long,
where Huey Long was shot.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.060
&gt;&gt; John Cole: So, yeah it was...

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:20.030
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Yeah that
was so fun and those people were

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.250
so great, they invited
me back for next year.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.090
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I know, well they
really take their book festivals

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.460
very seriously and they have
a wonderful book festival.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.760
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Mmmhmm.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.060
It was.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.360
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Jon, do
they have a fanfare?

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.790
Just asking.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.800
So, Kate how about for you?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Probably the most
fun has been explaining to people

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:48.490
that I'm the Ambassador and that
Jon was the first Ambassador

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.190
and then making fun of Jon
for five or six minutes

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:57.260
without him being anywhere
in the state.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.560
[ Inaudible ]

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.180
And then after I'm finished with
Jon, then I move on to Katherine

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:06.070
and Walter and sing their praises,
but I don't sing your praises.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.370
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Oh, I know.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.670
There's this thing called Twitter.

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:17.700
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Good, well
we're going to wrap this up.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.930
Well, you reminded me that we
still have a way of hearing

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:27.620
about Walter's Ambassadorship and
we're going to have a film clip

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.250
in a second and we also will have
a conversation including Chris,

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.880
at which time we can talk
a little bit about Walter

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.600
and some of his contributions.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:42.660
One of them and I will say
just a word about was just

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.610
about the time Walter
became Ambassador,

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.620
he knew knew what his theme was
going to be and we will hear

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:52.540
about it in the film clip,

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:58.220
but the idea of the them is
something the Ambassador can use

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:03.370
or not use, depending on
whether they're interested in it

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.470
and the tours that are planned.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.400
Another interesting thing
that happens is that all

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.460
of our Ambassadors have
distinguished publishers

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.870
and during their Ambassadorship,
each of them will have books

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.560
or have books that are being
worked on and so we've worked

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.820
on a relationship with the
publishers who've been very

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:27.240
supportive of this whole idea
and it's one of the ways I think

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.770 position:56%
that we're going to going to be able
to reach even more people and more

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.010
through future Ambassadorships.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:35.310
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Well,
it's been nice

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.800
to have multiple Ambassadors
now too.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.840
Because we were kind of making
it up as we went along Katherine

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.800
and now we have a whole
gang or gaggle?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.710
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Yeah, I felt like one

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.550
of the things I got the most
credit for as Ambassador.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:54.030
In fact, I tend to take
credit for is that I was

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.970
on the committee that chose Walter.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:30:57.270
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Ahh.

00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.570
Good move.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Yeah, and that's one
of the mechanics we've worked out is

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.320
that the previous Ambassador
and of course, Jon,

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.840
you should just came
out of the cold.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.910
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Could
you rephrase that?

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.100
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You had
no previous Ambassador

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.110
to nominate or endorse you.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.410
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That
was another positive.

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:24.460
&gt;&gt; John Cole: So, we had to
do a lot of careful research

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:31.420
and it was quite a debate.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.840
But we won.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.700
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I kind
of love that I did get

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.140
to make it up as I went along.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.390
It was just like I don't know maybe
the Ambassador does get to do that.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:41.690
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.860
I think everybody understands it'll
be a little hard to follow Jon.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.220
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Yes.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.030
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Great.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:53.590
Well, I am going to move now to
the tribute which we are going

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.320
to have about Walter Dean Myers.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:01.380
We are honored that Christopher
Myers, as you already know,

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.220
has joined us to pay tribute to
his father, Walter Dean Myers.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.430
Walter was our third Ambassador
and served between 2012 and 2013

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.000
if you can keep track
of all of this.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.030
But before Chris comes to
the podium, we want to share

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:23.980
with you a brief video clip from
a July 2012 interview with Walter

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.300
by Jeffrey Brown of the PBS News
Hour and I think those of us

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.680
on the stage will just...

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.980
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
We can look right there.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.280
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Oh, there it is.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.580
Alright, let's go.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.880
&gt;&gt; Finally tonight.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.670
One man's need to write
and society's need to read.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:41.980
Jeffrey Brown talks with author
and advocate, Walter Dean Myers.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.280
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: I was raised

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.580
[ inaudible ]

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:46.260
and I was raised in Harlem.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.130
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: And on
this day, it was to Harlem

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.440
that author Walter
Dean Myers returned.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.630
At 74, Myers is the Library of
Congress National Ambassador

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.270
for Young People's literature.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.070
The first African American
to hold the post.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.790
He'd come to his old neighborhood
to talk to with second graders

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:04.390
at St. Aloysius School
about his life

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.840
as a writer and his need to read.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.660
Something Myers' own
father never learned to do.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:21.710
&gt;&gt; How did you feel that you didn't
know your father couldn't read?

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.010
Did you feel sad?

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:24.770
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: Actually a
funny thing because he had died

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.280
and then I discovered
he couldn't read,

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.870 position:56%
but what happened during his
lifetime, he never praised my books.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:37.480 position:56%
He never said anything good about my
books and so, I felt bad about that.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:42.940
I thought he didn't like them and
I was too embarrassed to ask him.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:48.940
When I found out he couldn't
read I really felt bad

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.750
because I could have
taught him how to read.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:54.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: So, what do you
get by coming to a school like this?

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:58.950
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: Well, it
reminds me of why I'm writing.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.250
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: Why
you're writing?

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.830
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers:
Why you're writing?

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:05.630
It validates what I'm
doing and I realize

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:12.050
that I'm giving the kids something
and what I'm doing is telling them

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.830
that their lives are worthwhile.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:19.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: Myers is author
of more than 100 novels, biographies

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.220
and other books for young
adults and children.

00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.530
Some of the latter illustrated
by his son Christopher.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:27.870
All together his works have
sold more than a million copies

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.010
and frequently focus on the
gritty side of city life.

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.820
One that he's lived and knows still
from visits to detention centers

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:38.100
and prisons as well as
school around the country.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.300
The best selling novel,
"Monster" for example is

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.910
about a Harlem teen jailed
as an accomplice in a murder.

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:48.660
"Hoops" features a young basketball
player whose coach gambles

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.240
on their championship game.

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.660 position:56%
A new book, "Just Write, Here's
How" tells of Myers' own troubles in

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.950
and out of school, how
reading and writing saved him

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.860
and how they can help others too.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.180
You've taken this new
role as Ambassador

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.550
of Young People's Literature, but
I read about your life and it seems

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.120
as though that's a role that you
assigned yourself a long time ago.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.660
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: Yeah,
I've always been interested

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:17.620
in young people reading
and you know,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.630
when I go to the juvenile
detention centers and prisons,

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.540
I see people who can't
read and I know

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:28.800
that when they leave those
prisons and detention centers,

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.410
they're not going to be
able to make it in society.

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:36.080
I'm also old enough to know
that reading has changed.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.380
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: Changed
in what way?

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.180
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: Well, it's
changed in that when I was young,

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.660
there were many, many
people who could go out

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.530
and get a job in a factory.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.540
Or they could get a
job doing some sort

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.690
of physical work and
make a good living.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:53.120
Or at least a good
enough living to make it.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.690
Now, you can't do that.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:59.200
Even the job that you think is
pretty good today may not be

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.990
around in five years, so
you have to be able to read.

00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:11.590 position:56%
It's not like it's a nice thing to
do or funny adjunct, it's essential.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.380
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: Growing up, Myers
says that he always loved reading,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.980
but found few examples of
kids like him in books.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.140
His own path took many turns.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.700
He dropped out of high
school, joined the army

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.620
and worked a variety of jobs.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.660
Eventually, he started
writing in off hours.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.200
When you were growing up
and you write about this,

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:35.650
the idea of being a writer, that
one could make a living and sort

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.150
of be writer was unheard
of in your background.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.450
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers:

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.110
It was completely unheard
of, but I liked to write.

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.540
I couldn't speak well.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:49.250
I was in speech therapy for ten
years and I was so frustrated

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:54.560
in that sense, but I
found that I love reading

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.260
and I liked writing stories.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.090
I never thought of
making a living at it.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.290
I never thought about
making a living at writing.

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.700
I didn't even know for years that
people ever even got paid for this.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.390 position:56%
They don't teach you that in school.

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:16.390
They don't say Shakespeare
got a check, you know.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:19.110
Or Shelley was getting royalties.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.390
They don't tell you that.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.750
They make it sound like
these guys were geniuses

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.070
and they were above money.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.370
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: The
speech impediment,

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:31.940
also something you write about,
being laughed at as a child.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:33.240
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers:
Luckily I was big.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.530
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: That meant
what getting into fights?

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.340
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: I
got into many, many fights.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.640
and many I would start.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.260
I would start the fights
because someone would smile,

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:44.780
and they could be smiling
at anything,

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:49.300 position:56%
but I thought people were laughing
at me so I would be very aggressive.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.900
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: The
young adult novels

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.860
that perhaps you're best
known for now are tough stuff.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.080
I mean you're looking at
some real tough issues

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.390
in the lives of young people right?

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.440
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: They're
tough issues, they're tough issues.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:09.260
I started writing sports,
I was writing adventure,

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:15.920
I was writing mysteries, but
then I began going to prisons.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.430
I began to realize that
these guys had families

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.400
or who's raising your kids?

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.690
Then I began going to
juvenile prisons and some

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.800
of these kids face some
very, very tough lives

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.920
and how do they handle these lives?

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:42.560
Do they even know that if their
life is bad that they're still ok.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.890
Do they know that?

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:47.360
Do they know that someone
is thinking the same way

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.660
that they're thinking.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.010
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: Of course
a lot of people, I suppose,

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.880
would think that is this stuff
for young people to read?

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.110
You know, to read about
prison and drugs and poverty.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.050
Why not give them something
more positive?

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:05.410
&gt;&gt; Walter Dean Myers: The most
positive I can give them is their

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.300
own presence acknowledging them.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:15.910
You know if I say to a kid, you are
a human being that I understand.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:22.240
You know, I'm not going to excuse
you if you've done a crime.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.220 position:56%
I'm not going to excuse your crime,
but I know where you're coming from.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:34.680 position:56%
I know that you feel and that you're
thinking and I need to do that.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.010
I need to write that.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.940
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey Brown: And
keep writing he will.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.270
This spring, Myers
published his latest novel,

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:42.890
"All the Right Stuff"
set again in Harlem.

00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:45.080
It tells the story
of a young man trying

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.010
to find direction in his life.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.200
In the meantime, Myers will
continue to proselytize

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.700 position:56%
in his role as a reading Ambassador.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.510
His mantra he says,
reading is not optional.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:10.040
[ Clapping ]

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:12.840
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Christopher Myers
is an author and illustrator

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:18.080
who won a Caldecott Honor for his
illustrations in "Harlem: A Poem",

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.300 position:56%
a book by his father, Walter Dean
Myers and a Coretta Scott King Honor

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:32.100
for "H.O.R.S.E" for "Jazz" and "The
Black Cat" which he also wrote.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.370
In 2015, he won the Coretta
King Award for illustration

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:40.430
for "Firebird" by the ballet
dancer Misty Copeland.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.380
He began his career by doing
research to help his father

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.510
and then went on to illustrate
many of his father's books.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:52.140
A brief summary of Walter's
career includes over 80 books

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.310
for children and young adults.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.710
Walter received two Newbery Honors,
five Coretta Scott King Awards

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.050
and the Inaugural Virginia Hamilton
Award for Lifetime Achievement.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:06.820
He won the first Michael
L. Prince Award

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:12.070
and in 1994 received the American
Library Association's Margaret A.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:16.590
Edwards Award for Significant
and Lasting Contribution

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.390
to Young Adult Literature.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:21.510
Join me in welcoming
Christopher Myers to the podium.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:38.060
[ Clapping ]

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.110
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Dad was so
excited when he got his medal.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.160
He was a little bit like you Jon.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:46.580
He carried it around.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.590
He wore it through the streets
of Harlem and he loved the idea

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:52.900
that people would look
at him and say,

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.820
what's that guy got a medal on for?

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.810
You know, he loved that.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:58.540
He took it very seriously.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.800
He took it very, very seriously
and I think that in this idea

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.870
of being the National Ambassador
for Young People's Literature,

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:09.980
we've talked a lot about young
people, we've talked a lot

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:15.120 position:56%
about literature and the awkwardness
of Ambassador or whatever

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.770 position:56%
that means, but that national thing.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:22.290
That thing to be invited to
here, The Library of Congress,

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.600
really stuck with Dad in
a certain kind of way.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:31.300
As you can see, he thought of
himself as like a young guy

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:35.480
from Harlem that's all of a
sudden the nation had recognized

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.870
in a certain way and he thought
that was super important.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:42.940
And I thought maybe just in terms
of thinking what it meant to him

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.230
to be the National Ambassador,
I wanted to focus on that bit.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:50.430
That nation thing.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:55.500
This country is unique in
the world and everybody says

00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:56.800
that about their country.

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.990 position:56%
I don't care if you're from Zimbabwe
or from Miranmar or whatever,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.350
everyone says my country's unique.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.800
But there is something really
unique about this country

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.360
that it's founded on words.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:12.570
All the other countries
are founded on history,

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:17.750
we've been living here quite some
time, etc. This country is founded

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:22.710
in documents, in words, in
declarations, in constitutions,

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:29.230
in inalienable rights, in I
have not yet begun to fights

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.940
and this country continues
to be sustained by words.

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:40.430
This is a place of speeches, of
four score and seven years ago,

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.730
of fear of self, of
I have a dream, of

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.030
[ foreign language ]

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.260
. Of all of these words, this
is what makes this country,

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:56.010
is that we are a country of words
and so when we are challenged,

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:01.800
when we have problems, we continue
to turn toward language, right.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.400
So, we go to I am woman,
hear my roar,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.560
we go to by any means necessary,
we go to black lives matter.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.800
This is how our country functions.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:17.390
We think in terms of language
and so when I look at these guys

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.800
and I think about what
my father did,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:24.640
I realize that these guys are the
guys that write the passports.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:29.460
They write the passports for all
of you young people to fully enter

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:34.780
into this countryness because
they invite people into language.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.490
They invite young people
into language

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.380
and to take full part in language.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:46.010
When Pop would go to schools, when
I would go to schools with Dad,

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.070 position:56%
you know there are a lot of schools.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.980
I've been doing this
for a short time.

00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.380
He did this forever.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.470
Some of these folks have been
doing it for a minute as well.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:03.170
You realize that when you go to the
school that these kids are looking

00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.670
at you and they're
looking to be invited.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:14.090
Schools are even not as poignant or
as real as when you go to prisons,

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:18.180
when you go to juvenile prisons,
here are kids that have been told

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.940
that they are not part of
this, that or the other thing.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.300
They are not able to
wear proper shoes,

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.000
because they can't control
the clothing they wear.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.250
They're wearing flip flops often
because that's what it means

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.130
to be in juvenile detention.

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:41.680 position:56%
And what Dad did is he invited those
kids to take part in the country

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:47.270
of language that he was
so much a member of.

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:52.520
The thing that got him out of what
could have been a dead end life

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:58.700
as a high school dropout, etc,,
etc. Language was his passport,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:03.770 position:56%
language is our passport and so when
we're in this repository of language

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:07.030
that makes a nation, it's
really exciting to realize

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.740
that it starts really young.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:14.770
It starts with the language that
invites us to be in Terabithia,

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:20.730
or dealing with the stinky
cheese man, or Winn Dixie.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:22.590
I'm talking about the
books that I read,

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:31.840
but like that is what the
National Ambassadorship means.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.700
It's this invitation to language
and it's and understanding

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:42.100
that language is at the center
of what it means to be part

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.960
of this country in so many ways.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:51.940
So, then about a year ago Dad and I
wrote these articles for the Times,

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.980
hold on, I got some
notes, just making sure.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.360
Dad and I wrote some articles
for the Times about diversity

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:06.440
in young people's literature
and what we found

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.990
and what we were worried about was
how many kids we'd seen throughout

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:16.820
the country who were not in their
way being invited into language.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:21.180
Not being invited into the
world that had given us so much.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.680
I was raised on books,
and when I say raised

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.200
on books, I was fed on books.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:28.450
That was, you know every
piece of stitch of clothing

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:32.910
that I had was made through the
hard work of my dad's long fingers

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:39.890
at a keyboard and books have given
me so much and so we realized

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:43.060
that there were all these kids
in the world and the country

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:47.940
who had not been invited into
that nation and so we think

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:53.910
that that is one of the things that
we want to change in this world.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:59.670
That we're really lucky to have
had a platform through Pops thing

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.070
about reading is not optional.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:05.780
Like reading is not something that
you want to leave anybody out of

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.980
and we're also really lucky that
the Library of Congress has worked

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:15.010
with a movement that started
after our articles called

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.180
"We need diverse books" and
they've decided that they're going

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.520
to have a reward for books
that think about diversity,

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:27.930
that bring diversity to the
fore, that invite more people

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.510
into language and they're
calling it "The Walter".

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:38.610
[ Clapping ]

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:42.630
&gt;&gt; Which through the center for the
book, the young reader's center,

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:52.300
the point is that next year
March we're going to be giving

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:55.930
out this award and Dad would have
been tickled as he was tickled

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.100
to be a part of you guys.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:03.130
As he was tickled to not be
only invited into the language

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.460
of the country, of the language
of books and to the language

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.750
of the nationhood, but to
be lauded, to get a medal

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:17.550
that said he was a member and
to sit with you guys and to say,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:21.370
man I'm a National
Ambassador like them.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:29.660
So, I just wanted to thank you
for that experience in his life

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.240
because there's a way
in which, I think,

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.300
for everybody that makes
kid's books, there's an age

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:39.580
that you've stopped in your head
and that you're always that kid.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.680
My dad, he was maybe ten.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:47.480
He was in Harlem, it
wasn't an easy life.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.170
He was afraid of things, he
was nervous about things,

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:55.450
he didn't know what his future
had ahead of him and so for him

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.730
to be able to turn to that
ten year old kid inside him

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:01.950
and say oh, it's going to be good.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:05.110
You're going to be a
National Ambassador.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.210
First of all, that ten year
old kid didn't believe him,

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.480
but he got to prove that
ten year old kid wrong.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:13.510
So, thank you.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:36.140

&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank
you so much Chris.

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:44.700
That was wonderful and just
evoked that fourth ambassadorship

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:47.240
in ways that our hard to count.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.770
It was terrific.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.540
And stay tuned because the
first "Walter" will be presented

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:57.510
at the Library of Congress
next March.

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:58.810

&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
That's wonderful.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.190
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I don't mean
that as a casual comment,

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:05.450
it's just that this
is a project underway

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.700
and it involves many partners and
many groups and many organizations

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:13.770
and we're thrilled that it will
be presented here at the Library

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:18.930
and we can continue to do this
kind of very meaningful work.

00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.870
I wanted to thank all of our
distinguished Ambassadors,

Paterson and Kate DiCamillo.

have a brief question

00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:41.010
and answer period before we close.

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.760
We have a few minutes and I would
like to ask for the first question

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:51.700
from the audience and I'm
going to be straining.

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.080
Over here, thank you.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.610
All the way over.

00:53:54.610 --> 00:54:02.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I would just like to ask all four
of you if there's anything that out

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:08.370
of all the books that you've wrote,
is there like a special lesson

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.600
that you would like everyone that
reads all your books to take?

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.760
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Wow,
that's a tough one.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:19.650
Do you want Jon to start with that?

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:21.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yes, I think
the lesson I want everyone

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.080
to learn is don't make a little
man out of bad smelling cheese.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.470
Not a good idea.

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.770
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Well,

00:54:29.770 --> 00:54:32.180
I always feel like that
the writer has no right

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.370
to tell what the lesson is.

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:37.180
That all of us when we read a book,

00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.720
we get to take whatever
we want to learn from it.

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:44.410 position:56%
Now, the teacher might tell you
there's a certain lesson in the book

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:48.810
and for the test you can say
that, but really in your heart,

00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:53.320
you get to decide what the
lesson of the book is for you

00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.570
and if there's no lesson, fine.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.230
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: And
I think that's true too

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.720
and also what I have found

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.260
and probably you have
found this Katherine,

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.450 position:56%
and you have found this Christopher,
you have not found this,

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:10.400
that writing the book
teaches you something,

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:14.850
as the writer that you
didn't realize going into it.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.710 position:56%
Maybe even Jon has learned that too.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:20.590
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: No, I
think that's true because a lot

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:25.080
of times you write a book because
you have a question that you want

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.830
to answer and you don't
have the answer

00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:31.220
until after you've written the
book, but that's your answer.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.130
It might not be the
reader's answer at all.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:37.740
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: That's true.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.470
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Another
question from our audience?

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:43.540
All the way in the
back please, thank you.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.420
&gt;&gt; So, I have a question for Kate.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.350
What inspired you to write
the Mercy Watson series?

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:54.000
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Well, actually
it's a good question to lead

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.860
from this question because
when you write books for kids,

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:02.620
what adults always say to you
is what lesson did you mean

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:03.990
to impart here.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:08.540
And the Mercy Watson books are
the answer to that question

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.840
because nobody ever learns
anything in those books.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.260
You know, the pig goes right on
being a pig and I had the idea

00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:20.620
for the story of a pig who lived
with two people who were not pigs

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.680
and I thought it was really
funny and I kept on playing

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:27.410
around with it, but I couldn't
make it work until I got a new car

00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:30.270
and I was taking a friend to
the airport the very first day

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:34.370
that I had this new car and she got
into the car with a gigantic piece

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:38.040
of toast that had a ton of butter
on it and she started to eat it

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.300
in my brand new car spraying greasy
crumbs everywhere and I said stop

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.950
that and instead of her stopping
eating the toast, she talked to me

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:50.050
about the virtues of toast and
how it should be well buttered

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:53.640
and how it tasted better
if somebody made it for you

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:57.500
and by the time I got rid of her,
I knew what was missing in the book

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.910
about the pig, which is what
the pig loved which is toast

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.090
and that's the deep
meaning of those books.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.560
Right.

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.490
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Wow, that's a lot.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:16.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I have a question for all of you.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.100
Do you have a special place
where you like to think

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.490
about what your books
are going to be?

00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:22.950
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Oh,
that's a very good question.

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:24.250
I want to go first.

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:25.550
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: No, I want to.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:26.850
No, you go.

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.150
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Alright.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.890
I always have a notebook that
I carry with me and I have

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:36.210
that all the time and I write ideas
down in that, but to write I have

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:40.990
to be at my desk facing
a blank wall.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:43.590
So, that's where the
writing actually gets done.

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:45.010
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That's weird.

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.390
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: You can
write anywhere can't you?

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.500
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, I
don't have any special place.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:49.800
I have any place.

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.100
I'm writing right now.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.480
It doesn't look like it, but I am.

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:55.940
That's what I tell my editor.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.540
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Katherine?

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:02.460
You want to respond to that?

00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:07.500
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well, I'm always embarrassed

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.810
when a real writer like Kate talks
about carrying her notebook around

00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:13.830
and writing down ideas because
all for when I go to school,

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:18.460
people say don't you keep a
notebook with ideas and I say no

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.610
and they say, don't you
keep a journal and I say no.

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:24.850
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Don't
let our all your secrets.

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:27.290
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Well, by
the time we're through I say,

00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:32.440
let's face it, whatever
real writers do, I don't.

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:37.550 position:56%
So, yeah I have a place to write and
right now it's covered with stuff

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:42.020 position:56%
that has nothing to do with what I'm
trying to write so I think I've got

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.970
to go home and clean
up and get to work.

00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.970
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Christopher,
do you want to respond

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.270
about your working habits?

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.720
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Well, in
terms of places, I travel a lot

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:58.140
and that often informs what I'm
working on, so I was just in Italy

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:01.780
where I got a grant to
have a studio there.

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.580
It was very inspirational.

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.940
Italian food, I have found
is quite inspirational.

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.620
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Why are all
your books about spaghetti?

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:12.140
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Although
Vietnamese food is very

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:15.710
inspirational, I was
there for a while.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:17.250
Food in Brooklyn.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:22.890
Food, food that's also a
part of my creative process.

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:25.850
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: But I
think Christopher should talk

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:31.550 position:56%
about his new book because I think
that's great for kids to know about.

00:59:31.550 --> 00:59:32.850
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers:

00:59:32.850 --> 00:59:36.400
I just finished a book,
a book called "My Pen".

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:42.060
And it's about that I do carry
a notebook and a pen with me.

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.360
Where's yours?

00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:44.660
It's not on stage with you?

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:45.960
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: It's in my purse

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: It's far away.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.880
If you had an idea now, I would
take it from you and write it down.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.590
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I'm
writing it down up here.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:53.910
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: But
I'm interested in the idea

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:59.130
that you know all you really
need, I was in a prison with Pop

00:59:59.130 --> 01:00:02.520
and the guy looked at me,
looked at Dad and goes,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.650
you know when you guys don't
dress particularly well,

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.710
you don't have nice
watches or anything.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:10.010
Do you live in a mansion?

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.030
And I was like I live in Brooklyn
in an apartment and they were

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.880
like what kind of power
do you have and I was

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.230
like I'm really, really
good with a pen.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.260
And so as long as I have a pen,

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:22.380
no matter where I am,
I can do something.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.480
You know, be it drawing
and I'm also beginning

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.690
to realize how much is
around us is all pens.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:34.730
You know, from how the podiums
designed to you know your clothing.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.810
You know, there's somebody with
a pen somewhere who drew that,

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:42.720
you know, so this idea of as
long as you have a pen no matter

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.030
where you are, you go something.

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:46.460
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
It's a great book.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:52.780
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Right in
the front, thank you.

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.780
&gt;&gt; This is for all you guys.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:58.490
How did it feel when you
wrote your first book?

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.610
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Could you repeat
the question once for us?

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:02.980
&gt;&gt; How did it feel when
you wrote your first book?

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:07.540
&gt;&gt; John Cole: How did you feel
when you wrote your first book?

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:08.840
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo:
Who wants to go first?

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.500
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Round robin.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Katherine, tell us.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.850
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well, it's been so long.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:21.720
I had written a book just because
I had been asked to write a book

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:26.230
by the church, but my first
novel, I had gone for seven years

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:32.780 position:56%
and sold practically nothing and one
short story and the magazine folded,

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:40.540
but I decided if I could
write a story a week,

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:44.690 position:56%
none of which were selling, I could
even write a chapter a week and even

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.800
if nobody ever bought
it or published it,

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.150
I would have accomplished
something by the end of the year.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:53.800
So, I set myself the task
of writing a chapter a week.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:59.870
I know that book only has 14
chapters and a year has 52 weeks,

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:05.500
but anyhow by the end of the year
I had a rough draft of the book

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.540
and it eventually sold and
it became my first novel

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:13.950
so when people say they don't have
time to write and when they get old

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:15.780
and don't have anything
else to do they'll write,

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.930
I think maybe you have
more time than you think,

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.350
but you just don't have the nerve

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.790
because I think writing
takes a lot of nerve.

01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.090
Don't you guys?

01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.960
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, because I
remember writing Three Little Pigs

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.560
writing in an office in New
York and nobody liked it.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.860
Everyone thought it was too stupid.

01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:35.440
Either that or they thought
kids wouldn't understand it

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:37.330
and I thought no, I
think they get it.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:40.570
So, it took like a year of people
saying no, this is too weird

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:41.940
and then I met the illustrator.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.150
He did some drawings and they
said, now it's really too weird.

01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:49.980
Now, we're really not going to
publish it, so it's a sad memory.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.370
Until it came out and sold a bunch.

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:58.150
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
A million books later.

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah, yeah.

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.980
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: My first
book was "Because of Winn Dixie"

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.040
and I was working in
book warehouse and...

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.970
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: And you
didn't even have shoes right?

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:12.120
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I
didn't even have shoes.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.730
I read your dad in that warehouse.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:16.940 position:56%
I was assigned all children's books.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.310
I read Katherine Paterson
in that warehouse.

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:22.670
I walked passed Jon's books.

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:32.300
No, I got to study everybody
and then Winn Dixie was going

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:37.040
to join the ranks of these
people that I loved and knew

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.850
through their books and it was just
the most amazing thing in the world

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:44.080
and it still, it surprises
me every day.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:47.030
I don't know if you all feel
that way because you grew

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:49.010
up with your dad doing it.

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:51.710
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers:
Yeah, so for my first book,

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:56.480
I'd seen my dad publishing books
and I'd illustrated a book.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:04.800
The first one I illustrated one
with him and he got half the money

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.040
because he did the words and
then I did the and then I said,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.830
I can cut you out and so when
I published my first book,

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.020
I was excited because
I was like see,

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.010
I don't even need this
whole half the money.

01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:20.310
I like all of it.

01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.110
That's much better for me.

01:04:22.110 --> 01:04:24.820
Such an uplifting question.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:28.390
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: This wasn't
a question, but I can remember

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:32.120
when I read Kate's first book
because somebody gave it to me

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.250
and they said you're
going to love this book

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:39.890
and I thought this woman is
kin to me, I want to meet her.

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:43.300
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: That still
makes me cry when you say that.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:47.460
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Alright, we'll
go to this question over here.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.670
&gt;&gt; Well, I have this
for Kate DiCamillo.

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:50.970
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Yes.

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:53.980
&gt;&gt; What inspired you to
make "Flora and Ulysses"

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.610
because I am still confused
about how you thought

01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:00.150
of a squirrel lifting up a 100
or 200 pound vacuum cleaner?

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:01.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: He's a superhero.

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:06.040
So, it is always very complicated
to trace these ideas back,

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:09.420
but I have those notebooks
that Katherine doesn't have

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:13.090
and Jon doesn't have and I could go
back and trace how it all happened

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:20.280
and so, my mom who passed away in
2009, she had a vacuum cleaner,

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.090
and Electrolux vacuum cleaner

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.600
and she thought it was the
most incredible vacuum cleaner

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:28.340
and in the last year of her
life, she talked to me a lot

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.640
about what was going to happen

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.580
to the vacuum cleaner
when she was gone.

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:35.160 position:56%
And I kept saying, I'll take the
vacuum cleaner don't worry about it.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.660
So, she passed away, I did
take the vacuum cleaner

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.250
because I promised her I would.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.370
However, she had a cat.

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:48.530
The world's most evil cat named
Mildew and I'm allergic to cats.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:52.340
Are you following this because
it is all going to come together.

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:56.220
So, I'm allergic to cats so I
couldn't put the vacuum cleaner

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.680
in the house because I needed

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.910
to detoxify it, so
it was in the garage.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:01.720
Every time I would
pull in the garage,

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.250
I would see the vacuum
cleaner, it would make me sad,

01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:06.200
it would make me miss my mother.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.650
So, there's the vacuum cleaner.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.040
So, the spring after she
died there's a squirrel dying

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.630
on my front steps.

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.560
Like draped across it in
a very dramatic fashion,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.440
obviously not going to get well.

01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:24.620
I called one of my best friends,
who lives a block and a half away.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.410
She's asked me not to
say her name anymore.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:29.810
She's really the sweetest and
gentlest of all of my friends,

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.130
but what she said when I told
her there was a squirrel dying

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.200
on my front steps was,
do you have a shovel?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.220
I was like, yeah I have a shovel.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.950
She said get the shovel and and
old t-shirt and I'll come over

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:41.580
and whack him over the head.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:47.460
So, I'm on the cell phone with
her, very close to the squirrel

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.920
and I start backing up
because I don't want him

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:56.050
to hear what she just said, right.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:59.480
I go around to the side door, go
in and look out the front door

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.970 position:56%
and guess what, the squirrel is gone
because he did hear and he thought,

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:04.850
that is not the death for me.

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:06.400
I'm going to go someplace else

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.420
and die a more quiet
and dignified death.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:13.070
So, I started to think about
ways to save a squirrel

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.870
and I've got this vacuum cleaner

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:17.650
and I these two things
together and there you go.

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:26.390
Now you understand.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:30.670
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Alright,
we'll go to the back please.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.970
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
I need a notebook.

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:37.220
&gt;&gt; How do you guys feel
when you win an award?

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:40.830
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I want
to go first with that one

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:46.780
because I was a kid who
was lucky enough to go

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.350
to the library twice a week.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.400 position:56%
There was a spin rack in the library

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.840
that had all the Newbery,
Yearling paperbacks.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.350
Raise your hand if you are
old enough to remember those.

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:04.550
They were all and I knew that
the Newbery Medal on a book meant

01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:10.150
that it was going to be a
book that I loved and to think

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:12.030
that that would be on
something that I wrote,

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:15.600
is something that I
still cannot get over.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.900
You know?

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.200
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: It still
great to win awards.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.790
When I hear about new awards like
the Walter, I want to win it.

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:27.990
Like it's never been around
before, but now I've got a new one.

01:08:27.990 --> 01:08:34.470
I've got a lot things I want,
but let's not get into that.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.200
How about you Katherine?

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:37.520
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well, I guess...

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: You've
got a slew of them.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:42.770
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: The first
award I won was the National Book

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:46.230
Award for "The Master
Puppeteer" and...

01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:48.900
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That's
a nice way to start.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:50.640
Don't start small, right.

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.760
No state awards.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.470
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Well, it was kind of weird

01:08:54.470 --> 01:09:00.090
because in those days they
warned a few days ahead.

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:02.830
Now, you have to go to the thing
and they call out your name

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:07.420
like the Academy Awards which
is just horrible, but anyhow,

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:13.120
they called to say I was
nominated, but don't worry.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.870
That's just a great
honor to be nominated.

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:20.930 position:56%
Don't worry about winning the award,
but you will have to make a speech

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:22.580
so you should write a speech.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.960
And I said, how am I going to
write a speech for an award

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:27.550
that I am not going to win.

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:30.600
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Oh, I
have those all ready.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.570
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: But then
they called and said I won,

01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:38.810
but I had just heard my daughter
had been in a bike accident,

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.680 position:56%
so I wasn't really worried about
writing a speech that had to be done

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:43.980
by five o'clock in the afternoon.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:45.420
I was worried about
finding my daughter

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.080
and making sure she was alright.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.540
So, I jump in the car to go to
where she is and she's fine.

01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:56.380
Her bike is not ridable, so I
get all the kids home and I say,

01:09:56.380 --> 01:10:01.730
if you'll give me quiet, I've
got to write 500 deathless words

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:07.680
and they gave me quiet and I wrote
500 deathless words and my husband,

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.980
of course, was out of town.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:13.920
He was always out of town when
a crisis occurs and I took them

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.060
to this restaurant and
the next thing I knew all

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.270
of the wait staff had gathered
around the table singing

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:25.420
"For she's a jolly good fellow"
and they said, congratulations

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.240
to Katherine Paterson, the greatest
children's writer in the world

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.080
and my kids were beaming
and I was bright red,

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.000
but anyhow it was a great occasion.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: In general,
it's good to win awards, I think.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.360
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I think
that's a good summary.

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:44.660
It's nice.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:46.150
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
It feels good.

01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:47.450
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I should mention

01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:51.970
that in Katherine's part I had
just finished her new book,

01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:55.610
"The Stories of My Life" and she
talks about each of the awards

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:58.670
and the story behind them and the
way you just did for that first one

01:10:58.670 --> 01:11:03.000
and it's really a wonderful story.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.050
A footnote for you about awards.

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:08.860
We're going to move
up to this one please.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:13.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I have a question for all of you.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.000
What was your favorite
book when you was a kid?

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.370
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Favorite
book when you were a kid?

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:21.670 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Favorite book.

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:23.040
I had a lot of favorite books.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.470
I read anything that had
myths and legends in it.

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:30.570
I read not nearly enough
of my father's work

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:37.720
because it was always
around and he was there.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.600
Of those of us who live
with somebody who's working,

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.720
you don't really care about their
job, you're like that's nice

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.250
that you're working, that's cool.

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:49.920
I would like to read something,
comic books were big with me,

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:56.270
but at the same time I
read what was the book

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.550
that had Japanese dolls
on the cover?

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:00.000
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
That was "Master Puppeteer"

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.050
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: "Master
Puppeteer" and my father brought

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.650
that home for me and I liked that

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.240
and he was mad at me
that I liked that.

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.360
He wasn't mad at me
because I liked that,

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.320
but he was like why
haven't you read my books?

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.150
But, this one has Japanese dolls
on the cover, it's cool man.

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:20.690
You do a book with Japanese
dolls on the cover and I got you.

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:23.190
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Revenge reading.

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:29.610
I loved "Because of Winn
Dixie" when I was little.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.900
No, my favorite book was
the "The Carrot Seed".

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.440
Have you ever read that?

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.740
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Yep.

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.040
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: And the
more I thought about it,

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:38.880
the more I realized where my
whole life's attitude was formed.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.950
Like this little guy
finds a carrot seed

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.420
and everyone tells him it's not
going to grow up, don't bother,

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.000
but he plants it and they still
say don't bother it's not going

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.700
to grow up, but he takes good care
of it and they say don't bother.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:53.490
And the last page is he's got a
huge carrot in the wheelbarrow

01:12:53.490 --> 01:12:58.100
and that's the whole book.

01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.820
Good story.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.130
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: For me,
I loved to read everything

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:05.840
until I got to "Black Beauty".

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.270
How many of you all have
read "Black Beauty"?

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:15.140
That book upset me so much, that I
like didn't want to read any book

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.330
that had an animal on
the cover after that.

01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:20.550
So, I did not read "Charlotte's
Web" until I was 30 years old.

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:22.520 position:56%
Every week I would look at Wilbur...

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:24.250
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: You
skipped all animal books?

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:25.550
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Mmmhmm.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:26.850
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: That's
a lot of them.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.150
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo:
Right, it sure is.

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:29.670
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Because they
all have pretty much the same plot.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:32.370
Right, the animal on the cover.

01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:36.820
I don't feel good for
that animal later.

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.510
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: And
Wilbur looked so worried

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.110
on the cover of "Charlotte's Web".

01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:42.960
It's like something terrible
is going to happen to this pig.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.250
I don't want anything
to do with it so.

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:46.550
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I'm
thinking back now.

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:47.920
Yeah, "Old Yeller".

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.220
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers:
Yeah, you know.

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.520
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: "Old Yeller".

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.820
"Where the Red Fern Grows".

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.120
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.420
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: Yeah, put
an animal on the cover, mmhmm.

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:55.720
That animal's not lasting long.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.170
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: And the irony
is I as a child would not read any

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:02.720
of the books my adult self has
written because I've got an animal

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.470
on the cover of everything
I've done.

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:07.000
So, that's some kind of weird...

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.810
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: You're
very conflicted.

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:11.030
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: Not
about you, I'm not.

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.170
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Read
"The Carrot Seed".

01:14:14.170 --> 01:14:16.470
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Alright,
let's go to this question.

01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:19.390
&gt;&gt; I have a question for Jon.

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:22.280
On the cover of the book it
says mostly true stories.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.610
How many stories are
true and what are they?

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:27.910
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Wow.

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.510
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I
want to answer for him.

01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:32.740
You've been listening to him.

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.590
How many of those stories
do you think are true?

01:14:34.590 --> 01:14:36.910
Goose eggs.

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.100
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: No,
no, that's not true.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:45.230
Most of them are because we have
six boys and a cat and a dog

01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:48.020
and a goldfish and
like little brothers

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.340
that threw up on each other.

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.380 position:56%
And we accidentally did pee on Greg.

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.420
It wasn't our fault and
on the electric heater.

01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:01.280
Those are all real, but
don't try that either.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.400
I would say 98 percent.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.700
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Are true.

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.000
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Are true.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.050
I'm sticking with 98.

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:11.360
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: I'm
sticking with zero.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.980
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Alright, we're
going to go back over here.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.280
Thank you.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.390
&gt;&gt; So, this is for all of you.

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:22.910
What book have you written
that most relates to your life?

01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:25.990
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I'm sorry, will
you repeat the question once?

01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:31.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh ok. What book have you written
that most relates to your life?

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:33.340
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Most
relates to your life?

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.640
&gt;&gt; If you have one.

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:41.270
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Well,
I guess the book that I wrote

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:45.460 position:56%
out of something that happened in
my family was "Bridge to Terabithia"

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:51.550
because my son's best friend has
been killed by lightning and I had

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:55.180
to somehow makes sense out of
something that didn't make sense.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.860
The book that's most like
me probably is "Come Sing,

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.760
Jimmy Jo" because I'm
a shy show off.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.060
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Yeah.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.360
Yeah.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.830
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
People don't believe I'm shy

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:08.810
until they see me in a small group.

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:11.240
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: Me too.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: But who can
be shy sitting next to Jon Scieszka?

01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:20.090
&gt;&gt; Jon Scieszka: I think
in my life it's "The Story

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:21.750
of the Three Little Pigs"

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:28.020
because it's not honestly
my fault, like ever.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.880
Whatever the accusation.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.180
&gt;&gt; Kate DiCamillo: For me,

01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:36.920
I don't know I think
it's what's coming next.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.190
The novel that's coming out next
year, but I think that a lot.

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:44.090
The thing that I've just
finished is the thing

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:48.870 position:56%
that most accurately sums me up,
but then the next thing comes along.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:50.170
What about you Chris?

01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.660
&gt;&gt; Christopher Myers: I would say
"The Pen Book" I feel is really

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.700
that is it until the next book
and then the next book will be it,

01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.570
but right now I really
do see everything

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:02.770
as everyone up here is a pen.

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:06.450
I feel like everything is about
pens and I'm pen oriented.

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:09.790
Years ago I did a book
about Harlem and I was

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:12.810
like everyone is from Harlem.

01:17:12.810 --> 01:17:15.080
We're not, but...

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.480
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, that was
the final question and answer

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.040
and I have a couple more
announcements before we say a final

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.090
thank you to our participants.

01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:30.500
First of all, when you go out,
in addition to the contest

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.010
that I talked about a little
earlier, picking up the forms.

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:37.770
The Children's Book Council has
provided a children's book week

01:17:37.770 --> 01:17:42.150
poster for each of our students
as you leave the auditorium

01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:44.970
and if you'll remember that
is one of the many purposes

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:47.950
of this wonderful event
that we've enjoyed together.

01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:50.570
This is a full week and I know

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:53.810
that the Children's Book
Council has gone national

01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:58.310
with children's book week in a
number of new ways and are reaching

01:17:58.310 --> 01:18:03.280
across the nation and have really
strengthened children's book week

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.940
in the few years that we
worked together on this.

01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:13.920
Finally, when we leave, we need
to leave, for logistical reasons,

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.690
exit by school and I'm
going to announce the order

01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:23.560
and it will be the order in
which I introduced everyone.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.670
I will give you the word
when you are to get up

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.670
and for that school to leave.

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:35.380
We'll start with Hyde Addison,
then Brent, John Eaton,

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.350
Washington Latin and Alice Beale.

01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:43.200
But finally I want to one
more time call for a round

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.510
of gratitude and applause

01:18:45.510 --> 01:19:03.560
[ Clapping ]

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.360
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Thank you.

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:14.430
[ Clapping ]

01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:15.730
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I want to say

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:18.490
that when we began this
I said it was going

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:22.730
to be a very special program and
it turned out to be because each

01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:27.760
of the ambassadors plus Christopher
have really shared themselves

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:32.150
with us in terms of their writing
and their ambitions and especially

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:35.040
about the importance about
the work that they do.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.750
Not just for us, but also
in some ways for themselves.

01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:43.460
I think it's rare that you
have such an articulate,

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:47.940
caring group of writers who
have such a broad perspective

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:52.350
on what the work that they're doing
and how important that work is

01:19:52.350 --> 01:19:56.370
in this case for the
entire world of literature.

01:19:56.370 --> 01:19:58.320
So, we're pleased you were here.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:03.830
We just want to express the
gratitude for our writers.

01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:08.600
For the true value of what they do.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.610
That we appreciate it and we really
appreciate them taking the effort

01:20:12.610 --> 01:20:16.670
to spend their time, not only
here, but as national ambassadors

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:19.400
for young people's
literature so final round

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:25.870
and then I'm going
to announce the...

01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:29.470
This has been a presentation
from The Library of Congress.
