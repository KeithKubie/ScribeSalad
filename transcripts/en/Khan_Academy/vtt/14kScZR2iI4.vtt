00:00:00.663 --> 00:00:04.564
- A builder needs to add
cross braces to a 3.5 meter

00:00:04.564 --> 00:00:09.022
by five meter opening between
supports in a building,

00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:10.984
as shown in the figure above.

00:00:10.984 --> 00:00:15.047
Okay, so this is 3.5 meters
high, five meters wide,

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:18.715
and then this right over
here is a cross brace.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:20.201
So that right over there is a cross brace.

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.384
There's another one that goes that way.

00:00:22.384 --> 00:00:23.777
So which of the following is closest

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:26.540
to the length of one of the cross braces?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.641
And they give us four options here.

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.022
And so let's look at this.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:32.019
So closest to the length
of one of the cross braces.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.795
So if you look at the cross brace

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:38.079
that I have started to shade
in here in this navy blue,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.565
you see if you look at that,

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:41.899
and then you look at this five meter side,

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.534
let me do this in a brighter color.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:47.343
If you look at this, and then you look

00:00:47.343 --> 00:00:50.118
at this five meter side,

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:52.056
and then you look at this 3.5 meter side,

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:54.703
you see that they form a right triangle.

00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:56.062
And so if we wanted to solve

00:00:56.062 --> 00:00:58.639
for the length of the cross brace,

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.786
that cross brace is a hypotenuse
of the right triangle.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.201
It's the longest side
of that right triangle.

00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:05.477
And so we know that we can apply

00:01:05.477 --> 00:01:07.717
the Pythagorean theorem here.

00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:10.445
We know, or the Pythagorean
theorem tell us,

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:15.445
that the length of the sum of
the two shorter sides squared,

00:01:15.495 --> 00:01:20.495
so five squared plus 3.5 squared

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:23.378
is going to be equal to the length

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:24.945
of the hypotenuse squared.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:26.837
So let's just call this length h,

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.683
or actually we could call it c,

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:31.318
if we're used to using the
Pythagorean theorem calling

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:35.822
this a,b,c, and say a squared
plus b squared is equal to,

00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:38.144
let's call that c, c for cross braces,

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:40.280
is equal to c squared.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.473
Now five squared is
pretty straightforward.

00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:45.504
That's going to be 25.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.384
Now 3.5 squared.

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:51.784
Let's see, 3.5 times 3.5.

00:01:51.784 --> 00:01:54.071
Five times five is 25.

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:58.808
Three times fives is 15 plus two is 17.

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:01.246
Now we'll use the three.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:04.671
Three times five is 15.

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:08.745
Three times three is nine, plus one is 10.

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:10.150
Five plus zero is five.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.461
Seven plus five is 12.

00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:14.387
One plus one is two.

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:17.415
And then you have one right over here.

00:02:17.415 --> 00:02:19.911
And you have two digits to the
right of the decimal points.

00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.292
You're going to have
two digits to the right

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:22.871
of the decimal point right over here.

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:27.816
So this is going to be plus 12 plus 12.25

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:30.707
is equal to c squared.

00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:35.707
Now 25 plus 12.25,
that's going to be 37.25

00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:37.951
is equal to c squared.

00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:42.951
Or we could say that c is equal
to the square root of 37.25.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:45.567
Now let's think about what this is.

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:49.049
We know that six squared is equal to 36,

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.275
and we know that seven
squared is equal to 49.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:55.852
So c is going to be between.

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:57.895
Actually let me write this down.

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:01.831
So let's see, let me give
ourselves some more space.

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.373
Six squared is equal to 36,

00:03:04.373 --> 00:03:08.587
and seven squared is equal to 49.

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:12.952
And we know that c
squared is equal to 37.25,

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:14.229
which is closer to 36.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:15.785
It's larger than 36,

00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:18.664
but it's closer to 36 than it is to 49.

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:22.112
So I'd approximate c would
be between six and seven.

00:03:22.112 --> 00:03:24.051
It's going to be closer to six.

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:26.709
And so let's see, out of
our options right over here,

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.484
6.1's looking pretty good.

00:03:29.484 --> 00:03:31.109
It's definitely not going to be 8.5.

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.905
8.5 squared is going
to be greater than 64.

00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:36.403
So it's not going to be that.

00:03:36.403 --> 00:03:39.084
3.6 meters squared,

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:41.964
well that's going to be less than 16.

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:43.728
So 6.1's looking good.

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:45.992
This is going to be a
little bit more than 36,

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:49.899
which 37.25 is, it's a
little bit more than 36.
