(Lively Techno Music)

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:07.707
- What up?

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.042
It's your boy C-Czar

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.678
Well, ribbit, blah,
blah, blah, blah

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.946
it's Prince Charming

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.280
I'm 17 years old

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.050
My catch phrase is
"let them eat cake!"

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.252
- [Female] Do you eat a lot
out of vending machines?

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:21.221 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I love candy for
dinner, what about you?

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:22.155
Let them eat cake!

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:23.490
That's my catch phrase!

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.791
So, like, whatever
the question was,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.593
it's like slit my neck.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:27.861
- Don't ...

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.063
- I'm good on ice, but
I'm also good in bed.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.032
(sexual noises)

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.566
Yo', you're my son, son!

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.401
- Ooh

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.668
- Let them eat cake!

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.203
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:40.140
I will straight up drop
a bullet in your unit!

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.908
Blah, blah, blah, blah

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
But like being
with you, it's like

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.845
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.115
but it's also like blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:53.253 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I'm straight up
having the time of my life

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.423 line:0%
