00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.438
I'M GUILTY.
- OH, DEAR GOD.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.739
- GUILTY OF FALLING

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.241
FOR ONE OF THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WORLD.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.409
- [laughing]
OH, ARMOND.

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:11.378
- I DIDN'T MURDER HER, KELSEY.

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:12.946
I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE ME.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.949
BUT JUST IN CASE,
MAYBE GET A WHITE BRONCO.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:17.150
[doorbell rings]

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.719
- ARMOND, THE COPS ARE HERE.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:19.887
AM I GONNA MISS SHANNON?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.622
HELL NO.
THAT BITCH WAS WACK.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:22.823
YOU KNOW, REST IN PEACE.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.125
MAKE ME A FEAST, HO.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.193
[device beeps]

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.694
- DR. ARMOND,
THIS IS OFFICER LONG.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.363
I'M DETECTIVE SMART.

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.366
- YOU MUST BE TO RISE
TO THE RANK OF DETECTIVE.

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:37.104
- THIS IS MY BEAUTIFUL SON
ROMAN.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.205
[smack]

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.073
- WELL, YOU MUST VERY PROUD.

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:42.109
- FIRST, I HAD TO CONVINCE
THIS DETECTIVE

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.544
THAT I HADN'T MURDERED
MY WIFE.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:45.279
BUT ALMOST MORE IMPORTANTLY,

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.949
I HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT MY SON
HAD THE BREAKFAST HE SO DESIRED.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:51.885
- WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU FIRST
DISCOVERED YOUR WIFE'S BODY?

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.654
- I WAS DECIDING
WHETHER TO SEVER HER...

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.222
- [screams]

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.558
- TIES TO ME.

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.126
[squeak]

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.695
- DO YOU HAVE ANY ACCESS
TO SEDATIVES OR DRUGS?

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.730
- ONLY ENOUGH TO KILL A HORSE.

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:05.098
[whip cracks,
horse neighs]

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:06.633
- YOU'RE NOT INTIMIDATING ME
WITH YOUR FANCY SHIRT.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.669
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.
- IS IT OKAY IF I GO?

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:10.103
- I JUST PREPARED
A FEAST FOR YOU.

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:11.271
- I'M NOT EATING THAT.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.874
I'M GOING TO CHICK CLUB
WITH MY FRIENDS.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.075
THIS LOOKS LIKE [bleep].

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.810
- BUT THE JOKE'S ON HIM.

00:01:16.844 --> 00:01:19.746
MORE FOR ME.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.248
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.783
LIKE, YOUR FACE
ISN'T EVEN MOVING.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:24.084
YOUR WIFE JUST DIED.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.485
- WHAT WOULD BE
A MORE APPROPRIATE THING

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.887
FOR ME TO DO WITH MY FACE?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.723
- HAVE IT MOVE.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:33.894
- [howling]

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.562
SINCE MY TEAR DUCTS
ARE NOW CLOSED,

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.965
THE ONLY WAY I CAN CRY
IS THROUGH MY MOUTH.

00:01:37.998 --> 00:01:41.435
[howling]

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:49.510
[overlapping howling]

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:51.211
- I FORGOT TO HANG UP,
OLD FRIEND.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.413
I'M SENDING OVER MY LAWYER
ZACK SWORD.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.316
[sword unsheathes]
- I'VE NEVER LOST A CASE.
