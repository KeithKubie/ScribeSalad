00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.202
When the infamous fictional character,

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:13.315
Carrie White, left her high school
prom hall ablaze,

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.498
and brought terror upon her town,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.635
she relied on her powers of telekinesis,

00:00:18.635 --> 00:00:24.868
the ability to manipulate physical
objects using the power of the mind alone.

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:28.857
But while Carrie is just a fictional film
based upon a fictional book,

00:00:28.857 --> 00:00:32.858
belief in telekinesis
isn't fictional at all.

00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:36.529
For centuries, humans have claimed
they really do have the power

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:40.712
to control the motion of objects
using only their minds.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:44.744
Levitation, opening doors at will
and spoon bending

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:47.237
are all intriguing examples.

00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:51.097
It happens in the Matrix when Neo
freezes bullets midair,

00:00:51.097 --> 00:00:54.463
and it's a skill that 
Yoda has honed to a T.

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:56.125
But is telekinesis real,

00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.904
or just as fictional as 
Carrie, Yoda and Neo combined?

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:04.304
To investigate, we need to evaluate
telekinetic claims

00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:08.477
through a scientific lens
using the scientific method.

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:12.286
Telekinesis is part of the discipline
called parapsychology,

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.370
in which researchers study 
psychic phenomena.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.514
Parapsychologists regard what they 
do as a science,

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:20.974
but other scientists disagree.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:23.461
Let's start with a few basic observations.

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:25.282
Observation #1:

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:28.620
While there are loads of anecdotes out
there about telekinesis,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.569
there's no scientific proof 
that it exists;

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.425
no studies conducted according to
the scientific method

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:38.903
and repeated under lab conditions
can show that its real.

00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:43.871
In the 1930s, the so-called father
of parapsychology, Joseph Banks Rhine,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:47.169
tested in the lab whether people
could use telekinesis

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.474
to make a dice roll the way 
they wanted it to.

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:53.708
But afterwards, scientists couldn't
replicate his results,

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:56.386
and since replication is key
to proving an idea,

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:58.237
that was a problem.

00:01:58.237 --> 00:01:59.688
Aside from scientists,

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:02.970
there are also countless
self-proclaimed telekinetics,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.347
but all have been exposed as tricksters,

00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:10.492
or can't perform under conditions
where they're not totally in control,

00:02:10.492 --> 00:02:15.256
suggesting that they manipulate the
situation to get the results they want.

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:20.681
Today, there's even a huge stash of prize
money available from lots of organizations

00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:26.093
for anyone who can prove that psychic
abilities, like telekinesis, are real.

00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:29.024
But these riches remain unclaimed.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.659
Observation #2:

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.401
When we investigate telekinesis,

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:36.541
there's no consensus about
what exactly is being measured.

00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.026
Are powerful, Yoda-like brainwaves
at work perhaps?

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:43.996
Since nobody agrees, it's difficult
to apply a research standard,

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.759
something required in all 
other types of science

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:49.401
to test the validity of ideas.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:50.921
Observation #3:

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:54.025
The point of science is to
discover the unknown,

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:56.392
and in the history of 
scientific investigation,

00:02:56.392 --> 00:02:57.806
it's definitely happened

00:02:57.806 --> 00:03:01.391
that new discoveries have 
gone against established science,

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.414
and even overturned 
whole branches of science.

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:07.668
Such discoveries must be 
proven extra carefully

00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:10.135
to withstand skepticism.

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:11.717
In the case of telekinesis,

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:14.270
the idea goes against established science,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.493
but lacks the powerful
evidence in favor of it.

00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:21.130
Our universe is controlled
and explained by the laws of physics,

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.305
and one of these laws tells us
that brain waves can't control objects

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.271
because they're neither strong
nor far-reaching enough

00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.795
to influence anything 
outside of our skulls.

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:35.974
Physics also tells us that the only forces
that can influence objects from afar

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:39.356
are magnetic and gravitational.

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:43.280
Probably the closest thing to 
telekinesis that science can explain

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.405
is the use of thoughts
to control a robotic arm.

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:50.085
In the brains of stroke 
patients who can't move,

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:54.414
researchers can implant tiny wires
into the region that controls movement,

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:58.396
and then train the patient to 
concentrate on moving a robotic arm,

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:01.800
which acts like an extension
of their minds, and it works.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.480
It's amazing, but it isn't telekinesis.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.783
The patients thoughts aren't just vague,
undetectable things.

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:09.607
They're measurable brain signals,

00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:12.972
translated through wires into a robot.

00:04:12.972 --> 00:04:16.123
Science can measure, test
and explain the motion,

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:20.446
and that's how we've shown that 
this kind of mind control is real.

00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:22.942
Science is a slow process of accumulating

00:04:22.942 --> 00:04:27.120
the evidence that either stands 
for or against an idea.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.836
When we stack up evidence,

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:31.035
we can see which tower grows tallest,

00:04:31.035 --> 00:04:35.730
and in the case of telekinesis,
it's not the tower showing that it exists.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.858
Some say this mystical phenomenon
can't fit within the confines of science,

00:04:39.858 --> 00:04:41.277
and that's okay.

00:04:41.277 --> 00:04:45.467
But then telekinesis becomes purely
a matter of personal conviction.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.758
If something can't be 
assessed scientifically,

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:50.584
then it can't be described
as scientific either.

00:04:50.584 --> 00:04:52.560
So the results of our investigation

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.713
reveal that however much 
we may want to believe

00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:57.943
that the force really is within us,

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:00.922
the case for telekinesis
remains weak.

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.021
Sorry Neo, Carrie and Yoda.

00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:07.158
Your skills are mind-blowing,
but for now, they belong in the movies.
