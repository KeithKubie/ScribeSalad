00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:04,970
Hello, I'm Jan [inaudible]. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab. Our topic today,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,760
parasites. Parasites. No, we've met them.

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:10,490
They were nice and we've met
them when they're not so nice.

4
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:13,130
I don't know that we've met any
nice ones really or we haven't.

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,930
I thought I thought that [inaudible]
Nice. Yeah, they were nice. So,

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,420
and now the question is,
let's just talk about scale.

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,560
I mean for the most part they're
irritating and Ludo and they seem kind of

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,050
invisible, visible and sort of offstage.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,950
But when you back off a little
bit and consider them, you know,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,140
in the effects that
they have on the world,

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,930
there are actually these powerful
sculptors of monumental narrative.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,910
There was, these are little guys
telling very big stories. And Zach,

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,090
here's an example. Recently I went to
visit a guy named Dickson Despommier,

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,400
but Columbia University, he's eight.
There's intelligence and well,

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,150
there's a bunch of different things
we ended up talking about. Um,

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,690
well he told me this crazy story. The
story I love telling the most. Oh,

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,140
and before we start, I just want
to say one thing. The following.

18
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:06,920
Two stories contain moments
that are a little bit gross.

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,420
Just want to make sure you've been warned.

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,610
The story I love telling the most
is how we eradicated hookworm.

21
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,610
The story begins in
1908 John D Rockefeller,

22
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,660
Sr really rich guy's sitting in his
New York office and he's thinking,

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,650
how can I make more money selling
something to the south? Yeah,

24
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,930
I've got all this money.
You've got all these resources.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,240
I just need a new market.
In terms of new markets,

26
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:34,241
the south was pretty much untapped if
only those damn southerners were just get

27
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,730
off their butts and get going.
Problem was, they weren't,

28
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,403
they weren't getting off there.

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,960
The forms were not operational.
The economic engine was turned off.

30
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,920
The economy was in the toilet. And so
John D Rockefeller wanted to know why,

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,820
why aren't they producing more? Yep.
What's happened to their economic engine?

32
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,580
So he thought, I know
all form of commission.

33
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,660
So he said that a bunch of economists
and sociologists and people like that on

34
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,000
the original Rockefeller Commission,

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,600
they did everything a commission could
possibly do to try to find out why these

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,050
southern gentlemen were not rising to
the occasion and they came back with the

37
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:14,890
following conclusion. Well, we
don't exactly know what's wrong,

38
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,250
but we think that these people are
sick from something cause they don't.

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,750
They don't behave like we do. What
does that mean? They are slow?

40
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,150
Not Mentally. They're slow. Physically.
They're Pale. I'll give you an example.

41
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,390
You remember the movie
deliverance short. Okay.

42
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:33,190
Remember that little guy
that played the Banjo?

43
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,010
I remember the other scene
that we all know we're not,

44
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,730
but if you can recall what that
little bed Joe player looked like,

45
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,060
why are we looking guy? But
he looked old, sickly pear,

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,870
simply pale and yet an adult.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,470
Well that is not a description
of all southerners.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,090
No description of in one
teeny corner in a no.

49
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,990
But what the commission did say about
a lot of the southern people that

50
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,070
encountered is that a lot of them, they
just don't look right. They look weak.

51
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,690
They look when they looked kind
of La man won one, they one hale,

52
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,110
lethargic. It's interesting
way in or one one future.

53
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:14,200
So the thought was that maybe these
southerners had some kind of laziness

54
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,900
disease. This is really
what a lot of folks thought.

55
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,390
The one member on the committee suggested
a Rockefeller like, you know what?

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,390
Perhaps these people are anemic, anemic

57
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,660
there. They're anemic. Do you
say, yeah, they're anemic.

58
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,950
It sounds like a medical problem.
Then maybe they're not lazy after all.

59
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,860
Maybe they're anemic and
maybe they're just waiting.

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,570
Okay, next thing you know, Rockefeller
puts together another commission,

61
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:37,290
this one with doctors
and he sends them back

62
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,000
down to the south to find out
what the basis for the anemia was.

63
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,010
And not only did they find anemia,

64
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,690
but they found a correlation of the
anemia was soil types. That's bizarre.

65
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,120
Sandy loamy soils, anemia,
hardpack clay soils. Hm.

66
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,710
No anemia. Sandy loamy swells,
good farmland, hardpack clay soils,

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,820
not such good farmland.

68
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:03,290
So all the rich farmers were anemic and
all the poor farmers were doing okay.

69
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,360
And this seemed to be a clue.

70
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,260
The incidence of anemia was
linked somehow to the soil.

71
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:12,400
Maybe bump a bum. Yeah.
Something was in the soil.

72
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:16,710
That's correct. So somehow they hit
upon this idea of looking for hookworm.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,450
[inaudible]

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,030
the hook. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

75
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,550
[inaudible]

76
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,200
all right, let's run some tests.
And when they did, big time,

77
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,010
they discovered hookworm big time. Okay.

78
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,550
Okay.

79
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,210
So the anemia is due to hook hookworm

80
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,700
[inaudible].

81
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,540
Now the question became,

82
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:40,470
how are these southerners getting the
hookworm and giving it to one another and

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,200
a pretty good place to
start to look for an answer.

84
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,300
Was there a feces because of
these silkworms or in you?

85
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:49,860
They're going to come out at
you when you go to the bathroom.

86
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:53,640
So they asked these southerners, when
you guys [inaudible] where do you do it?

87
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,700
Most of them said something
like this. I came over there.

88
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:01,630
You see a tree over there? That's right.
Deprecate. So I deprecate over there,

89
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,650
but I live over here.

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,840
Okay, so then the investigators
ask the next question.

91
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,920
When you go to that tree and do
it, do you, do you wear any shoes?

92
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,650
Most of them said no. Barefoot.

93
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:13,870
Just like everybody else
because it's comfortable.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,690
So clearly these worms are in the feces
that are landing near the tree that are

95
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:22,840
somehow getting into people's feet the
next time they come to use the tree.

96
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:27,190
But no one intentionally
steps in their own, you know,

97
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,190
no one does that, which meant,

98
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,640
oh my goodness. Oh my
goodness, it can crawl,

99
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,710
right? So let's find out
how far it can crawl.

100
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,820
So what they did these researchers is
they built a sandbox and then they took

101
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,490
some hookworm infested stool
and put it right in the middle.

102
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,240
Then every day we'll sample from the
stool sample out in the sand in all

103
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,460
directions, and find larvae and
find out how far that can travel.

104
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:54,294
How's that sound?

105
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,000
So now we have larvae in the stool and
they began to crawl away from the stool

106
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,210
seeking a victim. On Day one,

107
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:07,190
they crawled an entire foot in all
directions, but they weren't a two feet.

108
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,660
On Day two, my God, they're at two feet.

109
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,190
At Day three, they're in three feet.

110
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,910
I can't believe it was the
crawling on a long way. Day Four,

111
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,170
they crawl to four feet. What about
day five? No, I'm allowed to ask that.

112
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,710
And what about day
five? Five feet? No, no.

113
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,630
Four feet. That's it. So after
four feet, they're what? Exhausted.

114
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,340
One would assume on day six
there were still at four feet.

115
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,590
And on day seven they were dead.

116
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,870
Yay. Yay.

117
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,450
So how in the world could you deal with
this problem when these worms can crawl?

118
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,970
They can crawl four feet. It
doesn't matter where your difficult,

119
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,080
they're going to crawl away from that.

120
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:01,860
And within a four foot radius of that
stool sample, you're going to get hookworm

121
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,900
unless you do something radical
that's never been done before.

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,680
They devised a scheme for burying the
stool sample into the ground six feet deep

123
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,620
because the worms can
only make it four feet.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,160
Well then that's two feet past the
point where they die. We call that the,

125
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,600
so the outhouse was invented by exploring
the lifecycle of hookworm and in fact,

126
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,190
Rockefeller got his wish
the south did rise again.

127
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,920
That sounds too easy to me though.
You're telling me that, that uh,

128
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,160
an understanding of hookworm
which created the outhouse.

129
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,450
We removed the quote southern laziness
disease and they did rise with the,

130
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:54,040
and you, you bring that all back
to the hookworm? I do. Really, no,

131
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,410
I believe bring it back to
sanitation. Yeah, it'd be fair.

132
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:58,930
You can find plenty of other
reasons why the south rose again.

133
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,530
Air Conditioning and highways and
university, right, and stuff like that.

134
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,550
So though chrome had some help,

135
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:07,660
but what is clear is that when we as a
country began to distance ourselves from

136
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:12,460
our own excrement, to put it bluntly,
when we stop walking around in our own,

137
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,640
there were all of these
unintended concepts.

138
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,300
Salmonella disappeared is the Luda
disappeared. Shigella disappeared.

139
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,120
Colorado disappeared. GRD had disappeared.

140
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:28,121
Cryptosporidium anything that's associated
with parasites in feces disappeared.

141
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,650
Every time we build out houses
and people use them religiously,

142
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,030
guess what? Their kids can stay
in school. They could learn more.

143
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,923
They got ahead.

144
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,733
[inaudible]

145
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,940
Dixon, his mom. Yeah.

146
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,040
He is a professor of public health
in Environmental Health Sciences and

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,480
Microbiology at Columbia University.

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,060
Can they make longer
titles at the university?

149
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,060
Literally wrote the book on parasites.
The book is called Parasitic Diseases.

150
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,850
You know it very well. It's assumed
to be a major motion picture.

151
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,730
Now it's fourth edition
in its fourth edition.

152
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,020
And while we're on the
subject of hookworms and the
glorious campaign to Deworm

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,740
America,

154
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,740
because this has been a very carefully
crafted and intentionally fair program,

155
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,890
you have heard the case against hookworms.

156
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:39,990
Now let's turn the coin and say
something nice about hookworms.

157
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,260
And to begin that discussion, let's go
to our reporter Patrick Walters. Okay,

158
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,810
so pat, are you there? Are you
there? Yeah, I'm here, Robert.

159
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:49,840
So tell us a little bit about this
fellow. What's his name exactly?

160
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:54,670
His name is Jasper Lawrence, right?
Jasper Lawrence. So where is he from?

161
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,330
He actually grew up in England and
he grew up in this little farm in the

162
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,940
southwest corner of England.
Sorry. It's important to know,

163
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,260
I think before hearing any part of his
story that Jasper has had allergies for

164
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:06,130
pretty much his whole life

165
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,350
on really bad days.

166
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,440
My eyes would swell up so much from Poland
or airborne allergens that they would

167
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:17,310
feel like they were swelling shut. I could
feel my eyes squeaking in my sockets.

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,400
It was an enormously
uncomfortable feeling,

169
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,470
but it was nothing debilitating. They
were just allergies. So, you know,

170
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,480
he's just like, like most
other people have allergies.

171
00:10:26,481 --> 00:10:28,700
Just learn to deal with it,
you know, you live with it. But

172
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,640
what changed for me in my late
twenties, early thirties, was my asthma.

173
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,320
And in that time I was living in Santa
Cruz. I was relatively recently married.

174
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:41,910
We had three cats, um, that had been
grandfathered in with the relationship.

175
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,510
And I started landscaping business. I
really didn't want to work for [inaudible]

176
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,240
someone else pick someone with allergies,

177
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:51,260
starting a landscaping business that
seems kind of unexpected, unexpected,

178
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,030
stupid is actually the word for it.

179
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,910
And uh, within six months or a year,

180
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,960
he starts to notice this
really weird barking cough.

181
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,120
Was there anything particular that
brought this on? Like, no, it would,

182
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,140
it was just sitting and breathing. Cat
certainly didn't help. Right. And uh,

183
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,040
during that period, my asthma got
much worse. Very, very quickly.

184
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,010
By the time it was 1996, 1997,

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,230
I was seeing specialists having skin
allergen tests and cycling through

186
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,490
emergency inhalers,

187
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,250
trying Singulair and all these other
drugs that were coming on the market.

188
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,140
I was being hospitalized, um, at least
a couple of times a year. I mean, I,

189
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,750
I looked terrible. I had dark
eyes and Pale, waxy skin.

190
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,640
I had that allergic look.

191
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:40,420
It was a really bad time and

192
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,250
he decides in that summer
of 2004 to take a vacation,

193
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,900
he made this visit to England.

194
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,580
Yeah.

195
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,580
I took my two daughters back to see my
aunt who had raised me very early in the

196
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:52,160
visit.

197
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I was sitting at her table and she asked
me if I'd seen a BBC documentary about

198
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,810
parasites and their connection with
things like asthma and allergies and

199
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:03,820
multiple sclerosis.
And of course I hadn't,

200
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,740
but I went upstairs
and got on the Internet

201
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,590
after lunch and I've stayed on the
Internet until perhaps two in the morning.

202
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,470
I was reading and reading and the work
of all these researchers have been steady

203
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:22,200
after the neck, Japan and
epidemiological studies.

204
00:12:22,201 --> 00:12:25,800
And African animal models and multiple
sclerosis, this enormous weight

205
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,080
of evidence that in the developing world,

206
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,010
people don't really have
asthma or allergies.

207
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,840
And what he discovers is
that behind all of this too,

208
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,030
his shock is,

209
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,590
oh, hookworms hookworm yeah,

210
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:46,931
yeah.

211
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:51,931
I learned that asthma was 50% less
likely in someone who had a hookworm

212
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,090
infections. So this sort of
just like hits you. Oh yeah.

213
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,180
What'd you think when you,
when you read that? Oh,

214
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,680
I immediately was determined to clean
hookworm immediately. I couldn't wait.

215
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,280
So hookworms are these very tiny worms,

216
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,750
the size of a little hair.

217
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,050
But if you take a microscope
and use zoom way in,

218
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,430
I have this big circular mouth
brimming full of pointy teeth.

219
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,470
Very scary to look at.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,420
They have these toothy mouths so that
they can burrow up through your feet,

221
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,711
Grad through your blood,

222
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:31,600
and eventually end up down in your gut
and start chewing on the inside of your

223
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,793
intestines.

224
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,640
This guy wants aquariums in his
intestines. Absolutely. And so you,

225
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,000
did you just Google it? Yeah. Hook
Hook Worms for sale. I mean, you know,

226
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,330
someone's gotta be selling
them, but not, nothing.

227
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,590
I contacted every laboratory supply
company in the world and parasitology

228
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,410
research centers and they
all said the same thing.

229
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,900
No various flavors of no.

230
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,590
And so I came to the conclusion that I
was going to have to go to the tropics.

231
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,460
So fast forward, a little jasper
is in Cameroon along the coast,

232
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,530
quite literally and figuratively.

233
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,390
The armpit of Africa is 200 miles north
of the equator. It's extremely hot.

234
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,630
You find a guy to drive him around
and so he and his driver would go to a

235
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:16,170
village. You get out of the car,

236
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,230
walk up to these villagers and ask
them if they could see the latrine.

237
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,440
Just an open area of ground,

238
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,890
usually with bushes so people
can have a little bit of privacy.

239
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,630
And I would go over to the area,

240
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,720
remove my shoes and start walking.
The first time I did that,

241
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,920
I uh, I almost couldn't do it. It was,

242
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,380
it must've been 110 degrees that day.

243
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,590
100% humidity and the stench

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,900
and the noise from the insects,

245
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,950
it was so repulsive and so disgusting.

246
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,870
How many villages of the trains do you
think you've visited? Between 30 and 40

247
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,043
okay.

248
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Jasper spent two weeks there walking
around in the village latrines and then he

249
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:17,024
flew home. Hm.

250
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,650
Yeah. I got back from
Africa in early February,

251
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,220
so I was looking at allergy season coming
up and the day I realized that I no

252
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,560
longer had allergies.
I was such a good day.

253
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,950
I got into my car and I started driving
and I had the window down and I felt the

254
00:15:35,011 --> 00:15:37,380
breeze blowing across my face in the past.

255
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:41,550
What that meant was that very quickly
my eyes would be itching uncontrollably,

256
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,470
snot and s phlegm was going to be pouring
out of every orifice in my face and it

257
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:49,940
didn't happen. It didn't happen.

258
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,060
I just started screaming in
the car. I was so, so happy

259
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,030
and I didn't have an, I had an
asthma attack since I went to Africa.

260
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,320
I no longer have allergies.

261
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,540
The vast majority of the benefits that
I've experienced has come from hookworm.

262
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:19,860
Yep.

263
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,630
What, what is the hookworm
doing? Do you know?

264
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,200
Also the immune system that we learned
about in elementary school is all about

265
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:31,110
like these attacks cells, they go after
foreign invaders and destroy them,

266
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:33,510
right? And that's a big important
part of the immune system.

267
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,800
But if the immune system were allowed
to attack and destroy things unchecked,

268
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,813
it could kill you.

269
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,240
And there are lots of diseases where
the primary symptoms are caused by the

270
00:16:42,241 --> 00:16:45,360
immune system attacking the body
that it's really designed to protect.

271
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,430
Allergies and asthma
are just two of these.

272
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,270
Some of the more serious ones are like
type one diabetes, multiple sclerosis,

273
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,990
Crohn's disease in which the immune system
actually starts attacking the inside

274
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,680
of the intestines. They are like
80 FTSE disease, 80 of them.

275
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,780
And so what scientists have found in lots
and lots of mouse studies and in some

276
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,350
human studies to this point too,

277
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:11,180
is that once the hookworms get inside
the gut and the immune system actually

278
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:12,110
starts attacking,

279
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,490
somehow hook rooms actually
stimulate the cells,

280
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,090
which just quiet things down,

281
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,770
nobody

282
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,680
and tell the attack
cells to stop attacking.

283
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,940
[inaudible]

284
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,030
so these are like lullaby
sells Jackley what?

285
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:34,870
Lots and lots of scientists
think Joel Weinstein stock,

286
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Tufts Medical Center and dozens of others
is that over thousands and thousands

287
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:44,911
of years hookworms almost developed
in tandem with the human immune system

288
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,660
coevolution parasites living within
your body, your immune system changes.

289
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,550
He got to a point where the
hookworms could survive safely.

290
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,740
Worm gets a home is food coming down
the food pipe and in return the human

291
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:03,741
immune system gained some kind of some
form of positive regulatory advantage

292
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:08,640
[inaudible]

293
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,640
so that if you had this glitch where your
immune systems started attacking your

294
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:18,930
own body, the presence of the
hookworms would keep things controlled.

295
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,210
That's the gift. You do something for the
worm, the worm does something for you.

296
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,850
So then by that logic,

297
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,810
what we in the West and the richer
countries have done stupidly as we have

298
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,880
cleaned ourselves up too much and we
don't have enough worm easy on us. Yeah.

299
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,500
This is called, they called
the hygiene hypothesis,

300
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,310
the hygiene IP that we're
not dirty enough to clean.

301
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,360
We function like rainforests where
ecosystems and we've entirely eliminated a

302
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:50,670
class of organism that coevolved with
us and or genetic predecessors for

303
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,510
millions of years.

304
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,300
Now, I don't want to leave the
impression that hygiene is bad for you.

305
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,580
People can't go back to living in filth,

306
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,840
kids playing and sewage by the river
bank. But in improving our hygiene,

307
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,700
we are also excluding organisms that
may be important for making a swell.

308
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,830
So then what does Jasper
do about all this?

309
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,550
He decides to start a business
selling hookworm to people.

310
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,910
What you can call him up
and he will literally FedEx
a dose of hookworms to your

311
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:21,650
door. How I break in for a second.

312
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,370
Fat I jad where does he get the
hook and from, this is weird.

313
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,330
Jasper gets the hookworm from himself.

314
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Could you describe how you go
about getting hookworm from,

315
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,700
uh, your stool into, uh,
one of your patients?

316
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,350
Well, it's a very easy organism
to work with. It, it just,

317
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,760
it gets up when it walks out of it.

318
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,900
So it doesn't take an enormous amount
of work to separate it from the feces.

319
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,250
And then I haven't done that.

320
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,770
I repeatedly wash them in solutions of
antibiotics to make sure that anything

321
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,080
that could live on them is
killed. People contact us,

322
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,990
we'll have them complete a questionnaire,
submit a recent blood tests,

323
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,410
then we'll ship them a dose and all
the materials and equipment and the

324
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:08,390
instructions necessary to infect
themselves. Two ways. Is this the same

325
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,600
freeing to do Jasper? Yes. Jasper
has done tons and tons of research,

326
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:16,560
but he's not a doctor. The treatment
is not approved by the FDA.

327
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,070
And I wonder is there any serious sort
of double blind study trying to figure

328
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:25,360
out whether some safe delivery of
hookworm might make sense? Yes.

329
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:30,361
And so one of the guys who was sort of
a pioneer in this hookworm research is

330
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:32,700
David Pritchard.

331
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,210
I'm professor David Preciado immunologist
and Paris fetologist up the University

332
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,990
of Nottingham where I study parasites
and the wound healing properties of

333
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:44,410
maggots. So we've now got two
safety trials under our belts,

334
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,620
but we've yet to conduct the trials to
show that therapeutic benefit results

335
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:51,040
from infection with words.

336
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,760
So Pritchard infected himself pretty
much just to make sure that we're safe.

337
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,350
What we did was 10 of us in the
lab took worms at different doses.

338
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,300
We were either given 10 25 50 or a hundred
worms and then we have to report on

339
00:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,370
the symptoms. Along
the back of that study,

340
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:10,930
we determined the 10 wounds
were tolerated by it. Richard,

341
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:15,910
when he did this, proof of safety study
actually gave himself 50 hookworms. Oh.

342
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,500
Which put him out of commission
for Awhile. I felt pretty bad.

343
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,120
I mean pain in the gut really, you know,

344
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,760
you can feel them cause they
are biting on your tissues.

345
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,110
I mean if you have too many hookworms
they can cause things like diarrhea and

346
00:21:29,111 --> 00:21:32,980
the most serious side effect and the
side effect that makes them a sort of a

347
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,940
public health enemy is that
they can give you an email

348
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:37,780
[inaudible]

349
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,110
so if you have too many you, you lose
quite a bit of blood to these parasites.

350
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,600
Well, you know, if you
take too many hookworm,

351
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,100
which you're not gonna if you come to us,

352
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,140
the worst thing you're
going to get is anemia.

353
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,630
But it's not like you wake up one
morning and you're drained to blood.

354
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,590
[inaudible]

355
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,900
very slow to develop and
it's very easy to deal with.

356
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,700
Jasper is kind of just
gone for it, you know?

357
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:58,210
It's a very sort of like cowboy
move to the scientific community.

358
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:00,880
I think they believe that I'm premature.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,520
It's not FDA approved and
offering this to the public.

360
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:07,130
You don't know what it is. You don't
know its purity. It's not safe.

361
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,290
But I've talked to several clients who
had really severe allergies and asthma.

362
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,110
They say they've just achieved these
great results and Jesper also says he had

363
00:22:15,111 --> 00:22:19,660
seen success with that with a few
multiple sclerosis patients and several

364
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,070
crumbs. Do these patients too,

365
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,280
like how many people do you
think that you have infected?

366
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,140
It's about 85 right now. How is
business isn't everything that

367
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,581
businesses is adequate,

368
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:34,581
but I honestly don't know why I don't
wake up in the morning with my front

369
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:39,660
garden 20 deep with people with ulcerative
colitis, Crohn's disease, allergies.

370
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,520
I just don't know why I'm not
completely buried the way he sees it.

371
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,530
People are scared. Well,

372
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,710
they're the people who are coming from
a point of view of what I learned in

373
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:53,490
kindergarten about clean drinking
water and sewers to them.

374
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,090
Worms and parasites are so repulsive that
there's nothing good to be said about

375
00:22:57,091 --> 00:23:01,950
them, but I can make you
better. It's simple. It's cheap.

376
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,480
I mean, for God's sake,

377
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:07,350
these organisms fall out my rear end
every day a half a million at a time.

378
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,010
The raw material is human
excrement for God's sake.

379
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,350
No.

380
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,360
All people have to do is open their minds.

381
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,670
Are you really that
scared of a little warm

382
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,270
[inaudible] [inaudible]

383
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:36,270
thanks to reporter Pat Walters and to
Jasper Lawrence and to the worms and to

384
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,930
look. I'm, thank you. Hookworms thank you.

385
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:40,330
Hope for more information
about hookworms on our website,

386
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,290
and that's the end of this
section with clean up the address.

387
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,000
radiolab.org yes. Slash
