Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:01          All right, great. You're listening to radio, the podcast from New York public radio and public radio. Neville, you are

Speaker 1:          00:11          c. N. N. P. R. Hello. This is Jad from Radiolab a while we work on season four of radio lab, which we hope to release sometime in the new year very soon in the new year we thought we would play you some excerpts from a talk that Robert and I gave at the apple store in Soho. They asked us to come talk about the show and we ended up talking about the thing that we never actually address explicitly on the air, which is how we use sound, which we do a lot of on radio loud. This is the one time we actually have to talk about it, but 250 people showed up to hear us. I fired some clips from my laptop. They had this big beautiful sound system and a very fancy screen behind us and we started the whole presentation with a a piece of tape that got stuck in our heads as we were making one of our programs. It's a little clip that became the basis for the musical language show and we played it for the crowd. It happened during an interview with a developmental psychologist by the name of Anne Fernald. She was talking about how moms talked to their babies and she said this thing,

Speaker 3:          01:13          well you know, I think it's more where we're used to thinking of sounds like that as, as being about something because uh, speeches always about something, but it feels to me more like touch where touch isn't about something. If you whack me on the arm in a sudden sharp way, I'm going to be startled or a gentle touch has, has a different uh, effect. And I think, you know, actually sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance

Speaker 2:          01:41          sound is kind of touch at a distance. For some reason that phrase just stayed in the air,

Speaker 3:          01:48          sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance

Speaker 2:          01:51          and it just didn't. And I thought, well, you know, that I said to him, well you know that actually that's literally the case. Cause if I'm making the sound basically through this enhanced device, air is pulsing. And it's going into your ears. And actually, you know, we could do a journey, uh, that way. We, there's another reporter in our group named Jonah Lehrer was up in living in Concord, New Hampshire. We called him. He began sending us notes. He had a notion, which we'll explain in a bit, but this is then what we made and uh, Al gonna play it to you first and then we're going to dissect it and yeah, you'll see when a genius I'm working with actually.

Speaker 1:          02:27          All right. So this is, um, this is an interview with Robert and Jonah, which we embroidered, shall we say, more like Tut. It's just waves of vibrating air. Um, it's just into my ear. A little ton of waves of diffuse, vibrating air focused and channeled into my eardrum, which vibrates a few very small bones and the little bones transmit the vibration into this salty sea

Speaker 4:          03:21          where the hairs are. And the hair cells are fascinating. The hair cells become active when they are literally bent by weight.

Speaker 5:          03:30          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          03:31          Ben, like trees and a breeze. And when these hair cells band

Speaker 1:          03:36          charged molecules blood inwards and activate the cell. So all those changes, it's only when the electricity touch sound is kind of touch at a, at a distance. Now I don't exactly know how he did that and I don't exactly know. You know, I mean at the time, well, should I show that I like jump on your, if you could just break it down. Sure. Of when you open up sound in a sound editor, it looks Kinda like that. So you see that each of the [inaudible] podcast listeners, I'm going to interrupt here just to tell you visually what happened next. I took that scrap the sound that we just heard sound is like touch at a distance and I opened it in the sound editor and it popped up on the big screen behind me and what the audience saw was the way form of that sentence in a way form. It looks kind of like a mountain range. Each little piece of sound is like a peak or a valley. And if it's a sharp continent, it's a sharp peak. If it's a vowel, it's broad. And I demonstrate it to people how you can literally grab these little mountains, these little hills of sound and stretch them. For instance, if you took the ch from touch, just the Cha and you grabbed it and stretched it, he would sound something like this.

Speaker 1:          05:34          So that's true. Extended over a long period of time. Yeah. And you hear how it sounds, it starts to sound a little bit like wind. Yeah. So that plus let's take the breath that you're just pointing to. Yes. And let's do the same sort of, you know, smearing of that moment combined with the other thing. And you get something like this

Speaker 5:          05:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:03          that's built from an for nodes, voice from nothing added, nothing extra in her breath

Speaker 6:          06:08          and her, yeah, no, let's take the tongue of touch. Yeah. And just use that, the little grains of sound that are in the top and then, uh, started those and you get something like this.

Speaker 5:          06:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          06:23          So there you've got wind, you've got a nice low sort of gravelly watery thing going on and you've got the, which is the, uh, the sound of the hairs bending in the years perhaps. And then you've got you, you built the whole thing out of her sentence with a few exceptions with the bones, except for the bows, except for some splashy splashy water. The entire journey of sandwich you heard a moment ago, and we'll play it again, is built entirely of that sentence completely and totally from the [inaudible] bones. I know we're extra, right. I couldn't, I couldn't figure out how to do that with just, wow. It's just that there's one last thing. Can I just, with the electricity, I don't know if you're wondering that, is this the hard s on distance? Can I have to use your imagination? But that run through many distortion filters in the volume jacked up becomes this

Speaker 2:          07:22          really? Yeah. Because in a, in a, I don't hear any or I just hear [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:29          well if you can imagine that little peak there at the very end being a much more, um, much more pointy and tolerant peak and then running it through basically the same kind of distortion pedals. I right

Speaker 2:          07:41          for everybody to listen again to the exact same thing. Now that you know that the entire thing was the manufacturer from the raw material of just one sentence. Let's just hear it one more time and then we'll move on. But realize that this has been a re this is just basically a reassembly

Speaker 6:          07:55          from the raw stuff. More like today. It's just waves of vibrating air. Um, it's, yeah, the little ton of waves of diffuse vibrating air focused and channeled into my eardrums, which vibrates a few very small bones and the little bones transmit the vibration into this salty sea where the hairs are and the hair cells are fastening the hair cells become active when they are literally bent by waves.

Speaker 5:          08:53          [inaudible] they bend

Speaker 6:          08:53          like trees and a breeze.

Speaker 1:          08:57          And when these hair cells been charged, molecules

Speaker 3:          09:02          light inwards and activation itself.

Speaker 2:          09:06          Oh, so the sound triggers the bones

Speaker 3:          09:42          more like touch sound is kind of touch edit at a distance.

Speaker 2:          09:48          Sound is also in our case we use it for a variety of things and one of the more important elements is at is is a kind of paint we like emotion and feeling and surprise and we are always trying to goose what we've got and in a show about minds and bodies and the conversation between body, brain and body that goes on constantly and sometimes gets out of hand and sometimes gets us confused as to show coming up there. So we haven't heard this hasn't been aired yet. There is a scene in which we have some pilots. These pilots have been brought into a room and they'd been put into some kind of a sort of a centrifuge kind of thing. They [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:27          yeah, let, let me, let me, uh, n Kara are you guys here? Those two very fine radio producers right there. Um, they talked to a lot of pilots about something that was happening to pilots many years ago. Pilots fly in planes that go very fast. And when they make these fast heart turns, there's a tremendous amount of, uh, gravitational force that's applied to their person, which if you've ever heard the term g-forces, that's, that's what we're talking about as the turns get harder and faster is a very unfortunate thing that happens to the pilots, which is that the blood in their brains gets pulled violently and pools in their abdomen and they black out, which is not a good thing to happen when you flying a plane. So, uh, there was an experiment which we wanted to profile. And so Anne and Kara interviewed the Guy who did this experiment.

Speaker 1:          11:18          He got a bunch of pilots into a centrifuge, which is this big lung 50 foot arm that spins round and round. And at the end of this arm is a mock pretend cockpit pilots sit in that pretend to fly a plane chasing an enemy aircraft. And then all the way I'll get, do they have to sit and do something? They have to pretend they're flying and it's a flight simulator essentially. And they get spun around really fast. And then they black out and when they black out Jim wintery, the researcher measures how long they're blacked out. What happens? Do they convulse don't they convulse all kinds of various things.

Speaker 2:          11:49          The result and they're called back. They try to get them to wake up.

Speaker 1:          11:52          Yes they do. No, right.

Speaker 6:          11:54          Yeah. I guess that's what saying. Um, so, so we're going to play I guess a minute and a half clip from that piece. Um, they essentially they, those two over there asked these pilots, well what does that like tell us about the experiment. Give us a sort of sense of, of, of how that, how that was for you. Scared

Speaker 7:          12:15          pilots don't do scared.

Speaker 5:          12:17          [inaudible] 10 [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          12:24          the task was to chase this little airplane. So I'd sit there and you'd follow it. And first couple of maneuvers would be, you know, three gs g forces as they is the, well it's like a tick when you're on a rollercoaster, five gs that forest pins you back in your seat. Yeah. Seven gs. Except really on a roller coaster. You're only ever going to experience about two gs and then nine gs. Nothing like these guys. The Hydro g forces hurt

Speaker 8:          12:48          the skin on your face, sags your eyelids sag so low that you can't see out from under him and you end up tilt your head back to look out from under your own eyelids that are shaking down in front of your face. Meanwhile, yes,

Speaker 7:          12:59          you're tensing all your leg muscles and your abdominal muscles in your arm muscles as hard as you can. Learn to use your body to fight it. And what you do is you tend to every muscle from your toes to your calves,

Speaker 8:          13:09          push it out, push it all the way up, all the way up, okay. And uh, you take a breath, right?

Speaker 7:          13:15          And you start to say the word Hook and you hold it for three seconds and then you finish it off by finishing the k of the hook through these pilots. They sound like they're wrestling or fighting or something. They're grunting and groaning and hook.

Speaker 5:          13:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          13:39          making all these hook noises,

Speaker 5:          13:45          select that

Speaker 7:          13:46          the most you have ever pulled was 12.4 gs. Now you can understand when you listen to that, there's a couple of tensions that I, you know, that were introduced. How do we know that what we've just heard is a real thing? All right. Our thing,

Speaker 6:          14:04          well, um, I see where you're going with this. Um, I, the Ed Moreau kind of ques. Sure, sure. Um, these are real interviews. If that's, I mean, just to sort of clarify. Um, they were done very much not knowing how they would be sort of composed and arranged in the, in the, in the, uh, in the final product. It just so happened in the case of the hook, that's just something that pilots do. And every pilot that they talked to made that sound and it's something, there's something very visceral in percussive and musical about that moment. So when you get to that moment where they actually do the hook, it becomes a kind of musical event at that point, you know, which is, I think one of the secrets of our notion to storytelling is that it is a musical. You're trying, you're playing with rhythm, you're playing with meter, you're playing with beats. So when you've got these sort of great vocal, whatever those are, you just treat them almost as, as a composer with notes.

Speaker 2:          15:03          I think you have a raw interview with a pilot, do you not and you have that enhanced one. I think it'd be interesting just to hear what it sounds like when they did it and what it sounds like after he

Speaker 6:          15:13          abused it and then, so let's just hear this. Do we need to set this up at all? This piece? Yeah, I'll do the setup. This is a one of one of our guys that we heard just a moment ago. His name is Tim Sestak. He's, if you can imagine the course of this experiment getting spun around, spin around, spin around while he blacks out. This is the moment which he comes to or he's recalling that moment and he's in this little pod and he has to kind of assess the situation.

Speaker 7:          15:40          When I woke up, I remember just sitting there and I mean this little white space. I actually had no idea who I was, where I was sure what I was doing. So I'm sitting in this little white ball and I'm looking around and I hear this beeping. There was this white light beeping, and then at that moment I realize that I'm in a little room and that I'm supposed to do something in that. One of the things I'm supposed to do is press that button. Should I press the button? And at that moment I realized, holy Macron a pilot. I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying it. And I grabbed the controls and then just in a giant rush. I'm Tim Sestak. Holy Mackerel. Tim says stack. I'm Tim Stack. I'm a pilot. I'm flying in the centrifuge all came back to me at once and I was okay.

Speaker 6:          16:29          Alright, so that's the wrong sun sound design. Let me just go right ahead now see what you did. Do it.

Speaker 5:          16:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          16:37          when I woke up, I remember just sitting there and I'm in this little white space. I actually had no idea who I was, who am I, where I was or what I was doing? Why am I doing this? I'm sitting in this little white ball and I'm looking around and what is this all about? I hear this beeping. There's this white light beeping.

Speaker 9:          16:58          Okay.

Speaker 7:          16:58          And then at that moment I realize that I'm in a little room and that I'm supposed to do something in that. One of the things I'm supposed to do is press that button. Should I press the button?

Speaker 5:          17:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          17:11          and at that moment I realized, holy macro on a pilot and I'm in an airplane and I'm not flying it. And I grabbed the controls and then just giant run.

Speaker 7:          17:23          I'm Tim Sestak, Holly macro. I'm Tim Sestak. I'm too obsessed. Jack. I'm a pilot. I'm flying in the centrifuge all came back to me at once and I was okay.

Speaker 8:          17:33          Okay. Commando [inaudible] Dr Minute, how are you feeling again? Am I to go home time

Speaker 2:          17:44          now? You see there's a real difference there. I mean, there are, there are stunning silences. There are times when the sounds are slightly piled up on each other and the instinct to do that will raise in some quarters some questions like, you know, like who's the, what experience are we having here? [inaudible] hours or he is at the same time. I mean, here's our argument. I mean anticipating that someone might have this problem, we are manipulating reality to a degree, but it is the, it is the music that we create. It is in some way our sort of,

Speaker 6:          18:17          yeah, I mean how I would, how I would put it as that. Um, in the case of the thing you just heard, it's a little sort of story lit that has, you know, he's, he's in a white space. He's doing all these things as a story. I mean, you have to follow the story I guess. I mean I think people are savvy enough to know that when you are leading them in places that the story doesn't want them to go. And in that moment, I mean there are, you look for the transfer transformation moments. Like he has five or six points where he wakes up, you know, he's in a white space kind of womb. Like all of a sudden, oh my God, I'm in a plane, I have to fly the plane. And then, oh my God, I'm Tim says stack. It's like this whole journey of life in this little like moment and so all that the sound is doing there, I mean there is some emotional information's being conveyed, but really it's just sort of hammering each point of transformation. It's saying it's sort of like in a kind of punctuational way, it's giving a kind of explanation point on each one

Speaker 2:          19:11          and, and we do this to ourselves in this sections in which we're talking back and forth and arguing and they are real actual conversations. We are very conscious of the musicality. So there will be times when he will say basically take it down or things like that rather frequently. Yes. Cause I, this is like a difference in age. I mean if, if you're born in the fifties and sixties and stuff or you're born in the eighties and nineties I think you have different jokes, different music, different conversations in your head, a whole different set of how you read life. And when I often noticed with Ellen and Shannon, some of the people that I have to work with who are younger than me is I'll come in and I'll say, okay, here's how we should do this. The Guy, I look up to, a follower, Robert, Robert, quiet. Yeah, they do that. And so I accused him of this intense, ridiculous desire for irony and distance. And I feel that I'm being blamed for my own heart pounding. I an opinion

Speaker 6:          20:07          deference to you. We, you often tell us to get interested, stop being so mellow. And then that's also,

Speaker 2:          20:14          but we are having absolutely a generational struggle in the middle of all this because what I love to hear and with he and g and them love to hear are actually different sounds. And so you really whack each other. What we end up doing in these conversations in the studio is I go, those are my comments. I'm the less, I go last and goes, we have the Lego Llamas. I go, yeah. I said, yeah, that was, yeah. You know, and then I look at Ellen and I said, that was young. That was good. And it's frankly in comprehensible to me, it's still even now, I mean to sort

Speaker 6:          20:48          of bring this grid, it is the middle space, the middle space between your tendency toward want to sort of uh, perform in a more forward way. My tendency to want to kind of lean back there is that middle ground which I I hope to show kind of lives in, which I neither of us could come up with on our own. No,

Speaker 1:          21:06          and we both share it. Fairness, this idea about touching at a distance. Okay. Here I played a clip from one of my personal heroes. Walter Merge is a great film editor who did the Godfather apocalypse now called mountain, a million other great movies and he's a great thinker about editing and sound.

Speaker 10:         21:25          As far as we can tell from the evolutionary record, the oldest sense that we have is either the sense of smell or the sense of touch that that's how Ubers and bacteria is used to navigate around in the world. Hearing is a very refined sense of touch and it developed of all the five senses. It's the latest to be developed by living entities, owners. The paradox about hearing is that as the child is growing in the wound, it's the first of the senses to get hooked up about four and a half months after conception, which is to say halfway through gestation, the trial begins to hear now the child was not seeing anything because it's dark in there. The child isn't tasting anything or smelling anything but hearing for all intents and purposes, the world into which the child is developing that, which is to say the mother's middle is full of sound. It's got the weather's heartbeat 24 hours a day. It's got her breathing 24 hours a day, the gurgling of her intestines at certain times of day. It's got her voice and remembering that the wound is pretty thin, there's nothing to prevent sounds from outside. The father's a music penetrating in and being heard by the developing child.

Speaker 1:          22:52          So sound as touch starts way, way early. Okay. So moving right along, we then played a clip from a segment from our musical language show, which looks at a particular piece of music, Igor Stravinsky's rite of spring, and what it can teach us about how our brains deal with unpleasant noises. In 1913, Stravinsky premiered the rite of spring. It was a ballet. Nijinsky did the choreography and when it premiered, all hell broke loose. Robert and Jonah layer do the play by play.

Speaker 6:          23:27          So let's begin first. Uh, Jonah, what, how does this, um, just set the scene? This is May, 1913. The spring night. It's a, it's a balmy summer night. Black Tie costumes. The women have their fedoras. This was evening clothes. Yeah. Well, this was the Russian ballet. This was high art.

Speaker 4:          23:47          And the program's had, this is a concert about springtime, but as they settled into their seats, it turns out that what's driven ski had in mind was not spring like honeybees. No, this spring Stravinsky had in mind was about change, about radical change, ritual murder. Literally, that's what the story of the play is. It's, it's a pagan ritual where the end, the virgin gets massacred. Oh dear.

Speaker 5:          24:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          24:17          but the music itself is fascinating. The beginning is this very charming bassoon. It's a classic Lithuanian folk and it does sound like the earth is warming and that lasts for about a minute. And then we get some Tutti of flutes and it's lovely. It's getting a little more disturbing. And then about three minutes into it

Speaker 11:         24:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          24:49          everything changes. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          24:59          there's this, there's just an earthquake. Stravinsky plays this cord

Speaker 5:          25:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:06          there's a great story that when Diaghilev who's the head of the ballet reus first heard this cord insurance. He was playing on the piano for him. He asked her Wanski how long will it go on like that. And Stravinsky looked at him and said to the end, my dear. And, and it literally does that cord structures, the music

Speaker 5:          25:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:25          it's one of the most difficult sounds you've ever heard. It is. It is just the stereotype of desinence. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          25:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          25:33          it hurts you, Huh? Well what happened? Well, after about three minutes, they ride it. They rided meaning what? Like they scream or through, they scream. There was blood old ladies were hitting each other with canes. One Lady Lady, she had a gun and hit Stravinsky with a cane. But once they started screaming, Stravinsky ran backstage and by some counselors crying, the ski was off on the side of the stage screaming to his dancers to keep the beat. Dude. Wow. Quite the fiasco. And the question is why,

Speaker 6:          26:15          you know, what I love about that is that it's three minutes simply to ask a question, which is a question we're interested in, which is like, why does music sometimes create such a like intense emotion, not always good emotion. And the why that we go on to sort of answer, uh, subsequently is that, um, there, it turns out, and this is new science and it's speculative science, we should say there is, there are already these gangs of neurons and a particular part of your brain called the auditory that are responsible for decoding new sounds, sounds that you've never heard before. And they generally do a really good job, but every so often they hear sounds, which are relentlessly new, which it was in this case. And there it never goes back to the sounds. They know. And in those cases, when they fail and they can't decode the sounds, they squirt out some dopamine. And dopamine is not always a bad thing and little dopamine makes you feel happy. That's why sex and drugs and chocolate and various things make you feel good. But too much dopamine has been shown clinically to cause schizophrenia. Now we don't want to oversimplify schizophrenia, but perhaps, and this is the argument we put forward, what happened that night was that their brains flooded with dopamine and they literally went crazy.

Speaker 2:          27:32          And then we go on to propose that a year later in Paris, a year later, this same guy comes back to the same hall, plays the same piece of music and this time he's carried out on the shoulders of the crowd. 25 years later, Mickey mouse is performing this particular piece with Tuscanini and it's become almost kitty music. So then we asked what happened? How did the music that was so fear, so new and so disturbing on Monday become kitty music on Thursday. And that leads to to another notion about the brain, that it is a very conservative organ and it steals from artists. Yeah. Yeah. She could have to explain that a little bit, but I don't think I will. But what was very cool afterwards is it turns out that with this speculative notion, again, Walter Mitch will conclude with welder merge Walter Verge on the phone with Ellen is talking. He, we send them the piece and say, what do you think? And he says, not only do I think this, I did this

Speaker 10:         28:25          well number of years ago, I was working at a radio station in New York, which is now defunct, called wr VR. And I was assigned the job of catalog in the record collection. Then they played mostly classical music. They had a jazz section, but it was mostly classical music. I found myself in the basement in a room full of records and I was supposed to type out a card for each of the records and I thought, well, I'll just use this opportunity to teach myself musical history. So I began at the beginning of what they had, which was a couple of shelves of Gregorian chants

Speaker 12:         29:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         29:04          and so for two weeks I saturated myself in that music from nine o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock at night, whatever. I went home listening to nothing but those tonalities

Speaker 12:         29:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         29:20          then for some reason I had to go up to the control booth to ask Gordon the the engineer or question. So I ran up the stairs and opened the door to this car company of sounds and, and I, I had for a moment exactly what I imagined the people at the rite of spring experienced, which was a of a cognitive dissonance. What is this? Why is this radio station playing this kind of musical nonsense? I literally clap my hands to my ears and said, Gordon, what? What is this music? And he sort of casually leaned over and picked up the album and it was box St Matthew Passion.

Speaker 1:          30:01          No, if you've never heard buck's Saint Matthew Passion is what it sounds like.

Speaker 13:         30:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          30:10          oh, the horror.

Speaker 10:         30:13          Two weeks I had managed without knowing it, to reset the rural musical receptors to the kind of music that existed before the 16th century.

Speaker 13:         30:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         30:33          we think of Bach as being in the symbol itself of musical respectability. And yet here I was coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon Bar and hearing the dissonances that are dissonant only when you compare them with the 15th 16th centuries.

Speaker 13:         30:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          30:59          around this time we took some questions from the audience and one came up that's near and dear to our hearts. Someone asked if we felt we were constrained by, by radio, by the medium, by having no visuals. And here's the answer we gave.

Speaker 2:          31:13          Now what I would say is that you have to kind of reset. But I think for a lot of people, the, that you know, you're cutting your carrots, you're driving along and um, if we are doing this right, you should not be having that feeling that you should actually be having something close to a Richard feeling. Because here's the deal. If I'm on TV and I say to you, all right, let's imagine a mountain and on the top of the man lives, but go little house on TV. I have no choice. I have to make the mountain my mountain and put it on a little house, my house, not your house and you will see it in a piece of furniture in your room across the distance and you will stare at my house on my mountain. And many of you will have some exception about whether you don't, it's not Emilia House, what kind of it is that? Whereas in this case you are unwittingly coauthors. If I say make a mountain, that's your mountain. If I say add a house, that's your house and I'm indoors, I am in your hand already, so it's a, I think we'll have to just basically operate on you.

Speaker 1:          32:10          I said there are just sort of to to play the other side for a second. There are moments there've been one that I could call the mind where the, the lack of a picture was frustrating to us. We were doing a show about us swarming behavior and emergence and this sort of crowds coming together and forming a, a personality irrespective of the individuals and the swarming footage of uh, of what are those spirits called? Starling, starling flocking behavior. It's, it's indescribable when you see pictures. It, that was the one time where were uh, being sort of this felt like a constraint only using sound but generally it's about creating pictures and that are much more rich as he was saying in, in your brain.

Speaker 2:          32:51          I know, I'll be honest, they are occasions where I really wished I could be on television for certain things. Yeah. Cause their TV's good at some stuff. Uh, but abstract stuff t v is when you approach television with an abstract thought, television itself looks you right in the face and it goes. So uh, radio is a little bit more helpful in that regard. However, if you're murdering someone and someone is dying and screaming, go TV, go TV on that one.
