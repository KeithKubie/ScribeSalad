00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.368
For the first inequality, we are basically looking for y-values along the pink

00:00:04.368 --> 00:00:08.460
curve that are greater than the y-value of the purple curve, since the pink

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.816
corresponds with the left side of the equation and the purple corresponds with

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.254
the right side of the equation, I mean, when the left to be greater than right.

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:21.274
So, the line y equals x squared minus 16 is above the line y equals 0, well,

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:25.594
above the purple line. That means that the x -value of any point, on the pink

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:30.245
line that's above the purple line, should satisfy this inequality. let's check

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:34.782
one just to be sure. Well these end points, these points of the intersection,

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:39.383
are the points negative 4, 0 and 4, 0. So, that means that the x-values in this

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:43.604
region above the purple line, x is less than negative 4 in this portion of the

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:47.864
curve, and x is greater than 4 over here. And remember, that was the solution

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:52.088
set we found for this inequality so that's perfect. Almost exactly the same

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:56.806
thing happens in graph b. Again, solutions are found above the purple line since

00:00:56.806 --> 00:01:01.303
we want x squared to be greater than 16 and y equals 16 is the purple line. The

00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:06.838
points of intersection, in this case, are negative 4, 16 and 4, 16. Even though

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:11.875
the y-values of those points are different, the x-values are exactly the same.

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:16.660
In fact, this graph is simply the same as a, just shifted upward 16. To be

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.223
clear, each inequality that we're looking at only has one variable in it. We

00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:25.594
only care about x-values. What these graphs help us do is portion out the

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:30.659
coordinate planes that we can see which x-values do satisfy these equations. So,

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.139
over here in graph a, any points in either the region to the left or this region

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:39.493
to the right, we'll have x-values that satisfy this equation. The areas that

00:01:39.493 --> 00:01:43.321
aren't shaded in are areas where we can't guarantee whether or not the x-values

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:47.193
will satisfy this, and we have a similar thing happening in graph b. I know that

00:01:47.193 --> 00:01:51.079
connecting graphs to inequalities in this way might seem a little bit confusing

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.511
at first, but hopefully you at least thought that it was interesting.
