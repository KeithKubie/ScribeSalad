HILLARY BERGH: Hello.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.730
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.715
I'm here with Chef Carla Hall.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.290
It's very exciting
to be here with you.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.480
So, those of you
that don't know,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.150
she was a finalist on the
fifth and the eighth season

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.140
of "Top Chef" on
Bravo-- yes-- and is

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.440
a current co-host
on "the Chew" talk

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.440
show on ABC, which is
a lot of fun to watch.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.177
So we're here, or she's here.

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:29.510
We're going to talk about the
new book, "Carla's Comfort

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.700
Foods."

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.120
Yes.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.790
I'm the chef at Root Cafe.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.405
My name's Hillary Bergh, and--

00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:36.840
CARLA HALL: [APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.480
HILLARY BERGH: Thank you.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.700
CARLA HALL: I ate
there yesterday.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.372
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.205
It was a lot of fun.

00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:42.540
We had a little chat
over lunch, impromptu.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.190
And then today, we did a
whole menu based on her book.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.380
So hopefully, some of you
were able to join for that.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.760
And, if not, now you know
that next time, when there's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.160
a chef on campus, I write
a menu from their book.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.780
You have another
book that you wrote.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.970
CARLA HALL: Uh-huh.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.050
"Cooking With Love."

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.459
And it's primarily comfort
foods from the Sunday suppers

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.500
where I grew up in Nashville,
Tennessee, and also

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.570
a lot of the recipes
that I did on Top Chef--

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.290
the chicken pot pie, the Jimmy
Fallon-- that's in there.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.890
The Last Supper Buttered
Tarragon Peas are in this book.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.660
But the meal that I did
at Ellis Island-- that's

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.650
in there-- that I
really thought I

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.390
should have won
because it was so good.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.160
But I didn't.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.340
So that's in there.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.720
The oyster stew, where I won
the car, that's in there.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.100
Anything that won a prize is
in there-- or I should have won

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.319
is in there.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.360
HILLARY BERGH: Very good.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.170
And then, you and some of the
other co-hosts on "The Chew"

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.520
wrote a cookbook together, too.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.270
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.360
Well, we "wrote" it,
in that we're on ABC,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.350
and we work there, and
they took our recipes

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.190
and put them in that book.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.940
HILLARY BERGH: OK.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.082
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:05.010
CARLA HALL: (WHISPERING)
Crap, it's video.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.979
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.312
CARLA HALL: (WHISPERING) We
don't get paid for that one.

00:02:10.312 --> 00:02:13.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.110
HILLARY BERGH: So
anyway, all right.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.820
Well, I really liked how much
you spoke about connections

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.880
through food.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.650
And I'm sure that you noticed,
when we ate yesterday,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.940
there's a lot of communal
tables in the cafes,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.610
and when you got to go around.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.260
So, can you speak a
little about how important

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.660
that is to not only just
be eating good food,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.164
but to make these connections?

00:02:38.164 --> 00:02:39.830
CARLA HALL: Right,
it's about community.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.820
Well, the inspiration
for this book

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:50.170
came from the political
climate, our polarizing, very

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.600
dysfunctional political climate.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.950
In 2012, when I
was thinking, it's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.280
so terrible that they polarize
each other's differences,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.010
and it's like repelling magnets.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.470
And I was thinking, how
can I show through food

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.680
how we're very
similar as people?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.290
And our differences
should be celebrated.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.120
So the spices, basically,
are the differences.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.340
And it should be celebrated.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.880
So take the first
set of recipes that I

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.820
thought about that
would actually

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.160
share my thinking was
chicken and milk gravy, which

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.910
is basically a smothered
chicken dish in the South,

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.270
like sausage and gravy, that
white gravy that you put on

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.382
that you hope is not
too thick that's yummy?

00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.090
OK, so that's the
chicken and milk gravy.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.700
But if you take the milk out and
you add sour cream and paprika,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.850
you could be in Hungary.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.440
If you take the milk out and you
add heavy cream, dijon mustard,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.210
white wine, and tarragon,
you could be in France.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.170
Or if you take the milk out
and you add tomatoes, habanero

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.370
peppers, and maybe
plantains or bananas,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.150
you could be in West Africa.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.230
But at the end of
the day, they're

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.790
all a smothered chicken dish.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.810
You're just changing the spices.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.060
And they should be celebrated.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.730
It shouldn't be where, well,
I eat smothered chicken

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.490
where I live with milk gravy.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.305
And just because you're having
it with wine and heavy cream,

00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:14.680
I don't like you, and I'm
never going to taste your food.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.170
I mean, how crazy is that?

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.180
And so this is what
this book is about.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.103
And it's about sharing and
honoring and celebrating

00:04:21.103 --> 00:04:22.019
people and their food.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.922
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah,
that's wonderful.

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:25.630
We spoke a little bit
yesterday about how

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.434
my cafe goes all around the
world in our menu, and--

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.225
CARLA HALL: I know.

00:04:29.225 --> 00:04:30.410
Have you guys been there?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.910
Right?

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.274
I mean, I know you
work here, right.

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:34.690
Of course you've been there.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.150
I'm just so amazed how you were
in Cambodia, and then Russia,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.750
and then you were
in the Philippines.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.540
It was amazing.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.474
Like, day after day.

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:45.140
It wasn't like you've
got all this stuff

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.640
and you get to turn
it over after a week.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.806
That's a lot of work, y'all.

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:48.830
That's a lot of work.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.135
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:50.134
No, it is a lot of work.

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:51.920
But it's interesting
for my cooks.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.510
They get to apply
this technique where

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.650
it's the same basic
technique with just

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.350
a few little moderations of
what the ingredients are.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.540
So it's really
unique, and you get

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.869
to learn about that in the book.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.660
CARLA HALL: So one of
the things that I do.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.284
I mean, in the book, of course,
there are all of these recipes.

00:05:08.284 --> 00:05:10.550
And in the vegetable
chapter, I will

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.370
take my favorite vegetables
because it's my book.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.191
So peas-- I mean, you know, I
may never get to do it again.

00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:20.732
So when you write your book,
you put your favorite vegetables

00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:22.330
in it.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.570
But peas, corn,
squash, cauliflower.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.360
So I take my favorite
vegetables and I change them

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.130
with those spices.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.050
But let's say that
you are somebody

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.290
who cooks a lot at home.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.320
There's a spice chart.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.710
I have the international
spice chart.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.877
And in that spice chart,
you have the aromatics,

00:05:41.877 --> 00:05:43.960
which would be your fresh
ingredients like onions,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.820
garlic, peppers, all of that.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.690
And then, you have
you're fresh herbs.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.900
And then, you have
your dried spices,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.280
the things that make
that cuisine unique,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.500
and then whatever
miscellaneous ingredients.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.200
So I have these 18
different cuisines.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.237
So, let's say you
make a meatloaf

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:02.320
and you want to change it.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.680
You already know how
to make meatloaf.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.686
So, now what you
do to change it up

00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:08.640
is to go to one of
those different cuisines

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.060
and just mix it up a little bit.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.969
So now, instead of one recipe,
you have 18 different recipes.

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:13.760
HILLARY BERGH: Mhm.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.470
Yeah, the spice chart
was really cool.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.215
CARLA HALL: Yeah.

00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:18.520
Did you agree with
it or disagree?

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.910
HILLARY BERGH: I agreed, yeah.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.215
I wanted to add a few
more things on there.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:22.491
CARLA HALL: I know, I know.

00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.199
And let me tell you
why I didn't exactly.

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.124
Did you want to add things that
were more exotic or-- right.

00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:29.540
HILLARY BERGH:
Some unique things.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.831
CARLA HALL: Some unique things.

00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.810
And I didn't do
that specifically

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.346
because when you think
about international food,

00:06:37.346 --> 00:06:39.720
you think that you have to go
to a specialty food market.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.220
And I'm honestly trying to
make this so approachable to--

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.154
and I think about
Middle America.

00:06:46.154 --> 00:06:47.820
I just want to make
it very approachable

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.490
for them, so that they're
not going to get scared.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.970
And not only are the
ingredients approachable,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.160
but the recipes
are approachable.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.900
The time.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.380
I thought about, can you make
a lot of them during the week?

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.217
So I steered away from
those exotic things.

00:07:02.217 --> 00:07:03.550
HILLARY BERGH: That makes sense.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.050
Yeah.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.294
And there's not a Middle Eastern
market on the corner of every--

00:07:07.294 --> 00:07:08.460
CARLA HALL: --store in Iowa.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.780
HILLARY BERGH: Right.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.410
Yes.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.520
So, cool.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.006
So I know that you were inspired
by your grandma, Thelma.

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:16.630
You didn't get to
really cook with her,

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.450
but inspired by
her, which is great.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.700
CARLA HALL: Thelma and Granny.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.020
I have two grand-- Yeah.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.910
My grandmothers cooked
so well, and it just

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.290
leaped right over my mom.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.480
You know, whoop!

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.120
HILLARY BERGH: Well, it happens.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.080
And I had a lot of fun
growing up and cooking

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.429
with my grandma [? Idebel. ?]

00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:33.470
[? CARLA HALL: Idebel? ?]

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.636
[? HILLARY BERGH: Idebel. ?]

00:07:34.636 --> 00:07:35.789
CARLA HALL: Oh my-- cute!

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.330
Freddie Mae and [? Idebel, ?]
they would've been-- oh my god.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.660
Together, they are a pair.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.035
HILLARY BERGH:
Best friends, yes.

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:43.880
So how important is it to
get our youth involved,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.130
and to pass down
these traditions?

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.380
CARLA HALL: It's so important.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.588
As a matter of fact, the
first cookbook that I wrote,

00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:51.850
I was actually thinking
about my niece.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.030
Now, my sister
doesn't like to cook.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.130
My niece kind of likes to cook.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.870
We weren't there
with my grandmother.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.400
I didn't start cooking
until I was about 25

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.680
and went to culinary
school at 30.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.351
And so then, I was trying
to backpedal and say,

00:08:07.351 --> 00:08:08.600
oh, gosh, what are you making?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.520
And then, my grandma Thelma
had passed away already.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.690
And then my grandmother, Granny,
Freddie Mae, she was already

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.040
in her late 80s,
going into her 90s.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.670
By the way, my mother was still
going to Lebanon, Tennessee,

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.870
30 miles outside of
Nashville, to get those Sunday

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.720
suppers to take to
work for her lunch.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.970
OK, I'm just saying.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.890
I mean, my grandmother was
still cooking for my mom at 94.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.096
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:32.470
Let's see, my
grandmother was 92,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.580
and she was still cooking
every Sunday for all of us.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.419
CARLA HALL: Right?

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:36.130
You know?

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.559
And then you don't realize
that they were sick

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.058
until the macaroni
started slipping.

00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:41.828
And you're like,
wait, are you OK?

00:08:41.828 --> 00:08:43.280
I mean--

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.300
HILLARY BERGH: This is a
little different, right?

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.636
CARLA HALL: Yeah.

00:08:44.636 --> 00:08:45.135
Right.

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:45.880
What happened?

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.010
You notice in the food.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.720
It's that you're
talking to them,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.950
but you're really
focused on the food.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.450
OK.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.380
So anyway.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.780
It's so important
for those traditions

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.230
to be carried down the line.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.310
And unless the kids
are actually in there--

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.880
and I think with our
food-- and even though I'm

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.370
talking about
international food,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.780
I really like the fact
that we can keep our food

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.170
segregated so it's not so
homogenized and blending

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.030
with other cuisines.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.340
Because it's about history.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.690
It's like this [? grio ?] that
you're passing on these stories

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:17.260
along.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.010
And it's nice.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.860
And if they all mix,
then, for the generations

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.420
that are younger than us, they
forget what Southern food is,

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.260
or what Indian food is, or what
all of these different cuisines

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.760
are.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.570
HILLARY BERGH: Honoring
that authenticity.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.500
CARLA HALL: Exactly.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.090
Exactly.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.640
And just loving
it for what it is.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.060
And then you can
mix, but as long

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.510
as they know what
the original was.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.770
But I think, because of
shows like the Food Network

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.930
and Bravo and "Chopped" and
all of these different shows,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.450
kids are getting more
involved in food,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.120
and the world is
getting smaller.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.445
And they're actually
putting chefs on pedestals.

00:09:55.445 --> 00:09:58.110
I don't know if that's so
great, but the great thing

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.770
is, they want to be cooks.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.980
And they want to
eat different foods.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.750
And they're playing
with their food,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.860
unlike back in the
day when they're like,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.880
I will only eat a grilled
cheese and plain rice

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.080
and plain chicken.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.650
Now, I heard a kid-- I
was at a grocery store--

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.290
and the kid was
crying because they

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.014
didn't have the
sushi that he wanted.

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:19.802
And I wasn't even here.

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:22.470
I mean, I could understand if
I was here on the west coast.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.145
I was in-- I mean, because I'm
sure all the kids are like,

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.690
ah, I don't like that
sushi, I want-- you know.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.590
But I was in Maryland.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.279
And I'm like, oh my
god, that's crazy.

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.320
No, it was in Pittsburgh.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.570
HILLARY BERGH: Oh, that's cool.

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:34.840
CARLA HALL: Right?

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.710
Isn't that cool?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.330
HILLARY BERGH: Surprising.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:37.225
CARLA HALL: It was
very surprising.

00:10:37.225 --> 00:10:38.680
I'm like, kid, you cry.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.970
You cry for your sushi!

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:40.665
HILLARY BERGH: That's right.

00:10:40.665 --> 00:10:41.561
CARLA HALL: You know.

00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:42.060
Right?

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.893
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:45.830
There's a child care center.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.360
Not here on campus, but
there's four of them

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.390
that the Googlers can
send their kids to.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.160
And the chef there has
told me many stories where

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.910
the parents have
called her and said,

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.110
my kid is asking for this
quinoa salad that you made.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.080
My kid is asking for
these kale chips.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.450
Can you-- how do I make them?

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:04.057
What is this?

00:11:04.057 --> 00:11:04.890
CARLA HALL: Exactly.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.110
HILLARY BERGH: So
it's really cool.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.318
CARLA HALL: It's really cool.

00:11:07.318 --> 00:11:09.500
And that's what's so
important about kids

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.340
being involved in food.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.930
Because what happens,
I think, as adults,

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.280
we tend to put them
in these boxes.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.050
But when kids have
an experience,

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.970
and they take that
experience home,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.890
then they're broadening
their parents'

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.280
idea of what they would want.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.363
And so then, the parents
are getting those things.

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:28.940
And it's this big cycle
that should continue.

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.250
And it's so beautiful to see.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.110
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah,
it is, for sure.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.970
So you alluded a little bit
to TV a few minutes ago.

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.660
What are some secrets you
might be able to share with us?

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.810
Because, is there
really cooking going on?

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.370
CARLA HALL: There's
really cooking.

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.300
Some things not good.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.760
Some things are not a winner.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.840
There are some things,
and-- so we actually

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.950
do cook in real time.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.050
And some of the things
are so delicious.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.080
And a lot of times, you'll
see us start a dish.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.650
And then there's a
commercial break,

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.889
and we finish cooking that dish
during the commercial break.

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:00.180
And we come back and we eat it.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.580
Especially things that
cook very quickly.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.490
I mean, stews, you
can't do that with.

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.730
So you put them together,
and there's a slot.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.270
But for the most part, we
really try to do those quickly.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:12.644
Those dishes that cook
quickly, we are eating them.

00:12:12.644 --> 00:12:14.060
As a matter of
fact, we've kind of

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.351
got a little snobbish about it.

00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:18.120
So the culinary team will
bring some of those dishes

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.954
from the kitchen.

00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:20.370
But they were
cooked, because they

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.800
have to stagger everything
and make them ahead of time.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.770
And we're like, oh,
I don't want that.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.540
I want the dish that
was just cooked,

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.880
that's hot and delicious,
that Mario made.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.182
No offense to the kitchen
staff, but, you know.

00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:33.890
HILLARY BERGH: Well,
that's good to know,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.660
because that shows you how
quickly you can make something

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.290
at home, right?

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.040
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.400
I mean the "5 in 5"
that Michael does,

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.940
his little segment
called "5 in 5."

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.950
So it's five ingredients,
five minutes or less,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.320
and he makes it right there.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.350
So if it takes Michael
five minutes-- I mean,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.570
maybe it's going to take
somebody at home 20 minutes.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.660
But still, that's fast, to
get dinner on the table.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.230
And sometimes, his
pan will be too hot,

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.780
and there are all kinds of
antics that are going on.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.280
And Mario is like, yeah, chef.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.310
You haven't had the pasta in,
and you have one minute left.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.170
Yeah, let's see if
you're going to make it.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.610
But it's still really
fun to show people

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.177
that they can have a really
quick meal under 30 minutes.

00:13:12.177 --> 00:13:13.510
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.150
And I know that all of you
are working long hours.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.020
I'm certainly
working long hours.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.060
So little tips and
tricks, anything else

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:21.160
you might share with us?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.170
So we need to watch the
show for the "5 in 5."

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.045
CARLA HALL: Yeah, you
need to watch the show.

00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:28.630
Here's a funny story.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.909
It has nothing to do with food.

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:33.450
HILLARY BERGH: We're
ready, I'm sure.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.260
CARLA HALL: So when
the show first started,

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.070
I had to get used to-- the
transition from "Top Chef"

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.940
to where I'm just
cooking and there happens

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.260
to be a camera-- to actually
hosting a show where you're

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.080
cooking, you're
talking to a guest,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.040
you're telling the audience
a little bit about yourself,

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.390
all of these things.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.220
You're juggling.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.060
It's really harder
than you think.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.370
I mean, it's multitasking
like nobody's business.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.250
And we have found,
and studies of shown,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.196
that multitasking
really doesn't work.

00:14:08.196 --> 00:14:11.024
But it's kind of boring when
you have to cook something

00:14:11.024 --> 00:14:12.690
and you're just like,
whatever, hold on,

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.481
and you're just focusing
on that one thing.

00:14:14.481 --> 00:14:16.240
So you have to multitask, OK.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.520
So I have an IFB in my ear
where the executive producer

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.340
talks in your ear.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:23.630
And he helps you go along.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.540
If you need to move on,
he will say, hey, move on.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:32.180
He'll say, "great"
and then you move on.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.030
"Fantastic," you move on.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:36.400
So this was in the
beginning before I'm

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.935
used to someone
talking in my ear.

00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:39.490
Usually, if I hear
voices in my head,

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.470
they're mine, not somebody
else's with this deep voice

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.150
with an Australian accent.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.330
So I have the IFB.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.550
I'm actually interviewing
this person, I'm cooking,

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.030
and I'm doing this egg dish.

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.210
And he just keeps
saying "egg," "egg."

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.430
And he just keeps saying it.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.980
That's all he's saying, "egg."

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.310
So I'm hearing "egg."

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:07.040
And let say I'm interviewing
you, and I'm like, "egg."

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.690
He says "egg." "Egg."

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.125
I'm literally
saying it out loud.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:12.590
I just keep saying "egg."

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.860
And then, I look
over at Michael.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.220
He's like this,
cracking up laughing.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.290
Because I'm like, why
does he keep saying "egg"?

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.590
He doesn't say, "put the
egg," "don't forget the egg."

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.450
So he just says this
one word, "egg."

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.720
So I'm like, you need
to give me more words.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.480
OK, so keep that in your head.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.280
So then, let's fast forward.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.280
Now it's season two.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.970
And this is what
I get in my ear.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.450
"Carla, well, you know,
what I think you should do

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.620
is talk to them about--
you know, there's an egg."

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.550
I'm like, why are you
giving me so many words?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.912
He's having a
conversation in my ear.

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:49.280
I'm like-- And so sometimes,
if you watch the show,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.180
I'm like this.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.000
Because I'm answering
those voices in my head,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.910
which is kind of crazy.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.290
The food is usually really good.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.050
You can tell.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.860
I don't fake it.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.019
If I don't like something,
my face really can't--

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:13.810
HILLARY BERGH: It's
not going to hold back.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:14.768
CARLA HALL: It doesn't.

00:16:14.768 --> 00:16:23.060
I'm like-- So most of the things
that Mario makes are delicious.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.890
I love me some Mario Batali.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:31.960
But one time, at band
camp, Mario made this dish.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960
It was panettone.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.700
Delicious.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.390
He made a French toast with
panettone with maple syrup.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.080
Delicious.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.124
And you know, Mario makes
really good meatballs

00:16:41.124 --> 00:16:42.040
with the tomato sauce.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.110
He actually has a tomato
sauce that you can buy.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.610
Delicious.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.220
But this particular
day, he decided

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.610
to take that meatball,
and that tomato sauce,

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.520
and that beautiful panettone
with that maple syrup,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.380
do a mashup.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.400
HILLARY BERGH: Uh-oh.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.536
CARLA HALL: Oh, no.

00:16:57.536 --> 00:16:59.800
I'm sure they don't
eat it in Italy.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.730
And I'm very sure they should
not have it here in America.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:03.590
It was not a winner.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:09.308
And I was like--
Yeah, it wasn't good.

00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:10.849
HILLARY BERGH: Did
he really like it?

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:11.890
He thought it was--

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:13.265
CARLA HALL: I was
looking at him,

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:19.619
and I said-- I said, do
you really like this?

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.410
Because when Mario doesn't
like something, he's like this.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:30.320
Like that one time that Clinton
decided to make an eggnog.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.250
And with raw eggs.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.200
OK.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.420
And Mario's like, I'm
not having that eggnog.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:39.000
Right.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.140
But everybody else had some.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.620
And on the way home, if
you were on the train--

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.899
HILLARY BERGH: Uh-oh.

00:17:50.899 --> 00:17:52.440
CARLA HALL: --you
were having issues.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.460
We were all texting
each other, saying,

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.460
I had to take a meeting.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.460
I had to run to the
bathroom and take a meeting.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.110
That's code for having to
go to the bathroom for us.

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.240
And it wasn't good.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.865
Mario said, I told
you guys not to have

00:18:06.865 --> 00:18:11.730
that eggnog with those fresh
eggs that weren't so fresh.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.230
HILLARY BERGH: Maybe if they
had been from someone's chicken

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.938
in the backyard--

00:18:14.938 --> 00:18:16.110
CARLA HALL: Exactly.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.574
Like "Portlandia,"
you knew that chicken.

00:18:18.574 --> 00:18:21.790
You're like, is that from Sam?

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.250
Sam, did you cluck
that chicken out?

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.470
Yes, exactly.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.273
But no, we didn't
know those chickens.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.860
HILLARY BERGH:
Nope, that's risky.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.399
Raw chicken.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:30.440
CARLA HALL: Risky, risky.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.190
A word to the wise.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.070
HILLARY BERGH: So, comfort
food, there's always

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.490
this stigma of it's
heavy, it's greasy.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.840
But you take a very healthy
approach here, which I like.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.960
I have a very healthy
approach in my cafe.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.300
And people that haven't
eaten my food yet-- or maybe

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.060
you can relate to
before you were famous--

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.990
and they look at me and they
go, but you're so skinny.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:57.205
Your food must not be good.

00:18:57.205 --> 00:18:57.490
CARLA HALL: Girl, I know.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.550
Never trust a skinny chef.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.942
You get that all
the time, right?

00:18:59.942 --> 00:19:00.413
HILLARY BERGH: Yes.

00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:01.830
CARLA HALL: Do
you eat your food?

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.100
HILLARY BERGH: Right?

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.310
CARLA HALL: I know, I know.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.990
I get it, too.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.360
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah?

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.443
CARLA HALL: I get it, too.

00:19:05.443 --> 00:19:07.600
HILLARY BERGH: So
what do you do?

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.030
CARLA HALL: The funny
thing is people,

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.790
oftentimes, they say, oh, you
have this healthy approach

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.870
to your food.

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.740
And I don't think
of it that way.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.860
I think that it's
just how I cook.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.430
I want to taste the food.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.540
I want to taste the ingredients.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.850
I want to taste the
vegetables that I'm using.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.112
So I don't want to put
a lot of fat into it.

00:19:26.112 --> 00:19:27.570
I don't want to
put a lot of bacon.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:29.100
If I'm having bacon,
I'm having bacon.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.933
But if I'm having grains,
I'm having grains.

00:19:30.933 --> 00:19:32.890
If I'm having hot
water cornbread, which

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.495
you guys probably
know nothing about,

00:19:35.495 --> 00:19:36.870
you can have a
little bit of fat.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.650
Has anybody had hot
water cornbread?

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.150
What?

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.629
Where are your
people from, girl?

00:19:40.629 --> 00:19:41.462
AUDIENCE: Louisiana.

00:19:41.462 --> 00:19:43.010
CARLA HALL: Ah!

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.640
OK, so hot water cornbread.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.069
Let's just take a little
time out, a little break.

00:19:48.069 --> 00:19:51.880
Hot water cornbread
is white cornmeal.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.790
And you have a
little bit of fat,

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:58.150
and some salt, and no sugar.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.700
By the way, Southerners,
for the most part,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.550
if they're real
Southerners, they

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:05.110
like everything sweet
but their cornbread.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.560
It's OK to drop a whole five
pounds of sugar in your tea.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.450
That's fine.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.840
But you do not put
it in the cornbread.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.482
And then, a little
bit of bacon fat.

00:20:13.482 --> 00:20:14.440
You know, bacon grease.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.070
And you make this
mush with hot water.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:20.280
You make a mush, and then you
make them into little patties

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.010
and you fry it.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.840
So inside, it's very tender, and
the outside is kind of crispy

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.550
because it fries
in the shallow oil.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.240
And that's what you
use with-- you have it

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.840
with beans and collard
greens and stews,

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.930
because it's for sopping.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.721
Which is why we don't
have sweet cornbread,

00:20:35.721 --> 00:20:37.972
because it's for sopping.

00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:39.430
Why did I start
talking about this?

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.940
HILLARY BERGH: We were
talking about healthy food

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.460
and the healthy approach.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.200
But fat is still good.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.080
There's fat in here.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.200
Fat is good, but--

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.970
CARLA HALL: Fat is good, but
I want to taste the food.

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:49.940
I want to taste it.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:57.210
And so my grandmother, who was
born in 1908, at a time when

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.200
people were having
a lot of hog jaws

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.220
and all of that in her food,
her husband-- my grandfather,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.010
[? Doc-- ?] had
high blood pressure.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.610
And so she took that
out of her food.

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.810
So I grew up having a lighter
version of Southern food.

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:18.880
And I think that
comfort food for me

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.230
is all the food that you
might have in your kitchen,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.870
where somebody who loves
you is making for you.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.510
And so, when you're
feeling low, you

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.920
go back to those food
memories for that thing.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.340
And so it changes for everybody.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.575
I mean, in San Francisco,
it may be your cioppino.

00:21:33.575 --> 00:21:35.300
And that doesn't have
a lot of fat in it.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.540
It's a seafood stew, right?

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.960
But it's different
for everybody.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.210
And I wanted to celebrate what
could be comfort food for one

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.427
and a delicacy for
another, or whatever.

00:21:47.427 --> 00:21:48.885
And that's with
this book is about.

00:21:48.885 --> 00:21:50.468
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah,
that's very cool.

00:21:50.468 --> 00:21:53.730
So, as a female in
our industry, we're

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.690
usually in the minority
in the kitchens.

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.130
I know that in many of the
departments here at Google,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.785
women are also the minority.

00:22:00.785 --> 00:22:01.910
CARLA HALL: Move over, men.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.506
They're coming.

00:22:03.506 --> 00:22:05.727
It is the year of the woman.

00:22:05.727 --> 00:22:07.060
I think the decade of the woman.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.700
OK, go ahead.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.090
Sorry.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:10.090
HILLARY BERGH: Well, can
you speak a little bit?

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.430
So, as a woman, how can
you empower yourself?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.540
How can you rise to the top and
not be intimidated or not be

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.040
called the B-word because
you're standing strong, or--

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.790
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.540
Right.

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.620
I think for me,
first off, I always

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.120
wanted to do something
that I loved.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.036
I mean, it was my job.

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:27.560
My parents told me, it's
your job to be happy.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.240
So wherever I am, I want to be.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.280
And there's confidence
that knowing that--

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.770
and also, I'm a Taurus.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.260
So I think my
stubbornness protects me.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.630
Because if I want to
be there, I'm all in.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.350
You can't tell me to leave.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.440
I'm all in.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:50.524
But I think what's also
helped me is that I'm tall.

00:22:50.524 --> 00:22:51.690
HILLARY BERGH: Yes, I agree.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.050
CARLA HALL: Right?

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.050
Especially in a kitchen.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.447
When you're around
a lot of men--

00:22:55.447 --> 00:22:57.860
no offense-- when you're
around a lot of guys,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.800
it helps that you are
tall because you're

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.280
looking at someone in the
eye versus looking at them

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.040
down here.

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:06.520
And I know that, in the
kitchen, some of my friends

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.080
who aren't as tall, they had a
totally different experience.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.770
And also, I was older when
I came into the kitchen.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.800
So I went to culinary
school at 30.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.000
So I came in at a time where
I knew I wanted to be here.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.520
I have left a career
that I didn't like.

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.650
So I'm here, and
I'm here to stay.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.510
And I knew that I
could work long hours.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.400
I know that I'm strong.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.190
Physically strong, as well
as just emotionally strong.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:35.030
So I think determination
has a lot to do with it.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.620
And just basically digging
your heels in and saying,

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.460
I'm here to stay.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.542
And I think, as women,
we apologize a lot

00:23:42.542 --> 00:23:43.750
because we're very nurturing.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.490
So we want everyone else
to feel really good.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.379
And we have to stop that.

00:23:49.379 --> 00:23:50.670
And it doesn't make us a bitch.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:51.740
So what?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.262
If you're-- oh.

00:23:53.262 --> 00:23:54.262
HILLARY BERGH: Oh, yeah.

00:23:54.262 --> 00:23:55.890
That's fine.

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.770
We've said it now.

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.160
Do you want me to say it
too, so you feel better?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.700
So there's no bitching.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.700
No bitches, right?

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.160
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:03.850
HILLARY BERGH: But
we're-- you know.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:04.730
No, we're not bitches.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.105
CARLA HALL: It's
like that-- What

00:24:06.105 --> 00:24:08.120
is the Keele and-- what is it?

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.030
Peele and-- Matthew?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.120
Peele and--

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.120
AUDIENCE: Key and Peele.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:12.828
CARLA HALL: Yeah.

00:24:12.828 --> 00:24:17.190
You know the Key and Peele,
with the bitch, with the wife.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.940
And they go on all
about the wives like--

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.312
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:24:21.312 --> 00:24:22.270
CARLA HALL: But anyway.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.370
But no, we're not.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.080
We're just strong
women and determined,

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.630
and knowing what we like.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.875
And yeah.

00:24:29.875 --> 00:24:31.330
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah, awesome.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:32.120
So I don't know.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.240
Does anyone in here
have a Google Glass on?

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:35.870
No?

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.040
Oh, yes.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.150
Cliff does.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.400
So have you heard
about the Google Glass?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.530
CARLA HALL: I've seen--
tell me about it.

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.530
I've seen so many people
walking around with it.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.380
I've seen yellow
ones and pink ones.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.685
Cliff has a grey one.

00:24:48.685 --> 00:24:49.560
I like the green one.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.590
HILLARY BERGH: I don't
know very many specifics,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.440
but I do know that you can
take pictures of things,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.250
and you can record things.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.890
And so I'm wondering,
what kind of technology,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.030
is there something like
that that you think

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.220
is going to be beneficial
in the cooking world,

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.110
or that could apply?

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.600
Would you want to
wear one of those

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.160
while you're cooking stuff
and do a YouTube video, or--

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.200
CARLA HALL: Well,
if I had one and I'm

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.990
doing a cooking
demonstration, and I

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.160
have to have a
recipe on the fly,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.820
or if I have to
look something up.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.336
Like if somebody-- is
it like "Intelligence"?

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:25.960
Like that show?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.210
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah, I think
that you can Google stuff

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.630
from it, and you can make
phone calls and texts and--

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.800
AUDIENCE: There's an
app called KitchMe.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.700
HILLARY BERGH: An
app called what?

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.132
AUDIENCE: An app called KitchMe.

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:35.090
HILLARY BERGH: KitchMe.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:36.250
And that's for the kitchen?

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.020
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.910
CARLA HALL: Oh, see.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.460
I would be the smartest
girl in the room.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.790
I mean, I can see
that, if you're

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:47.400
doing a demo or some kind
of talk where, let's say,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.837
you need to see your recipe.

00:25:48.837 --> 00:25:51.170
And you're here and on the
fly, and somebody says, well,

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.000
what else can you do
with that ingredient?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.520
And you Google it, and
this ingredient pops up.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.696
Well, you could do this, or
maybe you can use these spices.

00:25:58.696 --> 00:26:00.570
Do you guys know the
book "The Flavor Bible"?

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.600
HILLARY BERGH: I love that book.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:01.930
CARLA HALL: Right?

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:02.510
HILLARY BERGH: I love it.

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.610
CARLA HALL: I mean,
as a professional--

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:03.750
HILLARY BERGH: I love it.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.120
If you don't have it,
you need to get it.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.786
CARLA HALL: So those
of you who know it,

00:26:06.786 --> 00:26:09.160
let me describe it to those
of you who don't know it.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.520
So it's a book with all
of these ingredients.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.370
And so, from A to Z, you have
all of these ingredients.

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.441
And let's say you go--
are you looking it up now?

00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:20.815
See, if you've
got your glasses--

00:26:20.815 --> 00:26:22.023
HILLARY BERGH: Taking a note.

00:26:22.023 --> 00:26:24.030
CARLA HALL: Oh, OK.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.450
So if you look up apples,
and you see everything

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.560
that goes with apples.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.420
And then you see
on that list honey.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.800
So then you go to H
and you find honey.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.830
And you see everything
that goes with honey.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.110
But on both lists,
you will see rosemary.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.055
So then, you can cross
source the rosemary,

00:26:42.055 --> 00:26:43.635
so you know that
honey, rosemary,

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.070
and apples go together.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.950
And you can create this
dish with those ingredients.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.300
And it's a really great
tool to create new dishes.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.280
And so professionals use it.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.270
And it's still really top,
top, top on one of the number

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.400
one books to get,
in terms of spices.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.860
But, so something like that.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.310
If you have all of that
information in this app,

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.070
then you could
create on the fly,

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.820
and you would be so amazing.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.444
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah,
that would be fun.

00:27:11.444 --> 00:27:15.630
Yeah, from "The Flavor Bible,"
I was doing a wild boar dish.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.590
And we were celebrating
Chocolate Day.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.950
Like chocolate and boar,
chocolate and boar.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.090
Well I ended up doing a-- so the
boar was marinated with juniper

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.260
berries overnight,
so super tender.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.930
And then the sauce was
parsnips and heavy cream

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.750
and lavender and
white chocolate.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.545
And it was just-- I run it at
Root like once a quarter or so.

00:27:37.545 --> 00:27:39.315
So watch out for it.

00:27:39.315 --> 00:27:42.250
It was so much fun doing the
investigation and then like,

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:43.947
this is kind of a
weird combination.

00:27:43.947 --> 00:27:44.780
Is it going to work?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.350
Is it going to work?

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.950
And--

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:46.825
CARLA HALL: It works.

00:27:46.825 --> 00:27:51.160
It works because all of
those things in those lists,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.830
as you cross, in
the science of it,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.140
there is some property
in each of those foods

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.275
that make it go together, and
you don't know what it is.

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:01.900
I mean, there's
certain things that you

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.858
know would go together.

00:28:02.858 --> 00:28:03.960
For instance, ratatouille.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.497
All of those ingredients grow
together, they go together.

00:28:06.497 --> 00:28:07.330
And those, you know.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.246
But there are some of
these weird combinations

00:28:09.246 --> 00:28:11.720
like white chocolate and
boar and juniper berries.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.430
You're like, what?

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.270
What?

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.540
But then, speaking
of that, let's

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.270
say I was having a
talk with somebody,

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.870
and I wanted to
share with them ways

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.370
to get to know your palate.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.110
And I think that's so powerful.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:31.480
So obviously, when you buy my
book, it's based on my palate,

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.650
because all of the recipes,
I've tasted and said,

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.425
yes, I like them.

00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:37.050
But let's say, if
you don't like lemon,

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.460
and I love lemon, then
nine times out of 10,

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.360
you may not like my recipes.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.630
Or maybe they're too lemon-y.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.690
Or maybe you try recipes
that are too spicy.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:48.490
But just to get to
know your palate.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.562
So if you have a talk, and
you say to somebody, well,

00:28:51.562 --> 00:28:52.270
what do you like?

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.226
Well, I like sweet.

00:28:53.226 --> 00:28:54.600
And then, you
think, OK, what are

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.250
the sweet things
that you may like?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:00.021
And so you have this list,
sweet potatoes, bananas,

00:29:00.021 --> 00:29:01.270
all of these different things.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.540
Or let's say you like bitter.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.714
And you have all of these
things that they like,

00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:06.380
and certain things
that they don't like.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:10.920
Let's say they don't like turnip
greens because they're bitter.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.690
So I can tell you how you can
change that into something

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:17.790
that you may like by adding a
sweet or a component or salt so

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:18.820
that you will like it.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.420
So it helps that person
because, I think, sometimes,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.611
when people try a dish, and
it's made in a certain way

00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:28.110
that they don't
like, they will say,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.945
oh, I don't like turnip greens.

00:29:30.945 --> 00:29:32.820
But they don't know why
they don't like them.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.530
Or they'll say they're not good.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.210
It's not that they're not
good, you don't like them.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.580
And there's a difference.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.950
And so often, people
say something isn't good

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:41.950
when they don't like it.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:44.630
But if they understand
their palates,

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:47.690
then they can see how
to change certain foods

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.170
that they wouldn't
normally like.

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:50.160
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:50.810
That's cool.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.740
I like that.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.080
Let's see.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.770
So I know that you're
doing the Down at Monterey,

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.590
the Cooking for Solutions in
May, which is really cool.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.840
That's always a fun event.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.670
I did it a couple years ago.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.100
So Google does-- all of
our seafood is sustainable.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.400
We follow the Monterey
Bay watch guidelines.

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.990
Can you tell us a little bit
about sustainable seafood

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.870
and your take on that?

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.900
CARLA HALL: So this event,
Cooking for Solutions,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.680
is so amazing.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.820
I think I've done it, this
is probably my third time.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.950
And I skipped a couple years.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.020
But when you're in the
Monterey Bay, when you're here,

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:30.200
you're reminded why
you're doing all of this.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.010
And I think
California has sort of

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.240
been the lead in telling
the rest of the country how

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.580
to conserve and how
to appreciate our land

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.000
and not take it for granted.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.890
And so, when you go
to your Whole Foods,

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:53.500
and you see the fish that's
on the avoid list, the red.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.090
And then you have the
yellow, and then the green.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:57.750
It's so important.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.640
And it's actually
doing this event

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.400
that I started thinking
about what fishes to buy.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.530
Because you kind of forget.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.840
Because they're there doesn't
mean that you have to buy them.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.650
And sea bass, I
had to just tell--

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.620
I mean, in this industry,
I think, when we cook

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:23.210
and we see the food
rules, so to speak,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.780
but we forget that the
lay person doesn't know.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.820
So my sister, who
loves Chilean sea bass,

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:32.010
I have to go and tell
her, well, Kim, you really

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:32.940
shouldn't have that.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.240
Honestly, if you go to a
restaurant and they have it,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.340
then they probably are
having a lot of other fish

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.680
that they should not
have on their menu.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.980
And I would like for you
not to go there, please.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:51.080
And it's our responsibility
in being chefs and working

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.417
with food to lead the
charge and tell people what

00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:55.750
they should and should not have.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.600
And it starts with us.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.840
So I take that responsibility
very seriously,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.920
as I take the responsibility
of cooking for someone very

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.770
seriously.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.970
Because, if I'm in a bad
mood-- and I say this--

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:12.560
if you're in a bad mood, the
only thing you should make

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.072
is a reservation.

00:32:15.072 --> 00:32:17.620
And at that point, you pray
that whoever made your food

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.780
there is in a good
mood, because you'll

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.480
think it's the blue fish that's
off, and it was the chef.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.640
HILLARY BERGH: That's true.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.410
The energy that's in
the kitchen definitely

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.240
translates into the food.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.290
Absolutely.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.170
Cook with love.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.570
Always cook with love.

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.260
Yes.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.840
So you were on NPR recently.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:38.330
And one of the things that
really caught my attention

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.750
was your take on salt.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.510
And I loved the
compliments versus insults

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.150
that you referred to.

00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.692
Can you share with them that?

00:32:45.692 --> 00:32:47.400
CARLA HALL: Yes, let
me pick somebody out

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.120
to share this with.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.310
Sir?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:51.210
OK.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.120
So what's your name?

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:52.710
AUDIENCE: Aaron.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.460
CARLA HALL: Aaron?

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.010
All right.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.200
So Aaron, are you old
enough to have gone back

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.840
for your class reunion?

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.430
OK, great.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.595
I don't know.

00:33:01.595 --> 00:33:02.970
I went to my class
reunion, and I

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.720
realized that Santa
Claus was in my class.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:07.330
I'm like, whoa.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:11.115
So Aaron, you go back to your
high school class reunion,

00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:13.810
and they say, oh,
Aaron, you look so good.

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:14.980
Oh, let me just back up.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:19.040
I call salt compliments,
like Hillary said.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.839
But too many compliments
is an insult.

00:33:20.839 --> 00:33:21.630
So that's the idea.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.750
But to get people to get
their head around it, you say,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.950
Aaron you look really good.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:27.950
And you're like, thanks.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.000
You're like, yeah.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.510
And you're smiling
at this point.

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:32.580
And they're like, no,
you look really good.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.236
Have you guys seen Aaron?

00:33:34.236 --> 00:33:35.110
Doesn't he look good?

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.540
Oh, my god, you look so good.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:41.118
Oh, you look good.

00:33:41.118 --> 00:33:43.390
So then, at this point,
you're thinking, well damn.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.955
What did I look like before?

00:33:45.955 --> 00:33:46.775
I mean, right?

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.000
Because again, too many
compliments is an insult.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.810
And the same thing with salt.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.150
Salt is perfect if it
is used in moderation

00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:59.090
and it goes into the food.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.539
And as you're cooking, you
add salt into the food.

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:03.580
Like the church in the
steeple, that whole thing.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.200
So the salt has to go into
the fiber of the food.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.219
But if you use too much,
you can't take it out,

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:09.429
and it ruins the dish.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:13.864
And sometimes, people
may not use salt,

00:34:13.864 --> 00:34:15.280
and they will put
it on the table.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.489
And they're very proud of that.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.154
They're like, oh, I don't
use salt in my food.

00:34:18.154 --> 00:34:18.903
It's on the table.

00:34:18.903 --> 00:34:20.800
And I'm like, thank you
for letting me know,

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.064
I don't have to go to the table.

00:34:23.064 --> 00:34:26.500
Because when you add salt,
and you're putting salt

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.147
on top of the food,
it's only on top.

00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:29.480
So it's not going into the food.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.813
So you keep adding salt and
adding salt and adding salt.

00:34:31.813 --> 00:34:32.870
And then you over-salt.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.620
And then all of a
sudden, you have

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.864
this dish that you can't eat.

00:34:36.864 --> 00:34:39.920
Or when you buy processed
foods, what you have said

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.659
is, thank you for
salting my food for me.

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.730
You've given your power
away, because they've

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:45.949
salted it for you.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:48.824
And so this is what I
always try to tell people.

00:34:48.824 --> 00:34:50.199
When you're cooking
from scratch,

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.014
and it looks like chefs
use a lot of salt.

00:34:52.014 --> 00:34:54.150
But you're cooking from
scratch, and I know,

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.394
and you're like, let it rain.

00:34:55.394 --> 00:34:57.480
And in Mario, it's like roar.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.510
And the food is dusty.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.630
It's like a covering of
white dust on your food.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.180
But if it's a big piece
of meat, it can take that.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:08.130
It can take that salt.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.110
But again, too much salt--
too many spices-- too much

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.690
of anything is an insult
because you're not

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.787
tasting the food
itself, now you're only

00:35:15.787 --> 00:35:17.370
tasting the things
that you put on it.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:18.244
HILLARY BERGH: Right.

00:35:18.244 --> 00:35:20.280
Just enough to enhance
what's already going on.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:20.650
CARLA HALL: Right, exactly.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:21.310
Nature.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:22.393
And this is another thing.

00:35:22.393 --> 00:35:26.570
And this is why in a cookbook--
speaking of nature-- nature

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:32.100
gives you this ingredient
the decimals or whatever

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.440
and it changes so the
terrorists may be sweet today

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.750
and tomorrow they're not sweet.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.770
So that's why it's so
important to taste your food

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:43.040
because you can't
read in the cookbook,

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.970
oh, a 1/2 teaspoon of
salt and then, well,

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:47.410
hey, her food
doesn't taste great.

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:50.550
Because you're using ingredients
and you have to kind of taste

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.220
to determine what
that needs that day.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.480
HILLARY BERGH: Yes.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.563
To taste.

00:35:55.563 --> 00:35:56.290
CARLA HALL: Yeah.

00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:57.164
HILLARY BERGH: Right.

00:35:57.164 --> 00:35:59.140
Well, are there any
questions from any of you

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.574
that you'd like to ask Carla?

00:36:01.574 --> 00:36:02.990
CARLA HALL: OK
you, you, then you.

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.106
HILLARY BERGH: All right.

00:36:03.106 --> 00:36:03.280
You want to--

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.655
CARLA HALL: OK, yes,

00:36:03.655 --> 00:36:04.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Natasha.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.710
CARLA HALL: Hi, Natasha.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.671
You look good, girl.

00:36:07.671 --> 00:36:08.625
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:11.487
I was wondering, because
I saw you on "Top Chef,"

00:36:11.487 --> 00:36:12.918
and I loved seeing
"The Chew" when

00:36:12.918 --> 00:36:15.864
I am at home, which is
usually on a sick day.

00:36:15.864 --> 00:36:20.055
But I'm wondering what
would be your perfect job

00:36:20.055 --> 00:36:21.679
or perfect show that
you want to be on?

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:23.010
What would that be like?

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.900
CARLA HALL: Well right
now, it is my job

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.670
to talk and eat with my friends.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.867
And I get paid.

00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:32.700
I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:33.930
I mean, it's pretty perfect.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.920
I work three days a week,
I get there at 6:30.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.905
I leave around 2:00.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.857
And then people invite
me to eat more later.

00:36:42.857 --> 00:36:44.690
HILLARY BERGH: That
does sound pretty great.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.231
CARLA HALL: It sounds
pretty awesome.

00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:47.524
I have a four-day weekend.

00:36:47.524 --> 00:36:49.190
I mean, I know it
sounds really awesome.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.010
I mean that.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.570
But I have to work and putting
together recipes and stuff,

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.530
but it's pretty great.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.920
It's pretty great.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.820
Cooking without a clock
like on "Top Chef"?

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.520
Go be fabulous?

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.348
Yeah, this is pretty awesome.

00:37:01.348 --> 00:37:02.181
HILLARY BERGH: Nice.

00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:04.390
I think we had-- let's see, you
have a microphone back there?

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.042
All right.

00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:06.250
AUDIENCE: Carla, I'm Chelsea.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.370
CARLA HALL: Hi, Chelsea.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:11.060
AUDIENCE: I like your
show and your everything.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:12.578
CARLA HALL: Thank you.

00:37:12.578 --> 00:37:15.023
AUDIENCE: I actually didn't
know the part of your story

00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:17.231
that you didn't go to culinary
school until your 30s.

00:37:17.231 --> 00:37:18.446
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:37:18.446 --> 00:37:20.321
AUDIENCE: So for anyone
who's [INAUDIBLE] who

00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:23.336
may want that to happen in
the future, that's inspiring.

00:37:23.336 --> 00:37:27.760
But where would you go if
you were to, like, be 26?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.720
CARLA HALL: And my
name is Chelsea?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.120
AUDIENCE: If your
name was Chelsea.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.813
[INAUDIBLE] into the industry?

00:37:34.813 --> 00:37:36.646
What would you do, even
if it's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:43.270
CARLA HALL: What I do, even if
my name wasn't Chelsea-- hint,

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.976
hint-- does your boss know that
you are thinking of leaving?

00:37:45.976 --> 00:37:47.850
AUDIENCE: No no, I'm
not thinking of leaving,

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.320
but I just want to
be more [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.900
CARLA HALL: Oh OK.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.830
So you want to do
it on the side?

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:57.900
I would say recreational
cooking classes are perfect.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.720
A lot of culinary
schools, not only

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.620
do they do certificate
programs, but they also

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.750
do classes on the side.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.350
Volunteering for places
like Sur La Table,

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.130
I think they have
a cooking program

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:14.750
and they take volunteers
so you don't have to pay.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.520
I would do that.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.570
You can do that as an option.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.080
If you really want
to get into it

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.371
and you don't want to do the
whole certificate program,

00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:25.450
sometimes there are
evening programs,

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.020
where there are about
six to eight weeks

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.222
where you get the basics.

00:38:30.222 --> 00:38:33.520
And let me just be clear, going
to culinary school is great.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.390
It gives you the technique.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.130
But it's that technique
and your experiences

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.530
that give you the thing
that you probably wanting.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.580
So for me, I was 30 and
I went to culinary school

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.340
because I had to
do a jump start.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.190
Did you go to culinary school?

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.050
HILLARY BERGH: I did, I
had been in the kitchens.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:51.340
My parents owned restaurants.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.340
Since I was six or seven,
I was in the kitchens.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.840
And I went to
culinary school at 18.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.786
I learned some stuff, but,
I already kind of knew it.

00:38:59.786 --> 00:39:00.262
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:39:00.262 --> 00:39:00.692
So you already knew that stuff.

00:39:00.692 --> 00:39:02.010
You probably didn't need to go.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:03.180
HILLARY BERGH: I just
wanted the certificate.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:03.670
CARLA HALL: Right.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:04.890
So you just wanted
that piece of paper

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.450
to say that, I did something.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.570
And also, you were
18, so you probably

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:11.830
wanted to have an experience
of going to school.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:12.830
HILLARY BERGH: Yes.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.340
CARLA HALL: As a
career changer, I

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.020
went because I
needed a jump start.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:21.290
But for you, I would maybe
take that abbreviated course

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:25.182
where you get technique,
and then you just play.

00:39:25.182 --> 00:39:27.680
And then you take
one-off classes

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.450
and play and cook
for your friends.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.370
When I went to culinary
school, I actually

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.540
would get my friends
to buy the ingredients

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.910
and I would go and cook.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.254
Whatever turned out, turned out.

00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:40.670
If it was bad, I'm like, hey,
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:39:44.659 --> 00:39:45.700
There's always a way out.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.220
You always look
for that door out.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.162
Did I see another
person over here?

00:39:52.802 --> 00:39:54.510
AUDIENCE: I've watched
you on "Top Chef,"

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.850
and I just love the show.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.295
And I wanted to
ask, what are some

00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:02.790
of things about the show that
aren't obvious to the viewers?

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.510
What does it take to be really
successful on that show other

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.931
than cooking skills?

00:40:08.931 --> 00:40:10.930
CARLA HALL: Yes, well,
there are about 90 people

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:11.860
working on the show.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.150
We have really
amazing producers.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:21.420
And the producers, we have
the executive producers,

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.610
but we also have the people
who put the topics together.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.790
The producers actually come to
us with a theme of the show.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.480
And we work from that theme,
and then they have this grid.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:37.620
So that helps us narrow,
zoom in on the dishes

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.770
that we might put
together for that show.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.680
So they'll come in and say,
Carla, we're doing a show.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.880
"Batter up" is the theme.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.260
And so we are doing
something with batter.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.410
And Michael is already doing
something with the meat.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.710
Mario's doing this.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.060
Can you do a dessert?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.950
So there's that part of it.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:04.160
Like I said, it's so hard to
cook and talk to somebody.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.320
And you want to make
a good dish and relate

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.510
to the people who
are watching you.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.670
That was the biggest
transition for me.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.870
And so it just
comes with practice.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.810
But it also helps to--
like in the beginning,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:24.690
I would read through the
entire script of the show,

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:28.270
and then whoever we had coming
on the show, I felt like Oprah.

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:32.040
In my head I said, this is
Oprah reading a book the night

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.895
before she sees a guest.

00:41:33.895 --> 00:41:36.020
So then you know that you're
going to have a guest.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.680
So you want to know a
little bit about them.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.870
And so you watch
all these clips.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.460
You go down this rabbit
hole of who they are.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.060
And you want to have
some information just

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.492
to connect with them.

00:41:47.492 --> 00:41:48.450
So there's all of that.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.170
And that's what I'm doing after
2 o'clock, when I say I'm off

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:53.420
but I'm not really off.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.300
So just absorbing
all that information

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.150
and being 50 and having
that hormone that

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.170
takes your mind
away is hard, too.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.770
I don't remember a darn thing.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.470
I mean I'm like, I have three
things to tell you, one, blah,

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:10.610
blah, blah, two, blah,
blah, blah, three-- three?

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.100
I guess it wasn't important.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:13.070
So all of that.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.360
So it's a balance of all that.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.600
But the best thing that
you may or may not see,

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.940
is that we have the
support of each other.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.190
So let's say I do forget
something but Michael's right

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.689
there.

00:42:23.689 --> 00:42:26.030
He's like, oh, Carla, what
about blah, blah, blah?

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:29.890
And then so we have that between
each other, which is amazing.

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:34.540
If it wasn't for
Michael and Mario

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.390
specifically about how
to balance that food

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.939
and doing the demo
and interview,

00:42:39.939 --> 00:42:41.230
I would have been totally lost.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.450
I really relied on them.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.680
Clinton had also done
a lot of television.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.490
And the thing that
he told me was

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.760
to be authentic, to be yourself.

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.470
And what a lot of people may not
know, after the first season,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.970
I went to a media trainer.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:00.230
And it really wasn't
to learn how to do TV,

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:04.060
it was trying to be the best me
I could be in front of a camera

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:06.150
and not have those inhibitions.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:07.730
HILLARY BERGH: Ah, cool.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:08.230
Let's see.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.600
I think we had
another question here.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:11.100
We got the microphone up to you.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.870
AUDIENCE: So with
a lot of new cooks,

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.820
they seem to be really
intimidated by the oven,

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.320
but right away
eager to cook eggs.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.320
Eggs are so
technically difficult--

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.420
CARLA HALL: Dude!

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.540
AUDIENCE: Why do you think
this is so backwards?

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.832
I mean, sticking a
boneless, skinless chicken

00:43:30.832 --> 00:43:32.415
breast in the oven
and clicking Broil,

00:43:32.415 --> 00:43:35.050
you have long stretches of time.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.270
You can be off by five
minutes, it's not a big deal.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.515
CARLA HALL: Yeah, it is.

00:43:37.515 --> 00:43:40.200
AUDIENCE: Eggs, it's like
five seconds, it's over.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.417
Why do you think things
are backwards like that

00:43:42.417 --> 00:43:43.000
for new shows?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.440
CARLA HALL: When I was
working in the kitchen

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:52.030
and I was running a kitchen,
and I was having to hire people,

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.230
I would have them make
an omelette, eggs.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.050
And I had them make
an omelette because I

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.420
could tell how they held
a pan, how cleanly they

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.470
worked, how they
use their tools.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.440
It's a lot of finesse in
something very simple.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:11.220
And I'm like, can do
the simple very well?

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:14.600
When I go to an ice cream
store, I want their vanilla.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:16.980
When I go to a restaurant, I
want their roasted chicken.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.540
Can you do the
simple really well?

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.910
Because a lot of
smoke and mirrors,

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:28.390
you can slide under the
wire with all of this.

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.574
The presentation and
sauces and your food

00:44:31.574 --> 00:44:32.990
on one side of the
plate, thinking

00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:36.300
that they left the
rest of it off.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.930
You can do a lot, but can
you do the simple well?

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.160
And with eggs, are they
seasoned perfectly?

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.230
Are they fluffy?

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:46.630
Is the omelette
coming out of the pan?

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:48.550
Is it all tucked nicely?

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.690
So in culinary
school, you actually

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:54.470
spend about a month
on eggs, eggs alone.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:58.690
I think with cooking
something like chicken,

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:03.330
people are afraid of it, I think
because it goes into this box.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:05.261
It goes in there,
and I guess they

00:45:05.261 --> 00:45:06.760
don't know what's
going to come out.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:10.840
It's like this magic box.

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.914
But I disagree that
you have five or 10

00:45:12.914 --> 00:45:14.580
minutes with that
chicken because people

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.450
will cook that chicken to death.

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:19.373
People are afraid
of raw chicken.

00:45:19.373 --> 00:45:21.490
I mean, they are
so afraid and they

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.780
will cook it until it's dust.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.280
HILLARY BERGH: The
health department

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.700
says 165, but at home pull
it out a little earlier.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.967
It's going to continue to carry
over cooking on your counter.

00:45:33.967 --> 00:45:35.550
CARLA HALL: We have
two words for you.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.010
Residual heat.

00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.892
HILLARY BERGH: Yes.

00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:39.599
CARLA HALL: Yes.

00:45:39.599 --> 00:45:40.640
HILLARY BERGH: All right.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.340
Let's get the-- oh, there we go.

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:42.970
There's another [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:43.850
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question for you.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.516
There was an article
in "The New Yorker"

00:45:45.516 --> 00:45:49.335
this week about this crazy
dinner they had a WD~50.

00:45:49.335 --> 00:45:51.460
They had three chefs fly
in from all over the world

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.360
to basically create all
their interpretations

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.230
of their favorite dishes ever.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.345
What's the best meal
that you've ever had?

00:45:58.345 --> 00:46:00.790
Because you work with
so many phenomenal chefs

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:01.860
over the years.

00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.810
What is the most memorable
meal that you've ever done?

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.810
CARLA HALL: Oh wow, what is the
most memorable meal I've had?

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:08.190
HILLARY BERGH: That's hard.

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.731
CARLA HALL: I know,
it's really hard.

00:46:09.731 --> 00:46:10.980
It's very hard.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:14.120
And it also depends
on where I am

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.464
and what mood I'm
in, who I'm with.

00:46:16.464 --> 00:46:17.880
HILLARY BERGH:
What the season is.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.620
CARLA HALL: Yeah, the season.

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:21.860
I do remember when
I got to New York,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.450
and it was probably
the first time

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:26.830
that I went to ABC Kitchen.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.760
What's his restaurant?

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.500
Oh, my god.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.600
Not Daniel Boulud.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.000
Have you got your glasses on?

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.944
You can look that up.

00:46:39.944 --> 00:46:40.890
AUDIENCE: George.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:41.890
CARLA HALL: John George.

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:43.198
Thank you.

00:46:43.198 --> 00:46:43.698
What a girl.

00:46:43.698 --> 00:46:45.198
She didn't even
have the glasses on.

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:50.940
The meal was amazing.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.150
The bread was so good.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.070
And it was pea season.

00:46:54.070 --> 00:46:55.000
And I love peas.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.790
And they had the
fava bean spread.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.800
And it was the fava
beans and the bread

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.060
was just the perfect
amount of salt.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:03.760
And the spread.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.680
And the texture.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.680
And it was just so good.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.805
And I was like, oh, my god.

00:47:06.805 --> 00:47:09.718
This is the best I've ever had.

00:47:09.718 --> 00:47:12.130
And I've said that many times.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.350
But then I got to
dessert, and they

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:18.090
had this like a
strawberry shortcake.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:20.060
And they had these
little tiny berries

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:21.870
that was so perfectly sweet.

00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.990
And they had done an almost
like a-- not a coulis,

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:31.875
but a broth, or a syrup
of the strawberries.

00:47:31.875 --> 00:47:32.750
And they strained it.

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:33.740
And it was so clear.

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.865
And it had lime in it.

00:47:37.865 --> 00:47:41.140
And it was so perfectly
sweet and tangy.

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.710
And then these little
berries, and the whipped cream

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.360
was perfectly whipped.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.260
And this like angel
food cake, and--

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.600
It was so good.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.150
It was so, so good.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:58.910
And I love when somebody can
take ingredients and just

00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:59.580
let them sing.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.950
And it's not a lot of
fuss and a 1,000 people

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.087
haven't touched it.

00:48:04.087 --> 00:48:05.170
And that was really great.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.460
Conversely, thinking
about that same dish,

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:14.330
I went to a restaurant
and it was Jersey cream

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:18.870
with Jersey blueberries-- it
was blueberry season-- and maple

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:19.370
syrup.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:21.300
Doesn't that sound heavenly?

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:29.590
Well, I got it, and the
cream was over-whipped

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.930
just before it became butter.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.990
And then I move the spoon back--
so that of the first thing--

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:35.980
then I was like, oh--

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.610
And I'm like, well, my maple
syrup wasn't even there.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:42.700
It was three ingredients
on the whole dish.

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:44.170
One ingredient was over-whipped.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.570
And then the other one, the
maple syrup, wasn't there.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.612
So then I said, well, my
maple syrup isn't there.

00:48:49.612 --> 00:48:51.111
And I didn't even
mention the cream.

00:48:51.111 --> 00:48:53.040
So they go back and
they put the maple syrup

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.000
over the over-whipped cream,
which really curdled it up.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.921
It was like-- And
I was like, ugh.

00:49:00.921 --> 00:49:02.170
HILLARY BERGH: That's too bad.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:03.650
CARLA HALL: It's too bad, right?

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:04.480
It's too bad.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.600
So for me, the best
meal is like when

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.160
you can celebrate a chef
by making something for you

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:10.290
and honoring the food.

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:12.190
So it changes every time.

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.200
When I went to your
place, it was so good

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.440
how you transported
me to the Philippines.

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.649
It was amazing.

00:49:19.649 --> 00:49:21.440
Not that I'm interviewing
you, but have you

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.398
been to a kamayan meal?

00:49:24.904 --> 00:49:29.230
So tell me, Hillary, I'm
glad you could come today.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:30.940
Thank you all.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.590
HILLARY BERGH: Thank
you for having me.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:33.920
CARLA HALL: Yes, of course.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.604
Now you do such beautiful work.

00:49:35.604 --> 00:49:36.645
And you travel the globe.

00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:38.862
No.

00:49:38.862 --> 00:49:40.320
Have you ever have
to kamayan meal,

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.680
like a Filipino feast, where
they do the kamayan meal where

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680
you eat with your hands?

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.200
HILLARY BERGH: Yes, yes.

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.950
I'm forgetting the
name of the restaurant,

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.920
it's in Redwood City.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.060
It's a sister
restaurant to Left Bank.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.300
I think it's the Brasserie.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:56.040
Anyway, the chef
there is Filipino.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.420
And last year, he did
this whole spread.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.710
And it was amazing.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.150
He has a calamondin
tree in his backyard.

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.980
So he had fresh calamondins.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.614
And then he had
also preserved some.

00:50:06.614 --> 00:50:08.530
CARLA HALL: I just
discovered the calamondins,

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:10.850
that little tart, sweet
orange that-- You guys,

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.680
you have it good out here.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:14.290
You have it really good.

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.810
Somebody sent me some from
Florida, it was so delicious.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:17.990
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.920
The spread--

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.410
CARLA HALL: Isn't it amazing?

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:20.055
HILLARY BERGH: It was amazing.

00:50:20.055 --> 00:50:20.320
CARLA HALL: It's so good.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:21.150
HILLARY BERGH: And
then, yeah, to get

00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:23.019
to play with the
food with your hands.

00:50:23.019 --> 00:50:23.685
CARLA HALL: Yes.

00:50:23.685 --> 00:50:23.960
Yes.

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.530
HILLARY BERGH: I do love
eating with my hands.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:26.250
CARLA HALL: I do, too.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:27.060
But you know
there's an etiquette

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:27.890
to eating with your hands.

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:29.470
If you go above the
second knuckles,

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.929
you're eating like an ape.

00:50:31.929 --> 00:50:33.720
HILLARY BERGH: There's
some delicacy to it.

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.790
CARLA HALL: Yeah,
it's so fantastic.

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:36.290
Yes?

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:37.284
Sorry.

00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:39.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, I want to ask
you a question about one

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.860
of the spices you have
in your very nice chart.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.974
It's saffron.

00:50:42.974 --> 00:50:43.640
CARLA HALL: Yes.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.348
AUDIENCE: So first,
is there a difference

00:50:45.348 --> 00:50:48.630
between the saffron that
is used for Persian food

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:50.275
and the Spanish food?

00:50:50.275 --> 00:50:51.650
That would be the
first question.

00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:53.550
And the second one
is, how to use it.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.240
I been learning how
to make Spanish paella

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.590
the last couple of weeks.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.620
And I've tried a
couple of times.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:01.250
But it's a mystery
how to use it.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.320
Lots of different
advice out there.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.161
And it makes it so unreliable,
unpredictable the result,

00:51:07.161 --> 00:51:07.660
right?

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.085
So maybe I should go for a
saffron in powder version?

00:51:11.085 --> 00:51:13.062
Or I don't know-- no right?

00:51:13.062 --> 00:51:14.520
HILLARY BERGH:
Don't do the powder.

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.609
AUDIENCE: I want to
find out a technique.

00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:18.275
CARLA HALL: You can
use a saffron powder

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:19.020
if you wanted to.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.478
AUDIENCE: I prefer
to use a thread,

00:51:20.478 --> 00:51:23.340
but if I have a technique
that it goes well

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.724
all the time-- If you both
can give some perspective.

00:51:25.724 --> 00:51:27.140
CARLA HALL: Is
there a difference?

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:32.709
Basically what the threads, and
where you are in the world--

00:51:32.709 --> 00:51:34.750
HILLARY BERGH: I don't
know that there's actually

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.800
a difference between.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.430
I'm sure that there
is because obviously

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.370
one plant in one
area of the world

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:43.620
is going to be a little bit
different in another area

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.940
of the world, even if
they're the exact same plant.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:47.640
CARLA HALL: Right
because of the soil.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:48.580
HILLARY BERGH: The
soil and things

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.410
will have an influence
so, I'm sure there

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.675
would be some variation.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.217
I would think that it would
be close enough that they

00:51:58.217 --> 00:51:59.300
should be interchangeable.

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.995
CARLA HALL: It shouldn't
change the taste.

00:52:01.995 --> 00:52:08.510
Now how I was taught
to incorporate saffron,

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:15.130
I take a little bit of
water and a sugar cube.

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.960
And I actually chop
it up with the water

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:21.080
because the saffron won't
go flying everywhere.

00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:23.650
So I chop it up, and
I bloom the saffron

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:24.920
in that little bit of water.

00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.601
And then I incorporate
it like that.

00:52:27.601 --> 00:52:29.100
How are you-- you
bloom it in water?

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.710
HILLARY BERGH: I do
bloom it in water.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.479
Often I use dates
instead of sugar.

00:52:34.479 --> 00:52:35.270
CARLA HALL: Oh yes.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.990
So you grind it?

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.960
You make a little powder?

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.290
HILLARY BERGH: Mhm.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:38.050
CARLA HALL: So that's
the whole thing.

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:40.575
I said chop it, but I
use a mortar and pestle

00:52:40.575 --> 00:52:42.579
with a little sugar
cube and the water.

00:52:42.579 --> 00:52:44.870
And you grind it up so you
have this saffron water that

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.600
gets incorporated into the dish.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.505
And you use dates.

00:52:47.505 --> 00:52:48.630
HILLARY BERGH: I use dates.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:51.180
Just because I tried
not to use to much sugar

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.029
and I try to go a
more natural approach.

00:52:54.029 --> 00:52:56.195
CARLA HALL: Well, in my
head I saw brown sugar cube.

00:52:56.195 --> 00:52:59.810
HILLARY BERGH: Well,
hey, there you go.

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.561
CARLA HALL: I did.

00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:01.768
HILLARY BERGH: I accept that.

00:53:01.768 --> 00:53:02.710
CARLA HALL: Thank you.

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.050
AUDIENCE: So that
would be warm water.

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:04.716
CARLA HALL: Yes.

00:53:04.716 --> 00:53:05.670
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:06.590
HILLARY BERGH: Room temperature.

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:06.750
CARLA HALL: Room temperature.

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:07.540
Not hot.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.800
HILLARY BERGH: Not hot.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.390
Yeah, and the water should
turn this nice, bright yellow.

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:14.030
And then you know it's ready.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:17.280
CARLA HALL: But too
much saffron is bitter

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.700
and it will ruin a dish.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:19.560
Ruin.

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:19.840
HILLARY BERGH: Yeah.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.881
A little goes a long way.

00:53:20.881 --> 00:53:22.260
That's why it's so expensive.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.267
You just need a
little, a few threads.

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.850
CARLA HALL: But I
want you to Tweet me

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:27.230
when you make that paella.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.790
Carla Hall.

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:28.706
You guys can tweet me.

00:53:28.706 --> 00:53:30.930
I actually respond
when people are nice

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:34.730
and they're talking about food.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:38.230
I won't block you.

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:41.630
HILLARY BERGH: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:42.194
Be quick.

00:53:42.194 --> 00:53:43.610
AUDIENCE: One thing
that stood out

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:44.770
to me when you
are on "Top Chef,"

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.550
apart from your
personality, was that you

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.022
had quite a few
vegetarian dishes.

00:53:48.022 --> 00:53:49.480
And I see in the
cookbook, you also

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:52.040
have a non-meat section,
which as a vegetarian,

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.470
I appreciate quite a bit.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:54.450
But it's unusual.

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:57.280
A lot of chefs focus
on meat because I

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.010
guess there's more
tah-dah effect

00:53:59.010 --> 00:54:00.350
if you have meat in dishes.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:04.940
I wonder is it just kind
of a natural inclination?

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.860
Do you make a conscious
choice to incorporate

00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.165
vegetarian dishes?

00:54:08.165 --> 00:54:09.540
CARLA HALL: A lot
of people think

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.509
that I'm actually a
vegetarian, and I'm not.

00:54:11.509 --> 00:54:12.800
HILLARY BERGH: I get that, too.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.560
CARLA HALL: Yeah,
you get that, too?

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.970
Two reasons-- one, I love
vegetables, it's my favorite.

00:54:18.970 --> 00:54:21.220
I love vegetables.

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.060
The other reason, on "Top Chef,"
was because as a caterer--

00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.290
and I was a caterer when
I went on "Top Chef."

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:28.990
Now I'm a recovering caterer.

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.630
It's been 925 days
since my last job.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:38.190
This is when you guys say,
hi, Carla, keep coming back.

00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:40.120
I would look at the menu.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:42.190
So a lot of times,
we would be doing

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:45.330
an event where all
the food that we made

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.320
was the only food that the
people who came to the event

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:49.240
could have.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.640
So I would look at everything
that people were preparing

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:55.360
and there wouldn't be
anything for the vegetarian.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.120
And I'm like, well what is
the vegetarian going to eat?

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.290
This is what I'm thinking.

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:01.670
What are they going to eat?

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:05.020
Because I don't drink, I'm
always wanting the person

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:09.790
with the specialty
food request to feel

00:55:09.790 --> 00:55:11.580
like, I thought about you.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.420
And that's why I did a
lot of vegetarian foods.

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.860
And now I think it's much
easier to get vegetarian.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:21.500
But whenever I was
catering, I said

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.182
please, if there
are any vegetarians,

00:55:23.182 --> 00:55:25.140
let me know ahead of time
because I didn't want

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.270
the vegetarian to
have the sides.

00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:30.797
And just because you are
vegetarian and it's a vegetable

00:55:30.797 --> 00:55:32.880
does not mean that you did
not cook that vegetable

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.000
with some chicken stock.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.060
I mean that.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.546
My sense of catering to people
and wanting them to feel like I

00:55:42.546 --> 00:55:43.295
thought about you.

00:55:43.295 --> 00:55:44.350
I knew you were coming.

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:47.420
So here have this dish.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.790
And also my love for vegetables.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.580
HILLARY BERGH: OK.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:53.260
Well thank you all for joining.

00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.944
And it was so great meeting you.

00:55:54.944 --> 00:55:55.860
CARLA HALL: Thank you.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:56.920
HILLARY BERGH:
Two days in a row.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:57.040
CARLA HALL: I know.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.880
I can't wait to
have the goodies.

00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.740
You're fantastic.

00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.240
You guys have a
good one right here.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.829
She's a good one.

00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:03.870
HILLARY BERGH: Thank you.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:04.390
CARLA HALL: Thank you.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:05.330
Thank you so much.

00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:05.630
Thank you.

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:07.263
CARLA HALL: Thank you very much.

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.680
Thank you.
