TEACHERS, PLEASE DON'T BE
ALARMED, THIS ISN'T A WALL

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:38.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF EXPLOSIVES BEHIND US,
OKAY?

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:42.041 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST-- THESE ARE JUST SOME
CLOCKS WITH TIMES FROM

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:43.109 align:start position:0% line:85%
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:44.010 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SAFE.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT
CLEAR.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:50.183 size:78% position:39% line:85%
OKAY, FIRST THINGS FIRST.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.319 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO
MAKE THAT BOMB?

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:57.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE A

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.559 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRETTY COMPLICATED EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.627 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; 20 MINUTES.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.097 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO YOU WANTED TO
MAKE A CLOCK S THAT HOW IT

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.530 align:start position:0% line:85%
STARTED.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:05.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:06.399 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WHAT WAS YOUR
THINKING, HAD YOU MADE A

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.400 align:start position:0% line:85%
CLOCK BEFORE.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:07.867 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.102 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.070 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO WHY DID YOU
WANT TO MAKE A CLOCK.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS SOMETHING REALLY
SIMPLE TO MAKE.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:14.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
LOOK SIMPLE.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT THING LOOKS PRETTY
COMPLICATED.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:17.776 size:84% position:42% line:85%
DID YOU HAVE TO LOOK IT UP.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.278 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK
IT UP.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ONLY THING TO LOOK UP
WAS THE RECEIPT FOR THE BOX.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:22.982 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: REALLY?

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.119 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAIT, SO YOU ACTUALLY
THOUGHT THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:28.221 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF HOW TO MAKE A CLOCK
YOURSELF.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.090 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO IS THAT WHAT
YOU ARE REALLY PROUD OF,

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.292 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE ABOUT WHEN YOU DO THESE
TYPE OF THINGS, THAT YOU

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.161 size:81% position:41% line:85%
FIGURE IT OUT BY YOURSELF.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.231 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CUZ I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT
HOW TO DO A LEGO CLOCK LIKE

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.065 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT, YOU KNOW.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.633 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT A REAL CLOCK.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:46.739 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS REALLY SIMPLE TO ME
BECAUSE I BUILT MORE STUFF

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.142 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS VERY COMPLICATED
LIKE.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: LIKE.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.879 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; CPUs AND SODDERING THEM. BUT
THE CLOCK WAS SIMPLE.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:55.148 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SOME OF THE PARTS WERE
SCRAPPED OFF.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.350 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SO THAT'S HOW IT GOT EASIER.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.252 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THE HORRIBLE THING
ABOUT THIS WAS YOU GOT

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.353 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARRESTED.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.355 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WE HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU IN
HANDCUFFS DO WE STILL HAVE

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT PICTURE.

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:06.058 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THAT WAS AMAZING, YOU WERE
WEARING YOUR NASA SHIRT.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:10.029 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I REALLY WAS TAKEN
BECAUSE I LOVE SPACE AND

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.097 align:start position:0% line:85%
NASA.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.200 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I WAS LIKE WHAT, HOW COULD
THEY DO THIS TO THIS KID.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:17.403 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS IT A LITTLE COOL TO BE
ARRESTED?

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.705 align:start position:0% line:85%
KEEP IT 100 PERCENT.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:26.112 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN IT DOES GIVE YOU A
LITTLE STREET CRED.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.814 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT WAS KIND OF COOL.

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:34.320 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:38.824 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I MADE A CLOCK.

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.360 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ONLY REASON I FELT
COOL ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KNEW

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:45.131 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WAS INNOCENT AND I KNEW IF
I DID TAKE IT TO COURT I

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.032 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOULD-- 
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.535 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.637 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAS ANY PART OF THIS SCARY
AT ALL?

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start position:0% line:91%
WERE YOU EVER SCARED THAT
SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN OR --

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.741 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I MEAN, YEAH.

00:02:55.774 --> 00:03:00.479 line:91%
WHEN THE COPS ALMOST MADE ME DO
THE NAENAE BACKWARDS WHERE MY

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.181 size:75% position:38% line:85%
ARM WENT ALL THE WAY-- .

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.750 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DOING THE NAE NAE
BACKWARDS, HOW WOULD YOU DO

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:06.185 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE NAE NAE BACKWARDS.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:09.121 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE COP, WHAT THEY DO,
YOU SEE RIGHT HERE, THEY

00:03:09.154 --> 00:03:12.425 align:start position:0% line:91%
PULLED MY ARM ALL THE WAY UP
WHERE I COULD LIKE-- LIKE

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.593 align:start position:0% line:85%
HIGH ENOUGH.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:14.294 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: GOOD LORD.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:16.996 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CAN'T EVEN FAKE DOING
THAT.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT IS COMING UP NEXT
FOR YOU?

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.733 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO YOU ARE AN INVENTOR.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:21.534 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:22.601 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU REALLY LIKE
INVENTING.

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.737 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO YOU HAVE OTHER INVENTIONS
YOU WANT TO DO, ARE YOU

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTERESTED IN THAT KIND OF
THING.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:28.474 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES, I'M REALLY
INTERESTED IN IT.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:37.450 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WOULD SAY MY NEXT
INVENTION WOULD BE A-- A

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:38.384 align:start position:0% line:85%
SIDE HOVER BOARD.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:39.852 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOW DOES THAT WORK.

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:42.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE THESE FORWARD ONES
GOING FORWARD AND REVERSE

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.490 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ONE THAT MOVES

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:46.692 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: NICE.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:51.897 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
SOMEONE MAY THINK THAT MIGHT

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.034 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK LIKE AN EXPLOSIVE
DEVICE AND YOU CAN GET AWAY

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.436 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON THE HOVER BOARD AND GET
AWAY SIDEWAYS.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.839 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO BUILD
INVENTIONS WE WANTED TO GIVE

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.040 size:88% position:44% line:85%
