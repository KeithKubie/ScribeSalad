00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.720
 Your car stopped working in an uninhabited place, and your plane was forced to land 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.440
 Or trying to stay alive in the midst of an urban crash in your city. 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.640
 You will need skills to continue living after losing your well-being 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.400
 but how? The main necessities of survival are: water, food, housing, heating and clothing. 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.860
 Let's start with water. The search for a source of clean water will be an integral part of the task 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.580
 If water is found, it will not be disease-free. 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.660
 You will need to boil the water for five minutes to kill the harmful bacteria 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.520
 Existing toxins are probably proteins that break down at high temperatures. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.440
 You can consume water from the cactus by cutting parts of it and crushing them into a vase. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.580
 When temperatures drop, you can eat pure ice with thick ice because they are the best sources. 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.600
 If you can not get fresh water you can collect dew from the loose tissue 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.120
 Rainwater can be collected from leaves and cracks. 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.880
 Do not waste water licking your lips. You can suck a button or pebble to overcome dry mouth and thirst. 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.900
 Once you find the water, drink slowly over a long period of time. 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.720
 For the body to use efficiently and will prevent nausea. 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.440
 As for food, it treats insects, cockroaches, earthworms and other protein-rich organisms, vitamins and minerals 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.360
 Which are important for survival. 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 You also have to scare the animals, especially the owls, foxes and foxes 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.900
 They will leave their prey if they succeed 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.200
 And then you can take it. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.280
 Lactic acid found in predatory prey may make it harsh and spoil quickly 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.580
 Compared to the newly caught but when cooked directly will be fine. 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.280
 After months without vitamin C you will begin to feel weak and your body is struggling to heal itself. 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.180
 This is because vitamin C is an integral part of the vital processes that build collagen and structural protein that works on wound healing. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.580
 Tea making will provide you with boiled pine leaves 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 Vitamin C is equal to that in a glass of orange juice. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.420
 Rabbit one of the easiest animals to catch him 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.800
 Because he relies heavily on camouflage, he approached him calmly as he watched him. 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.480
 However you will not be able to survive relying solely on the rabbit 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.060
 Because it is low in fat and therefore you need to find more fat. 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.960
 Our consumption of fat comes from food such as: 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.740
 Butter, milk, oil and ice cream are hard to get in the wild. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.600
 So you'll have to look hard. Some plants and berries may be fatal 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.540
 So think like a squirrel and all the nuts 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.780
 Walnuts are safe and rich in fat. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.360
 The bitter taste comes from organic tannins found in tea and beer. 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.540
 If you boil the nut for two hours you will reduce the bitter taste 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.980
 Leave it to dry or grind to become a paste and make pancakes. 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.600
 All dandelion parts are edible, too. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.300
 You can also boil it to reduce its bitterness. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.440
 Maple seeds are also an amusing snack of high nutritional value 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.580
 Fish intake will be nutritional values 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.869
 But there are alternatives that do not need to be hunted 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.660
 Seaweeds are of high nutritional value. 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.320
 It can be boiled, steamed, fried or eaten fresh without cooking. 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.920
 And molluscs found abundantly along the Pacific coast of North America. 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.039
 The common way to cook meat is to hang a stick over the fire 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.000
 But steam can be cooked by digging a hole and placing hot rocks inside and then covering them 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.580
 With wet plants or seaweed 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.480
 And then put the food and slowly add the pure water produces hot steam rocks. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.480
 To make heating and to ignite the fire you will need matches or lighter 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.560
 But in difficult times you can hit two stones with each other to get sparks. 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.860
 Keep your eyes open to find the iron perit 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.420
 It is a fast-igniting metal that is extracted for its combustible properties. 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.360
 Another option is safe using magnifying glasses that work well. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.480
 Once you get the sparks you will need a quick flammable material, a name called the material that ignites quickly and easily. 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.659
 Examples include birch bark, dry moss, lichen, grass 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.960
 Evergreen plants and bark of cedar trees. 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.980
 Once it ignites, put the ends of the sticks in the fire and push them to the flame in a clear way. 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.940
 This is an effective way to keep NARC burning for the longest period 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.020
 Do not want to set fire to your residence for known reasons 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.040
 You need proper ventilation to stop carbon monoxide poisoning 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.480
 The low cave is a perfect refuge for putting the fire in the foreground at a safe distance from you to keep warm. 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.960
 In the forest, breaking the tree branches to make a sloping building is also a simple and effective idea. 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.500
 At a gradual downward angle to the wind 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.940
 Start building the walls from the bottom up. Use the stick to make a runway around the building to drain rainwater 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.960
 For a convenient arrangement, it can be filled with pine nuts, dry moss, leaves, and ferns 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.440
 In the winter do not wear very warm clothes 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.480
 As your body is able to adjust temperature and sweating leads to dehydration. 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.540
 On your way out wear your shoes and thick woolen socks 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.720
 Let your jeans be at home, you'll need a larger space around your knees for lightness. 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.520
 Look for clothes that have many pockets 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.960
 Preferably those that can be closed, loose cotton shirts will provide you with better protection from insects. 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.720
 Use animal fat to lubricate shoes and make them water resistant, 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.180
 Bird feathers can also be kept under clothing to make them warm when needed. 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.400
 Now review the section and record all notes for reference when Internet use is unavailable. 

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:47.709
 good luck 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.950
