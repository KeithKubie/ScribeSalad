00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.960
Being vulnerable is hard.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.160
It's for you.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.440
Because it means opening yourself up to being emotionally hurt

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.340
and who wants that?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.380
Who wants to open up only to be smacked down?

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.420
But being vulnerable today means having the courage to be yourself in a world where we curate people's perceptions of us,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.460
where we equate our value with likes and subscribers,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.300
and where we're raised to think that what's out here is more important than what's in here.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.080
But I think being vulnerable is such a beautiful thing,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.840
and the key to more intimate relationships.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.440
It gives you a deeper connection with family, friends, or a partner.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.720
And yes, it's scary as fuuuck!

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.160
A few weeks ago, I pissed my pants when I was out with my boyfriend.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.960
He didn't notice because I tied my jacket around my waist.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.020
But I had the options of basically playing it off and hoping that it dried soon,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.760
or just owning it and telling him.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.640
And between, like, crying and laughing, I ultimately decided,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.480
Fuck it! I'll just tell him, I guess, because this is me.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.760
I'm a 27 year old woman who just pissed her pants walking across the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.660
[Deep Breath]

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.660
And, uh, he was really nice. He was just like, "I love you so much. That's hilarious."

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.200
And we went on our merry way.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.260
And obviously this was like an incredibly vulnerable moment because

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.980
I was pretty sure I was going to be judged or he was gonna be disgusted,

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.220
or worst case scenario, he would ride off into the sunset in a rented Mustang,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.320
and he would find another woman.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.620
But none of those things happened.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.280
And we are definitely closer for it.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.740
So even if you're not ready to, like, piss your pants in the name of vulnerability,

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.580
I do think that being vulnerable on an everyday basis is so important.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.460
Like, allowing yourself to fall in love, or allowing other people in, or trusting people to know all of you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.020
without the fear of rejection or judgment,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.780
or at least not letting those fears stop you, is incredibly courageous.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.860
And I wanted to talk about this because I know that it's really hard.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.780
Like, when you've been burned by someone or when you've been rejected,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.000
it's increasingly difficult to let yourself be vulnerable again.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.080
And I mean, who hasn't been hurt? We're hurt all the time.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.440
But it is just so easy to let yourself become callous or pessimistic or cynical

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.960
and let these previous experiences deter you from being open again in the future.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.040
So I hope you know it just doesn't have to be that way.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.680
You can piss your fucking pants and someone will still love you. Who knew? Not me.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.780
But I do think that being vulnerable has immense rewards.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.360
And yes, sometimes you will get hurt, and sometimes it does have its drawbacks,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.560
but you never know what could happen if you don't put yourself out there.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.700
You could miss out on love or connection or even potentially a career.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.460
Because my job is to share intimate details about my life with strangers and have it live on the internet forever.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.320
So I encourage you to live your life with more vulnerability.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.740
Love recklessly. Be who you are with no shame.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.820
And if you piss your pants, tell the whole fucking world.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.940
I'm Anna Akana. I'll probably regret this.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.560
