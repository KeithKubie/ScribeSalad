LOGAN URY: So it's my
pleasure to welcome

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.670
my friend, Moira, here today.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.520
And we're so lucky
to have her with us.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.770
She's a writer and
academic who is currently

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.080
part of the Harvard
Society of Fellows.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.550
She just finished
her PhD at Yale,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.150
so we should all
congratulate her afterwards.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.960
And her work is fascinating.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.460
It's at the intersection
of social theory,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.280
along with histories of
labor, media, and technology

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.710
in the 20th and 21st centuries.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.900
Her book, which we'll
be talking about today,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.200
is called "Labor of Love,
The Invention of Dating."

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.420
And Moira is also
a founding editor

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.020
of "Logic," which is a new
magazine about technology.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.797
Moira Weigel, thank
you for joining us.

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:47.380
MOIRA WEIGEL: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.350
LOGAN URY: Woo.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.030
OK.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.940
So just to kick it off, I
want to start by digging

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.740
into the book.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.510
You've called the
book "Labor of Love,"

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.780
secretly an economic history.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.020
What's the connection between
economic forces and dating,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.162
and how has that played
out in the last century?

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:05.620
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah,
well, there are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440
a lot of connections between
economic forces and dating.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.590
I feel like, to backtrack
to when I was first

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.990
starting to think about
the book, part of why--

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.601
contrary to what it might
seem, I wasn't always obsessed

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.100
with dating, or at
least not anymore

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.520
than I think most
people probably are.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.240
But one aspect of its history
that really interested

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.850
me is that this practice
that we call dating,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.417
that we might take for granted
as sort of like natural

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.250
and not think about as
something historical,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.870
is actually pretty
new in human history,

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.870
if you look at most societies.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.210
It's not been the case that
young people go out and meet

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.750
one another on their own.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.050
And it really only
emerges when you

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.034
start to have large numbers
of women in the workforce.

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:48.450
Dating is connected
to the economy

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.700
in a number of different ways.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.033
But one of the big ways, and
part of why, as a feminist,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.650
I was excited to
write about it, is

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.600
it only emerges
as a practice when

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.150
you have large numbers of
women going outside the home,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.340
going outside private
space into public space,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.010
earning their own money,
and taking control

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.530
of their own romantic
and sexual lives

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.259
in a way that really was
pretty unprecedented.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.080
I mean, it's quite interesting,
because of course, this

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.400
happens differently-- my
book's mostly about America.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.560
But we can watch this happen
in Asia in a different way,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.070
or in Africa in a different way.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.760
But the history of dating
is very tied to the history

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.384
of women entering paid work.

00:02:23.384 --> 00:02:25.550
And then, of course, there
are some other ways, too.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.210
I think that the ways we
think about love and romance

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.320
are totally shaped, in a
number of ways, by the way

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.770
we think about
economics, in terms

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.056
of being on the market, off
the market, hard to get.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.430
These are all
economic metaphors.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.310
So I think there's a kind of
economic unconscious to how

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.134
we think of a lot of
things about dating.

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:45.050
LOGAN URY: Absolutely.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.040
So how has today's
economy reflected itself

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.190
in this age of Tinder?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.880
MOIRA WEIGEL: What's the gig,
the sexual gig economy like?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.830
I think that, like every
other aspect of our lives,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.730
our romantic and sexual lives
are becoming more flexible.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.864
And this has both positive
and negative aspects.

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:08.530
I feel like one reason
I wanted to write

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.560
the book was to push back
against all these kind of doom

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.460
and gloom narratives about
dating apps and online dating.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.862
I feel like around 2012, 2013,
when I was first starting--

00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:20.445
2013, 2014-- when I
was first starting

00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:22.240
to think about these
questions, there

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.180
were a series of high
profile stories and books.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.970
And I know that folks had
moms send these to them,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.200
or saw them in another way.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.590
But there was this
big end of men story

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.730
that was in "The Atlantic."

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.740
There was a huge "New
York Times" story

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.270
called "The End of Courtship."

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.910
There was all this anxiety
about hookup culture.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.057
And I'm always interested
in these conversations

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.390
about crisis, because I think
it's where people actually

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.960
articulate what they believe men
should be and women should be.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.510
So I'm always very
suspicious of them.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.832
But at that time, anyway,
I was interested in all

00:03:54.832 --> 00:03:56.290
these articles that
were basically,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.670
like, humans have always met
and fallen in love in this way.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.260
And ever since
caveman days, this

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.510
is how men and women
were until Tinder.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.190
And now everything's over.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.650
This, as a historian
and as a young person

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.330
who was still dating, this
seemed suspicious to me.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.210
So part of why I wanted
to do this research

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.847
was, I was, like, well, it
can't really be the end of sex

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:17.430
and the end of men
and the end of love

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.620
and the end of courtship
all because of Tinder.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.150
So what's behind that?

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.910
So anyway, that was
wanting to push back

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.550
against that narrative of
crisis around courtship

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.374
was part of how I got
into this project.

00:04:29.374 --> 00:04:30.040
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.140
That's something that really
fascinated me about the book.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.556
It felt like there were these
moments of crisis every time

00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:35.741
there was new technology.

00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.490
And I actually found
it pretty comforting.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.632
So you talked in
the book about how,

00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:41.590
when the automobile came
out, people were like,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.850
this is the end of morality.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.800
And at these different
stages, people

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.120
had this moral hand-wringing.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.010
So I would love if
you could talk us

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.420
through some of those moments.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.700
And then also tell
us, is there even

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.950
such thing as traditional
courtship, this idea

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.260
that people seem to
think is being lost,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.045
is that even
something that exists?

00:04:58.045 --> 00:04:59.170
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yes, totally.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.790
So this will either
be really comforting

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.740
or really depressing, depending
how you think about it.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.960
But one of the interesting
things about the history

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.277
of dating is that-- and to
talk about it, by the way,

00:05:08.277 --> 00:05:08.860
people often--

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.110
I call it, in the subtitle,
"The Invention of Dating,"

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.280
and people are like,
well, what does that mean?

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.446
Haven't people always dated?

00:05:13.446 --> 00:05:16.042
And I joke that dating
was invented in 1896.

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:17.500
It is the first
time that we see it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.990
in the print record being used--

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.180
that word, in the way
that we use it now.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.410
But basically, and again,
as I was saying earlier,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.730
it's tied to women entering
the workplace and young people

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.060
in general moving to cities and
this new kind of urban culture

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.220
that you have emerging
in that period.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.787
But when you go back
into the history,

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.870
the thing that is either
comforting or depressing,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.245
depending how you
think about it,

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:42.850
is there has never been any
time or place in which people

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.160
are, like, dating,
great, killing it,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.527
I'm sure I'm doing it right.

00:05:46.527 --> 00:05:47.860
All the kids are doing it right.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.360
We're not worried
about them at all.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.460
It's constantly, from
the very beginning

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.520
of dating, dating is said
to be dying or in crisis.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.340
And one of my favorite
research things

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.256
is that I learned that
during the first decade

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.970
or so that you have
women going out

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.570
with men on what we would
now think of as the most

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.000
traditional looking kind of
date, like going out to dinner

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.240
or going out to a movie, that
the person who would do this

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.049
are often arrested on
prostitution charges.

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:14.590
And a lot of the
early research I did

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.780
was in, like, vice squad
reports, because there

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.140
was no precedent for women
going out on their own

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.490
with men, or for money being
transacted in courtship.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.470
When you think of a
Jane Austen novel,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.270
Mr. Darcy isn't buying anything.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.740
He's just going
to her living room

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.250
and hanging out with her mom--

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.370
Elizabeth Bennett,
that's her name.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.352
So anyway, I think that back
in the very beginning, the very

00:06:36.352 --> 00:06:38.560
first period where you have
this thing called dating,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.800
you have not just hand-wringing,
but literally arrests

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.794
and people being dragged
off to reformatory.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:45.460
And then throughout
the history, there's

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.632
this constant kind of
overtone of anxiety,

00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:50.590
both from the grown ups
and from the people who

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.730
are participating in dating.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.354
Because one thing
that's distinctive is

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:54.280
nobody ever knows--

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.140
unlike courtships
systems, where it's

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.410
controlled by parents or by
rabbis or priests or whomever--

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.020
a defining feature of dating is
that nobody knows exactly how

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.230
you're supposed to do it.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.710
And that's always been true.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:04.990
LOGAN URY: Right.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.310
So let's paint a
picture for people

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.393
who haven't read the book.

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:08.920
What came before dating?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.940
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.010
So in the book, of
course, everywhere

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.700
has their own variables
and their own situations.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.560
But the dominant
middle class system

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.220
of courtship in the 19th
century is called calling.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.830
And again, it's the Jane
Austen scenario, right?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.027
You sit in your living room.

00:07:25.027 --> 00:07:26.860
Your mom, your aunt,
your sisters are there.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.874
Gentlemen callers
can come visit you.

00:07:29.874 --> 00:07:31.540
It's almost-- and
since I'm an academic,

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.640
I always think of it as a kind
of awkward, like, office hours,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.765
romantic kind of situation.

00:07:35.765 --> 00:07:37.306
LOGAN URY: No one
ever goes to those.

00:07:37.306 --> 00:07:37.856
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:39.180
MOIRA WEIGEL: They do.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.650
No one wants to come
to my office hours.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.790
But yeah, so calling it
as a system of courtship

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.427
is symbolically important.

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:49.510
I mean, I believe that all
of our social practices

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.090
encode all kinds of
beliefs about how

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.617
we think the world works
and what kinds of rules

00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:56.950
different people should perform.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.690
But it locates courtship
in the home, right?

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.650
So it's in the
territory of the family.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.310
It's being supervised.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.050
It is supposed to
be non-economic.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.310
No money is exchanged.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.018
I mean, the thing
that's very interesting

00:08:08.018 --> 00:08:10.300
is that it's also
very much understood

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.590
to be in control of the women.

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.030
I read-- there's an advice
column in "The Ladies Home

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.730
Journal," which is the
most popular magazine

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.620
in the world around 1900.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.720
And there's an advice
columnist called the Lady

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.520
from Philadelphia, who answers
people's romantic questions.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.440
And she would get these letters
from young men saying, oh,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.919
can I go call on a young woman
if she hasn't invited me?

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.721
And the Lady from Philadelphia,
contrary to our belief

00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:38.179
that men are always
the initiators,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.076
says absolutely not.

00:08:39.076 --> 00:08:39.909
You know, you can't.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:40.799
If a woman doesn't
want to see you,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.924
you can't go show up at
her house in this way.

00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:44.590
So there's this
important sense in which

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.150
the calling system makes women
like the hosts of courtship.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.920
And this dramatically
changes when

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.910
courtship moves from the
living room, with mom and dad,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.920
into the public sphere,
which historically

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.530
has been seen as the sphere
of men, the sphere of money,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.136
the sphere of the market.

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:03.010
LOGAN URY: So it's the
predecessor to Bumble.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.480
Women have to make
the first move?

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.896
MOIRA WEIGEL:
Something like that.

00:09:05.896 --> 00:09:08.470
Think about it-- if
your mom were on Bumble,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.312
watching [INAUDIBLE], maybe.

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:11.020
LOGAN URY: Great.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.728
So we'll talk about
that in a little bit,

00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:14.860
in terms of these
ideas that we think

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.210
are deep seated into our DNA,
and actually are relatively new

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.260
inventions.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.170
So one thing I read was that
you had initially thought

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.000
of things like dating
and relationships

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.440
as maybe too silly or trivial
to warrant serious study.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.440
How did you change and
come to write this book?

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.940
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah,
well, this book,

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.980
as my PhD supervisor would
be happy to tell you,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.260
was a distraction from
my main PhD research.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.930
It wasn't what I was supposed
to be working on at Yale, where

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.650
I was in grad school.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.952
I feel like, again,
about this time when

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:46.660
there were all these
stories coming out--

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.390
which I see, in a
way, as a reaction

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.390
to the financial crisis.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:51.681
I mean, we could have a longer
conversation about this,

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:55.180
but why around 2013, 2014, there
was all this anxiety in the air

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.615
about men aren't
acting like men,

00:09:57.615 --> 00:09:59.990
and women aren't-- you know,
kids aren't dating properly.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.400
But in that moment,
I was in grad school.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.650
I was getting trained in
all these ways of looking

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.597
at theory and history.

00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:08.680
But of course, on my own
time, I spent all my time

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.440
with my friends talking about
love and sex and romancing,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.390
not all of it, but
quite a lot of it.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.300
And I feel as if I came to
this point where I realized,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.700
we're all developing these huge
intellectual tool kits to look

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.820
at certain kinds of questions.

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:26.530
But why don't we take this other
kind of question seriously?

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.830
And I think, in a very
deep way, you know,

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.490
dating, for better or worse, is
the system that our culture has

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.350
in place for reproducing the
world, forming social bonds,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.150
for entering biological
reproduction,

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.070
for setting up kinship networks.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.460
There's very little that's more
serious than that, actually.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.020
And I think that there's
actually something

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.770
really kind of sexist and
conservative about treating

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.420
some of these topics
as if they don't

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.370
warrant serious
intellectual consideration.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.280
I mean, I think it's
kind of funny to have

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.930
this whole cultural
system, especially

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.971
if you're a straight woman,
where you've grown up

00:11:03.971 --> 00:11:06.280
your whole life with
magazines and movies and books

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.769
and all of these cultural
signals telling you here's

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:11.560
what you should want,
here's how you should

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.476
be if you want to be
loved, which, by the way,

00:11:13.476 --> 00:11:15.550
is the most important
thing about you.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.950
And then the minute
that you're, like,

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.210
I have a question about that.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.540
It's like, it's not serious.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.080
Don't waste serious intellectual
energy looking at this.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.210
So I feel as if I
came to the project

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.700
kind of extracurricularly
in graduate school.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.000
But then once I started thinking
about it and all the ways

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.620
that our romantic
beliefs are enmeshed

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.380
in deep social beliefs,
historical practices, that kind

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:41.390
of thing, I really felt,
it felt important to take

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.570
a serious intellectual
lens to look

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.820
at the sources of these
messages and the work

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.640
that they were doing in terms
of teaching us to desire.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.230
LOGAN URY: Well, I'm so
glad you did write the book.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.790
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, thank you.

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.180
LOGAN URY: And I
was wondering if you

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.510
would read this passage for us.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:53.681
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, dear.

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:54.181
Sure.

00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:56.950
LOGAN URY: And then I have
a follow up question on it.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.720
MOIRA WEIGEL: Ooh.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.310
Look at this.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.645
All right.

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:04.090
I began to feel a need
to write this book when

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.780
I sensed that I was trying to
make a life according to rules

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.590
I did not understand and that
the process had blinded me

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:13.660
to my desires.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.970
Following my desires was
supposed to be the point.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.970
Yet I had never
reflected long enough

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.700
to discover whether the
feelings that I believe

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.580
should be there actually were.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.070
I had no idea who I was.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.990
And as long as I
kept impersonating

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.030
all the women I
thought I should be,

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.150
I could not receive
love, much less give it.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.825
I had no self to
choose to give it from.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.162
True story.

00:12:41.162 --> 00:12:42.620
So if you ever feel
moved to laugh,

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.286
or it seems like I'm
trying to be funny,

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:45.892
just, like, feel free.

00:12:45.892 --> 00:12:47.350
LOGAN URY: So based
on that passage

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.050
and based on what you know
now, I'd love to ask you

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.350
what advice would you
give 16-year-old Moira?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.290
And more broadly, if
you could design a class

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.810
that every high school
girl had to take

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.050
before entering
adult relationships,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.770
what would you include
in that course?

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.990
MOIRA WEIGEL: OK, these
are big questions.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.030
I think-- and I'd be very
curious to hear from people

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.530
here--

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.071
I think what's
interesting, if you're

00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:14.410
a certain kind of ambitious,
Type A, high achieving,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.050
straight woman especially,
you receive this one set

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.342
of messages about your career.

00:13:18.342 --> 00:13:19.800
And you're supposed
to be confident

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.133
and you're supposed to be
able to act in all these ways.

00:13:22.133 --> 00:13:24.336
And then you receive,
basically, opposite messages

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.210
about your love life.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.940
And indeed, not only are you
not supposed to show initiative,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.690
you're supposed to do all this
extra work to cover up the fact

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.700
that you have those traits.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.800
So I feel as if--

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.760
I mean, 16-year-old Moira, who
knows what could have helped.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.710
But if I could have known
anything earlier, I think--

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.530
I don't know, I would
have liked to be

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.081
more aware of the ways
in which these rules that

00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:55.580
are given to us and these things
that we're taught about how

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:00.440
to be if we want to be desirable
serve all these incentives that

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.730
are not necessarily our own.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.800
It's an excellent way
to sell women things.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.590
Like, anxiety-- it's, like, tell
a woman that something that she

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.067
didn't even know was a
thing is wrong with her,

00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:10.650
and then sell her
the thing to fix it.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.850
It's like an engine of quite a
lot of the economy in general.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.750
But I feel as if, yeah,
this way in which you

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.460
get so many messages that are
also always about repressing

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.420
your own feelings.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.836
If you think, and we can talk
about this, but if you think

00:14:25.836 --> 00:14:28.070
about how many self-help
franchises are basically,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.350
like, whatever you
might feel like doing,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.400
do the opposite thing.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.140
Don't do that.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.181
Don't show your feelings.

00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:34.820
Don't express your desires.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.570
I think being aware of the
ways in which that grows out

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.871
of history that's
deeply sexist and serves

00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:42.620
institutions and
practices that are deeply

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.190
sexist would have been
helpful and probably would

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:50.580
have made me less anxious and
self-hated in various moments.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.314
What was the other
thing, a syllabus?

00:14:52.314 --> 00:14:54.480
LOGAN URY: Yeah, I mean,
it's kind of a combination.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.880
It's like, what would
16-year-old Moira

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.070
have benefited from knowing
with what you know now?

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.278
But what would women in
general benefit from knowing?

00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:01.657
And I think the
answer of just be

00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:03.740
skeptical of somebody
telling you that something's

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.490
wrong with you and
then trying to sell you

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.850
something to fix it is
good advice for all of us.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.780
MOIRA WEIGEL: And I think also--

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.946
and it's hard for us to do,
and it's especially hard

00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:13.220
to do in romance, because
we all have so much at stake

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.110
personally and want
to make things work--

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.770
but also to think structurally
and systemically sometimes

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.280
can be very helpful.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.700
But I think that this is the
opposite of what we usually

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.570
want from self-help.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.210
Usually, what we want is a
totally normal fair thing

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.960
to want--

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.030
is we're, like, what
are the 10 tricks that

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.490
will help me navigate
this situation, you know,

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.320
whether it's
professional or personal.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.130
But I think that what is
exciting and radicalizing and

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.750
liberating about
studying history

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.080
is you see how many of
these issues and problems

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.620
are, in fact,
structural and social.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.920
And there's quite
a lot of work left

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.290
to do before women are
romantic equals, or equals

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.840
of any kind, in all kinds
of social situations,

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.450
substantively and meaningfully.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.840
And those solutions can't all
be done by working on yourself

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.470
personally.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.520
LOGAN URY: Is that
a real pep talk

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.870
that you've given your
friends, where they're, like,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.040
what's wrong with me?

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.206
And then you're,
like, it's not you.

00:16:06.206 --> 00:16:09.800
It's market forces and
society and 100 years

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.170
of sexist institutions
that have contributed

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:13.640
to where you are today.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.970
MOIRA WEIGEL: More than 100.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.820
I think that I have--

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.490
trying to think of specific
friend and specific pep talks.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.550
I mean, I think this sense in
which the answer that we get

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.980
is so often work a little
harder on yourself, do

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.600
a little bit more about this.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.760
I think that the idea
that it's that's not,

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.160
the problem isn't always
you, is certainly a thing

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.230
that I've stressed to friends.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.700
Whether I talk about market
forces when comforting

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.874
a friend, I hope I don't.

00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:47.790
LOGAN URY: So I want to
talk a little bit more

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.961
about what you mentioned
about self-help books.

00:16:49.961 --> 00:16:51.960
So you make this really
great point in your book

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.750
that if you go to a
bookstore and you walk down

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.480
the self-help aisle, on your
left-hand side you might see

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.060
all the career books
that tell you lean in,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.550
work harder, don't
speak with uptalk.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.859
And it's all about
really putting effort

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:05.808
in toward your career.

00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:07.349
And then on the
right-hand side could

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.098
be all of these books
about your love life

00:17:09.098 --> 00:17:11.490
that say, whatever you want
to do, do the opposite.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:11.990
And--

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.020
MOIRA WEIGEL: It's
not him, it's you.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.660
LOGAN URY: Yeah, I think I'll
quote you here, when you said,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.951
if you want to call him, don't.

00:17:16.951 --> 00:17:18.540
If you want to sleep
with him, don't.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.956
If you slept with him and you
want to call him afterwards,

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.410
don't.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:23.250
And it's true.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.800
MOIRA WEIGEL: It's like the
rules is literally 32 chapters,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.750
each one of which is, like,
don't do this thing that you

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.410
want to do.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:29.118
LOGAN URY: Right.

00:17:29.118 --> 00:17:31.980
So I think it's fascinating to
just explore how on one hand,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.960
we're being told to
put so much effort in,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.420
and on the other hand,
we're told to be passive.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.970
So how do you
navigate that tension?

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.720
MOIRA WEIGEL: Wow.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.740
It's a big question.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.990
I mean, I think that,
again, to look to history,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.850
a thing that interests me is
to go back to the beginning

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.141
when we were saying how this
whole phenomenon of dating

00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:49.410
is predicated on women
being in the workforce,

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.590
being mobile in cities,
having certain kinds of agency

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.060
that we haven't had
historically, that it's then

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.300
that you start to see all
this romantic advice as

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.010
almost like a
reaction or an attempt

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.550
to control female sexuality,
given that it's no longer being

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:05.580
controlled by mom and dad
and the rabbi or the priest.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:08.450
I think that-- sorry--

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.450
I think that that perspective
was very interesting to get

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.730
while researching the book.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.380
It was fun to look at 19th
century advice, advice

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.620
for calling, because people
were also anxious about calling.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.657
But there wasn't this
emphasis on deceit.

00:18:22.657 --> 00:18:24.240
I feel like in
contemporary self-help,

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.520
there's so much emphasis--
and I mean this, by the way,

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.353
for straight people.

00:18:27.353 --> 00:18:29.964
Fascinatingly, self-help for
queer people is very different,

00:18:29.964 --> 00:18:31.380
and I think shows
how much of this

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.900
is about reinforcing certain
binary gender roles, actually.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.860
But there's so much
emphasis on not

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.140
showing too much
about how you feel

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.040
or covering up your desire.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.150
And this really only
emerges with dating.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.130
In this earlier era,
there's much more

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.680
emphasis on sort of
sincere self-expression

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:51.000
and straightforwardness.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.980
And I think that in a lot of
ways, from a macro perspective,

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.430
this is about controlling
female sexuality

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:00.210
and how anxious it makes a
culture broadly for women

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.717
to have certain kinds of
liberties that they hadn't had.

00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:05.050
LOGAN URY: And also, if you
tell women men are from Mars

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.840
and women are from
Venus, it's a lot easier

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.820
to sell both of them a book
to explain the other gender.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.320
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah,
exactly, I feel,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.410
like, very, very many self-help
books can kind of be summarized

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.550
as, what dudes are like, by
a dude, what women are really

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:18.370
like, by a woman.

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.940
That this sort of
mutual mystification

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.160
of men and women to each
other is a very good engine

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.872
for selling both sides things.

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:26.580
LOGAN URY: So this
whole idea about women

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.890
need to be passive in
dating, it's often chalked up

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.780
to this evolutionary legacy.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.520
Can you talk a
little bit about that

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.670
and where some of that
pseudo science emerges from,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.479
and how that impacts us today?

00:19:37.479 --> 00:19:38.270
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.145
Well, I think, I don't
know, have folks seen,

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:42.390
I feel like maybe this
trend has peaked and gone

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.140
down a little bit.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:46.110
But I feel like the
[? ev ?] site click bait,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.420
the article that's
like, did men evolve

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.920
to like women in high heels?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.000
Like, yes, click it.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.620
This is sort of like a
kind of a piece that--

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.520
LOGAN URY: Well,
there's that new book

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.650
that came out "Casual
Sex", about how

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.442
Tinder is affecting monogamy.

00:19:57.442 --> 00:19:59.400
And I think it reinforces
a lot of these ideas.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:19:59.700
So it's still--

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.140
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, what
does that book say?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.070
LOGAN URY: I
haven't read it yet.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.420
I just read an article about it.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.410
But it was basically saying that
men had to become monogamous

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.020
in order to get married, which
gave them access to women

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.400
and an ability to reproduce.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.605
But now with Tinder, men
have this easy access to sex

00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:15.230
when they want.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.640
So there's this bifurcation
between the place

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.610
I go for sex and the place I go
for marriage, which is leading

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.055
fewer people to want marriage.

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:23.430
MOIRA WEIGEL: It's
really amazing

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.220
how many respectable academics
and scholars in 2017,

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.950
it's never occurred to them
that women might also enjoy sex.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.850
But it's like there's still
this idea that heterosexuality

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.810
is this depressing truce
whereby women give as little sex

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.330
as they can get away
with for affection,

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.450
and that men do the opposite
or the contrapositive,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:45.240
whatever the mirror
image of that is.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.390
I think that it's
very comforting

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.990
to believe that
certain phenomena are

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.840
natural or biological
or are hardwired in,

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.970
like the Pleistocene era.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.115
And we all love--

00:20:58.115 --> 00:21:00.490
we don't, I don't, I love
carbohydrates-- but many people

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:04.640
love Paleo diets, or this idea
that something was natural

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.560
and it's how cave people did
it, so it's how we should do it.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.860
I think that this is very
rarely a useful framework

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:12.750
for explaining human behavior.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.860
We're social creatures.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.230
We're historical creatures.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.030
This isn't just some
wishy-washy kind

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.350
of social construction thing.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.540
Brain scientists talk about
the plasticity of the brain

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.330
and how quickly it can change.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.560
Scholars of gene expression
talk about how much

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.887
environmental factors
trigger and shape which genes

00:21:29.887 --> 00:21:30.970
express themselves or not.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.020
So this idea that the
nature of heterosexuality

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.170
was established by cave people
and we're still somehow acting

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.580
that out, always to me
seemed very circular

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.570
in all sorts of ways.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.764
You know, it's often--

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:46.930
Stephen Jay Gould, who is
the evolutionary biologist

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:50.500
at Harvard, described this kind
of story as "just so" stories,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.920
but also, just not that
useful a mode of explanation.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.560
As I was suggesting earlier,
you look back at advice columns

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:00.040
from 1905, and they say
totally different things

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.690
to what we say now
about who should

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:04.390
take the initiative in
a courtship situation

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:05.320
or whose role it is.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.310
So I think that humans are
much stranger and more flexible

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.069
than this kind of
narrative suggests.

00:22:11.069 --> 00:22:12.610
And it's really
comforting sometimes.

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.568
I think, it's kind of--

00:22:13.568 --> 00:22:15.970
ev psych narratives are
comforting to everybody.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.020
If you are a conservative
in certain gender beliefs,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.502
it's reassuring to
think, like, oh, things

00:22:22.502 --> 00:22:23.460
won't change that much.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.750
This is how people are.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.020
And if you're frustrated
by the lack of progress,

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.380
it's like, your
boyfriend is not a jerk.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.380
He evolved not to pick up
the dry cleaning, you know?

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.880
So I think that
these narratives are

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.290
very appealing as click bait.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.300
But I think that
they don't really,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.860
they're not very
useful, actually,

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.840
in terms of their
explanatory power.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.280
And there have
been many critiques

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.340
within academia of evolutionary
psychology specifically.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:49.840
It's funny.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.780
This is one of these modes
of thought that's existed

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.200
and it's popularized
for much beyond,

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.990
much longer than it's existed in
its institutionalized academic

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.530
form.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.030
LOGAN URY: I love how
you called it click bait.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.279
And I think it's interesting
to note that it's neither

00:23:03.279 --> 00:23:05.950
helpful for explaining
gender roles in dating nor

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.220
for why there are fewer
female engineers at places

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.780
like Google.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.830
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, dear.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.810
Is there a question?

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.510
LOGAN URY: Implicit question.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.730
MOIRA WEIGEL: An
implicit question?

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.130
Yeah, I think that--

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.620
I mean, this is a very charged
thing to talk about here.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.460
Again, I would just say
I think that explanations

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.760
that refer to some kind of
absolute natural disposition

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.776
are not usually very useful.

00:23:33.776 --> 00:23:35.900
And usually, when you go
back to the scientists who

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.720
are being cited do not
hold up to scrutiny.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.610
I think that there are
gender distributions,

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.900
it's not that there's no
differences among genders.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.640
But I think that,
usually, it'll be

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.550
like the brain scientists,
when you ask them,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:53.030
say 10% of this difference is
due to gender, and 90% of it

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:54.140
is due to other factors.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.240
There are more differences
among people than--

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.620
in this one class than
across the classes.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.640
And so I think that, again, it's
reassuring to certain people

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.460
to believe that what
is natural is good

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.110
and that nature sanctions a
certain kind of social order.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.980
But I think this is
usually not a very useful

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.740
and certainly not a
very progressive way

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.820
to think about our
relations as humans.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.160
LOGAN URY: So I just want to
underline your point, which

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.170
is that if anyone does
point to these things,

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.090
like women being
passive and men being

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.910
the aggressor in
relationships as natural,

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:26.050
even looking back 100 years,
things were totally different.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.962
So it isn't really
based in history.

00:24:27.962 --> 00:24:29.420
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah,
no, and indeed,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.040
history provides plenty
of counter examples.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.300
I mean, that's
what's so cool to me

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.860
and exciting about
studying history,

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.870
is it's so much
weirder than you think.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.162
And our social arrangements
are so much more contingent

00:24:38.162 --> 00:24:39.578
than you might
imagine, which also

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:41.000
means that they can be changed.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.500
Incidentally, I'm sure
everyone here knows this,

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.620
but programming is originally
a female profession,

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.510
predominantly.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:47.650
There's a great new book
about this by my friend,

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:48.650
so I'm going to tout it.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.540
It's called "Programmed
Inequality,"

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.647
about the pushing out--

00:24:51.647 --> 00:24:53.730
I've been doing a little
research at MIT on this--

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:56.357
but the pushing out of female
programmers in the 1980s,

00:24:56.357 --> 00:24:57.690
basically from their profession.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:01.400
So the idea that the current
gender distribution reflects

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.467
some sort of timeless
biological reality

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:06.800
rather than a certain set of
social arrangements, to me,

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.440
seems pretty tenuous, when
you look at as recently

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.530
as the 1970s and 1980s,
the gender distributions

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.779
were that different.

00:25:13.779 --> 00:25:16.070
LOGAN URY: I'm excited to
talk to you about that later.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:17.410
Yeah, I have a lot of
thoughts on that one.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:17.530
MOIRA WEIGEL: Take
the microphone off

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.530
and talk about it later.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:19.988
LOGAN URY: So in
this conversation,

00:25:19.988 --> 00:25:21.920
you've identified
yourself as a feminist.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.320
But I read, or I heard
in another interview

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.510
you did, that you didn't
always identify as a feminist.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:30.830
And in fact, you felt like you
could overachieve your way out

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:33.159
of these glass
ceiling situations.

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:34.700
What's been your
journey from feeling

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.359
like that was a possibility
to where you are now?

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:38.150
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.800
I think-- I love this question.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.341
And I'd be very
curious, I don't want

00:25:41.341 --> 00:25:45.880
to put anyone on the spot, who
identifies as a feminist here?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.850
Yeah.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:47.750
And I think that--

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.916
LOGAN URY: Most of the room.

00:25:48.916 --> 00:25:50.430
MOIRA WEIGEL: Most of the room.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:52.430
Did anyone else, maybe
this is a question people

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.910
have to think through, but
experience this thing of not

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:57.020
identifying that way,
and then in their 20s

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:01.042
or in a later life period,
coming to identify that way?

00:26:01.042 --> 00:26:02.750
Yeah, because I think
the only thing that

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.080
makes me feel less
embarrassed of how long

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.080
it took me to identify that
way is how many brilliant women

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.600
I know who say
something similar.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.532
I think that part of it, I'm
sure, I grew up in the '90s.

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:17.990
I'm sure part of it was the
historical mood when I grew up.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.284
But I also think until
you reach a certain age,

00:26:21.284 --> 00:26:22.700
there's this way
that you imagine,

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.210
as a young woman
of a certain kind,

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.709
that if you're just good enough,
if you're just good enough,

00:26:26.709 --> 00:26:28.280
it won't apply to you.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.170
It's amazing.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.540
I'm thinking about this because
of the Harvey Weinstein stuff

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.040
today.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.920
It's amazing when I think about
how many women I admire have--

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.870
since we've gotten a bit older--
talked about getting sexually

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.580
harassed at work and how
it's systemic and prevalent,

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:40.820
that is.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.560
But I think that
when you're younger,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.152
you just think, you know,
if I just do this right,

00:26:45.152 --> 00:26:47.360
or if I'm just smart enough,
or I'm just good enough,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.609
surely this won't apply to me.

00:26:48.609 --> 00:26:51.110
And nobody wants to
identify with a class that's

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.359
systemically disadvantaged.

00:26:52.359 --> 00:26:54.650
You know, nobody-- and this
comes back to your question

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.180
about what's
trivialized and what's

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.610
treated as unserious, and
sort of pink and frilly,

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.190
is female things.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.920
So I think that, gosh, it's hard
for me to pinpoint the moment.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.010
And I do think something
in the zeitgeist changed.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:08.718
Like, if we look at
that moment, I always

00:27:08.718 --> 00:27:12.450
think of Beyonce at the VMAs in
front of the big feminist sign.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.310
But there were many things in
the air in 2013, 2014, I think.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.820
You know, "Lean In,"
Sheryl Sandberg's book,

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.880
all sorts of other
cultural signals

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.490
suggested that feminism was
trendy for the first time

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.090
in our lives.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.070
I'm sure that influenced me.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.520
But I think that a lot of it
is just growing up and entering

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.770
more professional situations
or more adult situations,

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.320
when you realize that you
can't overachieve your way out

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.770
of anything or
everything, that it's

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:44.720
like these structural things do
indeed apply to you, no matter

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.722
how excellent you may be.

00:27:46.722 --> 00:27:48.222
And of course, this
applies, it goes

00:27:48.222 --> 00:27:49.520
without saying, across
[? intersectional ?]

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.030
identities.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:50.960
It's not just women.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.495
This is true for all
kinds of groups that

00:27:53.495 --> 00:27:54.620
are historically oppressed.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.250
But I think that,
yeah, I think it

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.500
was the experiences in my 20s.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.120
And also dating really
terrible men, if I'm honest.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.990
But both in work
and in love, I think

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.310
that I came to that realization
or to that identification

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.300
belatedly.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.650
LOGAN URY: Yeah, I mean, this
really resonates with me.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.660
I mean, we're similar ages.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.160
And everything you
said about, like,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.770
if you grow up on
the Powerpuff Girls

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.480
and Spice Girls and
Girl Power and being

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.060
told that girls can do anything,
you sort of believe it.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.890
And you don't want to
identify with people

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.485
who are having a
harder time and maybe

00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:26.100
who haven't experienced it.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.940
But at a certain point,
being the teacher's pet

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.724
or doing everything right
doesn't necessarily serve you

00:28:31.724 --> 00:28:33.140
and there's
structural things that

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.300
are actually
affecting you at work

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.710
or affecting you in academia.

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.680
And I even feel like
in Silicon Valley,

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.230
a lot of risk taking
behavior is really valued,

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.490
which in some ways is at odds
with this teacher's pet persona

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.147
that a lot of women
are forced into.

00:28:48.147 --> 00:28:49.730
So it's something
I've been observing,

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:52.520
which is for women to be
successful and take risks,

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.790
they almost have to shed
that teacher's pet persona

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.766
that they were praised
for for the first 18 or 22

00:28:58.766 --> 00:28:59.640
years of their lives.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.056
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah,
it make sense.

00:29:01.056 --> 00:29:04.610
And of course, this runs
into issues with age, too.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.140
But it's easier to
take risks if you

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.030
have no caring
responsibilities or children

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.196
or other kinds of things
that are disproportionately

00:29:10.196 --> 00:29:10.740
put on women.

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.390
So of course, this value
that's placed on risk taking

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.700
has certain gendered
elements, as well.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.750
But it's true, I think I was
raised to be a very good girl.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.440
I was a very good
girl for a long time.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.940
And you do everything
you're supposed to,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.981
and realize that it,
nonetheless, doesn't get you

00:29:24.981 --> 00:29:29.180
out of the situation
you might be in,

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.961
or that that experience
can be very radicalizing.

00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:34.460
But I think I realized-- this
became a plot line on the show

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.850
"Insecure" recently,
which I love.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:36.650
LOGAN URY: Oh, I'm a big fan.

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.160
MOIRA WEIGEL: I love it, too.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.610
LOGAN URY: Wait, what part?

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.770
MOIRA WEIGEL: Shoulds,
how much I realized

00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:41.210
I thought in should statements.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.880
It's like, oh, I should.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.921
I talk about [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:42.921 --> 00:29:44.270
LOGAN URY: Oh, are you a Molly?

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:44.870
MOIRA WEIGEL: I guess so.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.050
LOGAN URY: Yeah?

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:45.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.680
MOIRA WEIGEL: I don't know if
I'd claim to be a fully Molly.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.179
I don't know if I
get to claim that.

00:29:49.179 --> 00:29:51.860
But I definitely-- and I open
the book talking about this--

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.040
but I realized that I thought so
much about what I should want,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.940
or what I should want to do,
or what I should be doing.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.150
Was I doing the right things?

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.316
And that it's really hard
to shake that and be like,

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:04.560
what kind of-- you can't
"should" about a want.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.840
What do you want?

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.520
But that we're very
socialized to think

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.190
about what's the good thing to
do or the right thing to do.

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.520
LOGAN URY: Right.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.561
I mean that feels like a
very familiar narrative.

00:30:12.561 --> 00:30:15.890
If I do these things, I
will be desirable versus

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.510
what do I desire?

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:20.090
And how oftentimes when I
de-brief with people after they

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.370
go on dates, they talk
all about whether or not

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:23.990
the person seemed
interested, but they

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:25.610
don't get to the
point where, did they

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.230
like that person or not.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:29.480
And I try to get
them to that point.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.730
But it's interesting that
our brains don't naturally

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.950
say, what do I want?

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:35.829
It's what should I want or
how can I get them to want me?

00:30:35.829 --> 00:30:36.620
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.330
LOGAN URY: So it's something
we're working through.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.371
MOIRA WEIGEL: Absolutely.

00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:40.400
LOGAN URY: Yeah.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.050
So we've talked a
lot about how dating

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:45.095
is this arena where people
play out these gender roles.

00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:47.540
And we have these
scripts we've inherited,

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.380
whether it's through books
or culture or movies.

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.920
If people in this room
or people watching online

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.590
want to flip those scripts, what
are some things that we can do?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.340
MOIRA WEIGEL: Wow.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.147
I really do think
a recurring theme

00:31:02.147 --> 00:31:03.980
that I came across in
the different areas is

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:09.020
that despite this tendency
of the self-help industry

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.510
to mystify men and women
to each other, actually

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:13.850
most humans want
more similar things.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.810
You know, most humans want some
combination of sex and intimacy

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.710
and respect and communication.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.600
And I think that one of
the most harmful scripts

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.750
is this idea that men and
women are essentially at odds

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.610
and that all gender
and sexual relations

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:33.350
are this sad compromise
of women, for whom sex

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.770
is like work, and for men, it's
like recreation or something.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.460
But that's a whole other topic.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.870
So I think that it's
really important

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.690
to get out of that script.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:47.420
And I think, yeah,
I don't know, I

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.835
think there's so much
gamification there.

00:31:50.835 --> 00:31:52.710
This idea that it's a
game where you master--

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.168
I mean, "The Rules"
and "The Game,"

00:31:54.168 --> 00:31:58.560
these are the two most
successful dating franchises

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.060
of the past decade or so.

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.570
But I think that trying
to get beyond these games

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.690
and this idea that partners
are mysterious to one another

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:12.080
and do this slightly more
challenging emotional work

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.270
of being in touch
with one's own desires

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.940
is the most fundamentally
important thing.

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.250
And scripts-- I mean,
in some of the research

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.104
that I cover on hookup
culture, it's so funny.

00:32:23.104 --> 00:32:24.770
You get these young
men again and again,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.830
saying, well, I imagine everyone
else is having so much sex.

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.500
And I feel sad, but I
shouldn't, because I'm a man.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.492
And this is what men
are supposed to want.

00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:34.700
And it's, like, first of
all, none of your classmates

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:36.590
are having as much
sex as you think

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:39.200
they are, or very few of them.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.170
And second of all, you
can't should about a want.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.820
You know, if you
feel sad about this,

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.528
and you feel you
shouldn't because you're

00:32:45.528 --> 00:32:48.380
supposed to be masculine
and it's not masculine,

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.510
that belief, again, about
this absolute gender

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.299
difference and different aims is
producing a lot of unhappiness.

00:32:53.299 --> 00:32:55.340
It's actually very
counterproductive for everyone

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.540
involved.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.790
LOGAN URY: Do you feel
optimistic about the generation

00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.900
younger than us?

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.280
MOIRA WEIGEL:
Yeah, I think I do.

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:01.939
I think I do.

00:33:01.939 --> 00:33:03.230
I think the kids are all right.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:06.020
I think that we
always have to think

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.100
about class difference
and geographic differences

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:10.190
and it's very hard
to generalize.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.810
But I think the
generation below us

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.690
has better gender and
sexual politics than I

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:16.010
did at their age, anyway.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.310
I think that there's a way in
which the internet is creating

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.820
new kinds of discourse
and awareness.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:26.180
I think that there is,
despite the depressing state

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.330
of affairs, this apocalyptic,
smoky state of affairs

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.520
in America, generally,
there's a lot

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.565
to feel hopeful about
with young people.

00:33:33.565 --> 00:33:35.690
LOGAN URY: Well, since you
are on a college campus,

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.510
and in fact, the college campus
that you and I attended--

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:39.510
MOIRA WEIGEL: It's true.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:42.470
LOGAN URY: --I would be curious
to see whether women who are

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.090
undergrads right
now, whether they've

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.110
been affected by sort of what
you called the Beyonce 2013

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.210
feminism.

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:52.010
So basically,
either on one hand,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.930
they are more feminist than we
were when we were in college,

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.600
or it's just an age
thing and maybe they

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.160
will reach that
point of identifying

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.032
as a feminist later.

00:33:59.032 --> 00:33:59.990
MOIRA WEIGEL: I think--

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.280
I suspect some
people in this room

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.321
might be younger than I
am, so we could ask them.

00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:06.410
But I think that feminism
is trendier than it

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.489
was when we were in college,
that this idea, I can't think

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:12.780
if I have any hard
numbers to prove this,

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.159
but when I think of when I
encounter young women now

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.790
who are in college
or around that age,

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.090
they think it's cool
to be a feminist.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.810
And that's a thing
they identify as.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:26.449
I think that Beyonce and Hillary
and Sheryl and all these women

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.690
helped produce that moment,
which I think is basically--

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.300
Chimamanda Nazi Adichie--
that we should all

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.060
be feminists moment that that
really resonated, which I think

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.920
is basically a great thing.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.814
I think that there
are limitations to--

00:34:40.814 --> 00:34:42.980
I don't know, sort of the
transformation of feminism

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.540
into a lifestyle
brand, or that it's

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.920
this thing that you can just
make a choice individually

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.030
to be this way and
that that will fix all

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.312
the problems that women face.

00:34:51.312 --> 00:34:53.020
I think that there
are limitations to it.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.739
But basically, the kids
are more politically aware,

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:59.840
more politically engaged, maybe,
than we were at their age,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.090
certainly around these
questions of gender.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:02.480
LOGAN URY: That's great.

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.104
Yeah, I do find that
really comforting.

00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:07.010
And this idea that there
is more gender fluidity

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.110
and flipping the
scripts and that people

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.810
at least, whether or not
feminism is being commodified

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.750
in some ways, it's at least
giving people the space

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.030
to say like, hey, maybe we
shouldn't wear really short

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.490
skirts so we can get
into that final club

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.739
and see if we're on the list.

00:35:20.739 --> 00:35:21.530
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.416
I think that that
does feel, again,

00:35:23.416 --> 00:35:25.040
there's a lot more
work to do, but that

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.066
feels like a basic improvement.

00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:29.720
I think it wasn't even a
conversation my friends

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.420
and I were having when
we were undergrads,

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.570
at least not with
the same explicitness

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.230
and emphaticness
that we see now.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.820
LOGAN URY: Or it was the
idea from from 9:00 to 5:00,

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.650
you were in class, and you were
killing it and answering all

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:43.890
the questions and doing well.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.310
But then, what happened at
night was a different part

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:47.210
of your personality.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.880
And my hope would be that
people are more unified

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.280
in being that strong
woman during the day

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.139
and in the evening.

00:35:53.139 --> 00:35:53.930
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.090
I think what's
perverse, again, we

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.160
were both undergrads at Harvard.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.576
And I imagine a
lot of people here

00:35:57.576 --> 00:36:01.070
are also a certain kind of type
that we saw a lot in college.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.100
I think what's hard is that we
were very conditioned to want

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.600
to succeed and get approval.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.720
And you get that for one set
of things, professionally

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.750
or academically, and you get it
for a different set of things,

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.110
socially and sexually.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.690
And so there's no
real contradiction

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.120
between being the
straight A student who

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.370
wears a teeny, tiny skirt and
stands outside the finals club

00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:20.870
at night.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.480
They're both ways
of seeking approval

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.430
from institutions of authority.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.490
And the men own the real estate
for the finals clubs, too.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:32.450
I mean, there's this deeply
gendered system of social power

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:34.504
that we were really
responding to.

00:36:34.504 --> 00:36:35.670
It wasn't just in our heads.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.150
So it's this weird way that
it's like you're overachieving

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.880
by being what someone else
wants, whether it's on your CV

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.852
and about a boss or a teacher,
or about looking cute at night.

00:36:44.852 --> 00:36:47.060
And I think that it takes
a lot of personal strength,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.910
and also political solidarity
in these more collective forms

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:52.080
of thinking, to change that.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.330
And I do think it's happening.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.230
LOGAN URY: I love
that perspective.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.940
Yeah, I think it's hard
for an 18-year-old,

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.981
or certainly would have
been hard for me, to say,

00:36:57.981 --> 00:37:00.300
oh, success during the day
is doing well in my classes

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.629
and success at night is
standing up to the patriarchy.

00:37:02.629 --> 00:37:03.420
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah?

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.790
Well, hopefully, we
can make standing up

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.927
to the patriarchy cool.

00:37:05.927 --> 00:37:07.010
I think it's already cool.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.300
LOGAN URY: On its way, yeah.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.327
So I do want to leave time for
questions from the audience.

00:37:11.327 --> 00:37:13.910
Before we get to that, I'm going
to ask you one more question.

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.160
So this is something
I ask all my guests

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.350
who join me for these
talks at Google.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:22.040
There is the Google.com home
page that has the Google logo.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.480
And then underneath
it sometimes,

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.440
there's this line of text.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.700
So if you could write the
line of text for one day

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.710
and millions of
people would see it

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.020
as they do their
billions of searches,

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.420
what would you put
on that line of text?

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.330
And since this is a modern
romance talk, maybe what would

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.347
that line be to help people with
their dating and relationships?

00:37:41.347 --> 00:37:42.430
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, my gosh.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:43.380
LOGAN URY: Yeah, no
pressure, though.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.520
MOIRA WEIGEL: No pressure.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.710
I think, because I
usually think of Google

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.960
with those wonderful drawings.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.640
LOGAN URY: Oh, yeah,
we do have drawings.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.420
MOIRA WEIGEL: --when I look.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.753
I'm a terrible drawer, actually.

00:37:51.753 --> 00:37:54.380
LOGAN URY: You could commission
a Google Doodle for something

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:55.280
that's on your mind.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.750
MOIRA WEIGEL: No, I've
been thinking a lot--

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.614
and again, I feel like
we've just scratched

00:37:58.614 --> 00:37:59.780
the surface of this history.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.020
But I've been thinking a lot
about the leftist and feminist

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:07.062
slogan, "None of us are free
until all of us are free."

00:38:07.062 --> 00:38:09.020
And that might seem like
a stretch from dating.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.040
But I think that there's
a way in which we

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.827
can have fun at romance,
and we're not always

00:38:15.827 --> 00:38:17.660
supposed to be thinking
about the structural

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.410
and the political.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:19.975
But men and women,
and again, we've

00:38:19.975 --> 00:38:21.350
hardly talked
about queer dating,

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.970
which is the funnest part of
dating history, by the way.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.137
But I think that we can't--

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:28.220
it's all very well to say
that we're more flexible

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.678
and that we're more permissive
about romantic relationships

00:38:30.678 --> 00:38:32.500
and family structures
and all these things.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.940
But men and women
can't really meet

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.970
as full romantic
equals until we address

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:41.339
these kinds of underlying
social and structural problems.

00:38:41.339 --> 00:38:42.880
So again, there's
sort of these two--

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.129
there's always this double
vision between the personal

00:38:45.129 --> 00:38:46.130
and the social.

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.354
But I think that the
idea that none of us

00:38:48.354 --> 00:38:50.270
are sexy until all of
us are sexy, "none of us

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.740
are free until all
of us are free"

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.750
is a sentiment I've been
thinking about a lot.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.049
So that's my grand
claim to stake

00:38:56.049 --> 00:38:57.590
on the bottom of
the Google homepage.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:58.010
LOGAN URY: I love that.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.570
Well, maybe somebody
out here today

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.932
can actually get that on there.

00:39:00.932 --> 00:39:01.890
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, yeah.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:02.150
LOGAN URY: OK.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:04.441
So now we'll open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:39:04.441 --> 00:39:06.417
And Scott has a handheld mic.

00:39:06.417 --> 00:39:08.750
AUDIENCE: I'm really interested
to hear your perspective

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.650
on race within dating,
race or ethnicity.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.570
I recently heard
a podcast on NPR

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:17.900
about dating apps and how
it's completely skewed when

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.430
it comes to race.

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:22.640
And throughout history or just
what your perspective on it

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.099
is now in current times.

00:39:24.099 --> 00:39:24.890
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:28.100
I mean, this is a great
question, and a huge question.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.020
I think that there
is all this data.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.353
And one thing that's interesting
about the proliferation

00:39:32.353 --> 00:39:34.850
of these apps is it
does give us much more

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.030
measurable information
about people's preferences

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.940
and behaviors.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.200
There's certainly a lot of
disappointing information

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.690
that's come out of
OkCupid and other apps

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.740
in terms of how forms of social
prejudice that we see elsewhere

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.967
in society play out in dating.

00:39:51.967 --> 00:39:53.300
There are so many things to say.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.700
I mean, historically, one
thing that's really interesting

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.040
is that dating as
a practice really

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.150
emerges out of the working
class in the early 20th century.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:04.850
And so you have these
really vibrant dating

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.250
and nightlife cultures in
the Harlem Renaissance,

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.920
for instance.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.499
Or you have a really vibrant
queer dating culture.

00:40:11.499 --> 00:40:12.790
We didn't even talk about this.

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.164
This is one of my
favorite facts,

00:40:14.164 --> 00:40:17.242
how TGI Friday's, which
was the first singles' bar,

00:40:17.242 --> 00:40:18.950
was invented because
the entrepreneur who

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:21.590
started it was, like, we need
a gay bar for straight people.

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.286
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.660
MOIRA WEIGEL:
Anyways, often what

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.460
I call the dating avant garde--

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.710
LOGAN URY: More than
just potato skins.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.380
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah, but just
like Grindr and Tinder--

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:28.588
I mean, it's, like, exactly--

00:40:28.588 --> 00:40:30.950
TGI Friday's was a sexy
singles bar in the 1960s.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.120
It's all in here.

00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:34.760
But anyway, I
think that we often

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.580
see these experimental
spaces where

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.560
there are kinds of
interracial dating

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.280
or there are opportunities to
express other kinds of desire

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.450
and affiliation that open
up and then pretty quickly

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.750
are captured and
commodified and made, mostly

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.530
for straight, white people.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:54.767
And it's always this
horizon of possibility.

00:40:54.767 --> 00:40:56.350
Because one of the
things about dating

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.420
that's different from
organized courtship is

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.860
there are possibilities.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:02.470
I mean, desire's a very
hard thing to pin down.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:03.650
It moves in lots of ways.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.440
And so you do get
these sort of spaces

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.650
where there are other
kinds of relationships.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:11.590
And then, it gets
whitewashed and locked down.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.330
So that's one historical
observation, I think.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.350
So if we can keep
talking about it later,

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.380
there's so many possible things.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.472
AUDIENCE: My mom likes to say,
don't "should" on yourself.

00:41:25.472 --> 00:41:26.930
MOIRA WEIGEL: I
wish she could have

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:28.430
told 16-year-old Moira that.

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.090
AUDIENCE: Don't
"should" on yourself.

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:36.370
But I maybe have a Google
Design question for you.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:41.440
If you could wave a magic wand
and take away a social norm

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.380
within dating that you feel
like is detrimental to the way

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:49.411
that society designs dating,
what would you change?

00:41:49.411 --> 00:41:51.160
What would you change
about-- because it's

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.790
almost like, as individuals,
we're functioning

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:56.170
in this bigger picture.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:57.740
So so much of it,
you can't control.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.460
But if you could control
something, what would

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:00.960
you change?

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.543
MOIRA WEIGEL: This is going to
sound really, really grandiose.

00:42:03.543 --> 00:42:06.220
But I do think that so much of
dating in America and so many

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.730
of our practices are
still organized by this--

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.430
not just assumption or false
belief, but real belief--

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:14.590
that because we have--

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.707
again, the purpose of
dating is not always

00:42:16.707 --> 00:42:18.040
getting married and reproducing.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.740
But it is the dominant system
that our culture has for that.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.360
And because our
culture still treats

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.735
childhood and
social reproduction

00:42:26.735 --> 00:42:29.560
in these highly privatized way
that's not supported socially

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.260
very much at all, it
actually is a reality

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.230
that for a woman who
hopes to do those things,

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:37.180
there are real incentives
to be married here

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.710
that shapes sexual
behavior in a way

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:41.110
that you don't see in
Scandinavia in the same way,

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.030
for instance.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.680
So I'm like-- am I allowed
to say paid parental leave,

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.480
socialized medicine,
and child care-- like,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.720
I feel like those would be some
really good design changes that

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.306
I do think, actually,
really would reverberate--

00:42:52.306 --> 00:42:54.430
LOGAN URY: Why stop there--
universal basic income?

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.260
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh, yeah,
that's a complicated one.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.384
I have to think about that.

00:42:57.384 --> 00:43:00.550
But yeah, I think that--
wage inequality, for sure.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:02.980
It's a funny thing that I
get into, the first part

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.040
of the book, but how much early
dating was often just a way

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.919
for women to get men
to buy them dinner,

00:43:07.919 --> 00:43:09.960
because they didn't make
enough money in the city

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.052
to afford dinner.

00:43:11.052 --> 00:43:12.760
And I think that there
are all these ways

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.490
that wage inequality and other
kinds of social inequality

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:18.670
do continue to shape
the dating unconscious.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:21.530
And those inequalities are
still real, as we know.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:25.160
But yeah, I'd settle for
socialized medicine, child care

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.306
and paid family leave.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:32.650
AUDIENCE: So I've always
heard or subscribed

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:36.550
to this pervasive belief
that women are designed

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:40.540
to want to build a
nest and foster a home

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.060
and sort of settle down
and men are designed

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.980
to spread their seed as
far as they possibly can

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.550
and in as many different
directions as they can.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:51.130
I'm curious what your research
has uncovered around that

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.320
from a biological
perspective, and if that

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.010
is just more of a social
norm that we've adapted to,

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:00.400
or if there is something
inherent about human beings

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.200
that makes that sort of true.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.460
MOIRA WEIGEL: Well, one thing
that's really interesting--

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.080
I do tend to think
that it's like--

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:06.790
I joke about this,
but I think it's real.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.860
Because if there's
any widely held belief

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:12.130
about gender and sexuality,
usually the opposite thing

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:13.460
is actually true.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:14.794
So there are these new studies--

00:44:14.794 --> 00:44:16.501
there are studies that
ask men and women,

00:44:16.501 --> 00:44:18.060
would you like
random, anonymous sex?

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:19.476
Sorry, I'll get
to the question, I

00:44:19.476 --> 00:44:21.730
promise-- but random,
anonymous sex, like, right now.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:23.496
And you know, the
initial findings are,

00:44:23.496 --> 00:44:25.870
like, oh, men would love some
random, anonymous sex right

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:26.080
now.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.280
And women are not so sure.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.696
But then if you
control, and it's,

00:44:28.696 --> 00:44:32.920
like, he won't murder you, you
might get to orgasm, that then,

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.859
suddenly, women are much
more interested in casual sex

00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:36.400
than men are.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.790
And it's similar with numbers of
children that people want, too.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:41.290
There's recent work,
there's a woman

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.540
named Marina Adshade, who's
an economist at University

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.161
of British Columbia,
who's published and would

00:44:46.161 --> 00:44:48.160
know the exact numbers
on this if she were here.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.304
But men, historically,
I think there's

00:44:50.304 --> 00:44:52.720
this assumption that women
care more about having children

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.740
or want children more,
or that motherhood is

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.990
more defining than fatherhood.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.140
But indeed, when you control
for, or when you tell men,

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.140
oh, you might have to do
some of the work that's

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.800
related to child raising, that
actually men want children more

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.420
and want a greater number
of children than women do.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:12.670
So I feel like there are
all these beliefs that

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.980
start to shift under
scrutiny, and often

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.670
the opposite of what the
general assumption is is true.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.500
In terms of settling
down, I mean,

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.990
I do think there is a
certain biological reality

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:26.200
that female investment in
pregnancy and parenting

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.520
is greater.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.830
A woman has to make a
greater investment of time

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:32.950
and physical effort to become
a parent than a male does,

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:36.850
and there surely is something
biological about that.

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.790
At the same time, so much of
this is socially conditioned.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:41.380
And I think we've
seen, in societies

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.330
that had more robust forms
of communalized child care,

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.830
or where it wasn't just going
to be a private responsibility

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.500
to take care of your
kids in your home,

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:51.610
that you see very
different outcomes in terms

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.370
of how much women feel their
whole life needs to be oriented

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:55.730
around planning for that.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:58.120
And I think part of that
is a reaction to the fact

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.980
that, in our country,
in this time,

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.780
there's very few other options
for getting that work at home

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.824
done.

00:46:04.824 --> 00:46:06.740
This is a much longer,
different conversation.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.323
But I've just come
back from this trip

00:46:08.323 --> 00:46:10.620
to China, to this matriarchal
society where children

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.370
are raised communally
and have no fathers,

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.430
and it's very different.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.460
I mean, there really
are other ways to live.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.270
But I don't know.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.103
I'd imagine there's
some biological element,

00:46:18.103 --> 00:46:20.290
but it's also quite
socially constructed

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:25.299
and also variable if you control
for the equivalent of will I

00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:26.840
have an orgasm and
will he not murder

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.830
me, these kinds of variables.

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.250
AUDIENCE: As dating has evolved
to dating in the public sphere,

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.000
as it is today, as opposed
to calling in the parlor,

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.120
and where, maybe,
these experiences

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.600
were more chaperoned, or there
was more commentary invited

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.120
from your priest or your
rabbi or your parents, how

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.410
that conversation has evolved in
ways that it's maybe improved.

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:55.580
Like Logan, you
were saying you try

00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.220
to encourage your friends
who are dating to say, yeah,

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.520
but what did you
think of this person?

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.700
If there are ways that we can,
as the armchair therapists

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.940
for our friends who are
dating, be more constructive

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:09.520
and be more helpful
in navigating

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.620
the dialogue that is
associated with dating,

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.550
and maybe the de-brief.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:17.180
MOIRA WEIGEL: Hmm, it's
a really good question.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.200
I think that-- this will
be a strange thing to say--

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.700
I think another
thing that's come up

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.991
a lot back when I was on book
tour doing a lot of radio

00:47:23.991 --> 00:47:27.130
interviews is that people
feel this pressure to always

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:27.760
be dating.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.680
In the same way that
our cell phones mean

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.330
that we feel like we
should always be working

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.340
and our boss can email us
in the middle of the night,

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.340
people feel like they
should always be on Tinder

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.960
or should always be on OkCupid.

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.230
Again, these shoulds, but should
be working at it all the time.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:43.390
And I feel as if this--

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:45.430
I would very often, when
doing events back when

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:47.440
I was on book tour,
get a question

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.762
where someone would
say, basically,

00:47:49.762 --> 00:47:51.220
I don't feel like
dating right now.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.150
Is that OK?

00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.350
That's what the question
would boil down to.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:57.130
And I feel like I also
so often just want

00:47:57.130 --> 00:48:00.190
to tell friends
that it's like we've

00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:02.752
conflated romantic success
and professional success

00:48:02.752 --> 00:48:03.460
in a lot of ways.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:06.340
People often speak
about feeling like they

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.340
need to hit certain
milestones romantically,

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.090
as well as professionally
by certain ages.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:12.490
And I think that to
the extent that it's

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:15.640
you also don't have to.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.942
And a lot of--

00:48:16.942 --> 00:48:19.400
LOGAN URY: Well, it also goes
back to the biological clock.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.775
MOIRA WEIGEL:
Yeah, like you were

00:48:20.775 --> 00:48:23.401
talking about earlier, this
idea that women, straight women,

00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:25.900
in particular, feel all this
pressure to plan their life out

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:27.460
at every stage.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.120
I think that so often people
seem to just want permission

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.871
to desire otherwise or to
not be dating or working

00:48:33.871 --> 00:48:34.870
at it at a certain time.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:36.550
And I also found--

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.550
I think that can be a
useful kind of advice.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.147
And maybe it sounds
very kumbaya-y.

00:48:41.147 --> 00:48:42.730
But I think that
women, in particular,

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.497
are encouraged to be so hard on
themselves and so self-critical

00:48:45.497 --> 00:48:47.080
and to feel so anxious
in a way that's

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.040
actually very counterproductive
to establishing intimacy.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.740
But I feel like sometimes I
just want to tell friends,

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:55.810
you don't have to.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:58.120
If what you're hearing
from yourself that you

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.700
want is that you don't want
to be doing this right now,

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.790
that is also OK,
however addictive

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:05.860
it might be to
swipe all the time.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.260
LOGAN URY: What's the
term, ananormativity?

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.718
MOIRA WEIGEL: Oh,
amatonormativity.

00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:11.530
LOGAN URY:
Amatonormativity, yeah.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:14.530
So our friend, Mandy,
is very into this idea

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:18.370
that we're kind of raised to
think that the goal in life

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.130
is to find one partner and
everything is leading up

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.570
to this moment of romance.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:25.430
And actually, perhaps lots
of people are happy single,

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:27.680
and that's not necessarily
the goal in everything.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.600
So what does it mean for society
to take a step back and say,

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.090
perhaps it's OK
for a woman to be

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.660
seeking something other
than ultimate coupledom

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:37.327
and partnership?

00:49:37.327 --> 00:49:38.118
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah.

00:49:38.118 --> 00:49:40.060
And I think that,
again, it's a hard thing

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.010
to see in our own
individual lives.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.980
But the purpose of marriage
and the purpose of courtship

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.810
has changed greatly over time.

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.150
You know, when you think to
an agrarian, pre-industrial

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.220
society, you have
arranged marriage

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:54.670
because extended families
are the unit of production,

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.130
and you need to be married
to the dude from next door

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.150
so that his brothers and your
brothers can work the farm.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.810
It's like, what
marriage becomes when

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.811
it becomes about love,
basically around the time

00:50:03.811 --> 00:50:06.185
of the Industrial Revolution,
is something very different

00:50:06.185 --> 00:50:06.850
than that.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.190
And maybe we're entering
another new phase,

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.870
that the purpose of
these relationships

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.480
and their functional role
in our lives do change.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:17.620
We're all going to live to be
so much older than people did,

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:23.320
I mean, hopefully, than they
did in the early 19th century.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.442
We have very different
working circumstances.

00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:26.650
We have very different lives.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:32.180
And so this idea that a certain
kind of straight, usually

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.300
white, monogamous
romantic love is

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:38.500
this one measure of societal
success is really outdated.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.420
I think there are
many ways to live.

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:42.240
So yeah.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.540
LOGAN URY: Absolutely.

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.980
Any other questions?

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.730
AUDIENCE: You alluded
to this a few times,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:51.560
the differences between
queer dating historically

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.270
and straight dating.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.460
And can you elaborate
more on that?

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.030
Just some of the history
and the differences.

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.444
I'm really curious.

00:51:00.444 --> 00:51:01.610
MOIRA WEIGEL: Yeah, totally.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.540
I think that it's funny.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.623
It was a thing I struggled
with writing this book.

00:51:04.623 --> 00:51:06.920
Because this is a
book about dating

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:08.520
as a cultural institution.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.960
And for most of the century
or so that people have dated,

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.750
queer dating has not
been legible as dating

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.122
to most of society.

00:51:16.122 --> 00:51:18.080
At the same time, and
perhaps not incidentally,

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.170
it's also been like the funnest
and most experimental and best,

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.260
and best place, freed of
these terrible, gendered norms

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.550
that we see across
so much other dating.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.660
So I think that in my book
there are two chapters that deal

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.420
primarily with LGBTQ dating.

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.910
And I think that it often--

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.440
the first one deals a
lot with the roaring '20s

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.340
and the '30s and
speakeasy scenes

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.130
and these spaces that
are at once theoretically

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.920
out of the public eye,
but then also become

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.300
an avant garde or lead what's
fashionable for dating.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.670
You see it again, as I was
suggesting, in the '60s,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:54.950
with this hilarious
guy Alan Stillman, who

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.470
starts TGI Friday's and is,
like, if we could scale this

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.310
for straight people, we'd
make a bazillion dollars,

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.460
as indeed, he did.

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.780
But I think that often you see
cultures of experimentation

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:10.130
not burdened by these norms
about what I keep joking about,

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:12.410
this idea that men and
women are inevitably at odds

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:16.040
and that sex is this depressing
compromise, that allow

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:17.307
for a lot more possibility.

00:52:17.307 --> 00:52:19.640
I think because there aren't,
or for most of the history

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.730
of dating, haven't been such
overbearing social scripts

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.010
about how men are and
how women are-- you know,

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:27.590
LGBTQ folks don't have to deal
with those in the same way--

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.730
that often you see much
more self-awareness

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:34.947
or thoughtfulness about defining
desires and expectations,

00:52:34.947 --> 00:52:36.530
because there aren't
these assumptions

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.140
about what they should be.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.870
I think one part of the book
deals a lot with the AIDS

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.360
crisis and the safe sex
movement, too, and the ways

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.160
in which really heroic
activists around HIV and AIDS

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.980
started building materials
to help couples talk

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.991
about sexual practices more
specifically and more openly,

00:52:56.991 --> 00:52:58.490
and how that became
really important

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.840
for people of all
genders and orientations.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:08.580
So I think that queer dating
in my book and in history

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.590
is often a space of
greater experimentation

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:13.760
and self-awareness and
then often sets the trends.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:17.030
In the same way you get TGI
Friday's imitating gay bars,

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:19.640
you get Tender imitating Grindr.

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.516
So it gets sort of
co-opted and made less fun

00:53:23.516 --> 00:53:24.640
for straight people, maybe.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.050
But those are a couple of
themes that come to mind.

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.300
LOGAN URY: And I also post
a lot of things on Facebook

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:30.591
about dating and relationships.

00:53:30.591 --> 00:53:34.240
So you can find me at
Facebook.com/LoganUry.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.240
Just wanted to say thank
you so much for coming.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.196
It was so fun.

00:53:37.196 --> 00:53:37.600
MOIRA WEIGEL: It was fun.

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.390
Thank you all.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.440
