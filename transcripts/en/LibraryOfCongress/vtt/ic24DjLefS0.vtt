&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.750
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Hello, everybody.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.050
Good afternoon.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.410
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank you
for joining today's lecture,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.990
titled "Washington, DC Witness
Tree" by Doctor Paul Dolinsky.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.940
My name is Mari Nakahara,
the curator of architecture,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.010
design and engineering
at the Library's Prints

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.300
and Photographs Division.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.130
I also serve as a coordinator
for today's program.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.490
The lecture is one of the 2016
National Cherry Blossom Festival

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.070
official events, co-hosted
by the Library's Prints

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.320
and Photographs Division,
Asian Division,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.320
and the Asian Division
Friends Society.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.360 position:56%
I actually used to work at the Asian
Division as a reference librarian,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.980
and I was asked by my former
supervisor to circulate this.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.700
If you wish to become a member
of the Asian Friends Society,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.510
please sign on and I
will just put it --

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.070
[ Background Sounds ]

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.480
Pursuing one of the Library's goals
of providing general understanding

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.670 position:56%
of American culture, individual and
the social life and of other peoples

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.720
in the nation's, we
have been hosting events

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.910
and the programs related to
cherry blossoms since 2012,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.560
when we celebrated the
hundredth anniversary

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.870 position:56%
of cherry blossom tree gift from
the city of Tokyo to Washington, DC.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.510
The library holds over
160 million items,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.810
covering an almost universal range
of subjects in diverse formats,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.580
including resources related to
cherry blossoms and their history.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.890
The Library hosted Sakura:
Cherry Blossom as Living Symbols

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.360
of Friendship exhibition in 2012.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.730
The exhibition and its gallery talk

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.210
and then also many educational
materials are still available via

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.710
the Library's website.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.490
Although the scale is much smaller,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.880
the Library again provides an
opportunity for the general public

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.730
to view the Library's historical
and contemporary images related

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.810
to cherry trees as a
[inaudible] case display.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.690 position:56%
In celebration of the National Park
Services' hundredth anniversary this

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.240
year, the display also includes
items related to national parks

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.210 position:56%
and it introduces documents from the
Historic American Building Survey,

Historic American Engineering Record

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.800
and the Historic American
Landscape Survey,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.730
which we call HABS, HEAR and HALS.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.560
HABS, HEAR and HALS survive

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.230
through corporate agreements
amongst the National Park Service,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.940
the Library of Congress and
professional organizations.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.460
The Park Service creates
new documentation every year

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.750
which the Library preserves and
adds to the online collection.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.350
The 2016 National Cherry Blossom
Festival is calling attention

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.960
to the benefits of parks and then
connecting more people with them.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.670
The display was supposed
to be ready by today.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.790
However, a little incident has
caused a delay in installation.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.640
Once it's installed, I am hoping
within a week, it will be on view

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.020
until the end of June, so please
come back and take a look.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.500
It's going to be on the
first floor of this building.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.560
Please also note that
the Library has two

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.320
of a hundred remaining original
cherry blossom trees onsite,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.370
which the Library's Public
Affairs Office confirmed

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.670
with the National Park
Service in 2012.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.740
One of them is located right behind
of this building, near the corner

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.100
of the second street
and Independence Avenue.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.140
Unfortunately the blossoms
are gone, but you may want

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.960
to stop by to look at it.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.000
It is leaning on a
crutch, like this,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.690
and it has a plaque,
so you won't miss it.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.920
Before I introducing
today's speaker,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.730
please note that this event is
being videotaped for broadcast

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.270
on the Library's website
and other media.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.510
We encourage you in the
audience to ask questions

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.090
and offer comments during the
question and answer period,

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.850 position:56%
but please realize that in
participating in the Q and A period,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.830
you will be consenting to the
Library's possible reproducing

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.090
and transmitting your remarks.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.670
Now I would like to introduce
today's speaker, Dr. Paul Dolinsky.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.900
Dr. Paul Dolinsky has
long been associated

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.460
with historic preservation
in general and architecture

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.950
and in landscape architecture
documentation in particular.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.310 position:56%
Professionally trained in
architecture, landscape architecture

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.650
and architectural history, he
was uniquely qualified to work

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.190
with the Historic American
Building Survey, HABS,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.630
of the National Park Service.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.170
Dr. Dolinsky began to
work with HABS in 1979

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.360
as an architectural
technician working

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.570
with teams measuring
historic structures

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.100 position:56%
and producing ink on miter drawings.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.270
He eventually became
a project supervisor

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.000
and a national chief
of program in 1993.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.330
During tenure as chief,
he instituted many changes

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.810
to the program, such as
computer-aided drafting,

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.780
[inaudible] distance-measuring
devices, photogrammetry

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.680
and additional laser
measuring as well

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.310
as significantly expanding the
historic research components.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.480 position:56%
During the 1980s, there was a
strong interest in the unique nature

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.120
of historic landscape architecture

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.270
with the cultural landscape
movement.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.650
Dr. Dolinsky was instrumental in
developing a series of projects

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.610
that ultimately resulted
in the creation

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.840
of the Historic American
Landscape Survey, HALS, in 2000,

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.870
with the American Society
of Landscape Architects,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.030
National Park Service and
the Library of Congress.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.860
This rapidly-expanding program
has been extremely effective

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:58.490
in the last 16 years, now
having representation in 49

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.040
of the 50 states as well

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.950
as significant landscape
documentation American soil abroad.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:11.520
Dr. Paul Dolinsky has been serving
and contributing as chief of HALS

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.920
since it was established.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Paul Dolinsky.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.080
[ Applause ]

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.380
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Those
are hard boots to fill.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.680
My goodness.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.000
I'm not sure if I know that
person, but anyway, Mari,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.740
thank you very much for
that incredibly generous

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.360
and eloquent introduction.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.970
It is quite a privilege to be here
today and I'm equally delighted

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.870
to see so many new faces but so
many familiar faces from my friends

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.920
in the Prints and Photographs
Division.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.920
I certainly hope I can meet your
expectations and provide you

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.520
with some good information to
think about after you leave.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.490
After Mari asked me to
speak, I considered many,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.840
many different topics that I
thought might be interesting

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.080
for a more general audience,
and I quickly realized

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.890
that I'd possibly be
seeing a lot of yawns

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.640
in the room should I
proceed down that avenue.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:11.160 position:56%
So I finally settled on speaking
about something we all see every day

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.830
and how we might look at it through
a slightly different set of lenses

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.610
after you leave this room,
and more importantly,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.690
have some fun during the process.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.900
So, big surprise, I'm going to
talk about trees, but with a lens

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.510
of archival documentation in mind,
documentation to the standards

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.450
of the Historic American
Landscapes Survey,

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.350
or as it is more affectionately
known, HALS.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.420 position:56%
But before we can do that, I need to
briefly discuss its parent program,

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.000
the Historic American
Building Survey,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.400
HABS, for some of the context.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.620
By the way, in case you're
wondering, the photograph

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.580
on the front, the first slide there
is the view from the front porch

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.470
of Laurence Rockefeller's home

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.530
at the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller
National Historic Site.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.690
I think who would not love to be
sitting there during the summer,

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.400
but actually, like I said, we
will look a little bit at HABS

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.650
for some context and how HALS
was a logical progression,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.780
if you will, of the HABS mission.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:16.150
Not a very quick or easy task, but
bear with me through some leaps

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:19.150
of faith, because we only
have about a half-hour.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.360
You can easily dig
deeper into either

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.810
and any of the three programs.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.830 position:56%
There is a tremendous amount of
published information about each one

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:34.240
of the them and how HALS was a
natural outgrowth, pun intended.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.510
Sorry. And then we'll finally
focus on the HALS witness trees

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:43.020 position:56%
of Washington, DC pilot project all
within the allotted half-hour or so.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.370
As I said, to put HALS in
context, I really need to speak

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:50.050
about the Historic
American Building Survey.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:54.040
Very briefly, it is a Roosevelt
administration initiative

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.180
under the aegis of the WPA to
provide temporary employment

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.990
for architects and
draftsmen unemployed

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.290 position:56%
as a result of the Great Depression.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.630
Like I said, volumes have
been written about HABS,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.690
but for our purposes and
in the simplest terms,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.990
it is one of the anchors

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.800
of our federal government's
preservation programs.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.670
Hundreds of architects, draftsmen

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.910
and photographers were hired
temporarily for a four-month period

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.500
across the United States to produce
measured architectural drawings,

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.600
written history and large-format
photography of the complete resume

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.670
of the American builders' art,
and thanks to significant input

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.660
from the Library of Congress,
everything was completed

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.050
in standardized formats,
was to be durable,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.820
reproducible and verifiable.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.120
Why do this?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.710
Well, the obvious reason
is of course

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.410
to employ the struggling
architects of the period

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.250
or at least provide them
some temporary relief,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.770 position:56%
but more importantly, the collateral
benefits of these documents turned

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.930
out to be far more than
an academic record.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.540
In the burgeoning historic
preservation movement during the

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:03.120
1920s -- '26 is Colonial
Williamsburg, et cetera --

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.040
these drawings, history and
photographs proved to be invaluable

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.260
to provide existing condition
documentation as the basis

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:13.380
for restoration, insurance
needs for historic structures,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.650
interpretative needs
and fundamentally

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.600
to maintain the resources
and the facility management.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.620
I'd love to show you a
couple early HABS examples.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.190
That one there, by
the way -- pardon me.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.200
On top is the General Cowles
House in Farmington, Connecticut,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.920
a wonderful neoclassical structure.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.350
On the right is the large format
photographic, on the left,

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.900
the measured drawing, and
beneath it is the plan

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.250
of the ruin San Juan
Capistrano in California.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.800
One of my very favorite
drawings in the collection,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.910
this is the Le Pretre Mansion,
drawn in 1934, in New Orleans

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.750
and that wonderful photograph
looking from the balcony,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.140
really illustrating the laciness
of that beautiful ironwork.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.480
The success of the four-month
temporary relief was obvious.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.790 position:56%
It needed to be done on a
long-term basis and it was validated

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.390
by a permanent plan for
approval and disposition

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.700
of all future graphic records of
historic American architecture.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.950
That is Gustav Rohrich standing in
front of his sod house in Nebraska.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.710
There are very few sod
houses, I think, if any left,

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.500
and on the left side is --

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.770
right, left, is the measured
drawing not only of the house

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.450
but of the way the sod is
actually packed together

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.630 position:56%
and how the house is actually built.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.660
As Mari said a little bit about,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.970
we exist through a
tri-partite agreement.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:40.040
The National Park Services,
where I am based,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.580
we administer and run the programs.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.310 position:56%
The American Institute of Architects
advises our professionalism

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.850
and makes recommendations for
documentation, and we're here

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.610
in the Library of Congress,
which preserves

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.490
and distributes our records.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.560
It was made permanent and validated
in 1935 by the Historic Sites Act

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.620
as a regular duty of
the federal government.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.360
The architects and landscape
architects employed during the

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.720
initial four months of the survey
recognized the significance

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.260
of historic landscapes through
a very small subset program

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.900
of the Historic American
Building Survey.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.480
It was called the Historic American
Landscapes and Garden Project.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:22.250 position:56%
Unfortunately, its sun set after the
initial four months, but the benefit

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.570
of some of their documentation
will be very evident

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.160
in some of the slides we see.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760
This is The Lindens in
its original setting

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.480
up in Danvers, Massachusetts.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.890
It now sits up in Kalorama.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.080
You may know it was moved
here in the late 30s,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.380
and it's currently for sale.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.470
I think it's 8.7 million right now,

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.310
so it's gone up in price
a little bit, I think,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.970
but this is a 1934 photograph

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:50.800
of this great 1754 Georgian
wooden New England mansion,

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.000
and here's the site
plan that was done

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.890
by the landscape architects
working for HALJP.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.420
You can see the house itself sort
of enunciated a little bit darker

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.090
on the one side of it,
but there's the lawn,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.720
the formal gardens behind
it and above, of course,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.590
the vegetable gardens,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.440
but the landscape architects dug
a little deeper and they produced,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.130
on top, you'll see an evolutionary
drawing showing the home

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.470
in the 18th century and sort
of has it evolved up to 1934

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.130
on the upper right, and
then below, there are many,

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.810
many drawings of detailed
garden plans,

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.040
of every single flower,
every single plant.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.170
They really dug in deep and did an
extraordinary job documenting this

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.030
house and garden.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.120
This is another one of my
very favorite early documents.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.310
This is the Captain Thomas
Bennett Sunken Garden.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.520
You can see that sort
of sunken knot garden.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.820
It's like a platter.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.620
You step down into it,
surrounded by a hedge.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.690
Very, very private, but the
elevations of the garden are tilted

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.180
up and to the left, and in the far
right, you see they even dug in

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.110
and drew the sundial in elevation
and plan and completely filled,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.200
on one sheet of paper,
a complete document

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.660 position:56%
of the Thomas Bennett Sunken Garden.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.780
Another one of my favorites,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.430
a magnificent 18th-century
Georgian gates and fence

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.580
at the Pierce Place in Salem, Mass.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.140 position:56%
This is about half a dozen drawings
of how these gates are put together,

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:18.060
with all the details, and then
of course the great photos.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:23.090 position:56%
Another very early landscape element
document, a folly, a garden house,

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.030 position:56%
a summer, this great sort of Chinese
Chippendale little summer house

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.330
and a garden.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:30.310
Beautiful photograph and
beautiful drawings, should you want

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.470 position:56%
to build one in your own background.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.910
I was always impressed by
this early set of drawings

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.070
of the Beau Caray in New Orleans.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.110
That is a comprehensive measure
drawing of one entire square block,

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.220
every detail there, and then
the elevations of the structures

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.870
that make up the block
from the outside.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.330
Cover a little bit
of geography here.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.200
They were in Acoma in New Mexico.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.990
Many, many drawings of
the great old pueblo.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.230
You'll see a great aerial
photograph of the pueblo,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.010
and there's just the first
drawing of the overall site plan.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:07.670
Basically landscape documentation
continued as part of HABS from 1934

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:12.930
up until the mid to late 70s, when
there started to be more interest

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.190
in the documentation of
historical landscape architecture.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.690
When I first joined the program --

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.060
I also have a degree in
landscape architecture --

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.100
I was asked to run a series of
pilot projects that would look

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.290 position:56%
at what is different about landscape
architecture than architecture,

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.190
what is so different when an
architect looks at something

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.070
versus a landscape architect,
so we were asked to do a number

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.170
of pilot projects in the 70s.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.960
The first major one was actually
more of an architectonic landscape,

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.190
but it's Meridian Hill
Park in Washington, DC,

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.370
that extraordinary
cascade of fountains

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.020
and the upper formal parterres.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.000
The measured drawings, you can
see it's located directly north

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.060 position:56%
of the White House, about 16th
Street, and there's a detail drawing

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.300
of it on one side followed by
about 28 sheets of other drawings,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.690
but the important message here
is these drawings, histories

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.850
and photographs that were
produced ultimately informed sort

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.300
of the burgeoning cultural
landscape movement.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.350
You needed this information,
you needed these types

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:14.060 position:56%
of measured drawings, the
supporting research and photographs,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.520
to inform the analysis and
treatment recommendations

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.090 position:56%
for the preservation of these sites.

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:23.640
And here you'll see the Meridian
Hill drawings, and that is a copy

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.610
of the cultural landscape report
which is currently being used

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.840
in the restoration of Meridian
Hill Park, so in essence,

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.670
we were building the case of
the establishment of HALS.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.270
All this ultimately informed
the establishment of HALS

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.970
and the landscape survey

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.250
because landscape architecture
is indeed unique.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.720
So that's a lot of background
covered very quickly,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:50.850
actually about 50 years of HABS and
another 25 years of HALS to get us

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.880
up to the present, and like I said,
we only have about a half-hour

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.850
or so here, so hopefully this
will intrigue you enough.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.030 position:56%
If you just search it on any engine,
trust me, you'll get a huge amount

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.600
of information, and I
encourage you just to go

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.470
to the Library's collection,
our collection at the Library.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:06.770
It is staggering.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.940 position:56%
I think it's currently just shy of
45,000 sites or something like that.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.190
It's been functioning
now 80-plus years.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:16.820
So now, let's have a little fun.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:22.680 position:56%
I was musing over some examples that
might have influenced my thinking

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:27.350
in a less serious way, maybe
more of a popular culture way,

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:30.470
to explore HALS's documentation
of historically

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:35.210
and botanically significant trees,
linking together the historic

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.310
and cultural side of the National
Park Service with the scientific

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.540
and natural side of the
National Park Service.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.490
We tend not to play in the same
sandbox, and they have a lot more

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.970
on the natural side, so we're
always struggling on this side.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:50.660
So I'm always trying to find
money, to raise money for projects,

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:52.050
so this idea sort of coalesced.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.460
Maybe we can figure
some way to use trees

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.930
to knit the two together a
little bit and have some fun

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.410
and do some serious documentation,

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:03.750
so I hope you'll recognize
this image.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:08.150
It is the famous talking apple tree

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:13.110
in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1939
fantasy adventure The Wizard of Oz,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.240
the tree encountered by Dorothy,
Toto, the Tin Man, the Lion

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.900
and the Scarecrow on their way

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.840
down the Yellow Brick
Road to Emerald City.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.430 position:56%
The Library of Congress has declared
this book America's greatest

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.210 position:56%
and best-loved homegrown fairy tale.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.040
I like to refer to this
particular scene as the vegan slap,

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.740
where the tree, in a very angry,
stentor voice says, "How would you

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.370
like to have someone come along
and pick something off of you?"

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.020
This particular apple tree
is not just a living thing,

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.250
but it could actually breathe
and speak, it actually argues,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.770
and of course throws apples.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:50.650
Or how about the remarkable
Swiss Family Robinson treehouse?

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.440
Every child's dream.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.180
The romance of a treehouse, in
this case a treehouse on steroids

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.090
from the 1960 movie
of the same name.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.040
Would I have loved to
have had that treehouse.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.740 position:56%
But indeed, my fantasy was realized.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.880
A hundred and fifty-ton concrete

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.700
and reinforced steel Swiss
Family treehouse opened in 1962

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:15.060
in Adventureland at Disneyland,
and it only required a sea ticket.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.990
The whole thing, though, was
recreated in 1971 at Disney World,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:25.660 position:56%
recreated in 1992 at Euro Disneyland
and finally again in Tokyo Disney

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:31.390
in 1993, a truly sort of
pan-cultural tree experience.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.690
Or how about this one?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.370
I don't know if you recognize
this one, the Whomping Willow.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.010
It debuted in Harry Potter
and the Goblet of Fire.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.150
It is a very violent
species of magical plant,

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.020
sort of a tree with
a mean personality.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.280
Whomping Willows -- are there
any botanists in the audience?

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.580
I don't know.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.880
I can't resist this.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.420
It's a Salix whompus.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.720
I couldn't resist.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.870
It will attack anything
and anyone that comes

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.020
within range of its branches.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.490
"We must not be hasty.

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.350
Things will go as they will,
and there is no need to hurry

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.980
to meet them," quoth Treebeard
from The Lord of the Rings.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.880
Treebeard is the oldest of the
Ents still left in Middle Earth,

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.120
an ancient treelike being who is
sort of a shepherd of all trees.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.540
He has a very tall and
stiff-limbed appearance,

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.880
with bark-like skin and leafy hair.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.190
According to books, Ents are
much stronger than trolls

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.510
as trolls are just
crude imitation of Ents.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.310
And last but certainly not
least -- I could go on --

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:34.910
the Tree of Souls from Avatar, the
source of all energy and light.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.810
I'm not fluent in Na'vi, so I
will not dare attempt the correct

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.880
pronunciation, but it is a giant
willow-like tree that is a point

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.270
of extreme spiritual
significance to the Na'vi,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.010
moreso than any other
location on the planet Pandora

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:50.080
for at least 3,000 years.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.960 position:56%
The destruction of the Tree of Souls
would prove devastating to the Na'vi

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.660
as a whole and would create
a cultural and religious void

00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.730
that would decimate
their race entirely.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:06.100
Such is the significance of trees
in our extremely creative fiction.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.830
My mind really did
wander in that one.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.430
I went to Paul Bunyan,
Johnny Appleseed.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.030
There are a lot of opportunities
to sort of relate trees

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:16.940
in a popular way, but here are a
few quick examples of actual trees

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:22.090
that elicit and evoke similar
responses, very profound responses.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.060
The redwoods at Muir
National Forest.

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.440
The sequoia of California and
Oregon are among the largest

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.080
and tallest trees in the world,
living for thousands of years.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.560
John Steinbeck wrote about
redwood in 1961 in his Travels

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.770
with Charley in Search of America.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.890
"The redwoods, once seen,
leave a mark or create a vision

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:45.080
that stays with you always.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.870
No one has every successfully
painted

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.280
or photographed a redwood tree.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.180
The feeling they produce
is not transferable.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.310
From them comes silence and awe,

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:59.470 position:56%
and it's not only their unbelievable
stature nor the color which seems

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.600
to shift and vary under our eyes.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.350
No, they're not like
any other trees we know.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.020
They are ambassadors
from another time."

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.920
Or how about the Avenue
of Oaks from Oak Alley?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.490
The grand dame of the
great river road,

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.080
Oak Alley Plantation is a
national historic landmark located

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.630
on the west bank of the
Mississippi River in Vacherie,

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.180 position:56%
the Saint James Parish in Louisiana.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:23.500
Oak Alley is named, of course, for
that distinguished visual feature,

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.730
an alley created by a double
row of living southern live oaks

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.700
about 800 feet long and planted
in the early 18th century,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.640
long before the present
Greek revival focal point

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.320
in the picture was built.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.670
The alley or tree avenue runs
between the home and the river.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.330
And finally, of course, to sort
of bring it home a little bit,

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.230
our White House Christmas tree,
the official indoor Christmas tree

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.370
of the residence of the
president of the United States.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:52.240
Trust me, I came up with a lot
more popular culture examples,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.900
but hopefully these will be
sufficient to drive home the point

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.830
of the role of influences
of trees in our society.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.500
Probably it'll be a
little blurry out there.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.580
Like I said, I was musing over a
way to connect the natural side

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.810
with the culture side of
the National Park Service,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.430
and the idea of using trees

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.070
that have witnessed significant
cultural events coalesced

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.170
into the Witness Tree
Protection Program.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.800
I hope you see a little
humor in that one,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.850
but more seriously,
trees are landmarks.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:25.180
They are memorials, they identify
us, they identify human happenings,

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.410
we love them and they carry their
associations through generations.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:31.080
The idea of somehow preserving them

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.290
through documentation became
the core of the project.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.990
The national capital region of the
National Park Service embraced it

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.310
and funded the project completely,
and we are off and running

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:46.340
and completed HALS's
documentation on 24 witness trees

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.350
as a pilot project for the nation,
and we'd like to show not all 24

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.600
but a few of them briefly and
sort of soak you in the idea

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.410
of what a witness tree is.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:59.760
The Burnside Bridge American
Sycamore, Platanus occidentalis,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.810
located at the Antietam
National Battlefield.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.050
The Burnside Bridge American
Sycamore is a living monument

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.730
to those who fought there
on September 17th, 1862.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.420
With over 23,000 total casualties,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.680
the Battle of Antietam was not only
the bloodiest day of the Civil War

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.810
but also the bloodiest day
in all of American history,

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.090
and there you see a picture of
Union Army general Ambrose Everett

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.400
Burnside, with those
great mutton chops.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.540
This tiny bridge played
a key role in the battle.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.890
Burnside and the Federal
9th Corp had been charged

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:37.700
with first taking a stone
bridge spanning Antietam Creek.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.980
Burnside's attack was delayed some
five hours behind the original

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.610
schedule, and when he
finally did attack,

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.220
the entrenched Confederates
repelled several charges

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.200
by concentrating their fire
on that narrow bridge opening

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.010
on the creek's eastern bank.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.910
Burnside's force of
12,000 was held at bay

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.260
by a mere 400 resolute Georgians,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.740
the brigade that held off
a corp. Standing beside

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.390
that bridge is another
historic feature known

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.040
as the Burnside Sycamore,
a witness tree.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.170
The tree can be seen in photos by
the famous Civil War photographer,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.450
in the lower right there, Alexander
Gardner, and over 150 years later,

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:19.960
it still remains as a direct link
to the story and to the past.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.860
Or how about the Jackson
Magnolia, a magnolia grandiflora,

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.310
located on the south
side of the White House?

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:28.640
The Jackson Magnolia is a wonderful
hundred and eighty year-old story

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.050
of a tree that replaced itself.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.170
This story started in 1829

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.460
when President Andrew Jackson left
his Tennessee home and journeyed

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.760
to the White House for his
inauguration and presidency.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.070
Legend has it he had
a sprout from one

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.430
of his wife Rachel's
favorite magnolia trees.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.550
At that time, though, he was
in mourning for his wife,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.860
who had died just a few months
before his inauguration.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.990
Taking a sprout of the magnolia
tree obviously had a strong meaning

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.560 position:56%
for Andrew Jackson, and the majestic
tree has had a strong meaning

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.260
for many presidents since then
as well as their families.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.710
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.750
and Winston Churchill
commented many times,

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.430
"We sat underneath that
old magnolia tree."

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.380
It's a remarkably durable
specimen and quite a survivor.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:15.780
You may recall in 1994 it was
hit by a two-seat Cessna plane.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:17.480
Hitting the south side of
the house, it hit the tree,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.890
did some serious damage,
but it's still there.

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:21.890
And finally, to complete the story,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:27.000
a cutting from the Jackson Magnolia
made a return trip to the Hermitage

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.710
to replace the original tree that
was destroyed by a tornado in 1998.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.390
The War of 1812 Oak.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.690
It's a majestic tree.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:37.070
You can see the scale of it
next to those picked benches.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:41.430
A Quercus phellos located at Oxon
Hill Farm in Oxon Hill, Maryland,

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.600
planted at least in the early 19th
century, possibly the 18th century.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.770
The tree has stood
as a living witness

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.130
to a remarkable history
from the War of 1812.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.660
This is a 17th-century tract of
land overlooking the Potomac River

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.660
and the future Washington, DC.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.740
Ultimately it became known as Oxon
Hill Manor and its house is known

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.550
as Mount Welby, and that's
the view in the lower right

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.720
from Mount Welby toward
DC as it was burning.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.410 position:56%
The estate was situated near some of
the worst fighting of the entire war

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:15.700
and was in earshot of the Battle of
Bladensburg, and it was illuminated

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.370
by the fires in our capital,

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:22.080
and that remarkable willow
oak survives as a witness.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.710
One of my favorites, the Fort
Hunt Park Royal Visit Pin Oak,

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.690
a Quercus palustris, down on the
George Washington Memorial Parkway

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.840
at Fort Hunt Park.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.000
The Fort Hunt Park Royal
Visit Pin Oak is significant

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.220
because of its association
with the visitation

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:43.750 position:56%
of England's King George the Sixth
and Queen Elizabeth in June of 1939.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.760
The tree commemorates the visit
to the Civilian Conservation Corp,

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.600
the CCC, facility established
at Fort Hunt.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.570
President Roosevelt and First
Lady Eleanor Roosevelt used

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:59.450
to showcase Fort Hunt as a model
facility for CCC and it played host

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.580
to a great array of eminent
foreign leaders, including future,

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.300
most prominent, the royal couple.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.760
Two pin oak trees were planted
in honor of the occasion.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.440
One of those trees still
survives today to witness.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.670
The Lady Bird Johnson Park
Crabapple, a Malus species,

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:19.270
along the George Washington
Memorial Parkway.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:24.560
Lady Bird Johnson Park is actually
a manmade 157-acre island located

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.880
immediately south of Theodore
Roosevelt Island along the Virginia

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.110
shore of the Potomac
River at the west terminus

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.910
of Arlington Memorial
Bridge and sort

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.630
of the symbolic entrance
to the nation's capital.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.200
In 1901, the McMillan
Commission began to develop plans

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.500
for the present design

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.930
of Washington's city
beautiful, monumental core.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:44.970
Less well known, though,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.180
is the commission's plan
for a Columbia Island.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.090
In 1932, the Arlington
Memorial Bridge

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:54.670
and the Mount Vernon Memorial
Parkway opened to the public.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.130
The last phase of the work

00:29:56.130 --> 00:30:00.300 position:56%
on the Mount Vernon Memorial Parkway
project included seeding the grass

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.150
on Columbia Island and planting
approximately 75 ornamental

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.860
flowering trees.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.260
A very few amount of
these crabapples exist

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.150 position:56%
and this one certainly is a
mammoth example of a crabapple tree.

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:16.810
I think my favorite, the Frederick
Douglass White Oak, Quercus alba,

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.480
located at the Frederick
Douglass National Historic Site

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.170
in southeast Washington, DC.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.020
Frederick Douglass, of course,

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.270
was one of our nation's leading
abolitionists, author, editor,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.300
orator, reformer, statesman
and diplomat.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.990
He lived at Cedar Hill.

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.870
He died there in 1895.

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:38.010
The Frederick Douglass White Oak
commanded a prominent location

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.310
in front of the property.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.360
You can see it in the
historic photograph.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.020
That same V in the branches exists
in the V in the large photograph

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.610
on the other side of the image.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.840
It's located directly
outside his library

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.160
and witnessed his hours
of long work.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.600
It was the largest remaining
tree in the property.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.990
Sadly it has died and
has been removed,

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.450
the only remaining
archival record, of course,

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:02.450
being the witness tree
documentation.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.940
The big daddy, Methuselah, the
willow oak, a Quercus phellos,

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.130
located on the George Washington
Memorial Parkway right near one

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:11.720
of the parking lots
near Belle Haven.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:15.270
If you ever driven north on the
George Washington Memorial Parkway

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.570
from Mount Vernon, you more

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:19.790
than likely have enjoyed those
incredibly beautiful banked curves,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.260
the landscaping, the views and sort

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.140
of the way the parkway
integrates into the terrain.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.670
The George Washington Memorial
Parkway is actually the first

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.550
comprehensively designed
modern roadway built

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.850
by the federal government.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.810
There's several things that
you noticed when driving

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.510
on it made it quite
revolutionary for its time.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:42.420
You may have also noticed one
such curve, those gracious curves,

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.190
is gently interrupted
by sort of a hiccup

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:46.910
for no immediately obvious reason,

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:51.280
but if you go the desired
35 miles per hour,

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.750
you may have noticed an immense
tree located relatively close

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.050
to the road.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:59.370
The National Park Service
staff affectionately referred

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.970
to this specimen, an immense
willow oak, as Methuselah.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.310 position:56%
Such respect commanded actually
altering the road alignment in order

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.810
to preserve the massive tree.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:14.470
These mature trees, a Quercus
phellos, normally range in size

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.860
from 40 to 60 feet tall with a
30 to 40-inch spread on the crown

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.500
from about 110 to 220
inches around the trunk.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.600 position:56%
Methuselah's dimensions were
significantly greater than all three

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.060
of those, double some of those.

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:30.210
It's 160 feet across
the base of that tree.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.360
Sadly, it was hit by a car
and I believe lightning

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.730
and has since been removed.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.030
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.330
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: See, that's
how much we love trees.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:45.060
Indeed. But this of course is the
only remaining archival record.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.700
Just a few more.

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.260 position:56%
In Georgetown, the Tudor Place Tulip
Poplar, a Liriodendron tulipifera,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.260
located in Georgetown, District
of Columbia on the great estate.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.800
The tulip poplar is one of the
largest and most valuable hardwoods

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.340
of eastern North America.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.150
Its spread is unbelievable.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.550
It's from Connecticut and southern
New York to southern Ontario

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.310
and northern Ohio all the way
down to Louisiana and Florida.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:10.250
It has a massive growth area.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.180
This particular Tudor Place tulip
poplar is significant due its

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.700
association with the Peter family
of Georgetown and their development

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.410
of the Tudor Place Estate.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.830
Tudor Place was designed by Doctor
William Thornton, same architect

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.940
that designed the large structure
across the street, the US Capital,

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.380
but this tree is an
absolutely massive specimen.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.630
It occupies an extremely prominent
location on the south lawn.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:37.700
Certainly among one of the oldest
tulip poplars in Washington, DC,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.640
growing since the beginning of
property's long 200-year evolution,

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.610
and interestingly, Tudor Place is
the only private property protected

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.900 position:56%
by a National Park Service easement.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.650
Here's a local boy or girl.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:56.770
This is the Union Square
Zelkova, a Zelkova carpinifolia,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.830
located just at the bottom of
the hill here and Union Square.

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.060
The Botanic Garden elm is an
absolutely incredible ornamental

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.970
shade tree unlike another
any other tree on the mall.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.800
It's significant because of
its rarity, its longevity

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.700
and its association with
the original United States

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.190
Botanic Garden.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.860
It is also significant
due to its preservation

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.440
by Frederick Law Olmsted,
Junior, recognizing its uniqueness

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.840
in the world and certainly in
Washington, DC during his redesign

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.210
of the modern National Mall.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.890
In 1820, Congress authorized
the Columbian Institute

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.280
for the Promotion of
Arts and Sciences

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.380
to found first the United
States Botanic Garden

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:39.250
on the site currently occupied
by Union Square at the base

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.000
of the hill, by the water,
by the big lake down there,

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.280
an area approximately ten acres.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.990
In the 1850s, the first greenhouses
in the gardens were established.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:52.190
This historic photograph
shows the conservatory.

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.560
It's about 300 feet long totally,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.070
with a central dome
and two long wings.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.840
The late 19th-century photograph

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.840
in the lower right-hand corner also
shows where the original location

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.990
of the Bartholdi Fountain
is, from 1877 to 1927.

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:11.100
It's now on the opposite
side of Independence Avenue.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:15.510
The remaining Zelkova is a truly
unique specimen on the Mall,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.810
as you can see by the photos.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.760
I really would encourage
you to walk down and see it.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.290
It's sort of right before the
street where the cross-street is

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.850
for the Native American Museum,
so memorize that picture.

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:30.490
And finally, the 1910 Japanese
flowering cherry trees,

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:34.180
Prunus yedoensis, located
unusually, in this situation,

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:39.670
on the East Potomac Golf Course,
East Potomac Park, Haynes Point.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.730 position:56%
You may all know that the history
of the famous flowering cherry trees

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.830
of Washington, DC begins in 1885.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:50.240
A prominent city resident, a
travel writer and a photographer,

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.230
Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore
first traveled to Japan.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.800
She was deeply impressed by the
beauty of the cherry blossoms

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.450
and the prominent place that
this flowering tree holds

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.510
in Japanese culture.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:08.120
Upon her return to Washington, DC,
she lobbied Congress for 24 years

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.360
to plant those trees and
finally, in 1909, she decided --

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.660
she was almost ready to give up.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.590
She decided to raise the money
herself and purchase the trees

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:20.280
and then donate them to the city.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.970
She sent a letter explaining
all of this to First Lady Taft,

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:25.730
who embraced the project
immediately,

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:30.340
and this ultimately resulted
in a gift of 2,000 trees

00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:33.370
on behalf of the city of Tokyo.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.640
They arrived 1910.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.190
To the great disappointment of all
parties, a United States Department

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:41.830
of Agricultural Inspection
team discovered

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:46.870
that the trees had some insect
infection, so the USDA determined

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:51.510
that the trees must be destroyed
and on the 20th of January,

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.380
President William Howard Taft
reluctantly gave the order

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.570
to burn the trees that his
wife had just helped acquire.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:01.500
A second and even more generous
donation of an even larger group

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.630
of trees arrived in March of 1912,
with the first two trees planted

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.280
by First Lady Taft and Viscountess
Chinda the following day.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:13.920
Those are the trees we know, and
now for the rest of the story.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:16.930
It has long been assumed
that none of the cherry trees

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.540
from the 1910 shipment
survived destruction.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.110
That's simply not true.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:27.270
As we heard earlier, one of them
is here on the Library grounds

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:32.060
on the southeast corner, I think
it is, and the rest of them,

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:35.870
under recently discovered evidence
suggests that a small group of 24

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.510
of them were taken
under close observation

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:42.030
by government entomologists
for scientific analysis,

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.360
and today approximately
18 of the 24 survive.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.980
They are very, very old
Yoshino cherry trees.

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.440 position:56%
They're located on land now occupied
by the East Potomac Golf Course.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.310
They are not only the oldest but
some of the largest cherry trees

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:59.320
in Washington, DC, but
they also survived more

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:03.920
than twice their expected maximum
age that's expected for the species

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.620
and they really have grown to an
extraordinary size, as you can see

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.450
by some of the photographs.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.510
These witness trees are a living --

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:18.910
these 1910 cherry trees and the
1912 cherry trees are a living

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:22.640
and an enduring reminder of the
goodwill and friendship shared

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.290
by the people of Japan
and the United States.

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.510
Thank you very much.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:33.050
[ Applause ]

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.850
Thank you.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:40.720
[ Applause ]

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.520
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Thank you
very much, Doctor Dolinsky.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.620
It was wonderful.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.420
I learned a lot.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.860
We would like to hear some
questions or comments.

00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:57.260
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, one of the
things I would love is a map

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:01.330 position:56%
of those large trees on the capital,
basically [inaudible] them all, and,

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:05.870
you know, where you could have
like a -- guide yourself on a tour,

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:07.990
you know, and a lot of
them are like older.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.290
Some are not.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.590
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yes.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.640
Anticipating that question, the
National Capital Region is going

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.490
to do a brochure flyer
of the witness trees.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.750
Most of them are in Washington, DC.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.680
Some of them are outlying,
like I said Oxon Hill Farm

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.540
and Antietam National Battlefield,
and some are even further.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:29.750
The National Capital Region
has unusual boundaries.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:31.900
So there will be a map
coming out from NCR

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.600
in the near future illustrating the
location and a brief history, too,

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.750
of each one of the trees as
well as, more importantly,

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.000 position:56%
a link to the Library of Congress
so you can read the complete reports

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.160
and see all the photographs.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.220
&gt;&gt; A question.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:52.910
What is the replacement
policy when a tree dies?

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:55.890
Do you match it with
what was there originally

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.340
or do you put something new in?

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.380
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: I'm not uniquely
qualified to answer that question.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:05.930 position:56%
But in general terms, for example,
a good example would be the magnolia

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:09.900
at the White House that is replaced
from cuttings from the actual tree,

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.670 position:56%
and there's another one been planted
on the grounds on the right side.

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.240 position:56%
The original one's on the left side.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.320
But in general terms,
that's an argument

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:19.630
that has been going
on for a long time.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:24.910
For example, some large
plantations of formal plantings,

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.840
like an alley at the
Vacherie Plantation,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.260 position:56%
some of those were severely
destroyed around the Charleston area

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:36.470
and they left sort of a lot of
vacant teeth, let's just say,

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.720
in the middle of -- on the line,
so some people have actually chosen

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.240
to remove all and replace all
with similarly-sized new trees.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:47.810
On the mall here, you will
see numerous replacements

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.480
of the elm trees.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.400
One of the witness trees
is the Jefferson Elm,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.430
which is actually the species
of elm that helped save us

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.670
from the Dutch elm disease,
and we're propagating that

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.820
and the new trees on the mall
that are replacing the dying,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.700
expensive to maintain elm trees are
the same species, Jefferson elms.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.240
Yes, ma'am?

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.900
&gt;&gt; Would you tell a
story or make a selection

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.190
of the Cameron Elm
on capital grounds?

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.000
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Well, you
know, I don't know that story.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.600
It's not a National Park Service
tree, but I'd love to learn more

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.820
about it and you know there's
no reason the capital can't do a

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:24.270
witness tree protection program.

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.570
Yes, ma'am?

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.870
Oh, sorry.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.870
&gt;&gt; How do you actually
select the trees?

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.600
Is there like a list of criteria?

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.840
Do they have to have documentation?

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.790
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: That's
a very good question.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:39.740
When I came up with this idea --

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.340
I mean literally, HALS
is a mendicant order.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.990
You know, we always have to
go out and try to raise money

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.260
for these things, and
so I found the money

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.670
and by promising the
National Capital Region

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.950
that we'd use their
region as a pilot,

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.770
all of the National Park Service
cultural resource managers

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.770
in each one of the parks sent
in their recommendations,

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.450
and we gave them a
series of filters.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:06.180
You know, a witness tree has, you
know, witnessed an historic event,

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.280
has to be, you know, botanically --

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.710
it has to be old, and
a few other things,

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:14.730
but approximately two
dozen actually came in

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.590
and we just did whatever
was sent in by the managers.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.890
They understood quickly and
meaningfully what these trees were

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.310
and came up with a list,
and then we simply responded

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.410
to it and did the work.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:27.710
Sir?

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.020
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your
great presentation, by the way.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: I appreciate that.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, really good.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.460 position:56%
A lot of witness trees are logically
along highways and roadways

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.990
where things have happened.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.440 position:56%
[Inaudible] marched and [inaudible].

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:50.000
My experience of working
with Virginia's Department

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.350 position:56%
of Transportation leads me to
understand that in this day and age,

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:07.010
transportation agencies often
view large trees like this

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:13.840
as too dangerous for them to be
maintained and in fact have worked

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:21.570
to -- some of the arborist
associations have come

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:35.100
up with a grading point system for
their removal based on the fact

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:38.190
that there's a large tree
near a highway with a lot

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.000
of traffic, it should be removed.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.300
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah.

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.970
&gt;&gt; But I understand from other
arborists who were critical of that

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:52.710 position:56%
that that's really an unfortunate
development because what's happening

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:56.650
around the country is older
trees which are witness trees

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:58.810
from the Civil War era and later --

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:00.110
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Certainly.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:04.530
&gt;&gt; -- are being removed by
transportation agencies based

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.300
on this erroneous view that a
large tree is too dangerous.

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:11.570
Does HALS do anything to
push back against that?

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.390
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Well, we
have no bite in that sense,

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:18.710
and I will say the Department of
Transportation is sort of my enemy

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:20.880
in all historic preservation
projects.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.780
They have the big money
and we have none.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.350
But our documentation is meant
to, you know, somehow acknowledge.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:29.780
Many of the houses or the
homes you saw are gone as part

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.460
of the Historic American
Building Survey.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.480
I don't know what the actual
percent is of the collection,

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.040
but this is simply, you know,

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.630
documentation of the existing
condition and telling the story.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:45.360
And I have to believe, because
I've seen it happen many times

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.890
with saving historic houses and
things, when HABS has gone in,

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:53.930 position:56%
we've drawn the building, we've had
publicity, people tend to look at it

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.340
with a different set of filters
and then respect develops.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.690
So ultimately, I think, you
know, maybe we can't, you know,

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:00.990
fight the Department
of Transportation,

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.570
but I think this program is making
at least the National Park Service

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:03.870
and I know a lot of other
private sector as well

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.540
as state programs acknowledge the
significance of historic trees

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:07.520
and document them, and I think that
it can only lead to the next step,

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:08.990
which is the respect and
potential preservation of them.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.290
Yes, ma'am?

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.590
&gt;&gt; Do you know if there's
a landscape survey

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:12.890
of Yosemite National Park?

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:14.190
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Well, yes and no.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.490
There are portions of it that have
been measured in great detail.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:16.790
For example, I just finished a
project documenting Curry Village,

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.090
but the park in total, no, but
discreet, the historic structures

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.390
and Curry Village and certain areas
have been done, but not in total.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.690
&gt;&gt; Were you able to label
the Ahwahnee the Ahwahnee?

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.990
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: I just
knew you were going there.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:23.290
I knew you were going there.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:24.590
It's a bit embarrassing, isn't it?

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:25.890
They have a little, you know,
a shroud now over the sign

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:27.190
of the Ahwahnee and they've
renamed it something or other.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:28.490
Our documentation uses the
original historic name.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:29.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:31.090
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.390
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:33.690
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Well, yes, ma'am?

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.360
&gt;&gt; I know that HABS, HEAR, HALS
in general propagate standards

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.220
for documentation and I'm
just wondering what --

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.150
I don't actually know.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:45.790
What are the standards
for documenting a tree?

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.090
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Very good point.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.100 position:56%
The standards fall back on literally
the standards established in 1933

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.700
and '34, and that is that
the documentation needs

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.040
to be durable, okay.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.470
If there are measured drawings
being done, we will draw site plans

00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:04.870
for trees and locations within
the site and that's durably done

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:09.290
on an archival vellum, usually
done with an archival ink.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:13.020
In that sense, it has to be
-- the historical research,

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.730
of course, has to be verifiable.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.940
That simply means footnotes.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.570
Everything is formatted, in
that there are certain sizes

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.840
for the sheets of drawings, for
the sheets of historical research

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.310 position:56%
and a format for the photographs,
so all those type of standards apply

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.610
when you're doing a tree.

00:46:30.610 --> 00:46:33.420
You're photographing it, you're
researching it, you're drawing it

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:37.570
in a planned format or in some
other way, so the same apply

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:39.260
to buildings or engineering sites.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.160
We simply, you know, think
outside the box a little bit.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.460
Yes, sir?

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.630
&gt;&gt; This might have
been answered already,

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:50.280
but not every old tree
is a witness tree,

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.870
and how does one become
a witness tree?

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:57.170
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: I'm
not [inaudible].

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:02.690 position:56%
Basically it's, you know, cultural
association with some sort of event.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.480
It has to have -- you know,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.680
the Burnside Bridge Sycamore was
there the day the battle occurred.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.400
You know, Frederick
Douglass, you know,

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.270
was inspired by the white oak
tree out in front of his library.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:20.400
It has a direct association with
the cultural and the natural, okay.

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.700
Sir?

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.000
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.220
That was a great presentation.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.820
Appreciate it.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:34.500
&gt;&gt; And I actually have a
question that's specifically

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.300
about cherry trees.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:44.840
Are there any entities in
Japan that are interested

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.470
in how they're doing
and current things?

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:52.130
Because I know that we're
really good at documenting that,

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:56.100
but I've always wondered,
since it was a gift from them,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.240
if there's any people
back there doing it.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.540
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: That's
a very good question.

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.840
It's hard to answer.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:06.980
I'm not so sure I'm capable
of answering that question,

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:12.440
but you know, this
enduring relationship

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.580
of our countries regarding
those trees,

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:20.190
and I mean I don't know what
the total count is today,

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:31.410 position:56%
but the 1912 shipment was 3,200
trees and there must be 32,000 trees

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:38.300
out there now in the
city of Washington,

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:47.600
and of course they're all
Japanese cherry blossoms.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:58.920
And I don't know if there's
been a continual relationship

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.090
with Japan regarding
the exchange of trees,

00:49:02.090 --> 00:49:06.590
but I do know that every
year, there's a very spiritual

00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:12.720
and moving event for the cherry
blossom event itself and a visit

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:19.750
to the shrine there by the
Jefferson Memorial Bridge.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.980
So I would say that that
at least is acknowledged

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.520
as the original planting by First
Lady Taft and Viscountess Chinda.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.820
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Anne, would
you like to add something?

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:28.120
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yes?

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.420
&gt;&gt; Well, yes.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:30.720
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Sorry.

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:32.020
&gt;&gt; There's an ongoing
connection, to answer the question.

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.320
There are entities in Japan that
are interested in the ongoing

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.620
and making sure that the
connection keeps going.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.920
I'll have to talk you
up on that [inaudible].

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.220
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Thank you, Anne.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.520
Yes, ma'am?

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.820
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] both of
the cherry blossom trees.

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.120
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yes, ma'am?

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:42.420
&gt;&gt; Did I understand that
you have documentation

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:43.720
in all but one of the states?

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.020
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Correct.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.320
HALS is now represented
in 49 of the 50 states.

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.620
We're still fighting for --

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.920
I think it's either South
Dakota or North Dakota.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.220
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if I was going
to visit Idaho, for example,

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.520 position:56%
I could go online and find out where
in Idaho the witness trees were?

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.820
Is that correct?

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Unfortunately
there are no witness trees in Idaho,

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.420
but you can go online at
the Library of Congress.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.720
The witness tree project, it's
moving slowly, shall we say,

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.020
but it's popular in
the national parks.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.320
Not so much in the states, but
they're starting to pick up on it.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.620
But what I'd recommend is, well,
just I couldn't imagine going

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.920
to any state without checking
the HABS or HALS collection

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.220
at the Library of Congress
and you know,

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.520
it's extremely retentively
organized.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:05.820
I mean they drive me crazy.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:07.120
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: I
just want [inaudible].

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.420
I wish I could show it here.

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:09.720
It's just simple.

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.020
Go to loc.com, Library of
Congress, loc.com/pictures.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.320
Then you type in the
search box HABS or HALS.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.620
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah,
or Burnside Sycamore.

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:14.920
It'll go right to the
drawings and photographs.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.220
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Yes,
yes, then it'll find.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:17.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.820
Any one of these, you
go right to them,

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:20.120
you can read the entire report.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.420
&gt;&gt; So it's loc.gov
and then pictures?

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.720
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: I don't
think -- there might be.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:24.020
They might be work
out that way, yes.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.320
You get all the pictures
and all the written --

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.620
these, I'm just giving you,
of course, just a snippet

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:27.920
of the history, trying
to cover a few of them,

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.260
but some of these are
very large documents

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.560
and they're very interesting.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.780
We had a young historian
work on them

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.440
that was a particular
Civil War buff,

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.190
so the Burnside Bridge
report is like 30 pages.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.310
I know more than I ever wanted
to know about Ambrose Burnside.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:45.230
&gt;&gt; And it does say,
does it not, whether

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:47.660
or not the tree is still there?

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.960
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: No, it does not.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.260
&gt;&gt; Oh, my gosh.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:51.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: No, it does not.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.620 position:56%
Our record is of the year we did it.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.400
It has subsequently been removed.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:02.430
Those trees have been removed,
I apologize, some of them.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.730
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:05.030
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yes, sir?

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.330
&gt;&gt; Just a point of information

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.890
on whether there's a
continuing relationship

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.520
between the US and Japan.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:16.300
I know about two years ago, the US
State Department and the US embassy

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:22.510
in Tokyo donated, I
believe, a thousand trees

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.180
from the official tree of
Virginia, whatever it is.

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:26.480
I forget.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.780
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Tulip
poplar, I think.

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.080
&gt;&gt; Dogwood tree.

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.380
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Dogwood?

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.680
Dogwood tree.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.980
Okay, thanks.

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.280
&gt;&gt; Dogwood, maybe, yeah.

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.580
They donated that to Japan in the
spirit of friendship and as part

00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:38.910
of the Tomodachi post-tsunami
efforts

00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:41.810
to rekindle US/Japan relations.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.110
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.970
&gt;&gt; And those trees have
been planted all over Japan.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:48.820
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Eliza
Scidmore would be proud.

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:51.010
Is that it?

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.610
Okay, one more.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:52:09.600
&gt;&gt; I have actually read about a
town somewhere in Australia that,

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.220
for practical reasons,
they decided --

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.990
I can't remember if it
was [inaudible] addresses

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:15.750
or e-mail addresses to
the trees in the town --

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:17.050
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yes.

00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:18.490
&gt;&gt; -- for [inaudible] purposes
and I wondered if, you know,

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.660
people started writing to
the addresses of trees.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.960
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Yeah,
I think that's brilliant.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.260
I saw that article as well.

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.840 position:56%
I thought it was really very, very
clever because it does, in some way,

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.980
very similar to what we're trying
to do with the witness trees

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.150
and somehow get people
to acknowledge trees,

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:37.870
but they have GPS points in all
the trees and each tree is numbered

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:42.090
and people, you know, write the
story or tell if there's a problem.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:45.060
They keep it sort of -- they
keep track of it that way.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.360
I did see that as well.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.660
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious if you
had thought of doing something

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.960
like that as public promotion.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.260
I mean I'm sure they'll be
all numbered and tracked, too.

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:51.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Dolinsky: Well, you know,
I think there would be a great app

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.860
on a phone, like a witness tree
app, that you would, you know,

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.160
pull up on your phone and click
Washington, DC and you click

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.460
and it takes you to the Library,
it takes you to the location,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.760
so let's talk about that.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.060
We could make some money on that.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.860
&gt;&gt; Mari Nakahara: Well, thank
you very much and [inaudible].

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.320
[ Applause ]

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.980
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
