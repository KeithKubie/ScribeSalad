00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.700
The first scientific method acronym I was
ever taught was: SHE-OC. This was middle school.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.220
State the Problem.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.220
Hypothesis.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.220
Experiment.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.220
Observation.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.220
Conclusion.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.660
It seems pretty straightforward, and I didn’t
know it at the time.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.790
But that fourth one?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.030
That’s a doozy.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.429
Contemplate this classic story… when a tree
falls in the forest with nothing or no one

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.239
around, does it make a sound?

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.759
It would seem so, but if no one can hear it
does it matter?

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.939
What if I’m standing next to it?

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.700
What if I put a camera or a microphone nearby?

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.730
Surely a falling tree makes sound!

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.730
Right?

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.320
Sure, it probably does.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.620
But there’s really no answer, it’s just
a thought experiment.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.130
It really exists to illustrate a really huge
problem with science.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.020
The act of observation changes whatever you
observe!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.820
Famous chimp researcher Jane Goodall -- lived
among chimpanzee tribes for years, providing

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.110
food and learning about their behavior.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.980
Her observation and presence affected her
results -- and yet, what she learned taught

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.509
us heaps about chimps, and ourselves.

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.250
So, does it matter that she affected them?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.250
Yes.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.649
Did it affect the science?

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:11.790
YES, for sure!

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.759
Did we still learn a lot?

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:15.899
Abso-chimpin’-lutely.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.060
We still do these chimp studies, even knowing
we’re changing their behavior.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.039
A new study found even if researchers stay
away from them, just knowing they’re being

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.819
watched will change chimp hunting behavior.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.619
We’re not saying observation is negative!

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.270
It’s just -- out there.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.360
The act of doing it changes what you’re
observing.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.900
In the 1920s, American factories wanted workers
to be more efficient and productive.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.969
At one Hawthorne, Illinois factory, sociologists
were testing different rest periods, working

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.929
hours, lighting in the work areas… and every
change made workers more productive.

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.939
Even if they changed something, and then changed
it back --- both increased productivity!

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.700
It turned out, it wasn’t the changes, but
simply observing the workers changed their

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700
behavior.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.909
They felt someone was interested in their
well-being, and that was enough.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.880
Sociologists have dubbed this the Hawthorne
Effect.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.920
And this exist throughout science…

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.740
In computer science, the problem with observation
is called a Heisenbug.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.700
Basically if a programmer tries to figure
out where the bug is in their software, it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.860
won’t show up because they’re looking
for it.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.080
In physics they call this problem the Observer
Effect – and it’s super obvious: because

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.160
light is both a wave and made of photons,
but depending on how you observe it it will

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.750
only behave as one or the other!

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.750
So frustrating.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.220
And, this might have you wondering, how can
observation be part of science if the act

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.080
of observing changes the results?!

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.320
Can we really know what a black hole, amoeba
or atom does when it’s alone?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.270
We can’t …but…

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.210
NASA says on their website, “The ideal observer
is one who causes no unnecessary perturbations

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.140
to the system being observed.”

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.690
Observation is a big deal, but less so if
we know there’s an effect.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.250
In knowing the Observer Effect exists, we
can try to account for it.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.650
For example, researchers watching chimps have
tried using drones -- so there are no humans

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.650
around!

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.450
And… well, I’ll just let you see what
happened.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.030
The chimp prepared ahead of time, and used
a stick to take out the drone invader.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.430
No really, that’s what happened.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.220
We changed its behavior… even in trying
not to.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.830
In the end, there’s no “do this and the
observer effect goes away” instead, scientists

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.920
learn what the observer effect is for their
discipline, and then try and design experiments

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.920
to minimize it.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.030
That’s why double-blind studies are important,
and repeatability, and coming at problems

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.030
from different angles.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.410
There are even studies of the observer effects
in studies!

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.900
The SHEOC scientific method requires we get
information from the source, to draw conclusions,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.060
and ask new questions.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.930
Even though some problems can be solved without
ever going into the field, if we don’t observe,

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.190
how will we know?
