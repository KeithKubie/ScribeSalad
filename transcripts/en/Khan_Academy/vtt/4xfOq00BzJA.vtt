00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:02.810
VI HART: All right.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.710
So I'm Vi Hart and I'm
here with Sal Khan and--

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.600
SAL KHAN: Hello.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.390
VI HART: Yeah.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.490
We're talking about just
how we think about numbers

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.890
and what is the most
natural way to think

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.607
about them in our
everyday lives.

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:18.190
SAL KHAN: And Vi said that she
was going to test me right now.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.827
VI HART: Yeah.

00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:20.160
All right, can I borrow the pen?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.490
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.840
Yes.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.200
VI HART: I get to use the
official pen and screen-- oh

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.660
wait. [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.550
SAL KHAN: No, that's all screen.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.010
Yes.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.340
VI HART: OK.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.740
OK.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.073
SAL KHAN: You need training, Vi.

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:28.940
VI HART: I need training.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.440
Yay.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.474
SAL KHAN: It looks like a pizza.

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.040
VI HART: It's a triangle.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.070
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.340
Where's your test, Vi?

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.840
VI HART: OK.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.980
SAL KHAN: You're diverging.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.430
VI HART: I'm sorry.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.010
All right, so here's
a number line.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.150
Regular old number line.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.650
No, wait.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.705
I want to start at one.

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.330
All right, we're
going to start at one,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.630
and we're going to go
all the way to a million.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.790
And I'm going to give you the
pen now, and I'm going to ask,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.250
where is 1,000?

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.520
SAL KHAN: Where is 1,000?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.120
Where is 1,000?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.021
I see.

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:01.020
I see what you're doing.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.260
VI HART: So you can think
about this logically.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.700
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.199
Yes.

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.120
So I'll tell you what
went through my brain.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.670
My first knee-jerk
reaction was to put 1,000

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.820
like right over here.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.439
That's what I was tempted to do.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:14.980
VI HART: Mhm.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.637
SAL KHAN: And then
my brain kicked in.

00:01:16.637 --> 00:01:16.970
VI HART: Right.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.084
Yeah.

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:17.531
You think of it--

00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:19.100
SAL KHAN: My
highly-analytical mind.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.683
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.500
Because you know there is a
correct answer to this problem.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.320
We can think, all
right, where is

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.990
1,000 on the number line
related to a million?

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.139
Well, a million
divided by 1,000.

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.930
SAL KHAN: Is 1,000.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.075
VI HART: You want
one thousandth.

00:01:33.075 --> 00:01:33.660
SAL KHAN: Thousandth.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.010
Right.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.880
So it's not there.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.629
I was going to draw
it a tenth of the way.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.590
No.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.455
1,000 is like there.

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.580
You barely notice the
difference between that and--

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.600
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.087
You couldn't even see the
difference in thousandths.

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:44.670
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.680
So this is fascinating.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.570
What is this about?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.840
Why did I do that?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.530
VI HART: Yeah.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.760
Why do we think of 1,000 as
being much closer to a million

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.730
than it is?

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.450
And we do this,
actually, all the time.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.409
We're not so used
to having to think

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.450
about the difference
between 1,000 and a million.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.760
But when we're thinking about
the difference between 1 and 2,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.130
or the difference between
2 and 3, or 1 and 10,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.789
we think, 1 and 2.

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.080
There's a big difference there.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.732
2 is twice what 1 is.

00:02:17.732 --> 00:02:18.315
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:18.800
It's twice 1.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.310
Right.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.200
VI HART: And the
difference between 9 and 10

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.180
is the same distance
when you're looking

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.640
at it at the usual scale.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.290
It's 1.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.956
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:02:25.956 --> 00:02:26.570
Right.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.750
VI HART: But when we're thinking
about real-life things, well,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.291
the difference
between 9 and 10 isn't

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.729
so big in any real
life situation.

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:32.270
SAL KHAN: No.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.860
But the difference
between 1 and 2 is huge.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.090
VI HART: Yeah.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.070
SAL KHAN: In
real-life it's double.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.611
VI HART: Yes.

00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:36.520
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.097
VI HART: So now we have to
think on a logarithmic scale

00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:39.680
is what it is.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.221
SAL KHAN: Oh.

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:41.090
Yes.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.900
The old logarithmic scale.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.920
So what you're saying
is that we, as humans,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.420
even though everything
we're taught

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.400
is these linear scales, where
we want to say this is 1,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.270
and then maybe this
is 10, and then

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.690
this is 20-- even though
that's what we're taught,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.540
and that's what most
of our mathematics, we

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.870
plot lines and stuff like that.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.110
VI HART: Yeah.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.943
That's how we draw it
out on paper, usually.

00:02:58.943 --> 00:03:00.370
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.260
VI HART: But that doesn't
make sense, usually,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.620
for how we think about things.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.720
Because the difference
between 5 gazillion

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.060
and 5 gazillion and 10 is--

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.935
SAL KHAN: Is nothing.

00:03:10.935 --> 00:03:11.190
Is nothing.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.570
VI HART: Nothing.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.860
Whereas the difference
between 1 and 10 is huge.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.720
SAL KHAN: Right, right, right.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.261
And so that's why
almost the multiple

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:19.570
matters more than the absolute
distance between the numbers.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.245
VI HART: Yeah.

00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:20.670
SAL KHAN: Absoluately.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.740
And that's what the
logarithmic scale captures.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.710
VI HART: It is.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.930
And that's why we see
the logarithmic scale

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.760
in so many things in real life.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.587
As a mathemusician, on
the piano we see it.

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:32.170
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.322
VI HART: It's actually
the logarithmic scale.

00:03:34.322 --> 00:03:35.780
So let's get our
piano picture out.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.310
SAL KHAN: Oh, look at that.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.750
There's a piano.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.197
VI HART: Yeah.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:37.644
OK.

00:03:37.644 --> 00:03:38.091
OK.

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:38.780
Can I have the pen?

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.010
SAL KHAN: Here you go.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.060
Yes.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.810
VI HART: All right.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.050
Let's see if I can
figure this out.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.700
All right.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.647
So here we have
this C. Let's call

00:03:43.647 --> 00:03:46.810
it middle C. And
here we have this D.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.720
And there's a certain
distance between these.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.650
And then here is
this C and this D.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.360
And when we're listening
to these notes,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.320
we think, all right,
they're one note apart.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.779
This is the same distance
here between here and here

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:01.570
and here and there.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.250
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.940
VI HART: But if you look
at the actual frequencies,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.760
the distances are not the same.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.610
This was maybe a bad
example, because I

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.110
don't know the
frequency of D, but--

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.651
SAL KHAN: No.

00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.380
Well, we could--

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.921
VI HART: Well I'll give you an
example I can give numbers to,

00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:20.196
which is maybe the difference
between this octave

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:21.820
and the difference
between this octave.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.370
Right?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.922
If this is C--

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:24.794
SAL KHAN: Call it x.

00:04:24.794 --> 00:04:25.230
VI HART: x.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.380
SAL KHAN: Whatever
the frequency is.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.590
VI HART: Right.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.090
Yes.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.673
This is great.

00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:29.405
SAL KHAN: It's
like 440 kilohertz.

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:30.465
I don't know what it is.

00:04:30.465 --> 00:04:30.636
VI HART: No.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:31.200
A is 440.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.620
SAL KHAN: A is 440.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.435
VI HART: C is--

00:04:32.435 --> 00:04:33.726
SAL KHAN: Well we'll call it x.

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:35.987
VI HART: More like, I
don't know, let's say 300.

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:36.570
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:37.430
VI HART: All right.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.150
So if this is 300
or 300x or just x,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.687
then this frequency
would be 600.

00:04:44.687 --> 00:04:45.270
SAL KHAN: 600.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.480
Right.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.190
It doubles.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.010
VI HART: It doubles when
you go up an octave.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.280
And this would be 1,200 up here,
this C. We're in a weird scale

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.780
here.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.380
But the difference
between here is 300.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.940
And the difference
between here is 600.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.440
But when we're
listening to octaves,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.398
we feel like the difference
between this octave

00:05:05.398 --> 00:05:08.290
shouldn't be half as much as
the difference between these two

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.790
notes.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.290
Right?

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.990
The distance from an
octave should be an octave.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.504
Right?

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:13.170
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.430
So fundamentally the way we
perceive pitch is logarithmic.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.752
VI HART: It's just
fundamentally logarithmic.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.710
If you want to have all
your notes on the piano

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.210
be right next to
each other, instead

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.600
of having a piano where you
have one key for C here,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.704
and one key for C
here, and the next C

00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:29.745
is going to be over here.

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:29.850
Right?

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:30.475
SAL KHAN: Yeah.

00:05:30.475 --> 00:05:31.040
Twice as far.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.750
Yeah.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.250
VI HART: And the next C on the
piano would have to be like--

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.440
SAL KHAN: So if
piano manufacturers--

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.084
they innately made it based
on a logarithmic scale,

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:40.250
whether they knew it or not.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.298
VI HART: Yeah.

00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:41.220
Because we think about it
on a logarithmic scale.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.410
SAL KHAN: They could have
made it on a linear scale,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.510
and then the keys would
just get fatter and fatter

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.560
as we went to the right.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.970
VI HART: Oh, yeah.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.030
Fatter keys instead of
making them farther apart.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:47.715
SAL KHAN: Someone
should make that.

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:48.010
VI HART: A fat key piano.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.450
SAL KHAN: A linear scale piano.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.110
Yes.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.794
VI HART: That would be awesome.

00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:54.335
But that's not how
we think of pitch.

00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:54.876
SAL KHAN: No.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:56.320
It might be hard to play that.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.790
VI HART: It would
be [? awesome. ?]

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.206
SAL KHAN: And it's
just not pitch.

00:05:59.206 --> 00:06:03.784
It also even be how we perceive
a magnitude of the frequencies.

00:06:03.784 --> 00:06:05.200
Because we have
the decibel scale,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.547
which is a logarithmic scale.

00:06:06.547 --> 00:06:07.130
VI HART: Yeah.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.982
There's a lot of natural,
intuitive, logarithmic scales.

00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:11.940
So when we're looking at
how loud something is,

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.449
that's also the difference
between how I'm talking now

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.240
and how I'm talking if
I'm a little louder.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.094
And we feel like distances
between loudness also--

00:06:23.094 --> 00:06:23.760
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.110
VI HART: It's harder to explain.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.310
SAL KHAN: We perceive it a
lot-- it is harder to explain.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.450
But we'll leave it there.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.720
VI HART: I don't
have any pictures

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.510
of how loud something is.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.774
SAL KHAN: We don't.

00:06:27.774 --> 00:06:28.140
No.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.280
And we don't want
to bother people

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.260
by just getting
louder and louder.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.620
VI HART: By screaming.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.225
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:32.850
VI HART: I can scream
at you some more.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.404
I think that would be great.

00:06:34.404 --> 00:06:35.070
SAL KHAN: Right.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.190
No.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.148
But that's fascinating.

00:06:36.148 --> 00:06:38.137
Especially this
little game here.

00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:40.470
I'm going to start doing this
at the next party I go to.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.011
VI HART: Mhm.

00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:41.570
It's good.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.110
And it makes sense.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.620
When we're looking at things,
the difference between how

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.650
much $1 million
and $10 million is.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.832
SAL KHAN: Yes.

00:06:48.832 --> 00:06:50.790
VI HART: The world follows
these kind of rules.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.350
SAL KHAN: Right, right, right.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.220
Very cool.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.980
VI HART: Yeah.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.530
SAL KHAN: Awesome.
