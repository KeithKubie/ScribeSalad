00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:02.000
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.140
to see whether the
power rule is giving us

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.055
results that at least
seem reasonable.

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:08.480
This is by no means a
proof of the power rule,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.720
but at least we'll feel a little
bit more comfortable using it.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.190
So let's say that f
of x is equal to x.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.440
The power rule tells
us that f prime

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.270
of x is going to
be equal to what?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.990
Well, x is the same thing
as x to the first power.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.194
So n is implicitly
1 right over here.

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.360
So we bring the 1 out front.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.740
It'll be 1 times x to
the 1 minus 1 power.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.200
So it's going to be 1 times
x to the 0 power. x to the 0

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.730
is just 1.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.920
So it's just going
to be equal to 1.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.560
Now, does that makes
conceptual sense

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.100
if we actually try to
visualize these functions?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.370
So let me actually try
to graph these functions.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.700
So that's my y-axis.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.230
This is my x-axis.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.050
And let me graph y equals x.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.320
So y is equal to f of x here.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960
So y is equal to x.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.180
So it looks something like that.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.209
So y is equal to x.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.000
Or this is f of x
is equal to x, or y

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.560
is equal to this f of
x right over there.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.540
Now, actually, let me
just call that f of x just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910
to not confuse you.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.930
So this right over
here is f of x

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.870
is equal to x that I
graphed right over here.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.330
y is equal to f of x,
which is equal to x.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.280
And now, let me
graph the derivative.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.850
Let me graph f prime of x.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.370
That's saying it's 1.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.850
That's saying it's 1 for all x.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.821
Regardless of what x is,
it's going to be equal to 1.

00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:32.320
Is this consistent
with what we know

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.380
about derivatives and
slopes and all the rest?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.890
Well, let's look
at our function.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.560
What is the slope of the tangent
line right at this point?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.130
Well, right over here, this
has slope 1 continuously.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.060
Or it has a constant slope of 1.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.220
Slope is equal to 1
no matter what x is.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.212
It's a line.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:51.795
And for a line, the
slope is constant.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.840
So over here, the
slope is indeed 1.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.390
If you go to this point over
here, the slope is indeed 1.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.890
If you go over here,
the slope is indeed 1.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.260
So we've got a pretty
valid response there.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.100
Now, let's try something
where the slope might change.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.740
So let's say I have g of
x is equal to x squared.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.610
The power rule tells
us that g prime of x

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.550
would be equal to what?

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.700
Well, n is equal to 2.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.080
So it's going to be 2
times x to the 2 minus 1.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.660
Or it's going to be equal
to 2 x to the first power.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.860
It's going to be equal to 2x.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.067
So let's see if this
makes a reasonable sense.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.400
And I'm going to try to graph
this one a little bit more

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.899
precisely.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.360
Let's see how precisely
I can graph it.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.717
So this is the x-axis, y-axis.

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.050
Let me mark some stuff off here.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.990
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.322
This is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:55.322 --> 00:02:58.550
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.210
So g of x.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.930
When x is 0, it's 0.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.390
When x is 1, it is 1.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.780
When x is negative 1, it's 1.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.350
When x is 2, it is 4.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.849
So that puts us right
over there-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:12.890
Puts us right over there.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.170
When x is negative
2, you get to 4.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.917
It's a parabola.

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:17.250
You've seen this for many years.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.200
I put that point a
little bit too high.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.660
It looks something like this.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.020
Actually, the last two points I
graphed are a little bit weird.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.840
So this might be
right over here.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.690
So it looks something like this.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.980
It looks something like that.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.550
And then, when you
come over here,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.810
it looks something like that.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:42.490
It's symmetric.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.250
So I'm trying my best
to draw it reasonably.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.130
So there you go.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.860
That's the graph of g of x.
g of x is equal to x squared.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.360
Now, let's graph g prime of
x or what the power rule is

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.950
telling us a g prime of x is.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.240
So g prime of x is equal to 2x.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.230
So that's just a line that goes
through the origin of slope 2.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.920
So it looks something like that.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.400
When x is equal to
1, y is equal to 2.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.670
When x is equal to 2, y
or g of x is equal to 4.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.540
So it looks something like this.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.720
Let me try my best to
draw a straight line.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.839
It looks something like this.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.010
Now, does this make sense?

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.800
Well, if you just
eyeball it really fast,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.670
if you look at this
point right over here--

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.190
and you want to think about
the slope of the tangent line.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.470
Let me do this in a color that
pops out a little bit more.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.490
So the tangent line would
look something like this.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.650
So it looks like it has a
reasonably high negative slope.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.150
Yeah.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.190
It's definitely
a negative slope,

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.814
and it's a pretty
steep negative slope.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.460
For x is equal to negative
2, g prime of negative 2

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.140
is equal to 2 times negative 2,
which is equal to negative 4.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.621
So this is claiming that
the slope at this point-- so

00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:08.120
this right over
here is negative 4--

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.703
is saying that the
slope of this point

00:05:09.703 --> 00:05:12.220
is negative 4. m is
equal to negative 4.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.740
That looks about right.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.830
It's a fairly steep
negative slope.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.370
Now, what happens if
you go right over here

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.410
when x is equal to 0?

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.090
Well, our derivative--
if you say g prime of 0--

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.730
is telling us that the slope of
our original function, g, at x

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.710
is equal to 0 is 2 times 0 is 0.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.874
Well, does that make sense?

00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:34.540
Well, if we go to our
original parabola,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.289
it does indeed make sense.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:37.830
That's the slope of
the tangent line.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.720
The tangent line looks
something like this.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.520
We're at a minimum point.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.353
We're at the vertex.

00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:44.430
The slope really
does look to be 0.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.340
And what if you
go right over here

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.120
to x equals 2, the slope
of the tangent line?

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.780
Well, over here, the tangent
line looks something like this.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.040
It looks like a fairly
steep positive slope.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.672
What is our derivative telling
us based on the power rule?

00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:04.130
So this is essentially
saying, hey,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.160
tell me what the slope
of the tangent line for g

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.630
is when x is equal to 2.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.630
Well, we figured it out.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.870
It's going to be 2 times x.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.170
It's going to be 2 times
2, which is equal to 4.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.580
It's telling us that the
slope over here is 4.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.800
And I'm just using m.
m is often the letter

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.089
used to denote slope.

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.130
They're saying that the
slope of the tangent line

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.430
there is 4, which seems
completely, completely

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.310
reasonable.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.260
So I encourage you to
try this out yourself.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.700
I encourage you to try
to estimate the slopes

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.729
by calculating, by
taking points closer

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.020
and closer around those points.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.980
And you'll see that
the power rule really

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.860
does give you results
that actually make sense.
