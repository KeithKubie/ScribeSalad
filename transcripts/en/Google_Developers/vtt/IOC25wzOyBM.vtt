[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:52.035 --> 00:03:54.836
IKAI LAN: -- go in to new
APIs and new themes.

00:03:54.836 --> 00:03:55.960
JEFF POSNICK: There we go.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.900
IKAI LAN: As Jeff mentioned, the
show that we're going to

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.800
do for you guys today is we're
going to be talking about what

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.340
new developers experience when
they come to the YouTube API.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.690
So I personally love YouTube.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.510
I was talking to Jeff before I
joined this team about how

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.300
much I enjoy and I use YouTube
for everything I do.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.030
And initially, I started
watching

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.160
silly videos on YouTube.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.820
Like I started watching--

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.290
I don't know.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.394
Name a silly video.

00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:19.339
Name a silly video.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.209
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Cat videos.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.620
IKAI LAN: Cat videos.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.610
I don't watch cat videos.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.120
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Maybe
it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.970
IKAI LAN: Skateboarding dog.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.845
But as I started to use YouTube
more and more, I

00:04:26.845 --> 00:04:29.980
started to realize that
video is everything.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.250
I use YouTube to learn
how to cook.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.140
I use YouTube to figure out
how do I unclog my drain.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.570
YouTube is the resource for
pretty much everything that

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.330
you can think about, pretty
much that you want to do.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.040
So I'm sure that you've gone
on YouTube to learn about

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.820
snowboarding techniques.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.910
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Yeah, I enjoy
also just watching from their

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.990
cameras and their
old snapshots.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.460
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.920
So anyway, that was a very long
introduction to YouTube,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.320
which you all know
what it is now.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.360
So I'm going to talk about
the new developer

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.390
experience for YouTube.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.690
Not a lot of people know that
YouTube has an API.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.700
And when you start thinking
about the types of

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.200
applications you could build
once you have access to pretty

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.930
much every video in the world
on every subject you might

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.060
want, you can really build
some very compelling

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.000
applications.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.390
And YouTube has been pushing
out more and more APIs that

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.140
allow you to do this.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.480
And the three APIs that are
public right now that you can

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.890
start using right away are--
and in the order of

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.830
popularity, I think, are
the Player API--

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.785
JEFF POSNICK: Well, let's
not say popularity.

00:05:24.785 --> 00:05:25.370
IKAI LAN: They're all
very popular.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.955
JEFF POSNICK: They're
in our hearts.

00:05:26.955 --> 00:05:27.760
IKAI LAN: In our hearts.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.600
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.680
IKAI LAN: First off, there's
the Player API.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.050
And the Player API is what you
want when you have a web page

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.680
or some kind of HTML page where
you want to display and

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.670
control an embedded player.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.110
So the Player API is what you
would use when you want to use

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.720
JavaScript or Flash to say, skip
here in the video, move

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.760
backwards, enlarge the
video, [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.550
What else am I missing?

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.900
JEFF POSNICK: You could
queue up new videos.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.650
You could create kind of a
custom playback experience.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.010
You could get rid of
all the controls.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.570
You do have your own playback.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.750
And you mentioned JavaScript
and Flash.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.060
Just to make it clear, you can
do HTML5 video playback, too--

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.880
IKAI LAN: HTML video playback.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.220
JEFF POSNICK: --if you didn't
feel like using JavaScript.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.327
So we have a lot of really cool
stuff to offer in the

00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:09.676
Player API.

00:06:09.676 --> 00:06:11.960
IKAI LAN: So the Player API--

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.330
you could think of it as one
of the front-end APIs for

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.870
displaying and controlling
the actual videos.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.860
But when you start using the
Player API, the second API you

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.980
really want to really make the
experience better, make your

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.980
app better, is the Data API.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.870
And this is what I'll be talking
a lot about today--

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.140
or not too long, maybe 5
or 10 minutes or so.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.550
And the Data API is what you
would do when you want to

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.600
query, say, what videos
have you watched--

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.380
with his permission
of course--

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.330
search by topic, find me.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.240
JEFF POSNICK: Dog videos.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.130
IKAI LAN: Dog videos.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.180
Search by keyword.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.770
And there's a lot
of interesting

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.590
stuff in the Data API.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.450
It uses authentication,
so we'll talk a

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.450
little bit about that.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.300
And the third one is the
Analytics API, which I'm not

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.090
too familiar with.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.250
I've been on this team for
about a couple days.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.240
So tell me a little bit about
the Analytics API.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.400
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.430
And again, we wanted these new
developer experiences.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.970
So these are very
fresh Googlers.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.850
And I'm happy to talk a
little bit more about

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.740
the Analytics API.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.490
And this is a way of fetching
information about the videos

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.550
that are in your own accounts.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.325
Again, this is another
authorized API.

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:19.000
You have to go through the OAuth
2 flow first, which I

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.450
know Ikai is going to
be talking about

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.670
it in a little bit.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.250
And it lets you fetch pretty
much all the demographic

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.800
information that we have about
who's watching your videos,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.310
how popular videos are
in certain regions.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.230
We now have some information
about the total watch time,

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.050
which is really important for
folks who are looking to see

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.840
exactly how much of your videos
are being watched.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.400
And we're pretty excited
about it.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.230
It's currently in experimental
mode right now.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.900
So it's not fully launched in
its 100% final state yet.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.090
But we really do hope that
folks are using it.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.920
IKAI LAN: Right.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.010
And since it will be called
an offline API, you should

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.800
totally start using it if you
need this type of data.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.530
Because even though, as Jeff
says, it's experimental, what

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.260
that means, as a Google
Developer, is that we may

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.860
still make lots of breaking
API change.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.900
Now, we try really hard
not to do this.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.540
We try not to break our users.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.690
But when an API's an
experimental, that means that

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.290
we're still iterating
very, very fast.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.705
We're still not quite sure what
exactly we want to do

00:08:19.705 --> 00:08:20.130
with it yet.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.030
So there might be breaking
changes.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:24.890
But for the most part,
it should be working.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.220
So since it's offline, maybe
you're pulling analytics to

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.000
build a dashboard, or you're
aggregating stats at night.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.600
This is the sort of thing that
you would do with the

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.520
Analytics API.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.929
And if that breaks, at least
you won't break users.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:39.600
So I highly encourage it, if you
need this data, to start

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.860
using this right away.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.920
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about--

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.840
I just cheated.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:50.360
I just looked at the notes
that I put on my thigh.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.880
I mentioned that the Data API is
something that you want to

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.260
get into if you're doing any
kind of YouTube application.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.530
And to do the Data API, you
need to do authorization.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.860
So I've been at Google
for over three years.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.530
And before being at Google, I
worked at a place where I had

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.770
the opportunity--

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.165
opportunity?

00:09:06.165 --> 00:09:07.000
JEFF POSNICK: I think
that would be--

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.410
IKAI LAN: The joy.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.990
The joy to work with OAuth.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.270
JEFF POSNICK: Joy-portunity.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.640
IKAI LAN: Joy-portunity.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.560
I had the joy-portunity
to work with OAuth.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.950
And OAuth is this way of
authenticating requests.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.180
Now, when you jump into the
Data API, you'll see that,

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.720
holy moly, there are
a lot of options.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.930
You've got the Data
API v1, v2, v3.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.720
You have ClientLogin
authentication--

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.130
AuthSub and OAuth.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.980
What should you use?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.930
What should you use?

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.740
I don't want to make any
absolute statements

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.470
except for a few.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:35.830
I want to make a few absolute
statements.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.330
JEFF POSNICK: Make as many
absolute statements as you

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.260
want, and I will qualify your
absolute statements.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:39.370
IKAI LAN: All right.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.420
Jeff will qualify.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.930
And if Jeff starts to go
like this, don't do it.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.990
So first off, don't
use the v1 API.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.340
JEFF POSNICK: Do not.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.740
IKAI LAN: Just do
not use this.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.780
This is deprecated.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.560
I don't know what's going
to happen with it.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:52.950
Can you tell us?

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:54.190
JEFF POSNICK: I think it's going
to follow our normal

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.970
deprecation policy, basically.

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.970
And that's all dictated by our
terms of service, so I don't

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.550
want to extemporaneously talk
about what that involves.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.900
But you could look
that up online.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.000
And we're doing a pretty good
job, I think, of hiding the v1

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.260
API from our current docks.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.660
And hopefully there aren't too
many new developers that

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.010
stumble upon it and say, hey,
I'm going to get started with

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.900
the v1 API.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.730
IKAI LAN: Yeah.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.760
I still see a lot of
questions about the

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.900
v1 API online, though.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.140
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.730
IKAI LAN: So already, strike the
v1 API if you're starting

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.110
to jet-dive into the
YouTube API.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.300
So now you've got the choice
of the v2 and the v3 API.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.080
The v2 API is pretty much the
fully supported, mature

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.320
version of the API but doesn't
have quite all the

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.300
functionality we want.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.040
And the v3 API is kind
of on its way there.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.180
And if you're starting a new
project, definitely look at

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.800
what the v3 API can do, because

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.330
that's where we're headed.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.010
That's where the puck is going,
so check that out.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.430
And there are some things you
can't quite do with the v3

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.120
API, so keep that in mind
when you're designing.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.810
Just, abstraction is good when
you're writing code.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.110
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.240
So the v3 API is another
experimental API.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.330
And everything that you guys
said previously about our

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.310
experimental API policy and
adding new features and

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.120
perhaps introducing a
few breaking changes

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.370
also applies to v3.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:17.180
There is not quite full-feature
parity yet.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.850
There are some glaring
exceptions and things that are

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.330
currently in v2 that
aren't v3.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:27.730
And if you need any of those,
then v2 is the way to go.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:29.750
V3 has really nice
client libraries.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.110
And I think that's the biggest
thing about v3 that makes it

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.310
nice for new developers getting
started, because you

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.990
have a really rich client
library experience, including

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.120
good support for OAuth, too.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.580
IKAI LAN: A few things that we
have got to do on our end is

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.090
to really just build on those
client libraries and show you

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.520
guys how to build great
applications.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.850
So right now, there
are examples in

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.990
JavaScript and Python.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.000
And we're going to have examples
for many of the other

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
popular languages, too, like
Java, JavaScript, PHP.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.990
I've been working on some Go
samples, only because no one

00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.620
claimed those.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.410
So I said, oh heck,
I'll do it.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:03.200
So if you're programing in Go,
you're in luck, because

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.320
hopefully I'll be able to push
those samples out soon.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.970
So the v3 API, even though Jeff
says it's experimental,

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:09.930
I've taken a look at the API.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.940
And obviously I can't promise
this, but it looks pretty

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.130
close to what the final thing
might be, plus we might add a

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.600
few things.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:22.180
So even though it's way later
along in its development and

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.410
being pushed out than the
Analytics API, which came out

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.330
in, I think, December--

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.590
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, I don't
want to say that it's way

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.520
later along necessarily.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.950
I think they're pretty
much both--

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.510
IKAI LAN: Qualify
my statements.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.240
JEFF POSNICK: They're pretty
much both looking like what

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.000
the final version's going
to look like, with some

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.890
additional features.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.100
That would be my not unofficial
answer about the

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.010
future of those APIs.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.330
IKAI LAN: So what Jeff is
unofficially saying is that if

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.150
you can use the v3 API, it's
pretty safe to use the v3 API

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.570
and to start taking
a look at that.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.070
Now obviously, with any
experimental API, you're best

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.950
off in an environment where
you can iterate quickly.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.210
So a web environment's a really
good example, because

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.420
if there is a breaking change--
and there probably

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.740
won't be-- you can quickly
push out an update.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.280
Because most of the breaking
changes we make to

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.940
experimental APIs tend to be
very, very small-- like we're

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.320
renaming this function,
or we're

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.600
changing what this returns.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.990
So we do consider all these
things when we're pushing

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.140
things out, even for
experimental APIs.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.420
So on that note, v2 and v3 are
your different options.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.350
Now, I mentioned earlier, maybe
you want to write an

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.080
application that says, help me
look at my favorite videos and

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080
do something with them.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:27.990
Now, you don't need to write
this application, because

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.110
YouTube has a feature
called Favorites.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.460
And you can just go and look.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.450
But let's say you want to do
something interesting with

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.961
these, like you wanted to--

00:13:35.961 --> 00:13:37.830
JEFF POSNICK: You wanted to take
a look at your favorite

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.050
videos and find all the topics
that are associated with those

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.255
videos, using v3 is awesome
support for Freebase topics,

00:13:45.255 --> 00:13:46.590
for instance.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:47.880
IKAI LAN: You want
to translate all

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.030
the titles into Russian--

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.400
Roman Nurik is producing
for us.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.785
We'll translate them all
into Russian and

00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:54.080
email them to Roman.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.110
These are all things
that you could do

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.360
programmatically via the API.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.840
And you need authentication
to get this done.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.110
I can't just write
an application.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.590
Jeff can't just show up, and
I'll automatically know who

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.020
Jeff is, because that's bad.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.010
It's not a bad thing, it's that
if I'm a bad person, that

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.900
would be bad, because then I
would have accessed your data

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:16.770
and your YouTube, and I'd be
able to act on your behalf.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.760
JEFF POSNICK: And I will qualify
that by saying Ikai's

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.460
not a bad person.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.050
IKAI LAN: I'm not
a bad person.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.910
JEFF POSNICK: Ikai does not
want to act on my behalf

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.820
unless I tell Ikai to
act on my behalf.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.110
IKAI LAN: And thus we have
this concept of OAuth.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.010
So when you're authenticating,
you have three options to

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.750
authenticate.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.370
So when Jeff comes to your
application, and you want to

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.600
say, hey Jeff, let me
do stuff for you.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.900
Let me create interesting
content for you.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.420
Jeff has to somehow give me
access to his account.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.910
And there are three ways
of doing this.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.570
One is called ClientLogin, where
Jeff directly gives me

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.200
his username and password.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.440
Please don't do this.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.650
We don't want to support
this anymore.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:54.400
It trains users to give their
usernames and passwords to

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.720
third-party sites.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.100
In general, taking the username
and password is a bad

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.950
practice, and I don't want
to encourage this.

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:01.890
JEFF POSNICK: And you can't
actually do it in v3 anymore.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.910
So we don't have support--

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.640
IKAI LAN: You cannot do
it in v3 anymore.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.600
JEFF POSNICK: --for
ClientLogin in v3.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.840
IKAI LAN: The second way is
something called AuthSub.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.760
And AuthSub is a little
bit better,

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.630
but it's not a standard.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.930
It's a standard across what we
call GData across Google APIs,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:21.390
but that's going to be slowly
overshadowed by OAuth.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.010
So AuthSub works a little
bit better.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:24.560
AuthSub works like this.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.010
Jeff comes.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.440
I'm a service provider.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.410
You are YouTube.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.680
I'm just going to
act this out.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.660
Jeff goes to me.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.650
And I go, hey, I want to
translate all your favorite

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.085
videos into Russian, or
at least the titles.

00:15:37.085 --> 00:15:38.505
JEFF POSNICK: Yes, I do.

00:15:38.505 --> 00:15:39.850
IKAI LAN: You want this.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:43.030
So Jeff comes to me, and he
says, hey, I'll give you

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.100
access to my videos.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.590
I don't just have access
to his account.

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.450
I need to go and kick him into
YouTube, where YouTube asks

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.530
him, hey, do you trust Ikai?

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.220
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Do
you trust Ikai?

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.025
JEFF POSNICK: Pretty much.

00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:53.340
Yes.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.290
IKAI LAN: So now he throws
him back to me.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:58.260
And when YouTube throws Jeff
back to me, he gives me a

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.870
token that I can use to make
API calls on his behalf.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:03.220
And that's roughly what
AuthSub does.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.980
And OAuth is more or
less the same way.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.930
OAuth is the same thing.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.900
We call it the three-legged
flow, because

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.810
there are three legs.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.760
It's very confusing
by the way.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.790
There's a three-legged flow
where Jeff goes to me, I kick

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.340
him to YouTube, and
I say, hey, let me

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.710
access this guy's account.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.620
And YouTube says, yes,
you can access.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.020
Or Jeff says, you can access,
and YouTube gives me a token.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.290
Now, as part of this--

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.100
JEFF POSNICK: Sorry, just to
elaborate on that, everything

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.120
that we're talking about here
also takes place within the

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.420
context of a web browser.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.020
So this is all being done on
a web page that's hosted by

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.730
Google or YouTube.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.310
I think it's actually hosted
by a google.com demand.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:43.820
So you're entering your password
and username on a web

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.470
page that's hosted by Google.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.020
Or if you're already logged in
to your Google account, you

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.110
don't even have to enter any
of your credentials.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.700
It's really just clicking
Authorize or whatever.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.785
IKAI LAN: And a user comes in,
and the user sees https://.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.005
As long as you don't get a
certificate warning and ignore

00:17:00.005 --> 00:17:01.280
it like most users do--

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.550
I'm rolling my eyes--

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.339
then the user is protected
from phishing

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.009
and things like that.

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:09.220
Obviously, you're not protected
from keylogging, but

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.410
this isn't the Security GDL.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.470
Ha ha ha.

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.829
We're talking about OAuth.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.535
So OAuth takes us a little bit
further with the concept of

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.790
what's called scopes.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:22.079
As an application, if I'm
translating Jeff's videos, I

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.670
want a small scope
as possible.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.670
I really only want
read-only access.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.700
So I ask YouTube only for
read-only access.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.910
And when Jeff goes to YouTube to
authenticate, YouTube says,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.070
well, this app just wants
to look at your videos.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.050
So Jeff says, OK, well, an
application that translates my

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:40.080
favorite video titles
into Russian

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.440
doesn't need write access.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.990
Why would it need to
upload videos?

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:43.840
Why would it need to like?

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.120
Why would it need to
comment as me?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.170
It doesn't.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.010
So he can safely authenticate.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.490
And that's just one more layer
of protection OAuth provides.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.210
JEFF POSNICK: And that's
actually something that's only

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:55.070
supported in version three
of the Data API.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:57.900
Unfortunately, we didn't have
that sort of fine-grained

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.820
scopes in version one, version
two of the Data API.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.840
You kind of had to request a
scope that had full read-write

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.050
access to your YouTube
account.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.450
So that's another good reason
for the benefit of your users

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.400
to migrate to v3, in that you
could even request a minimal

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.090
set of permissions, and make
your users feel better about

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.840
what you're asking for.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.250
IKAI LAN: Let's do a quick
review of some of the things

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.640
that we've talked
about so far.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.560
And I'll review again
and again and again.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.310
So there is OAuth.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.090
There is v2 and v3.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.320
And we just talked
about scopes.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.860
So these are a lot of concepts
you'll be seeing over and over

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.550
as you're going through the
sample application in the

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:35.350
documentation.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:41.145
Now, I've left out one more type
of API which is also a

00:18:41.145 --> 00:18:43.450
very interesting type, which
is developer key

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:45.660
authentication.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.730
You need developer
key for this.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.260
You need keys for
OAuth as well.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:50.200
And you get to these
via the cloud--

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.020
or not cloud the cloud,
the API console.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.540
So I don't know the exact URL,
but you could search for

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.050
Google APIs console, and
it will come up.

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.890
JEFF POSNICK: And we've actually
had previous YouTube

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.010
Developer Live talks where we
featured the whole workflow

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:07.890
for requesting access to
these APIs and stuff.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.920
Probably on our Google+ stream,
we'll post some links

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.320
back to those old shows that you
could watch and see that.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.330
IKAI LAN: So you go to the APAC
console, and you say,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.890
give me YouTube access,
give me YouTube

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.270
Analytics API access.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.385
And they'll give you the
different keys you

00:19:20.385 --> 00:19:20.810
need to work with.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.340
Now, developer key access.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.550
Sometimes when you're writing
an application, I don't need

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.540
access to Jeff's account
or Roman's account

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.400
or Ibrahim's account.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.920
All I need is to say, search
for dog videos.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.760
And you could do this using
just developer key.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.000
We don't need the three-legged
OAuth for this.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.620
We just need developer key.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:40.160
And in v3, you can just append
this to the end of a URL, a

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.610
REST URL, and say,
give me back the

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:42.410
data, and that'll work.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.050
And you get the developer
key via the API console.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:48.100
So what do you need for working
with the YouTube API?

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.690
You need to go to
the API console.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.000
I keep leaving this out, but
that's one of the most

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.570
important things.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.550
JEFF POSNICK: So this is
actually another way that

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.490
version two and version
three differ.

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.540
In version two, we did
actually support

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.050
anonymous API access.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.170
You could use a developer key.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.320
And confusingly, it was a
different type of developer

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.485
key than what we're
talking about here

00:20:07.485 --> 00:20:09.110
from the API console.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.570
But in v2, it's optional.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.570
In v3, you do need to put a
developer key or use OAuth 2.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.315
It's an either/or situation
for all your requests.

00:20:17.315 --> 00:20:21.010
IKAI LAN: Jeff, when you used
v2 and you didn't use a key,

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.145
what were the limitations
that you would run into?

00:20:23.145 --> 00:20:25.760
JEFF POSNICK: It's basically
a quota issue.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.780
IKAI LAN: What's it quoted on?

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.120
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.990
So we--

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.070
IKAI LAN: Did you notice
there was a trap there?

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.116
I trapped you.

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:33.530
JEFF POSNICK: I'm going to
also say that we have me

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.510
talking about quota for 30
minutes in a previous GDL,

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.580
which is super, super
entertaining.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.830
It just tells you how big
an issue this is.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.310
There is like 30 minutes worth
of content to talk about.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.000
But basically, in any of our
Data APIs, there is a quota

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.050
imposed on kind of the rate of
API calls that you can make.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:56.360
And what we would do in version
one and version two,

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.000
if you were using a developer
key, there's a little bit more

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.600
accountability.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.930
And accordingly, we would grant
a slightly higher quota,

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.000
so you can make a larger number
of calls before you

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.460
start getting rate limited.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.030
We also do have quotas in
version three, slightly

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.472
different than the way
version two quotas

00:21:14.472 --> 00:21:17.256
work, though, basically.

00:21:17.256 --> 00:21:18.990
It's a way to protect from
a bunch of things.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.340
I think, Ikai, if I remember
correctly, when you were

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.170
learning Go--

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.450
I don't want to say anything
about your skills--

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.580
IKAI LAN: Oh, you can say
anything you want.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.080
JEFF POSNICK: I believe you
walked away from your desk

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.932
during lunch while you had a
loop running, and you blew

00:21:31.932 --> 00:21:32.555
through your quota.

00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:34.120
IKAI LAN: I might have
had an infinite loop.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.540
I might have had an infinite
loop running.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:35.630
Made a mistake.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.770
JEFF POSNICK: We want to partly
protect developers from

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.110
doing that sort of thing
inadvertently and sending

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.170
potentially unbounded number of

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.340
requests against our servers.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.850
Eventually, we started saying,
hey, we're going to start

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.340
rejecting these requests.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.580
IKAI LAN: So that's
another reason.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.650
That's what that developer
key is for.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.020
So again, the concept that you
need to understand when you're

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.760
working with the YouTube API
are-- or at least have some

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.990
kind of knowledge of-- are
OAuth, v2, v3, a developer

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.720
key, the API console, and
there's code samples.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.810
I think that's what you need.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.450
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.930
I think a lot of folks probably
get started using the

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.410
code samples, which is why I'm
really glad that you're

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.310
working on some.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.750
And we're going to put Ibrahim
soon to work on writing some

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.665
more code samples for v3.

00:22:19.665 --> 00:22:21.980
IKAI LAN: There's a lot of
confusion around these topics

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.500
sometimes, and that's why we
like to teach them as many

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.270
times as possible.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:27.900
So that was my spiel.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.550
I know I went on and on, but
that's what I had to say.

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:32.510
And I'm sure that over the
coming shows that I'll have a

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.510
lot more to add to this topic.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:36.000
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:36.280
That's good.

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.410
IKAI LAN: I'm sorry
for totally just

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.710
monopolizing the time.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.225
JEFF POSNICK: No, this is
exactly what I wanted to get

00:22:44.225 --> 00:22:44.770
out of the show.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.800
And Ibrahim, though, we didn't
give you too much of a chance

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.627
to ask anything.

00:22:48.627 --> 00:22:50.220
And I don't want to also put
you on the spot, but if

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.600
there's anything you wanted
to bring up from your

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.320
experience--

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.240
You've been here on the
YouTube team one

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.460
week less than Ikai.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.530
This is a little below
your third day--

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.080
third day on the team and
third day at Google.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.215
IKAI LAN: There were
vacations, too.

00:23:01.215 --> 00:23:03.250
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, there
were some vacations.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.920
So anything?

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.350
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Yeah, maybe
I will ask about--

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:10.550
you talked about the Data API,
Player API, and Analytics API.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.170
Is there a new starter
building your

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.330
own website or app.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.500
How do they all fit together
into the big picture?

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.080
How do they play handy?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.370
Or is it better to start from
one API and start using the

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.235
other ones?

00:23:23.235 --> 00:23:24.050
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.570
So they all do fit together
pretty nicely.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.270
And we do have some samples.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.040
The samples we have, for
instance, with the Analytics

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.920
API, also include making calls
to the Data API just because

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.120
you kind of have to.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.980
You need to get some information
from the Data API

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.610
first before you could use the
Analytics API effectively.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.500
You need to know what the
channel is that you're running

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.270
the Analytics API
report against.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.840
So our samples for using the
Analytics API also do show the

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.235
relevant Data API calls.

00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:56.900
IKAI LAN: So the bigger question
here is the use case.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.590
I'd like to come back from a
use case or to what kind of

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:59.860
app are you designing?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.290
Because the apps that you're
designing might not use all

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.310
three APIs.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.530
But I think that there are lots
of apps where when you

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.260
show a player, you usually want
to make data calls also.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.080
But it depends on the app
that you're building.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.770
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.300
So there are really common use
cases where you want to play

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.120
back a video but also display
metadata about that video,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.560
show the title and description,
or do a search

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.360
and have the snippets.

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.370
And all these are cases where
you're going to want to

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.680
integrate the Data API and the
Player API, or the Data API

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.500
and the Analytics API, like we
talked about, and potentially

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.690
all three within applications.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.440
I think we do a pretty good job
of having some samples out

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.510
there that show real, working
pieces of code.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.330
We maybe don't do the best job
of highlighting them directly

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.820
from the docks, so I'm not
sure that we can--

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.230
IKAI LAN: Well, let's
fix that.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.120
That's what we're here for.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:47.605
Gung ho.

00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:50.090
JEFF POSNICK: That's something
that we certainly should do.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.670
So we tend to blog
about things.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.970
And I don't know if you guys
have had a chance to go back

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.390
through our five-, six-year
archive on our--

00:24:57.390 --> 00:24:58.720
IKAI LAN: Six-year archive?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.820
JEFF POSNICK: --on our YouTube
API Developer's blog.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.090
So we certainly can't expect
everybody who's getting

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.090
started with the API to know
that we had a blog post from

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.910
three years ago in which we
talked about this cool,

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.830
open-source app that put
together all these different

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.880
APIs in a real-world fashion.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.240
So yeah.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.816
Let's work a little bit on
discovery for that, I think.

00:25:16.816 --> 00:25:19.990
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Maybe another
broad question is a new

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.490
starter, is I'm using
these APIs.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:26.070
And if I ever have some
problems, or if I think that

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.710
there's something not working,
or maybe I'm having some

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:33.080
difficulties, what's the best
way to escalate these issues

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.685
or file it back?

00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:36.545
IKAI LAN: I think you
can go to Jeff.

00:25:36.545 --> 00:25:37.940
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Or like the
fastest [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.700
IKAI LAN: Don't do that.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.190
JEFF POSNICK: Well eventually,
you're going to be the ones

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.590
answering these.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:43.530
So until that time
comes, yeah.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:47.530
So right now, we're asking most
of the questions that

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.720
come from developers
out there to go in

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.750
through Stack Overflow.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.350
That's the best place for
general questions about the

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.360
API, not really for bug
reports or for future

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.790
requests, though.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.170
So if you're in the situation
where you really just are

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:05.500
saying, hey, how do I do this in
this certain language using

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.315
the v3 Data API, that's
a great thing to

00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:08.690
ask in Stack Overflow.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.830
It's probably indicative of
the fact that our samples

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.010
aren't good enough to help you
right now, so apologies in

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:14.770
advance about that.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.490
Or just general questions about
why something isn't

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.080
working exactly as you'd expect
it, that's OK for Stack

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.820
Overflow, too.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:25.740
But then we also have a separate
issue tracker that we

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.190
use for reporting bugs or for
making future requests.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.890
And that just makes it a little
bit better for keeping

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.070
track of things on our end.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.140
We have this public thing that
we could refer to and say,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.660
hey, this is where the request
came in for this

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.375
feature in the API.

00:26:41.375 --> 00:26:44.910
We can tell the Engineering
team, hey, we have 20 people

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.180
that have starred this request,
and it's pretty

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.070
important that we
implement it.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.770
And it also just kind of plays
nicely with the Stack Overflow

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.980
community, because they have a
very large and established

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.010
community on Stack Overflow
in general.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:59.785
And they have some guidelines
as to what you should and

00:26:59.785 --> 00:27:00.330
shouldn't ask there.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.950
IKAI LAN: What's nice about
Stack Overflow, too, is that a

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.595
lot of times someone comes and
asks an API a question, and

00:27:05.595 --> 00:27:08.110
it's actually a Java question--
like how do I parse

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.080
to JSON the API returns?

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.460
You could definitely use the
client libraries, or you can

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:16.340
just use it without the client
libraries and do things raw.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.110
And that'll work
perfectly well.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.630
But you'll get back JSON and
want to say, well, how do I

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.210
parse this JSON?

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:22.560
Well, it's not really a
YouTube API question.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.430
JEFF POSNICK: Yes.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:25.970
And there's tons of folks
on Stack Overflow.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.700
Honestly, the thing I like best
about Stack Overflow is

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.840
that folks not on the core
team have been answering

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.480
YouTube API questions, which
is wonderful, because it

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.010
really does foster more
of a community.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:41.250
And it means that we don't
necessarily have to be your

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.910
only source of authoritative
answers out there.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.570
IKAI LAN: Now, I have an
add-on question to what

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.800
Ibrahim asked, which is that on
some teams at Google that

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.720
provide APIs, they also have a
Google group, which you would

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.590
use for like meta discussions.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.500
Now, Stack Overflow is good
for coding questions.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.130
It's not very good for more
general either policy

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.660
questions or hey, what's up?

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.000
So is there a place for that?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.960
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah, so
there used to be.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.100
We did have a very active
Google group, actually.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.450
So that is no longer around.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.050
We did deliberately make the
change from the Google group

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:15.550
model to Stack Overflow.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:20.150
And we did lose a little bit in
terms of being able to have

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.015
those meta discussions, have
things that aren't necessarily

00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:25.580
best fit for the future
requests or bugs

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.760
on the issue tracker.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.930
What I'd probably tell you to do
is phrase it in a way that

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.790
is more feature request-y or
buggy, and put it in the

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:35.875
public issue tracker rather
than putting it on Stack

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:39.290
Overflow in that case.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.270
We do have our YouTube for
Developers Google+ page.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.280
And occasionally, people share
things directly with us and

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.490
ask us things there.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:52.230
Not necessarily the best way
to get in touch with us,

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.330
because it is a little hard
to maintain that.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.990
We kind of deliberately made
the move towards fewer

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.110
channels for communication, so
we could focus a little bit

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.100
more on each channel and make
sure that we had as close to

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.790
100% of the things that come up
in each of those channels

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.150
addressed as possible.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.060
So it's kind of a trade-off,
but we had to make that.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.820
Maybe now that the teams are a
little bit bigger, we'll--

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.510
IKAI LAN: Well, and we're
always learning, right?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.180
We're always learning about
what model works for what,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.760
because I think Google groups is
very good for a few things.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.720
What gets really bad
is when there's

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.580
crossing of the streams--

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.430
"Ghostbusters"--

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.890
is when people start asking
coding questions on the groups

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.430
which are way better for Stack
Overflow, when people start

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.540
asking policy questions on Stack
Overflow, which you're

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.930
going to get down
voted real fast.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:38.874
JEFF POSNICK: Cool.

00:29:38.874 --> 00:29:41.235
IKAI LAN: Did you have
anything else?

00:29:41.235 --> 00:29:42.770
IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: I think
that was like my

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.000
first, beginning question.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.220
IKAI LAN: They're very, very
good ones, because I don't

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.810
think about these
things too much.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.130
So it's always good to have a
new perspective, a fresh set

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.070
of eyes on things.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.330
JEFF POSNICK: Awesome.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.635
Cool.

00:29:53.635 --> 00:29:56.830
Well, that's probably it for
the show for today then.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.910
IKAI LAN: We're running
out of time.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.260
JEFF POSNICK: I know that when I
checked the Google Moderator

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.070
queue for the show right before
the show started, we

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:04.620
didn't have any questions
from the general

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.490
community out there.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.950
So apologies if you added
a question since

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.510
this show has started.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.940
We'll try to get your question
next week, in that case.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.830
We kind of, at the end of each
show, peg the fact that Google

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.050
Developer Relations is hiring.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:25.550
YouTube Developer Relations has
obviously recently made

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:26.760
some hirings.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.100
But Google Developer Relations
in general is still hiring.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.390
And--

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.140
IKAI LAN: What locations
are we hiring in?

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.930
JEFF POSNICK: I think we're
hiring pretty globally.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.810
IKAI LAN: We're hiring in
Mountain View for sure.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:38.250
New York City, I know
we're hiring.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.700
JEFF POSNICK: Yeah.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.840
Definitely in other areas
of the globe as well.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.680
But I think the most
authoritative source for that

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.970
sort of information is
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.510
So if you're out there, and you
think you might want to do

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:57.530
what we're doing-- just sitting
around and talking--

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.810
IKAI LAN: You know what we
should do is, one of these

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.340
days, we should do a show
about what we all do.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.220
And we'll bring one guy
from every team out.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.620
I don't know how we're
going to do it here.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.695
JEFF POSNICK: A "Mr.
Rogers" type show.

00:31:08.695 --> 00:31:10.260
IKAI LAN: Let me give you
guys a sneak preview.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.810
Now, we're usually not allowed
to do this, but

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:14.530
I'm kind of a renegade.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.740
We're working on getting
a better studio.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:17.551
JEFF POSNICK: We've got to
get a censor button.

00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:19.250
IKAI LAN: We're trying to
get a better studio.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.330
Roman's pushing the big, red,
kick-him-off-the-air button.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.240
We're trying to get a better
studio space here now.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.075
In Mountain View, they have a
great studio space where they

00:31:26.075 --> 00:31:27.790
have shows where they can
put five or six people

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:28.050
comfortably.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.240
They've got multiple cameras.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.835
We've got one camera, sometimes
two in this studio.

00:31:32.835 --> 00:31:35.250
One time we should make a show
about behind-the-scenes, so

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.570
you could see how
we work here.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.090
But we are working on
getting a slightly

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.940
better studio space.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.790
Hopefully, that works
out for us.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.290
JEFF POSNICK: There you go.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:40.540
Yeah.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.082
A couple weeks ago-- for folks
who were watching, I think it

00:31:44.082 --> 00:31:45.310
was our show with
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.020
and then at the very tail-end
of the show, there was

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.175
somebody who was doing
construction work in the room

00:31:50.175 --> 00:31:50.750
right behind us.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:53.460
And it sounded exactly like
somebody was breaking into--

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.200
IKAI LAN: Was doing
construction?

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.980
JEFF POSNICK: --into a
bank vault's inlay.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.040
Well yeah, it was drilling and
a few other background noises

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.560
that hopefully will not happen
in this new studio space that

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.627
Ikai leaked.

00:32:03.627 --> 00:32:04.441
I don't know.

00:32:04.441 --> 00:32:05.720
I don't know if that qualifies
as a leak, but--

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.060
IKAI LAN: That's going to make
it to the top of CNN or Wall

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.190
Street Journal.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.160
You didn't try to
play it off as--

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.980
we intentionally put those
sounds in, because it's like

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.490
you're constructing
applications.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:17.680
Ooh.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.820
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.250
JEFF POSNICK: Now that
we have your--

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:22.935
your improv skills, right?

00:32:22.935 --> 00:32:24.960
IKAI LAN: Anyway, we've gone
away with time, now.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.360
We love talking to you guys.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.630
So hopefully, you'll join us for
the next GDL, which is--

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.190
JEFF POSNICK: I don't know.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.060
Oh, it's next Wednesday.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.940
IKAI LAN: It's next Wednesday.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.000
JEFF POSNICK: At 10:00 AM
Pacific and 1:00 PM Eastern.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.400
I do not know what the topic
is, but stay tuned probably

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.660
next Monday when we
announce them.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.550
IKAI LAN: And you'll
find these shows at

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:43.940
developers.google.com/live is
where to find a schedule.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.590

other great shows, so

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.010

00:32:48.472 --> 00:32:50.320
All right.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.240
Congratulations on getting
through your first show.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:53.930
