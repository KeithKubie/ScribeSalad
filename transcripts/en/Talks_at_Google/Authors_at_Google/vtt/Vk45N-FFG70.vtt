[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:13.110
MARTIN HELLMAN: Well, thank
you, Andre, and thank you

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.000
all for coming.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.708
Let's see, you're on
this side, Dorothie.

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.340
That's your notes.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.160
So I want to thank Google
for hosting the talk,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.720
and also for the $1 million,
that was no small thing either.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.770
Andre actually had checks
that we got at the ACM Awards

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.500
banquet last June.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.380
And as some of you may
know, Dorothie and I quickly

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.630
agreed that we were
going to devote

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.800
my half of the $1 million
prize to furthering our work

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.320
to build a more peaceful,
sustainable planet

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.530
with the initial focus being
on this new approach, which

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.830
is this book.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.770
Now, eight years ago,
I gave a talk at Google

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.760
on soaring cryptography
and nuclear weapons.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.150
I always like to do things that
kind of get people wondering.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.900
And my work then-- and
it still continues--

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.710
has been on bringing
risk analysis to bear

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.370
on the question of
nuclear deterrence.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.210
How risky is it to threaten
to destroy civilization

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.190
in an effort to
preserve the peace?

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.790
Well, my research has convinced
me it's a horrendous risk,

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.330
and that talk weight out
why, and this book also

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.950
helps to explain that.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.040
But even though that talk--

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.040
you put it on YouTube--
got roughly 10,000 views--

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.460
which is quite a lot
for an hour-long talk--

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.220
almost no one is interested
in nuclear weapons.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.740
Almost no one is interested
in war and peace,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.080
even though their lives depend
on it, and they don't know it.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.620
And so about three years
ago, Dorothie and I

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.020
decided that we were going to
take a new approach-- actually

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.060
it's an old approach.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.670
Because 35 years ago
when I shifted my work

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.410
from information security to
international security, what

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.640
got both of us interested in
this international security

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.180
wasn't wanting to save
the world initially,

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.149
it was wanting to
save our marriage.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.440
Now by the way, we just
celebrated our 50th anniversary

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.483
on Friday.

00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:14.798
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.210
But we almost didn't make it.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.210
Not in recent years, but
35 years ago, the marriage

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.154
was in some trouble.

00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:23.820
And I was so busy I
didn't even know it,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.950
but Dorothie fortunately
was watching out

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.610
and started a process that
we talk about in the book,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.740
and we'll talk about today.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.210
And so many more people
are interested in improving

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.730
their relationships than
are interested in improving

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.310
international relationships or
dealing with nuclear weapons.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.470
But as we explain in this
talk, and as the book

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.430
explains in more detail, the
two are intimately connected.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.830
And so that's why
our books subtitle

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.110
is "Creating True Love at
Home and Peace on the Planet".

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.800
Now, unless you're very unusual,
you sometimes have painful

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.800
disagreements with a
spouse, a partner, in-laws--

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.260
they'll come up in this talk--

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.620
co-workers.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.964
And how would you like to never
be in that kind of pain again?

00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:14.130
Think about it for a minute.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.740
Never be in that pain again.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.450
Well, this talk will outline
how you can accomplish that.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.940
And it describes how
we accomplish that

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.270
at least in our marriage.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.530
And it also will show
how doing that allowed

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.240
us to make a much larger
contribution to world peace

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.400
than we ever would
have thought possible.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.690
So the theme of this talk--
we had to narrow it down

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.440
to one sentence.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.280
Here it is.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.880
Your learning to compassionately
resolve personal conflicts

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.430
will help determine whether
or not civilization survives.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.000
That's big.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.900
Think about it.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.180
Your impact can be that big.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.690
Plus, you'll be happier.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.980
Now, this is a short talk
and would take a whole book

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.972
to explain that.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.680
But fortunately, we've
written that book,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.710
and Google very generously
bought a bunch from Books Inc.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.397
and has made them
available to people here.

00:04:08.397 --> 00:04:10.980
And at the end of the talk, I'll
mention how everyone else can

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.780
get a free copy of the book.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.940
But I'll leave that for then.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.899
So where does the title, "A
New Map for Relationships"

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:19.440
come from?

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.730
That's the main title.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.310
Well, the first story in
the book is all about that,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.160
and Dorothie is the
star of that story,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.110
so she's going to tell you.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.350
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: We were going
to San Francisco to an event.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.780
It was a Friday afternoon.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.470
The sun was shining
in San Francisco,

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.930
and it was just beautiful.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.940
So we thought we'd
drive up to Twin Peaks

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.760
and enjoy the
beauty of the city.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.940
And we were sitting in the
car getting ready to go,

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.350
and I pulled out the map.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.520
It was a paper map.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.720
It was that long ago.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.760
MARTIN HELLMAN: No Google Maps.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.230
DOROTHIE HELLMAN:
And I was trying

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.479
to figure out how we were
going to get from Twin Peaks

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.190
to our event.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.800
And Marty, without asking,
took the map out of my hands.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.780
And one of my pet peeves
was him doing that.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.890
He knew it would bother me.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.260
So I was furious.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.540
And so I got out of the
door, and I slammed the door,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.700
and I got out of the
car, and I huffed off.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.700
And I was just sitting there
like, I couldn't believe

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.701
he did that to me again.

00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:23.408
MARTIN HELLMAN: And
of course, I actually

00:05:23.408 --> 00:05:25.170
had forgotten that
that was her pet peeve,

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.500
or I wouldn't have done it.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.680
But I actually didn't know
what I had done at first.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.600
And so I was sitting in the
car wondering what to do.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.860
I have to admit, I was
tempted to drive off.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.050
She'd stomped off like
she was never coming back.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.610
I should drive off.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.894
It felt really stupid to just
sit there waiting for her.

00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:44.310
It felt like she
was the princess,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.730
and she would calm down, and
I was literally her attendant

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.810
in waiting.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.990
And when she came to her senses,
I would drive her someplace.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.690
But fortunately, I
did not drive off.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.580
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: So
that was very fortunate.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.920
So I got back in the car,
and Marty's reading the map

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.130
like this.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.210
He's ignoring me and
pretending like I'm not there.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.340
So this makes me even madder.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.060
So now I'm really furious.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.870
So without thinking about it,
actually I grab the map out

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.450
of Marty's hands, and
I start shredding it.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.130
I'm tearing it
into little pieces,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.610
and I'm throwing it
all over the car.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.720
And Marty's looking at me like,
I don't know what to do next.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.970
But luckily, he
started laughing.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.240
So he's laughing hysterically,
I'm shredding the map,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.630
and then I start
laughing hysterically.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.320
So then at that point
what we need to do

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.330
is we need to take all
the pieces of the map

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.620
and put it back together so
we can figure out where to go.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.390
So you can see
just a little shift

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.700
like that, Marty deciding to
laugh instead of get deeper

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.370
in the garbage of our silly
argument, changed everything.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.330
So just a small shift can
change everything, and that's

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.340
the power of compassion,
which we're really

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.980
talking about today.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.320
And as we wrote our
book, we realized

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:17.720
that this tearing up the map was
a metaphor for the whole book,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.820
that we each brought unconscious
maps to our relationship,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.970
and it kept helping
us drive off cliffs.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.890
And that it was scary
to leave the old map,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.890
because we knew that
map, but we decided

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.350
we weren't going to
keep driving off cliffs,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.469
so we had to stop and make new
maps and go new directions.

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.010
MARTIN HELLMAN: It's
amazing how much

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.170
we like holding
onto those old maps,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.080
even though they keep
taking us bad places.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.180
And the same is true
internationally.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.360
And in this talk, we have time
for just one piece of evidence,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.870
and that will be the United
States national security.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.690
In 1945, at the end
of World War II,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.550
we had not been touched
by the devastation.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.800
Europe had been devastated,
but the United States

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.100
had been inviolate during
World War II, our homeland.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.350
And in the intervening
72 years, we've

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.500
spent literally trillions
upon trillions of dollars

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.750
to improve our
national security.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.420
We've put some of our best
minds to work to maximize

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.160
the value of that investment.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.130
And let's look at where
the old map has taken us.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.710
1945, we could not be touched.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:28.030
2017, we can be destroyed
in under an hour by Russia,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.912
by China, and if North Korea
keeps doing what it's doing

00:08:31.912 --> 00:08:34.120
and we keep doing what we're
doing with North Korea--

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.390
which I'll get to in
about 10 minutes--

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.330
North Korea might be able
to take out San Francisco.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.730
Maybe the old map is
not working so well

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.160
internationally as well.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.100
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: So
the first key step

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.520
is to believe that peace is
possible, internationally

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.170
and personally.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.575
If we don't believe that peace
is possible, it won't happen.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.020
And if it never happens, society
will never see it happen,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.900
and we'll just never get there.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.600
Changes in society
depend on just a few

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.410
courageous individuals
making shifts

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.640
when societal beliefs
are mistaken or wrong

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.610
or misunderstood.

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:31.160
My grandmother was born around
1900 and when she was born,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.420
women were not allowed to
vote in the United States.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.480
Now, because of that, I've
never missed an election.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.770
And if the suffragettes hadn't
done something around 1900,

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.890
I still might not
be able to vote.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.200
Mark Twain said it very well.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.930
He said, they didn't know it
was impossible, so they did it.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.880
Marty and I know that
peace is possible,

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.180
because we transformed
a 35-year-old--

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.080
because we transformed a
turbulent marriage that

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.900
was almost on the
rocks 35 years ago

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.070
into one where we haven't
had an argument in 15 years.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.930
A marriage like that seemed
impossible from where

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:25.170
we stood there, just as
many people now believe

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.200
that world peace is impossible.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.330
The lessons we had to
learn in our marriage

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.280
were the same lessons we have
to learn internationally.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.320
If we keep getting
into wars, one of them

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.420
will escalate into
nuclear threats,

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.030
and therefore into nuclear war.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.280
We just can't afford it.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.410
That's why the key
takeaway from this talk

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.770
is Your Learning to
Compassionately Resolve

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.790
Personal Conflicts Will Help
Determine Whether Civilization

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.560
Survives.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.150
I hope you're
starting to see why

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.371
this is not an overstatement.

00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:01.120
MARTIN HELLMAN: Well,
even though it's not

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.325
an overstatement, many people
have told me-- actually,

00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:05.950
several people have
told me before they

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.720
read the book they
were very skeptical,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.210
but after reading it,
we'd made a good case.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.600
Since most of you have
not read the book,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.620
I'm going to give you two
appraisals of the book that

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.480
come from authoritative
individuals that

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.240
help to deal with this question
of how creating true love home

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.020
actually carries over to
creating peace on the planet.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.602
The first is a former Secretary
of Defense, Bill Perry.

00:11:29.602 --> 00:11:31.310
He's a colleague of
mine at Stanford now.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.160
He was Secretary of
Defense under Bill Clinton.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.990
And he calls the book truly
unique, and recommends quote,

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.600
"That it should be read by
couples seeking peace at home

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.650
as well as by diplomats
seeking peace in the world."

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.310
Karl Eikenberry, who
was a three-star general

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.440
in Afghanistan, led
the coalition troops,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.200
and then later under President
Obama was our ambassador

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.360
to Afghanistan--

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.880
also now a colleague of mine
at Stanford-- read the book

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.310
and calls it quote, "The
most thoughtful, unique,

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.140
and fascinating
book I've ever read

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.260
on personal and
international diplomacy."

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.690
So skepticism is
understandable, but I

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:11.100
hope quotes like that will help
you get over the skepticism,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.850
or at least get you
to read it on your own

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.424
and form your own opinion.

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:17.590
I'm just going to move these
over just a little bit.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.800
Now, how we respond to
conflict at the personal level

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.760
determines how we
as a nation respond

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.450
to conflict on the
international stage.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.200
How can anyone be at
war with their spouse,

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.350
with colleagues at work,
and say with a straight face

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.840
that peace is
possible in the world?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.650
It just doesn't work.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.540
It's much easier to
call for world peace--

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.100
I want world peace--

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.009
than it is to create
peace at home.

00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:50.550
I know that from
personal experience.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.470
It's also the most
rewarding thing I ever did,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.950
so it was worth
all that hard work.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.100
For anyone who wants
to improve the world,

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.160
personal relationships
are the testing ground

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.130
for that larger vision.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.270
Conversely, because we have
transformed our marriage from--

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.580
I sometimes say we
fought all the time,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.160
and Dorothie would object.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.070
So we changed it,
frequent fights.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:17.360
Is that OK?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.600
Frequent fights, to one where
as Dorothie has pointed out,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.456
fights are now a
nightmare of the past.

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:23.830
I didn't think
that was possible,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.930
and I have to give her full
credit for that vision,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.970
and of dragging me
through this process,

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.330
at times kicking and screaming.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.300
And now I'm really grateful.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.000
I didn't think a marriage where
you don't fight was possible.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.046
We still disagree, by the
way, about a lot of things.

00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:42.170
We learn a lot from each
other because we disagree.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.545
But what's the
point in fighting?

00:13:43.545 --> 00:13:46.280
When did yelling at her
ever get me what I wanted?

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.530
And yet in the old map,
that's what I kept doing.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:52.010
That's one of the cliffs
that we kept driving off.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.680
Our marriage became a laboratory
in which we carried out

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.200
repeated experiments
for learning

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.730
how adversaries might
solve what appear

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.400
to be insoluble conflicts.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:08.610
So having achieved true peace
in what had been an extremely

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.150
turbulent marriage, we
can say with conviction

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.760
that peace is possible
at the world level,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.805
because we as Dorothie said,
it was inconceivable to us--

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:21.180
or at least to
me-- that we could

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.250
have this kind of
relationship, just as it's

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.590
inconceivable to
most people today

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.440
that we could have peace
at the world of level.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.630
They didn't know it was
impossible, so they did it.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.324
So now, you're going to
tell them about my parents.

00:14:37.324 --> 00:14:39.740
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: I'm going
to tell a story about how just

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.690
one person can make a shift.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.680
There's always the
question, OK, if there are

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.930
two of you working, it's good.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.200
But how about if
there's only one?

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.415
Well, I'm going to tell you
a story about my in-laws.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.970
Marty comes from a Jewish
family, and I don't.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.330
And his parents
were very concerned

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.540
about him marrying
outside the faith.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.040
So I know I had this problem.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.000
So when I met his parents,
they were pretty nice to me.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.110
But the day after
I met his father,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.360
we were talking in
the kitchen, and he

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.650
said, Dorothie, you
remind me of my mother.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.050
And I said, why,
thank you very much.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.050
And he said, I never
liked my mother.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:28.070
We didn't get along.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.430
So now I've got a problem.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.180
So this continued, and
it was so painful for me

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.800
that I tried different things.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:48.540
I tried taking Valium,
that didn't work.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:50.290
Somebody at one of
these talks suggested

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:56.290
that I should have given them
Valium, that didn't work.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.810
So eventually I
stopped going, just

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.050
because it wrecked the whole--

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.190
my children should have a good
visit with their grandchildren.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:15.200
So what I decided
to do was I decided

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.500
to go with total compassion.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.730
And I was going to
visit, and my whole goal

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.890
was to make them feel loved.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.830
And nothing they said had
anything to do with me.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.090
It was totally irrelevant.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.160
And it totally worked.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.950
They felt totally loved by me.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.770
They felt that I made
this huge change,

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.900
and they felt that all the
problems in our relationship

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.260
had shifted.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.020
And even the Jewish
part went away.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.870
So compassion is a power tool.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.000
That's what I'd say about that.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.040
And if you think about
it, in the old map,

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.380
Dorothie taking
full responsibility

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:57.420
and not worrying about
what my parents said

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.080
and deciding that the visit was
a success if my parents felt

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.960
loved by her no matter
what they said or did,

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.750
she'd be seen as a
wimp in the old map.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.579
And yet you can see
from the results

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:09.810
that she was far from a wimp.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.119
Compassion gave her
tremendous power.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.740
So the old map and the new map
are really totally different,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.781
and it's hard to understand
the new map until you

00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:18.119
start experimenting with it.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.859
I know that was true for me.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.800
I now do things that would
have seemed crazy to me

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.530
35 years ago, and they
work out wonderfully.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.530
So what about
internationally, though?

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.810
OK, we've just seen
how sometimes it

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.775
only takes one party to
a conflict to resolve

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:35.650
an interpersonal one.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.330
But what about internationally?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.180
How can the United
States resolve

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:46.210
the conflict we have with
nations like North Korea, Iran,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.260
Russia?

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.030
I mean, those seem impossible.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.770
They have to change, don't they?

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:58.690
Well, in the book we have seven
international case studies,

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.989
including those three nations.

00:17:59.989 --> 00:18:02.030
There are four other
nations that are dealt with.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.731
In this talk, we just
have time for one.

00:18:03.731 --> 00:18:05.230
So I'm going to
take what's probably

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.120
the hardest one, North Korea.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:17.170
North Korea probably wouldn't
have any nuclear weapons today

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.320
if President Bush hadn't
torn up a nuclear agreement

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.020
that we had with them in 2002.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.660
That agreement kept them
from extracting plutonium.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.370
It protected their
plutonium stockpile.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.036
It was under international
lock and key.

00:18:30.036 --> 00:18:33.290
When he tore it up, they
kicked the inspectors out,

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.720
and they started
extracting plutonium.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.570
And four years later,
they did their first test.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.137
Now, this is so contrary to
what you read in the media,

00:18:42.137 --> 00:18:43.970
that when you read that
section of the book,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.700
you notice lots of
little numbered endnotes.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.450
They were kind of
unobtrusive that way.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.260
But if you want to see the
source documents that back this

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.440
up, you go to the end of the
book, and you can find them.

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.720
And in fact, if you go online to
the book's website anewmap.com

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.000
and then you add slash
notes, all of those notes

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.170
are repeated online
with clickable links

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.190
where appropriate.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.830
And so if you want to see some
of these top secret Documents

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.380
with the top secret crossed
out, now declassified,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.790
you can see that.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.460
But in this talk, I'll
just mention something

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.640
as backup for that statement.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.260
I'll read from a paper written
by a former director of Los

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.290
Alamos Nuclear
Weapons Laboratory.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.190
Not a peacenik.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.180
He's now a colleague of
mine, Dr. Siegfried Hecker.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.360
And he's visited North
Korea seven times

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.820
on what are known as track
two diplomatic missions.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.380
So he has firsthand
information on this country,

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.530
as well as knowing nuclear
weapons really well.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.110
In fact, the joke
about Sieg is he

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.370
hasn't met a phase of
plutonium he doesn't like.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.170
He's a chemical
engineer by training,

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:52.700
and plutonium is his specialty.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.200
And plutonium is
really interesting,

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.575
he's explained a
bit of it to me.

00:19:55.575 --> 00:19:58.755
But here's what he wrote to
back up what I just said.

00:19:58.755 --> 00:20:01.430
"Our nuclear agreement
with North Korea

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.000
was opposed immediately by
many in Congress who believed

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.220
that it rewarded bad behavior."

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.010
if that sounds like what's
going on now with Iran,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.480
that's a good reason for it.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.820
"Congress failed to
appropriate funds

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.120
for key provisions of the
pact, causing the United States

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.280
to fall behind in
its commitments

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.870
almost from the beginning."

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.030
You don't read about
that very much.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.760
"In 2002, the Bush
administration

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.840
killed the agreed framework for
domestic political reasons."

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.000
End of quote from
Hecker's paper.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.130
But the end note has a
link to the entire paper,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.140
if you want to read it.

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.760
So as I said, in
response, North Korea

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.820
kicked out the inspectors who
were guarding their plutonium

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.160
stockpile, and they did
their first nuclear test

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.290
four years later.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.270
Now, our book section
on North Korea

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.450
goes further and explains why
North Korea would probably

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.140
have over 100 nuclear
weapons today if it

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.790
hadn't been for that agreement.

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:59.420
Even though Bush abrogated
the agreement in 2002,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.190
it was enforced for
eight years, and it

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.020
had some really
beneficial effects for us.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.990
Again, you don't read
about that in the media.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:10.070
And so the reason they'd have
probably 100 nuclear warheads

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:15.740
or more, in 1994 when that
agreement went into effect,

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.160
they were a year or two away
from completing a large nuclear

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.770
reactor that would have
made enough plutonium--

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.590
and very good
plutonium, by the way--

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.570
enough plutonium for
about 10 bombs a year.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.530
So let's say it's finished in
1996, 21 years have elapsed.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.864
They'd have enough
plutonium for 210 warheads.

00:21:33.864 --> 00:21:35.780
Instead, they just have
a very small plutonium

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:40.520
stockpile from a much smaller
reactor 1/10 the size of that.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.580
And in fact, not only did
they stop construction

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.450
of that larger reactor
under the nuclear agreement

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.490
that we had with
them, but it started

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.280
to rust so badly from exposure
to the elements in the eight

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.670
years that the agreement
was in force that--

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.450
Hecker was there in
his last visit in 2010,

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.120
he told me he saw cranes that
were having to dismantle it,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.494
because it was
going to fall down

00:22:04.494 --> 00:22:06.030
from exposure to the elements.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.780
And so when he gave
a guest lecture

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.160
in a seminar around a
nuclear weapons risk and hope

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.500
at Stanford, on
North Korea he made

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.720
a column A, what we got
from nuclear diplomacy

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.160
with North Korea, and
column B, what they got.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.750
And if you look at
the two columns,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.300
we got more from nuclear
diplomacy with North Korea

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.440
than they did.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.600
And again, that's very
contrary to the impression

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.140
you get from reading the media.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.480
And so it's important to go
back and get at the facts

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.830
and avoid the fake news.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.380
So internationally, as
well as interpersonally,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:51.540
it's often possible
for us to make progress

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.000
on resolving a conflict when
it seems like the other side's

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.900
not interested.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.316
I mean, that same thing happened
here in our relationship.

00:22:57.316 --> 00:22:59.634
So many times, I felt
like I was doing all--

00:22:59.634 --> 00:23:00.300
I mean, earlier.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.840
Not the last 10,
15, even 20 years.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.539
But 25 years ago, I
remember I was so mad at her

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:08.580
at times, because I was
doing all this hard work.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.730
I was committed to doing it, and
she wasn't doing a damn thing.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.800
Guess how she felt?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.910
The mirror image.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.790
It felt to her like she
was doing all of it,

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.330
because you don't realize
when the other person is

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.163
doing the hard work.

00:23:19.163 --> 00:23:21.300
They're just doing what
they should be doing.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:25.080
But the same is true
internationally in many cases.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:29.280
There's another example of one
party to a conflict starting

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.560
a process of reconciliation.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.110
And this one is
particularly nice for here

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.310
at Google, because it
involves cryptography.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.740
And it's also nice, because
I was one of the parties

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.660
to the conflict,
but I wasn't the one

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.760
who initiated the resolution.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.820
It was the director of NSA at
the time, Admiral Bobby Inman.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.800
This was 1978.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.630
So as some of you know--

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.820
but background for
the rest of you--

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.186
in the 1970s, I was
at war with NSA.

00:23:56.186 --> 00:23:58.310
There were a number of
reasons, but I'll focus here

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.850
on publishing my papers
on cryptography, including

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.580
the one which was cited
in the Turing Award--

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.080
"New Directions
in Cryptography",

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.110
which appeared in November 1976.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:16.610
NSA took the position that
research in cryptography

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.120
was born classified,
meaning that even though I

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.220
had no benefit of
classified information,

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.240
nor did Whit Diffie
in writing that paper,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.630
the NSA had the right
to stop its publication.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.490
And I was in
violation of the law,

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.070
and could be prosecuted
and even thrown in jail

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.200
for publishing it in
international journals,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.380
because it was then
being exported.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.370
Well, I fought back.

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:45.200
I'm from the Bronx,
and I fought back.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.870
Dorothie was very grateful when
it became big news, because she

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.160
said, now if something
happens to you,

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.480
there will be an investigation.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:54.440
But we never talked directly.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.870
We were fighting it
out in the press.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.780
And of course we
didn't get very far.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.140
Until 1978-- so several
years into the fight--

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.300
I get a call at my
office at Stanford,

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.000
and it's from the
director's office at NSA,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.630
and they tell me that the
director Admiral Bobby Inman is

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.610
going to be in California
in a couple of weeks,

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.610
and would I be willing
to meet with him?

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.124
Well, I jumped at
the opportunity.

00:25:18.124 --> 00:25:20.290
I mean, him and I were
fighting it out in the press.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.040
And a couple of weeks later,
Inman shows up at my office,

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:27.010
and he told me that
he was meeting with me

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.800
against the advice of all
the other senior people

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.409
at the agency.

00:25:31.409 --> 00:25:32.950
And these are the
key words, he said,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.400
but I don't see the
harm in talking.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.590
Now, what's our position
with North Korea today?

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.420
We're not going to talk to
them unless it's about their

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.860
getting rid of their weapons.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.080
What's the harm in talking?

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.510
But coming back to Inman,
he told me another thing.

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.220
He looked over at
me and he said,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.010
nice to see you
don't have horns.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.750
That's how I was being
portrayed at NSA.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.730
And I can understand why
they saw it that way.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.030
And I looked back at him
and I said, same here.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.560
Because I had been portraying--

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.390
I'd been demonizing
nSA I mean, they

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.250
were threatening to
throw me in jail.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.560
Some people told me my wife
might even be in danger.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.040
Maybe not from them, but from
their foreign equivalents.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.800
And it was nice to
really see a human being

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.790
and stop the
demonization process.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.670
And from that initial meeting,
which was very cautious,

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.440
our relationship
grew to the point

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.140
that we now regard
each other as friends.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:32.710
And that relationship,
that friendship,

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.350
played a role and
maybe even a key role,

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:42.430
in liberalizing the export
regime for encryption,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.660
so that today products that
we use on our smartphones,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.260
on our computers, can have
relatively strong encryption

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.470
that was impossible in 1978.

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:56.470
And so there was a really
positive outcome from what's

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:57.520
the harm in talking.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.600
And I think we need to take that
to heart both internationally

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.420
like with North Korea, and
certainly it played a big role

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:07.850
in this relationship.

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.970
Well, there's a lot
more that could be said,

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:12.250
but that's why we have the book.

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.990
We don't have 10
hours for the talk,

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.452
so we hope you'll read the book.

00:27:16.452 --> 00:27:18.160
There are copies in
the back of the room,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.330
and we thank Google for making
them available free of charge

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.800
to those of you here.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:27.520
The rest of you out there,
gee, how do we get free books?

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:28.780
Well, it's really easy.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:32.160
You go to the book's
website, anewmap.com.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.240
So that's the first
three words of the title,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.090
a new map, run
together, dot com.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.480
Go to the Get The Book tab,
and there's a link there

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.460
for getting a free PDF.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.830
We can't give everybody
free hardcopies,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.440
but you can download a free PDF.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.710
And it also has links to
Amazon and Barnes Noble

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.120
so you can order it that way.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.570
Let's end by returning
to the key takeaway

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.150
that we want you to
get from this talk.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.450
Your Learning o Compassionately
Resolve Personal Conflicts

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:05.450
Will Help Determine Whether
Civilization Survives.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.620
And here I'm going to go to
former Supreme Court Justice

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.930
Sandra Day O'Connor,
the first woman

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.240
to serve on the Supreme Court.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.530
It turns out she and Dorothie
and I share a common mentor,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.210
a common teacher.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.390
His name was professor
Harry Rathbun.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:27.500
He was born in the
1890s, died in the 1980s.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.600
So he was into his own 90s.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.720
He lived to I think
93, 94 years of age.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:37.760
And Justice O'Connor
knew him around 1950

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.520
when she was an
undergraduate at Stanford.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.700
Dorothie and I knew
Harry in the 1980s

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.000
toward the end of his life.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.300
And here's what
Justice O'Connor wrote

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.970
in a letter encouraging
Stanford students to work

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.610
with me on a related project,
because we both had learned so

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.320
much from Harry she
was willing to write

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:59.890
this letter encouraging
them to work on a project.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:01.540
And here's the quote
from the letter.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.570
"When I was an undergraduate
at Stanford University,

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.540
Professor Harry Rathbun
repeatedly emphasized to me

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.370
that a single caring
individual could

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.770
make a difference
in this huge world,

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.190
and might even help determine
the course of events."

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.310
You can see that relating to
the takeaway from this talk.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.130
"I had not heard that before,
but he put it forward so

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.840
persuasively, that
many of us came

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:26.290
to believe it might be true,
and to take seriously the notion

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.820
that we could make a difference.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.390
I can now say unequivocally
that he was right."

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:35.420
End of quote from
Justice O'Connor.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.270
So Dorothie and I
fully agree, and we're

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.430
going to end this
part of the talk

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.330
with one of Harry's pearls of
wisdom that I'll never forget.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.630
And he summarized it by,
"Why not assume the nobler

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.520
hypothesis?"

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.970
Well, in this situation,
there are two hypotheses.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.940
The nobler hypothesis
is that we human beings

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.010
are capable of radical
change so that we

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.190
can have true love
in our relationships

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:04.820
even 50 years into them,
and we can bring peace

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:07.190
to the planet, as impossible
as that might seem.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.790
That's the nobler hypothesis.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:13.340
The less noble hypothesis,
which is prevalent in society,

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.900
is that that's impossible.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.440
Well, Harry pointed out,
if we accept the less noble

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.980
hypothesis, we're doomed,
even if we were capable

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:25.680
of radical change, because
we won't be motivated,

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.150
we won't think we can
make a difference.

00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:31.110
They knew it was impossible,
they didn't do it.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.909
And we're going to go down in
a nuclear war at some point

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:35.700
in time, because it's
only a matter of time

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.930
before one of these needless
wars escalates out of control.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.300
The nobler hypothesis
is that we are

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.820
capable of that radical change.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.570
And the worst that happens if
we accept the nobler hypothesis

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.700
is that we go down fighting.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.999
And we might.

00:30:51.999 --> 00:30:53.040
In fact, more than might.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.830
I think we have a good
chance of actually making it

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.420
as a civilization.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.190
So I can still see
Harry telling me

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.040
this toward the end of his
life with a twinkle in his eye.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:06.780
He said, "Why not assume
that nobler hypothesis?"

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.160
Indeed, why not?

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.150
So let's see, there's
one more thing.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.900
That's really the end
of the call to action.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.770
But now if you agree and want to
do something, what can you do?

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.560
So I've got a small list here,
but I need to turn the page.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.430
Well, read the book.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.642
That would be a great start.

00:31:27.642 --> 00:31:29.100
Or at least start
to read the book.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.016
If you don't like it,
give it to someone else.

00:31:31.016 --> 00:31:32.520
If you like it, read the thing.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.010
If you like it, get
another copy and give it

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.240
to friends or family.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.570
Oh, we also have cards that
we'll put out on the table

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.539
up here.

00:31:40.539 --> 00:31:41.580
They're very inexpensive.

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:42.954
They cost a couple
of cents each,

00:31:42.954 --> 00:31:45.780
with the name of the book, the
website, and an email address.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.841
If you want to take
five or 10 of them,

00:31:47.841 --> 00:31:50.340
if you have five or 10 friends
that you'd recommend the book

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.950
to.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.510
And recommend they
download the PDF,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:58.120
and the website will
allow them to do that.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.870
If you'd like to
continue this discussion,

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.120
if you want to play
a more direct role,

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.664
email us at the email
address on that card and say,

00:32:04.664 --> 00:32:05.830
hey, I want to get involved.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:06.680
What can I do?

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.010
And we'll figure something out.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:11.350
If you do those
things, you'll not only

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:14.110
help to make the
world a better place,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.010
your life will get
better as well.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.050
So we hope you'll join us.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.035
Thank you very much.

00:32:20.035 --> 00:32:22.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.680
So now we go to questions.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.200
AUDIENCE: One can gain
tremendous satisfaction

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.180
from telling other people
that they're wrong,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:34.450
and this sort of
pursuit of truth

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.930
is something that's
counterproductive I think

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.060
in a lot of heated
discussions in a relationship

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.720
or political disagreement.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.720
Is there any way to
have that satisfaction

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:52.390
of proving the facts
and still reconcile

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.220
with the opposing party?

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.886
MARTIN HELLMAN: Tell
them about the card

00:32:55.886 --> 00:32:57.157
you put on our bedroom door.

00:32:57.157 --> 00:32:59.740
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: You can either
be right or you can be happy.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.460
MARTIN HELLMAN: There's another
thing that I would add to that.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.104
She actually had a card.

00:33:08.104 --> 00:33:09.520
She saw it, found
it in the store,

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.980
and bought it, and taped it
to the door to our bedroom.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.090
Every time I walked in and
out, I had to see that.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.930
And as a Stanford professor,
I used to want to be right.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.070
Now I'd rather be happy.

00:33:21.247 --> 00:33:23.080
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: What's
really important is

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:28.120
to understand the joy of coming
to an understanding together

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.740
of something that works
right for everybody.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.380
That joy is so much more
than the joy of being right,

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.600
for everybody to be right.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.780
So that's what I'd
say about that.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.280
AUDIENCE: I was wondering with
the Republican and Democratic

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.480
parties, you know, labeling
everything as fake news.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.150
There seems to be no path
towards reconciliation

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:51.160
under what's
currently happening.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.469
What do you think would be best
to move that situation forward?

00:33:55.469 --> 00:33:57.010
DOROTHIE HELLMAN:
What are you doing?

00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.968
MARTIN HELLMAN: I just
happened to bring a copy

00:33:58.968 --> 00:34:02.660
of "Time Magazine" with me.

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.690
The fake news is
primarily being--

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.690
well, let's see, depending
which side you're on.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.790
I mean, it all surrounds
President Trump

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.000
and whether he's got fake news
or whether the news about him

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.694
is fake.

00:34:13.694 --> 00:34:16.360
It's important to recognize that
most of the news you're reading

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.348
internationally is fake news.

00:34:19.348 --> 00:34:20.389
I'll give you an example.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.560
This is I think the current
issue of "Time Magazine",

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.340
and it's got five essays
on North Korea in it.

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:28.929
And one of them says--

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.989
this is written by a former
Undersecretary of State

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:39.679
for Political Affairs
and another person.

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:43.340
"Successive US administrations
have tried various strategies

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.409
to thwart the
dangerous trajectory

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.239
of the North Korean regime.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:51.320
Some have made progress, only
to be set back by North Korean

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.989
perfidy by changes
in policy directions

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:57.350
and by cautious partners
and allies in the region."

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:01.750
Now notice, while they
do say several things,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.410
the one you remember is
North Korea's bad behavior.

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:06.487
And yet go back, the
other ones are actually

00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:08.070
more important from
our point of view,

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:10.010
because that's
where we have power.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:13.880
And I mean, the
basic impression I

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.084
get from reading about
North Korea in the media,

00:35:16.084 --> 00:35:17.750
including "The New
York Times" and "Time

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.510
Magazine" and the
more progressive side

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.320
is that it's a waste of time
doing new diplomacy with North

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.220
Korea.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.730
They delay, all
the time cheating,

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.500
even if there's no
cheating to be done,

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.000
and then when you
have an agreement,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.980
they cheat, and
then they blackmail.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.920
Well, compare that with
what I told you today,

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.310
and which you can
verify on your own.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.020
And if you find that
I'm wrong in any way

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.360
or have any questions, email me.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.220
And I'll be happy to
find out about that.

00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.240
But I think you'll
find that it's right.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.130
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: There
is something else.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.050
It's a mess, but when Trump
comes up with something

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:57.830
true, like we're not
so good after all,

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:03.410
everybody jumps all over him and
says, how could you say that?

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.360
So we're not ready
for Prime Time.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.800
MARTIN HELLMAN: Right,
that was when he was saying

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.960
something positive about Putin.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.370
I think it was Fox News, even.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.130
The interviewer said,
but Putin is a murderer.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:19.290
And he said, well, we're
not so innocent either.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:23.550
And both left and right
jumped on him about that.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:25.326
The only place we
can really stop

00:36:25.326 --> 00:36:26.700
the needless
killing in the world

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:28.116
is where we're
responsible for it.

00:36:28.116 --> 00:36:29.664
That's where we
have direct control.

00:36:29.664 --> 00:36:31.080
And there's been
a lot of needless

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.000
killing that we've done.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.550
But yet, as Dorothie said,
he gets jumped on for that.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.240
Other?

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.790
AUDIENCE: The world seems
to be in some conflict

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.770
with the natural world as well.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.930
Does your set of principles
apply to the nonhuman

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.309
organisms on this planet?

00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:52.350
MARTIN HELLMAN: Sure,
things like global warming,

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.780
environmental degradation?

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.180
Yeah, the group that we
got involved with back

00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.310
in 1980-- which by the
way, doesn't exist anymore,

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.430
so we're not trying to
recruit for that group.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:02.610
Plus we left it.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.340
Dorothie left in '87
and I left in '88--

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:08.220
started with
environmental issues.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.250
That was 1980.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:12.810
1981, Reagan became president
and brought the nuclear threat

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:16.740
into sharp focus for us,
just as Trump is doing that

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.700
for many people today.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.040
So that's another positive
to the Trump presidency.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.200
The world was
dangerous under Carter,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.600
the world was dangerous under
Obama, but only under Trump,

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:29.250
only under Reagan did it
become clear to the public.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.190
And we realized that the
greatest environmental threat

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.057
of all was a nuclear war.

00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:35.640
And that's where we
shifted our energy

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.680
from environmental
degradation in general

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.540
to nuclear war in particular.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.340
And as we researched
nuclear war,

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.090
we concluded you couldn't deal
with nuclear war in isolation.

00:37:45.090 --> 00:37:47.550
You had to deal with
the whole war system,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.790
that North Korea, for example,
thought nuclear weapons, partly

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.880
because it feared conventional
attack by the United States,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.950
which was much more powerful.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.920
And so it definitely applies
to those other issues as well.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.586
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: And
the same principle

00:38:00.586 --> 00:38:03.810
is needed too to
get away from war.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.700
The same principles we need
to address global warming

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:13.531
and all global issues.

00:38:13.531 --> 00:38:15.280
MARTIN HELLMAN: And
so we didn't have time

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.350
to go into-- we talked
about compassion.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:21.250
The other approach to looking
at is holistic thinking.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:23.740
We had to seek solutions
that worked for both of us.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.660
We need as a nation
to seek solutions

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.130
that work for the whole world.

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:29.560
And just as we found
out that giving up

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.540
what we thought we
wanted and seeking

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.114
those holistic solutions
usually produced things

00:38:34.114 --> 00:38:36.280
that were better for me and
better for her than what

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.810
we thought we wanted
going into it,

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:41.440
the same would be true for the
United States internationally.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.360
AUDIENCE: So I'm
trying to put together

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.500
the take home from this talk.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.880
And I could sort of see
it with relationships,

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:55.480
you know, assume my wife is
well-meaning and understanding

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:58.750
and she wants the best and I
do, and we can work it out.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:02.950
But I'm having trouble with that
same idea with al-Qaeda, North

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.385
Korea, et cetera.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.920
Are there people who are
evil and want our demise?

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.620
Are you saying yes,
maybe there are,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.330
but we should talk to them
anyway, and it'll work out?

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.870
But practically speaking,
what is the take

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.560
home with difficult situations
where people don't have

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.180
our best interest at heart.

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:27.790
MARTIN HELLMAN: Good question.

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.565
Well, we've already dealt with
North Korea, to some extent.

00:39:31.565 --> 00:39:33.523
AUDIENCE: All I've heard
is that we should talk

00:39:33.523 --> 00:39:35.200
to them, practically speaking.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.700
MARTIN HELLMAN: And we should
recognize mistakes we've made.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.780
Instead of accepting the--

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.430
the societal belief
in America is

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.232
that it's all North
Korea's fault.

00:39:44.232 --> 00:39:46.690
And if you read the North Korean
section of the book, which

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.252
would take you
five to 10 minutes,

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:50.210
you'll come away with a
very different picture.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.670
And then go to the
sources and see

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.940
if I'm wrong about anything.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.170
But let's take al-Qaeda,
which is harder--

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.350
I mean, to the
extent that al-Qaeda

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.720
seems largely responsible
for September 11, what

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.240
a horrible, horrible thing.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.000
Well, it helps to try to
understand their perspective.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.500
You don't necessarily
agree with it.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.150
But it helps to understand
the perspective,

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.608
and we'll be able to combat
them more effectively if we do,

00:40:12.608 --> 00:40:14.800
rather than just
demonizing them.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.240
Turns out, Osama bin Laden
felt that the United States

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.540
was responsible for 4 million
Muslim deaths, including

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:23.980
many children.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.730
He blames both us directly for
the Iraq war and the sanctions

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.470
that followed, but also
our support for Israel

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.767
and how that has affected.

00:40:33.767 --> 00:40:35.350
He may be wrong on
the numbers, but he

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.360
does have a legitimate
point there,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:42.340
that we have not been adequately
concerned with Muslim deaths.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:44.680
And he then goes to an
eye for an eye and a tooth

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.570
for a tooth, which
I disagree with.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.079
But if we would understand
instead of just demonizing him,

00:40:50.079 --> 00:40:52.120
if we would try to understand
where he came from,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:55.660
it might help us to realize
where we could pull back

00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.210
in the world, where we're
caught we're actually

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.350
creating more jihadists.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.350
It's often said when we
have a drone strike that

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.280
kills innocent civilians, you
may take out one jihadist,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.600
but you create 10 more.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.140
We need to look at that.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.515
DOROTHIE HELLMAN:
The other thing

00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:17.710
that we really don't consider is
that they really want to be OK.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.730
They want to survive.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:23.750
We've taken out a lot of
what we call bad actors.

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:26.710
We've killed a lot of
leaders because they

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.910
didn't follow our rules.

00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:33.640
And I think that if you
look at North Korea,

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.270
they're not very happy
to be playing with us,

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.736
because we don't play
by very good rules.

00:41:40.736 --> 00:41:42.610
And so I think you need
to consider that when

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.859
you think that they're willing
to deal with us at all.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.600
Yeah, I think we
need to talk to them

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.590
and treat them as if they
have a right to do their thing

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.512
their way.

00:41:57.512 --> 00:41:59.220
MARTIN HELLMAN: Not
here, but over there.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.042
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: Right.

00:42:01.042 --> 00:42:02.250
And I don't think we do that.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.560
Do you?

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.360
MARTIN HELLMAN: Well,
one of the things

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:09.030
we say in the book is we're
out for regime change in North

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.840
Korea.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.754
I mean, we don't often
put it that bluntly,

00:42:11.754 --> 00:42:13.170
but if you think
about it, and you

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.044
look at how we've done
regime change in Iraq,

00:42:15.044 --> 00:42:18.120
regime change in Libya, and
we're trying to do it in Syria,

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.890
you can see where the
North Koreans would

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:21.780
believe that we're out
for regime change there.

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.610
And if you study it, you'll
see that we really want it,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.230
and the sanctions
are partly intended

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.540
to cripple the regime
economically and produce

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.890
a revolution.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:30.570
Now, regime change
in North Korea,

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.737
let's imagine Kim Jong Un.

00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:35.070
What does regime change going
to mean for you personally

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.520
in your life?

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.140
You're going to die.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.090
So as long as we're
out for regime change,

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:44.390
the only way you can counter
us is with nuclear weapons

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.420
and ballistic missiles.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:48.460
Now, I don't like the
regime over there,

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.900
but we have a decision to make.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.720
Are we going to give up on
regime change in North Korea

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.971
and then have some hope of
reigning in their programs,

00:42:54.971 --> 00:42:57.345
or are we going to keep going
for regime change, in which

00:42:57.345 --> 00:42:59.140
case there's no
way they're going

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.060
to give up their programs?

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.310
And we made it
harder, by the way.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.100
And this is in the North
Korea section of the book.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.420
In 2003, Gaddafi gave up
his nuclear weapons program.

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.204
President Bush, in a speech
that's on the State Department

00:43:13.204 --> 00:43:15.370
website-- so you don't have
to take my word for it--

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.470
welcomed him into
the family of nations

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.410
and said his good
behavior will be rewarded.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.380
In 2011, when we helped
get the guy murdered,

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.849
North Korea put out a press
release that said, yeah,

00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:26.890
we've learned our lesson.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:28.660
That's how you
reward good behavior.

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.360
So it's not to
overlook the danger

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.650
that these people post to us.

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.090
It's not to become
some Pollyanna.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.240
But it's to start getting
beyond our fears, our anger,

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.367
and our hatred, and dealing
with it more objectively.

00:43:41.367 --> 00:43:43.700
And by the way, the other
thing you have to worry about,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.320
this new map is not
going to take over

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.640
the nation all at once.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.260
And so even if we
were Pollyannas,

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.530
you wouldn't have to worry about
things changing immediately.

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:53.690
And as it started
to gain traction,

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.810
then you could see whether
we need to pull back.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.090
Another question in the back.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.970
AUDIENCE: How do you maintain
peace in your marriage now,

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.430
and do you have a daily
or weekly practice that

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:04.930
helps to maintain that?

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:09.640
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: We practice
positive, unconditional regard.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:16.000
We know that the other person
has their best intent for us,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.910
and we practice compassion.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:25.130
And we spend a lot of
time telling each other

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.300
how much we love each other.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:32.360
We spend little moments with
each other when we're away.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.130
We call each other
and remind each other

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:38.122
that we love each other, and
we're grateful for each other.

00:44:38.122 --> 00:44:39.160
Would you add anything?

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.035
MARTIN HELLMAN: Yeah.

00:44:40.035 --> 00:44:43.150
So one of the short
takeaways in the book

00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:45.700
is get curious, not furious.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.250
It used to be when she did
things that I didn't like,

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:49.930
I'd get angry at her.

00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:54.100
I'd yell at her, which
then started a cycle

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.410
of psychological violence.

00:44:56.410 --> 00:44:59.046
Now, when she's doing something
that seems strange or crazy

00:44:59.046 --> 00:45:00.170
to me, I ask her questions.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.470
And there's a story in
the book about a new car

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.030
2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.230
Our two cars at that
point were three years old

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.260
and six years old,
and we typically

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.850
keep the cars for 10, 15 years.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.980
And so this crazy woman
is looking at new cars.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.932
And the only thing--

00:45:15.932 --> 00:45:17.140
I mean, that's how it seemed.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.310
I mean, I knew she wasn't crazy.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.768
But I couldn't get past the
feeling that what she was doing

00:45:20.768 --> 00:45:22.600
was crazy.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.900
And so I went to her and
I said, what are you doing

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.840
feels crazy to me, but
I know you're not crazy.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.140
What am I missing?

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.410
I got curious
instead of furious.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.800
She then explained that a newer
car-- the three-year-old car

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.660
had a backup camera
and blind spot

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.480
detection that the
six-year-old car did not have.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.540
Those safety features made her
much more comfortable driving.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.100
And the new car
she was looking at

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.840
had even more safety features,
like collision avoidance

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.670
for rear-end collision.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:53.950
And at our age, and especially
with the medication she's on,

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.650
it would give her
more independence.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.240
All of a sudden,
what had seemed crazy

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.900
was brilliant, not only
for her, but for me.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.270
It's made my driving a
lot more comfortable.

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.700
In fact, every time we drive
that car on a road trip,

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:11.030
I thank her for doing this
thing that seemed crazy to me.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:12.560
The other thing I'd add--

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.750
and it kind of relates
with what Dorothie said--

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:18.350
every relationship has a
bank account of goodwill.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.404
When we first met and
we were madly in love,

00:46:20.404 --> 00:46:22.070
we got married nine
months after we met.

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:23.510
You only took
seven, I know, Tim.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.360
But we were quickly
madly in love.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:27.920
The bank account
was overflowing.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.070
Anything she wanted, I wanted
to do for her, and vice versa.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.710
But then life set in,
two kids, a mortgage,

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:37.310
financial questions,
and the bank account

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:39.470
went from positive
to zero, and was

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.380
headed for what's called
marriage bankruptcy.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.860
And it took us years to
rebuild the bank account.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.610
But now the bank
account is so positive

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:52.130
that we can have that
unconditional positive regard.

00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:57.050
And a small thing that
feels like a slight wrong,

00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.700
like her looking at
the cars, does not

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.640
become the big issue it
would have 30 years ago.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.950
AUDIENCE: With regard to
international issues--

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:09.640
America, al-Qaeda, whatever--

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.769
I'm wondering how these
principles can help there.

00:47:12.769 --> 00:47:14.560
Because at the end of
the day, you can only

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.270
control your own actions.

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.240
You can't really control
what al-Qaeda, whoever's

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:23.080
on the other side, or maybe
even your spouse is going to do.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:30.270
And I'm wondering what kind
of actual practical advice

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.840
you might have that might
help the world become a better

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:33.340
place.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.670
Because it's only we who
can control our actions,

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.084
and we can't control
what other people do.

00:47:39.084 --> 00:47:40.750
MARTIN HELLMAN: There's
a story in there

00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.757
where I have this
epiphany, which relates

00:47:42.757 --> 00:47:43.840
very much to what you say.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.870
We had a huge fight.

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.930
Must have been 30
years ago, maybe more.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:50.110
And I cool down enough to
think through, and I realized,

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.000
now which would I
rather was true,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.800
that my current
perception was correct,

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.900
that was all this
crazy woman's fault--

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.000
which is how I saw
her at that moment--

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.980
in which case, I was
powerless to get out

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.740
of the pain I was in,
or would I rather that I

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.910
was missing something, and I
had played a part in this fight?

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.390
In which case, I could apologize
for that, which would give me

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.295
power to start a process
that might get me out

00:48:13.295 --> 00:48:14.170
of the pain I was in.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.750
With that motivation,
I found the role

00:48:16.750 --> 00:48:18.730
I had played in the fight,
I apologized to her,

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.920
she apologized for what she had
done, and the argument ended.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.020
And in the same way--

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.150
I'm not saying al-Qaeda
will respond that way.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:30.010
But all we can do is look
for where we've made mistakes

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:31.070
and correct those.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.490
And fortunately, there
are a huge number

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.000
of mistakes that we've made as
a nation that we could correct.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.560
I also would recommend
that we don't

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.807
start with al-Qaeda or with the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:48:43.807 --> 00:48:45.265
In fact, we had a
section on Israel

00:48:45.265 --> 00:48:47.620
in an early draft of
the book that we pulled.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.350
AUDIENCE: No, I
totally buy all this.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:52.240
I'm just wondering from a
practical standpoint how much--

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.530
MARTIN HELLMAN:
Practical standpoint?

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.580
Well, we also should go
for the low-hanging fruit.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.670
So just like Israel-Palestine
is not the low hanging fruit,

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.400
Russia-US is the
low-hanging fruit.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.060
What conflicts do we
have with Russia, really?

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:08.050
Ukraine?

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.490
Not that big a deal.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:10.948
DOROTHIE HELLMAN:
So maybe you need

00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:13.696
to talk to your congressman
and those kinds of things.

00:49:13.696 --> 00:49:15.070
MARTIN HELLMAN:
Oh, you're asking

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.455
what can we do as individuals?

00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:17.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:19.059
MARTIN HELLMAN: Oh,
a couple of things.

00:49:19.059 --> 00:49:21.100
First of all, the most
effective thing you can do

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.100
is to bring greater
and greater peace

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.790
to your personal relationships,
because that will motivate

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.980
you to continue
the process, and it

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.570
will make you a
convincing advocate

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.310
for these seemingly
impossible changes

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.480
at the international level.

00:49:38.774 --> 00:49:40.690
If you really want to
play a role, contact us,

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.780
we'll talk through our
email address on the cards.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:48.310
And we'd love to talk with you
about what role you might play.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.760
I contribute to a number of
congressional candidates.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.940
And the way I choose them
is when they call me--

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.530
and once you give to a few, a
whole bunch start calling you.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:49:59.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.500
I have this huge
target painted on me.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.710
I always discuss with them these
issues, North Korea, Russia,

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.440
and whether they're
interested in informing a more

00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:11.260
objective based foreign
policy, instead of based

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.861
on the demonization of Russia
that we have, and so on.

00:50:13.861 --> 00:50:15.610
And I'm actually working
with some of them

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.920
to see whether we might
get that information out

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.689
to other people within Congress.

00:50:20.689 --> 00:50:22.480
But if you don't give
money to congressmen,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.670
you can always write
letters to your congressmen,

00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:25.602
your senators.

00:50:25.602 --> 00:50:27.310
And you might wonder
living in California

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:28.780
what difference that makes.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.690
Because for example
Senator Feinstein

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:34.360
is going to vote the
way I would want her to

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.950
on most of these issues.

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.530
But someone pointed out to me
who really knows how Washington

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:42.160
works that lobbying Feinstein is
very important on these issues,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.670
because she has great
political capital in DC.

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.340
People on both sides of
the aisle respect her.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.590
But how she spends
that political capital

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.010
depends on what she
sees as important.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:59.500
And getting her to move
these issues up in her agenda

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.000
will cause her to do more.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.540
DOROTHIE HELLMAN: There is one
other thing that's important.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.880
We don't know how these
changes are going to occur.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.670
Just like in 1900,
we didn't know

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:13.240
how we were going to get
to women voting in 1920.

00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.450
But we knew that the more
people talked about this,

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:20.410
the more they acted on
it, the more it spread.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.910
It was going to happen.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:25.540
So we don't know the magic
that happens out there

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.580
to get something
like this started.

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:30.610
All we know is that
we can do our part.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.460
We can talk to people about it.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.720
We can behave it.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.490
We can do what we can.

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:41.240
But we can't see from
here to there to know.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.674
We can only do our part.

00:51:42.674 --> 00:51:44.840
Get a group of friends
together to all read the book

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.350
and discuss each chapter and
then tear it apart, and see

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.600
whether you agree or disagree.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.270
That creates a small group.

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:52.010
But that's how all
these things work.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.500
ANDRE: Thank you very
much, Martin and Dorothie,

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.040
for coming.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.930
And let's give them
a round of applause.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.280
[APPLAUSE]
