00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.910
Joining me today is a New Zealand born author,

2
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.960
speaker and founder and head mistress of Mckayla community school,

3
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.100
a free school established in London all the way back in 2014.

4
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.880
Catherine verbal saying welcome to the Rubin report.
Hi.
Hi.

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.420
I'm very happy to have you here.
Hello.
Thank you.
Thanks for having me.

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.600
I've heard a rumor that you sometimes play my videos in your classrooms.

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.750
Well,
I don't know about the classrooms,
but among staff,

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.520
among staff in the school,
somewhere in the school,
in this school.
Definitely.
Um,

9
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.460
we're all fans.
Thank you.
Thank you.

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.230
Far too controversial to play in the classroom.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think so.
Uh,

11
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.300
there's so much I want to talk to you about,
about education,
your,
your personal,

12
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:50.540
sort of political evolution,
all the things that you've been through.

13
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.440
So I always like finding out a little bit about somebody's history at the top

14
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:59.330
and you come from a long line of teachers and some interesting background stuff.

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.770
So tell me a little bit about young Catherine.
Well,
um,

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.820
how many my parents,
my father is Indian guy,
niece.
My mum is Drake and black.

17
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:12.470
Jamaican.
I say that because the whole race thing is important,
you know,
uh,

18
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.180
bizarrely,
cause these days,
you know,

19
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.390
people are so much more interested in who said it as opposed to what is being

20
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:19.910
said.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

21
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.730
somewhat some random person set up a Wikipedia page for me.

22
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:27.490
And there was this kind of major,
uh,
argument going on between my detractors and,

23
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:29.450
and the people who support me.
People that support me,

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.050
one of the truth to be there.
The people who didn't like me wanted it to,

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.520
wanted me to be Indian rather than black because black was kind of a bigger

26
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:42.020
victim.
And to discredit me,
they needed to push me up the,
the victim pole,

27
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.410
you know?
Yes.
So my hit hard following the oppression Olympics,

28
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.630
the whole operation of it.
Yeah,
I know.
Exactly.
And so,
uh,
you know,
my,

29
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.110
my uh,
mother was a nurse,
my father taught at university and,

30
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:57.890
and came from,
you know,
dirt poverty in Ghana,

31
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.500
but is one of those extraordinary people who made something of himself through

32
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:01.940
hard work.
And,
um,

33
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.110
I was born in New Zealand and then I grew up in Canada and then I've now been in

34
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.230
London for nearly 30 years.
And,
uh,

35
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:13.550
I went to Oxford University and I've been a teacher ever since.

36
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.480
And I was a very left wing teacher,
a very typical teacher in that way.
Yeah.

37
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.990
And I used to write a blog,
um,

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.800
which was called to miss with love based on the book and film Sir to Sir with

39
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.070
love,
you know,
Sidney Poitier was in the film and um,

40
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.340
I wrote this blog a few times a week.

41
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.130
I'd go home and write about how little Johnny had his money stolen and that kind

42
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:38.260
of thing.
Things that made me really upset about the education system.
And Ah,

43
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.511
wait,

44
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.390
let's pause for a second before you get to get to the point where you sort of

45
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:44.030
woke up and got into trouble and they don't have people fighting on your

46
00:02:44.031 --> 00:02:45.520
Wikipedia page.
So what,

47
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:50.150
what sort of education did you have that pushed you towards leftism or was it

48
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:50.984
just,

49
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.730
just how it was Kinda like where did those ideas come from?
Did that,

50
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:59.280
did that come from schools that come from family?
Was it media?

51
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:03.590
I suppose my family.
Yeah.
You know,
um,
it's really interesting cause I think,
um,

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.980
ethnic minorities really are small c conservative naturally.
Uh,

53
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.110
but because,
uh,
the black vote normally goes to the left.
Uh,

54
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.580
my family was no different from,
from a typical,
uh,
fam,
you know,

55
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.760
ethnic family in that sense.
And so I was brought up in a,
in a,

56
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.300
in a left wing household.
Why do you think they generally vote small,
cutesy,

57
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.200
conservative or that why they think that?

58
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.850
Why do they internally either think it or have been taught to think it?

59
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.960
I think they come from small c Conservative,
um,
uh,

60
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.730
backgrounds.
So when I say that,

61
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.940
just the belief in and pulling yourself up from your own booze but your own

62
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.080
bootstraps,
um,
hard work will get you somewhere.
Uh,

63
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.730
personal responsibility being stoical when things are difficult.
Um,

64
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.080
but the kind of thing that makes people successful.
Yeah,
exactly.

65
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.960
And I think minorities,
especially the ones who've been immigrants,

66
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.800
moved somewhere new.

67
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:57.340
They believe in giving their children a better life and in working hard in order

68
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.930
to be able to do so.
So it fits with them now.

69
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.680
So you come from a small seed conservative family,
but kind of voting left.

70
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.210
Yes.
Then that's right.
And then I'm a teacher,

71
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:14.230
so everyone I know is on the left and I don't speak to any conservative people

72
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:14.981
because that's how it is.

73
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:16.930
There's this big divide and nobody ever speaks to each other.

74
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:19.990
I didn't know any conservative people or the way conservative people thought.

75
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.970
And then I was writing this blog and that's where I started meeting conservative

76
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:28.690
people and I say meat on my blog.
So Twitter didn't exist in those days.

77
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.790
People would have discussions on the blog comment section and uh,

78
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.930
all these left wingers would come on and start attacking me and telling me how

79
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:40.780
awful I was with the stories that I was writing and how can I judge the

80
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.200
education system as I was judging it.
And,
uh,

81
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.670
all these conservatives would come on and defend me and I'd be saying to the

82
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.840
left wingers,
no,
no,
no,
I want to,
well,
I'm one of you,
you know,
I'm with you.

83
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.590
I'm a good person.
And they'd say,
no,
you're a right winger.
And I'd say,
well,

84
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:57.250
of course I'm not on the right.
Of course I'm not conservative.
I'm a good person.

85
00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.830
So how could I possibly be conservative?

86
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.970
And the Conservatives would come on and say,
I think you'll find that you are.

87
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.330
And over years of me writing and me insisting that I was on the left,

88
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.770
I came to realize that I wasn't yeah,
that my instincts,

89
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.020
the things that I valued,
the values,

90
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.860
it's those basic values of personal responsibility and,
and,
and,
and,

91
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.740
and perseverance and,
and,

92
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.240
and being happy with competition and all that kind of stuff.
Um,

93
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.210
I,
I liked,
and then I realized like I came to realize slowly and,

94
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.570
and then I met a few people.

95
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.030
So like I met you would be interested because you're always interested in

96
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.120
meeting people who don't think like you.
I met this guy.

97
00:05:40.121 --> 00:05:45.121
So there was this guy used to come onto my blog called a British national party

98
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:50.170
member.
So he was,
he was just,
I mean,
people call it the fascist party,
you know,

99
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:54.280
and in the day they had a lot more power than they do nowadays.

100
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.610
And um,
so he was part of the BNP and I would let him come on my blog.

101
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.950
So all of these kinds of lefties were outraged.

102
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.260
How can you let them come on your blog?
You need to ban him.

103
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.640
But I always thought just comments.
So commentator,

104
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.590
he would comment and get into discussions sometimes with me and sometimes with

105
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.760
other people and some of the left wingers would refuse to talk to him at all,

106
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.570
you know,
and they get really angry with me and the team that I should just say,

107
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:22.190
you're not allowed to be on here.
And then,
you know,
he was on there for ages,

108
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:24.800
this is over years.
And then,
um,
and then I said,
you know,

109
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.400
it'd be really interesting to meet you because you're very different from

110
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:32.900
anybody I know.
And so I met this guy and you know,

111
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:35.720
I mean he was a racist,
you know,
I mean he was,
you know,

112
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.110
the things that he believed about black people and so on.
He wasn't racist.

113
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.330
But you know what I always say is some of my best friends are racist.
You know,

114
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.480
it's like avenue Q,
you know,
the,
the musical with,
you know,

115
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:50.930
everyone's a little bit racist and people are racist on different levels.

116
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:53.810
You know,
sometimes you're really racist,
sometimes you just a little bit racist.

117
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.860
Anyway,
I met with him,
he was wearing a suit.
He's young White Guy,

118
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.210
I'm wearing a suit and nice shoes.
And then he went and he took me for lunch.

119
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.470
He paid for lunch.
That's right.
That's right.

120
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.320
That's what's so interesting about life.
Right.
And um,

121
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.160
so we went for lunch and he was hobbling along and I said,
you know,

122
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:17.450
you are right.
And he said,
Oh,
you know,
the thing is I bought this suit and,

123
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.420
and these shoes,
cause I was meeting with you and you know,

124
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:24.680
you went to Oxford University and I figured I've got to get dressed up,

125
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.400
you know.
But the sh the shoes are new and they're really hurting my feet.

126
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.380
And I feel isn't that interesting?

127
00:07:30.381 --> 00:07:33.380
Here's this racist who was taking me for lunch,

128
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.460
who's wearing new shoes that he's bought.
Cause I've been to Oxford,
you know,

129
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.200
and that's what's so interesting about life is that it's not as easy as some of

130
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.810
the left put people.
You know,
you're a racist,
you're not a racist,

131
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:47.630
you're a good person,
you're a bad person.
You're this,
it's not like that.

132
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.680
There's a whole variety of different ways of seeing people and learning from

133
00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:56.330
people.
And,
um,
was he able to learn from you after that?
Well,

134
00:07:56.331 --> 00:08:01.040
we met a second time and you know,
I mean when I say he was,

135
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.700
I mean like he was telling me about how that morning he'd been to see his

136
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:07.690
girlfriend and they have a toddler and uh,

137
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.520
he'd gone to see her and see the baby.

138
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.450
She wouldn't let him hold the baby because she knew that he was coming to see me

139
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.750
and she said,
you're going to contaminate him cause you're going.

140
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.870
Exactly.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Um,
but,

141
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:27.560
you know,
he was a good guy in so many other ways.
And that's what,

142
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.690
that's what's interesting about life is what I'd say,
um,
is that,

143
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.000
uh,
nobody's perfect and people change their minds.

144
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.151
You know,

145
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:41.450
I think about my parents who lived in the same house for 46 years in Toronto.

146
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.140
And,
um,
there was a man called Mr. Snow who lived opposite them.

147
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.090
And when he moved,
when they moved into the area,

148
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.020
it was all white and he was outraged because he was a racist and he thought,

149
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:54.380
no way,
I don't want these people living there.
And over the years,

150
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:57.720
over the 46 years,
they got to know each other and they became friends.

151
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.970
And in the end,
Mr Snow's wife,
you know,
she,
she got cancer and she died.

152
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.790
And Mr. Snow,
uh,
I had to depend on my parents for a whole lot of help and,

153
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.690
and my parents loved Mr. Snow and Mr. Snow loved them.
Um,
you know,

154
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:16.080
things can change,
people can change.
And when Mr. Snow died,

155
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.910
my parents moved house because the,
the,

156
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.310
the community they lived in and had,
had died.
We've,
we've,

157
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.950
Mr. Snow and this was the man who was so racist.

158
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:27.630
He didn't want them to live there.
You know,

159
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.520
<v 2>isn't it personally powerful too?
I mean,
I can feel it when you're saying it,</v>

160
00:09:31.521 --> 00:09:35.030
that when you can accept some people for all their flaws,

161
00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:40.031
that it actually allows you to figure out how to grow instead of just othering

162
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:41.210
them forever.
Even,

163
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:44.530
even if they might do that to a whole set of people for awful reasons.
Yeah.

164
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.790
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
and they can change.
I mean,
people change their minds.
You know,</v>

165
00:09:48.791 --> 00:09:52.990
I have this quote in my office from Muhammad Ali that says,
um,
you know,

166
00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:55.630
for man at 40 still thinks the same way as when he was 20,

167
00:09:55.631 --> 00:10:00.520
then he's lost 20 years of his life,
you know?
Um,
and,
and thank God we can change.

168
00:10:00.521 --> 00:10:04.720
I mean,
when I think about how I used to think,
you know,
and how I think now,
um,

169
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.820
well that's what life's all about,

170
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.100
<v 2>right?
So,
okay,
so let's back up to some of those ideas,
because,
so you were,</v>

171
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.280
you were a lefty and then you started teaching in inner city schools.

172
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:14.610
That's right.

173
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.840
That's when you started waking up and that's what sort of forced you to or force

174
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:20.760
you or led you to write the blog.
Yeah.

175
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:24.240
What were some of the ideas that you were seeing specifically that you realize,

176
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:26.190
wow,
this is not working in these schools?

177
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.260
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
So,</v>

178
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.250
so one of the big things that I used to think before going into teaching and

179
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:33.980
everyone used to just accept was that,
uh,

180
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.310
black kids failed at school because white teachers are racist.

181
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.340
The system is racist,
the white teachers are racist.

182
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.630
And that's why black kids are failing.

183
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.440
Teachers go into teaching for racist purposes.
Not Anything.

184
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.360
This is what's so crazy,
I was thinking,
but I've met hundreds,

185
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.190
thousands of teachers,
not one of them has ever said to me,

186
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:56.600
I'm a racist and I want to stop black kids from promise,
like feeding.
In fact,

187
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.020
they are killing themselves,
you know,
working all hours,

188
00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:02.960
giving everything that they can do the job.
Um,

189
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.490
and I started to question the kinds of things that the,
that the,
that the normal,

190
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:12.140
the normal way of seeing things was,
uh,
what I was being told.
Um,

191
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.370
and it wasn't just that,
you know,

192
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:17.870
in which we might get into later about teaching methods and about,
um,
uh,

193
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.190
discipline and so on.

194
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.620
The kinds of things are important and the whole second half is going to be on

195
00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:26.540
your solution.
Right.
Okay.
Right,
right,
right.
Okay.
So,
yeah,

196
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:30.440
I started to question all of that.
And,
um,
I went,

197
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.270
there was this a black achievement,
uh,
uh,

198
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.450
kind of conference that used to happen once a year,

199
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.270
which was about improving black achievement and how,

200
00:11:38.271 --> 00:11:42.450
what do we do raising black achievement?
And,
uh,
there was,
uh,
uh,
labor.
Uh,

201
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.550
so that's our left,
uh,
political policy.
Um,
black,

202
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.720
a woman MP.
So one of our politicians who used to run this thing.

203
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.490
And I went along and I took,
uh,

204
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.290
one of the white teachers who I worked with and he was older than me.

205
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.550
He's retired now and he'd been doing this for 25 years and I've given everything

206
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:05.320
to the job.
And I took him along and these people were standing up on stage,

207
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.090
essentially saying that white teachers were racist.
And I was so embarrassed.

208
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.360
I was so humiliated that I taken this man giving up his Saturday to go and sit

209
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:20.920
and be told that he's a racist when he had given everything to these black boys.

210
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:25.060
So we worked in this boy's school and it was mainly black boys in this school.

211
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.350
And um,
and I was just,
I was mortified.
Um,

212
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.010
so gradually I started to change my mind on these sorts of things and then I

213
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:37.420
started to see that they're with,
it had to do with our expectations of kids.

214
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.220
It had to do with our,
um,
our expectations of parents.

215
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.800
It had to do with the kinds of values that,
that we were giving them.

216
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:48.730
So if we were saying to them,
poor you,
you're a victim,
life is so difficult.

217
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:50.650
You're black,
you'll never be able to get anywhere.

218
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.640
Then it's quite hard for the black inner city boy go,
oh,
well,
you know,

219
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.940
actually it's about working hard.
It's about,
we always say at school,

220
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.720
even when it's difficult,
um,
especially when it's difficult,
you do what's right.

221
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.470
Right.
And as opposed to saying that it's difficult,
I can't do it right.

222
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.600
Except before Mckayla,
that that business of even when it's difficult,

223
00:13:10.601 --> 00:13:13.900
especially when it's difficult,
that,
that value,
that,
that,
that,

224
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.430
that business of believing in hard work,
I didn't see it so much.
Um,
and,

225
00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:23.460
and we would give kids excuses.
We would give kids excuses to fail and,
um,

226
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.260
I wouldn't do it in my classroom.
And,
uh,

227
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.130
the kids behave for me and the kids learned with me.

228
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:31.660
And of course I'm not the only teacher was doing that.

229
00:13:31.661 --> 00:13:34.420
There are teachers all over the place in their own classrooms.
We're doing that.

230
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.750
Uh,
what I,
what I wanted to do,

231
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.480
<v 2>the administration,
they can you,
cause it sounds like,
you know,
Whoa,</v>

232
00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:44.090
we've got you.
And obviously as you said,
you weren't the only one,

233
00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:48.260
but we've got people pushing against the very cause that's the fabric of what

234
00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:51.590
these schools eventually become,
that it's not,
it's not on them.

235
00:13:51.591 --> 00:13:56.060
It's on the system that is ruined because people before they've even begun yet.

236
00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.690
<v 1>Yeah,
they're poor.
I mean,
I don't suppose people realize what I was saying.</v>

237
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.840
You know,
I mean I'm,
you're talking to kids privately,
you do your own thing.

238
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:07.070
And if the kids are behaving for you and you're getting good results and then,

239
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.600
then the principal loves you,
you know,
uh,

240
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.010
it just works and people don't know why.
Um,
and I'm not even sure I realized why,

241
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.963
you know,
you just,
you,

242
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.750
you build up an experience over years and you know what works for the kids and

243
00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:21.740
how you get them on board and how you show them that you're in charge and,

244
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.190
and then you teach them properly and they love you for it.
Um,
yeah.

245
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.100
<v 2>And realize that your political evolution was happening at the exact same time</v>

246
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.470
because he was sort of very personal in the classroom,

247
00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.280
but then that you were evolving.
Yeah.
It would have been in another sense,

248
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.013
<v 1>uh,</v>

249
00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.820
<v 2>cause I can be,
that's how it is for a lot of people.</v>

250
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.550
When people come up to me on the street or email me,
they're saying,
you know,

251
00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:45.180
something's happening at work on dealing with this and now it's starting to make

252
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:49.680
me think differently about politics.
Or I used to always vote Democrat,

253
00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.040
but you know,
something happened in my family.
We got

254
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 1>in a conversation and now I'm starting to think something else is a little bit</v>

255
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:56.570
different.
Well that was the blog.
Yeah.

256
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:59.690
So it was the conservatives on my blog that I was realizing,

257
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:04.400
I'm agreeing with you and I'm not agreeing with the left wingers on the blog.
Uh,

258
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:09.020
and it was then that I just thought,
well maybe I am just a conservative.

259
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:15.020
So I,
um,
I accepted it and then in,
you know,

260
00:15:15.021 --> 00:15:19.250
accepted the idea of being conservative.
And then in 2010,
I voted conservative,

261
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.090
which was a major deal for me.
Um,
and it was funny cause you know,

262
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:27.620
after I did that,
I remember,
um,
this is after I ended up in the press and so on.

263
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.920
I was speaking to a friend of mine and I said to her,
and she's Indian.

264
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.720
And I said to her,
you know,

265
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.690
it will obviously you've seen in the press and everything and how I voted

266
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:38.210
conservative.
And she said,
well,
you know,
I have something to tell you Katherine.

267
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.080
I voted conservative too.
And that's the thing.

268
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:45.080
People are doing this and the canned admit to it,
it's so crazy.

269
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.060
So I voted conservative in May,
2010 and then in October,

270
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.710
2010 I was invited to go to the Conservative Party conference to,
to give,
uh,

271
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.310
a speech.
And that's like a convention.
You guys have conventions here.
And,
um,

272
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.530
I was a teacher.
I never really took much notice of political things.
I mean,
I,

273
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.340
I didn't,
I,
I was a bit naive and a bit stupid to be honest.
And,
um,
anyway,

274
00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:10.790
I went along and I gave this speech,
which,
uh,

275
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.840
the audience really liked and,
um,
and then I ended up all over the press.

276
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.620
This is the speech really,
that changed everything that changed my life.
Yeah.
Uh,

277
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.150
for the worst at the time.
I mean,

278
00:16:20.151 --> 00:16:23.570
I think now I can look back and say it was for the better in many ways,

279
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:27.240
or at least,
yeah.
I mean,
I,

280
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.370
every cloud has a silver lining and my silver lining has been,

281
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.520
has been a good one,
uh,
because I've made it into a silver lining,

282
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:38.480
but I could have been,
uh,
destroyed by it quite easily.
I mean,
in the end,

283
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:40.570
I ended up without a job.
I was told,
uh,

284
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.610
that I would never get a job in state education ever again.

285
00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.600
Lay out some of the things that you talked about in the speech.
Right?
So

286
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.350
I talked about black kids failing and that I talked about,
um,

287
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.630
I talked about that's not expecting enough of kids and how we are constantly

288
00:16:59.631 --> 00:17:04.631
making excuses for them and how we label them with things like anger management

289
00:17:04.641 --> 00:17:08.480
or I,
you know,
uh,
dyslexia or,

290
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:11.050
or all these kinds of labels that we give the kids.
Oh,

291
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:14.080
he can't possibly be behave.
He's,
he's got issues.

292
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.970
That's what we always say they have,
they have particular needs and,
uh,

293
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.270
we have to meet their needs,
um,
as opposed to just expecting them to behave.

294
00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.960
Um,
everybody has different needs.
Nobody,

295
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:30.460
we can't expect anything of them.
And that's just the norm.
It's the norm.
So I,

296
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.110
I talked about all of this.

297
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:35.710
I talked about competition and how it was needed in schools that kids need to

298
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.440
feel as if they're competing against somebody else and so on.

299
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:43.680
They need to feel like they're being inspired to work hard as opposed to being

300
00:17:44.591 --> 00:17:49.210
indulged.
Um,
and constantly let off the hook because while it's not your fault,

301
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.550
your parents are divorced,

302
00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:54.120
it's not your fault cause you live on an estate and you're black and you're mom

303
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:57.060
is a single mom and you can't possibly do your homework.
I mean,

304
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:00.690
I don't understand this,
you know,
like,
and,
and that was because over the years,

305
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:03.600
you know,
I visited,
I'd worked for a summer one since South Africa.

306
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.880
I'd been to see schools in China and Brazil and India and all of these countries

307
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.290
where the kids were for poor and yet they were walking five miles getting to

308
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:17.130
school and working really hard.
So why was it that those kids could do it?

309
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.300
And apparently our kids couldn't do it,
you know?
So that was why I questioned it.

310
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.900
And I said all of this stuff at the conference and the Conservatives liked what

311
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:29.640
I said.
Yeah.
Cause nobody ever says this sort of thing.
And then as I say,

312
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:32.640
it was out of a job and then I thought,
what do I do?
How does that happen?

313
00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.380
So you give this speech,
you're fired the next day.
I mean,
no,

314
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.940
I resigned in the end,
but it was just untenable.
Like,
yeah,
the press,
I was,

315
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.880
I was everywhere.
It was like one of those Hollywood films.

316
00:18:41.881 --> 00:18:46.170
I couldn't go outside my door because there were press waiting outside to talk

317
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:50.460
to me.
Yeah.
Like I said,
I'm still responsibilities a thing.
Go get her.

318
00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.810
This is what's so crazy.

319
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.970
All I said was ultimately I was saying that the education system was broken and

320
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:58.560
people wouldn't have that on.

321
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:02.580
The thing is I do feel it's like the emperor's new clothes,
which is that,
um,

322
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.490
everybody knows that there's a problem with the education system,

323
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.600
but nobody's willing to say it.
Uh,
and I,
I got hundreds,

324
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.350
if not thousands of emails from teachers all over the country saying,

325
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.590
thank God someone said something.
Thank you for saying something.

326
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.030
I won't tell you my name.
Yeah.

327
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.020
I can't tell you my name because I'll lose my job because they're all terrified.

328
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:25.860
Right.
So,
so yeah.
So I,
um,

329
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.260
I then thought about the private sector for a bit,
but then I thought,

330
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.670
I love working with disadvantaged kids.
I love working in the inner city.

331
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.510
This is what I do.
This is what I know.
I knocked,
I'm not giving up.

332
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.430
So we had just,

333
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:42.360
you've had charter schools in America for a long time.
We,

334
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.920
it was only in 2010 that free schools,
which are charter schools started in,

335
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.660
you know,
there was the possibility of setting one up.

336
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.490
So I decided to set up my own school and I got a group of people together and

337
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.110
then we started trying to set it up.

338
00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.970
Now this was not easy because I had a lot of people who hated me.
Yeah.

339
00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.700
Uh,
I mean I still have a lot of people pay me.
I said,

340
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.100
I do think the number is probably reduced.
Um,

341
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.320
or at least they've just left me alone.
Actually.

342
00:20:07.321 --> 00:20:09.330
I don't know if the numbers reduced.
I think they just leave me alone.

343
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.810
<v 2>I think at some point they see that you keep going,</v>

344
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.580
that's it and keep becoming successful.

345
00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:16.510
And then they'll always find someone new to feed on and to scare.

346
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.550
But it's like they,
you know what I mean?
Like at some point they're like,
wow,

347
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.220
yeah,
we haven't got her yet.
And then they run out.

348
00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.100
They're not into hard work really.
So they kind of were like,
all right,

349
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.750
let's move onto an easier target.

350
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.930
<v 1>Yeah.
And it is,
I am a more,
um,
it's harder now because,
um,</v>

351
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.880
because I have the school and it's really hard,
although they do try,
you know,

352
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.580
when we were trying to set up the school,
I wasn't used to say,
gosh,

353
00:20:39.581 --> 00:20:42.310
it's like we're like making nuclear bombs.
I mean,

354
00:20:42.311 --> 00:20:46.990
all we're doing is setting up a school.
I mean,
we would,
we would,
um,

355
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.050
we would have parents evenings.
So first of all,

356
00:20:50.051 --> 00:20:52.300
I'd be out on the street handing out flyers,
uh,

357
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.950
running into hairdressers and saying,

358
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.690
does anybody have any children who might want to go to the secondary school?

359
00:20:56.691 --> 00:20:59.200
And you know,
women would be coming out of their hair dryers saying,
okay,

360
00:20:59.201 --> 00:20:59.801
I'll have one,

361
00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:03.310
I'll have one going into churches and mosques and temples and all sorts.

362
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.850
And then we would have a parent's evening once we had it in the pub.

363
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.410
And all these parents who are arriving,

364
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.680
our detractors are outside picketing that got like posters saying Tory teacher.

365
00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.510
Um,
all sorts of insults is screaming obscenities at me,

366
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:23.320
calling me names and we have to hire a bouncer cause we were so worried about

367
00:21:23.321 --> 00:21:27.620
the possible violence.
Um,
and then when I was talking to the parent,

368
00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:30.760
these two parents finding out about a school,
that's it.

369
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.190
And they're all poor parents from the inner city,
right?

370
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.730
So you've got all these black mom's black single mom's sitting there trying to

371
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:39.670
find out about this new school and all these white middle class people.

372
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:42.010
And when we say middle class,
we mean people with money.

373
00:21:42.011 --> 00:21:46.150
You guys use it as a working you.
Okay.
When we say middle class,
you,

374
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.460
you guys say middle class,
we mean working class.

375
00:21:48.461 --> 00:21:52.240
When I say middle class I mean well off people.
So these white,
you know,

376
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:57.150
well educated,
well off,
people are,
have infiltrated on,

377
00:21:57.151 --> 00:22:00.940
are sitting amongst all of these inner city people,
uh,

378
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.500
who are wanting to find out about the school.

379
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.430
And when I'm talking they're standing up and shouting abuse deliberately cause

380
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.130
they're trying to disrupt kind of like when you do stuff and like the shaking

381
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:09.964
pennies and yeah.

382
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:11.690
<v 2>Yeah.
We'll do,
we're going to talk about that.</v>

383
00:22:11.691 --> 00:22:14.480
Cause I know you had a little criticism of the way I dealt with one of the

384
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:17.610
issues there related to education.
But we'll get to that.
But yeah.
So but,

385
00:22:17.611 --> 00:22:19.190
but let's just focus on that for a second.

386
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.740
What do you think it is about the intentions of those people?

387
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:25.220
I try not to judge people's intentions.
I try to judge their actions.
But bees,

388
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.390
these working class and,
and I know you're not into identity politics,

389
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:30.380
but they happen to be white,

390
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:33.620
which you're illustrating here that they're the ones that are attacking the

391
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.840
black mothers that are trying to take care of their kids.

392
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.070
What is it that these people,
what do you think they really think?

393
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:44.480
Why do you think they really are so invested in keeping everything the way it

394
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:48.380
was?
They'll die.
They'll say that they're for helping these people all the time.

395
00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:50.870
Then they'll look at a system that does not help these people.

396
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.420
Then someone comes in and says,
I'm going to help these people.
Yeah.

397
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:57.230
There's a track record of doing it.
Yeah.
And they hate you and them.
Yeah.

398
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.210
<v 1>Yeah,
they do.
Um,
and so just so I'm clear,
these are white well off people,
right?</v>

399
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.050
These are people who are,
who have everything.

400
00:23:04.051 --> 00:23:06.420
Some of them have been privately educated.
Right.

401
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:10.080
I think it's because they believe in making people equal.

402
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.770
But the state should make people equal as opposed to giving people equality of

403
00:23:13.771 --> 00:23:17.160
opportunity.
Because I'm all about giving people equality of opportunity.

404
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.070
I want to make it so that schools are so good,

405
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:24.960
but everybody has an equal chance of making something of themselves and changing

406
00:23:24.961 --> 00:23:28.140
their stars.
Right.
That's what I want to do.
Yeah.
They don't like that.

407
00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.180
They want these people to continue being not,
not being successful.

408
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.670
And then they as kind of these,

409
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.590
these white knights in shining armor can come down and the state can provide you

410
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:44.190
with money and,
and uh,
and a free apartment and,
and all sorts of things.

411
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.420
And then they can sit at parties and feel very good about themselves because,

412
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:51.590
well,
you know,
I vote on the left and I'm a very good person.
Um,

413
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:55.950
well this is it.
So they're not interested in whether or not it works.
Right.

414
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.190
They're interested in feeling good about themselves and their,

415
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:02.480
they genuinely believe that the state is going to make things better for these

416
00:24:02.481 --> 00:24:07.460
people and free schools,
charter schools,
while they are state schools,
um,

417
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.590
they break up the education system,
right?

418
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:13.850
So the unions aren't as powerful anymore and they very much believe in the power

419
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:17.360
of the unions.
Um,
and they want them to have their collective bargaining.

420
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.460
And if too many schools break out of the system and break up the system,
then it,

421
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.160
it devalues that power of the unions.
Um,

422
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.390
so I think that they convinced themselves that what they're doing is right.

423
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.390
Even though there are all these poor moms wanting to find out about another

424
00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:39.470
option for their child,
and they're desperate.
I mean,
when I say desperate,

425
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.540
I've had mothers crying in front of me crying saying,

426
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.810
I don't want my child to get knifed.
I don't want,

427
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.740
I want my child to have a decent education so that maybe he'll have a chance to

428
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:55.580
get to university.
I just want him to be safe.
Right.
And,

429
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.720
and then people are,
and then what they'll do is they'll deny that,
that,

430
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.780
that that's the case.
That there are schools where children aren't safe.

431
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.640
They'll deny,
they just,

432
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.040
they just lie there just boldface the highlights about,
about the system.

433
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.750
So what other kind of pushback did you get as you were creating the school?

434
00:25:14.751 --> 00:25:18.080
Like what,
what is it like to you?
Okay,
you,
you fill out some paperwork.

435
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:19.280
I assume that now you try it,

436
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:22.580
you talk to some people and maybe you talked to some teachers than likeminded

437
00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.150
people that say and things,
but what's that light to go?

438
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.150
I've got to find a building.
I got to find funding.
The whole that's right.

439
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:34.100
So it's a total nightmare.
Total nightmare.
I mean,
really,

440
00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:36.890
whenever any group comes to me and says we want to set up a school,
I always say,

441
00:25:36.891 --> 00:25:40.910
okay,
well dig deep,
right?
Cause you're going to have to get every bit of energy.

442
00:25:40.911 --> 00:25:44.600
You've got to be able to push through on this.
I mean,
it took us three years,
um,

443
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.250
and it took us three years to find a building.

444
00:25:46.251 --> 00:25:49.730
There was so many people against us.
Um,
and as you were saying earlier,

445
00:25:49.731 --> 00:25:51.140
I just kept going and I mean,

446
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:54.080
I kind of had to keep going because otherwise I wasn't going to be able to do

447
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:59.020
the job that I love.
So a hat too.
And eventually we found this building.
I mean,

448
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.210
so first you apply,
you have to go for interviews,
you know,

449
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:03.640
the panel interviews and Blah Blah,

450
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.440
and then you'd get approved and then you're looking for a building and oh,

451
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:11.270
it's just a little nightmare.
But,
um,
eventually we got this building,
uh,

452
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.730
which,
you know,
isn't the greatest building.
And when I say it's not great,

453
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:17.630
you know,
there's no grass there,
no trees,
there's no car park for the staff.

454
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.380
There's just the old car park,
which is used as a playground for the kids,

455
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:23.690
which is tiny.
You know,
it isn't ideal,

456
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.270
but I always say it's the people inside the building that matter.

457
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.220
And we've made a real go of it.
And,
um,
and,
you know,
it's,

458
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:35.510
it's great.
It's,
it's,
it's,
and what is great,
but what he really is great.

459
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.150
And this is where,
you know,
I,
I'm really,
you know,

460
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.070
I feel really optimistic is that we have five,

461
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.740
10 teachers from all over the world that come and visit the school every single

462
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:51.390
day,
mainly from the UK.
But we get Americans,
Canadians,
Australians,

463
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:52.650
New Zealanders.
I mean,

464
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.160
and they come because they've heard about us through social media and they want

465
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:59.370
to see what we do.
And then we get loads of letters from teachers,

466
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:02.130
from principals who say,
are taking these ideas.

467
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.220
And I put them in my school and it's really helped.
And,

468
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.410
and it's made things better for our kids.

469
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.000
So I feel like we're not just having impact in our school,
on our kids,
but on,

470
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.560
on kids all over the world,
you know?

471
00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:22.030
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
