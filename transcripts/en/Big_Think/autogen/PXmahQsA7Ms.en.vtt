the problem of the cost of college is an

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300
the problem of the cost of college is an
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.720
the problem of the cost of college is an
enormous one and it's real and frankly

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
enormous one and it's real and frankly
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.940

it's true whether you're a liberal arts

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
it's true whether you're a liberal arts
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.230
it's true whether you're a liberal arts
grad you're an engineering graduate

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
grad you're an engineering graduate
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.320
grad you're an engineering graduate
because you're still facing those those

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
because you're still facing those those
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.519
because you're still facing those those
those issues of debt and is it worth it

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529
those issues of debt and is it worth it
 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.410
those issues of debt and is it worth it
so I have a few things to say about that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
so I have a few things to say about that
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.609
so I have a few things to say about that
first is the data still shows that a

first is the data still shows that a
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200
first is the data still shows that a
college education is worth the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
college education is worth the
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.599
college education is worth the
investment that is your earnings will be

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
investment that is your earnings will be
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.720
investment that is your earnings will be
higher over your lifetime because you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
higher over your lifetime because you
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.980
higher over your lifetime because you
have a college degree and they will be

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
have a college degree and they will be
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959
have a college degree and they will be
significantly higher than the cost of

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
significantly higher than the cost of
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.510
significantly higher than the cost of
that college degree over the lifetime

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520
that college degree over the lifetime
 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
that college degree over the lifetime
point 12 there isn't that much

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610
point 12 there isn't that much
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.340
point 12 there isn't that much
difference in the lifetime earnings of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
difference in the lifetime earnings of
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.930
difference in the lifetime earnings of
an engineer and graduate and a non

an engineer and graduate and a non
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119
an engineer and graduate and a non

engineering graduate the engineering
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.549
engineering graduate the engineering
graduates start out higher but it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
graduates start out higher but it
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.180
graduates start out higher but it
equalizes after a while point 3 the real

equalizes after a while point 3 the real
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130

change that one has to hope is is
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110
change that one has to hope is is
happening is that the cost of college is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
happening is that the cost of college is
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.569
happening is that the cost of college is
going down and that it will therefore

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
going down and that it will therefore
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.540
going down and that it will therefore
allow people to be more experimental to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
allow people to be more experimental to
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.490
allow people to be more experimental to
follow their passions to you know to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
follow their passions to you know to
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.799
follow their passions to you know to
pursue what they want to and the cost of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
pursue what they want to and the cost of
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.939
pursue what they want to and the cost of
college is going down because

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
college is going down because
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620
college is going down because

a college seminar is even today right
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550
a college seminar is even today right
but now it's changing because online

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
but now it's changing because online
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.859

in both cases the consumer tends to be

distortion and frankly inflation so I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550
distortion and frankly inflation so I

think that in both areas you're going to
 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160
think that in both areas you're going to
see information technology begin to
