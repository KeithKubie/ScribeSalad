00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.170
Well, here we are, nearly
the end of Google I/O 2015,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.950
and it's been a great show.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.800
I'm a game designer, and
I've been focusing on games.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.940
And one of the things that
I love about this show

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.090
is that we go all the way back
to the early '80s and the game

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.890
here "Joust" that I was actually
a tester on in 1982, all

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.009
the way up to modern day when
these games are still fun,

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.550
but the new technologies and a
lot of the stuff we're showing

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.470
here at I/O is getting
used in current games

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.680
and future games that may
even be of types and genres we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410
haven't seen yet.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.200
It's been very
inspiring here for me.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.859
I've been able to be a part
of the audience at some

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.900
of our talks and see some
of the great new things

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.210
we have coming out.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.320
I'm particularly excited by how
Google's at the forefront of VR

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.420
at this point.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.580
The Cardboard team
has announced that we

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.650
have over a million Cardboards
in the hands of people

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.360
worldwide and having such an
inexpensive and accessible way

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.260
for people, for small developers
to get into virtual reality.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740
And for the audience that
we're after, for people

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.100
around the world,
for just $20 or less

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.990
to be able to get
a Cardboard device

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
and plug their phone in
and see the kind of quality

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.310
VR that it's able to do.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.200
I think is going to be
amazing to see what's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.210
coming out in the next year.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.530
Meanwhile, we have things
like our Project Tango

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.185
that is giving devices a
human-scale understanding

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:28.550
of their surroundings.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.210
It's going to be able to
transform GamePlay and give us

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.210
new types of games we
haven't seen before.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.380
And the ATAP group has been
announcing new technologies

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.370
that allow different types of
control for games or anything

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.170
that I think is just going to
be revolutionary for the kinds

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.880
of applications and
games we can see.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670
And one of the reasons
that I love games

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.200
is that if you're trying to do
business software, for example,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.550
and you have something
that works about 90%

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.980
of the time and 10%
it gets almost there,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.810
it's nowhere near
acceptable for business.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.530
But if it's 90% of the
time working in a game,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.590
and it's fun, and
even when it fails

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.660
it's still something
that's enjoyable,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.370
several of the features in
this game "Joust" over here

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.584
were actually bugs.

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:12.000
They were so much
fun they decided

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.310
to leave them in because
it enhanced the game.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.870
And there's a
flexibility in games

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.700
that I think a lot of the new
technologies we're seeing here

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.570
today will get pioneered in
games and will get polished

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.350
and honed so they could be used
in other types of applications

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.770
around the world after we've
had a chance to see what's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.980
fun with them.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.440
So it's been a long
I/O. A lot of people

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.250
are excited and happy, but a
little bit tired at the end.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.440
And I think we're all happy
to be doing something that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.150
can make a difference
to the world

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.190
and also make people a little
bit happier and entertain them.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.460
Because what's better
than having a good time

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.270
at the end of the day?

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.660
Thanks and have a good
time at home, too.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.210
