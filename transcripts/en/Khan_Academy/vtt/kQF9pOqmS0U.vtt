00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.860
So let's say that we've
got a pool of water

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.665
and I drop a rock into the
middle of that pool of water.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.840
And a little while later,
a little wave, a ripple

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.720
has formed that is moving
radially outward from where

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.840
I dropped the rock.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.680
So let's see how
well I can draw that.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.480
So it's moving
radially outwards.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.920
So that is the
ripple that is formed

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.320
from me dropping the
rock into the water.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.160
So it's a circle centered
at where the rock initially

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.259
hit the water.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.310
And let's say right at this
moment the radius of the circle

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.073
is equal to 3 centimeters.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.380
And we also know that
the radius is increasing

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.370
at a rate of 1
centimeter per second.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:04.920
So radius growing at rate
of 1 centimeter per second.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.120
So given this, right
now our circle,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.210
our ripple circle has a
radius of 3 centimeters.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.010
And we know that the
radius is growing

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.360
at 1 centimeter per second.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.920
Given that, at what rate
is the area growing?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:29.260
At what rate is area
of circle growing?

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.760
Interesting.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.245
So let's think
about what we know

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:33.870
and then what we
don't know, what we're

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.590
trying to figure out.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.890
So if we call this radius
r, we know that right now r

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.880
is equal to 3 centimeters.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.240
We also know the
rate at which r is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.450
changing with respect to time.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.790
We also know this information
right over here. dr dt,

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.630
the rate at which the radius is
changing with respect to time,

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.350
is 1 centimeter per second.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.060
Now what do we
need to figure out?

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.410
Well, they say at what rate is
the area of the circle growing?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.080
So we need to figure
out at what rate

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.560
is the area of
the circle-- where

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.890
a is the area of the circle--
at what rate is this growing?

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.370
This is what we
need to figure out.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.200
So what might be
useful here is if we

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
can come up with a relationship
between the area of the circle

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.170
and the radius of the
circle and maybe take

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.924
the derivative with
respect to time.

00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:29.090
And we'll have to use a
little bit of the chain rule

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.984
to do that.

00:02:29.984 --> 00:02:31.900
So what is the relationship
at any given point

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.750
in time between the
area of the circle

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.770
and the radius of the circle?

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.390
Well, this is
elementary geometry.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.160
The area of a circle
is going to be

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.070
equal to pi times the radius
of the circle squared.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.820
Now what we want
to do is figure out

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.321
the rate at which the area is
changing with respect to time.

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:52.778
So why don't we
take the derivative

00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:54.630
of both sides of this
with respect to time?

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.350
And let me give myself a
little more real estate.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.340
Actually, let me just
rewrite what I just had.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.570
So pi r squared.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.980
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.229
I'm going to take the
derivative of both sides of this

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.980
with respect to time.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.006
So the derivative
with respect to time.

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.006
I'm not taking the
derivative with respect to r,

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:16.732
I'm taking the derivative
with respect to time.

00:03:16.732 --> 00:03:18.440
So on the left-hand
side right over here,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.865
I'm going to have the
derivative of our area.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:23.990
Actually, let me just write
it in that green color.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.420
I'm going to have the
derivative of our area

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.310
with respect to time
on the left-hand side.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.730
And on the right-hand
side, what do I have?

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.100
Well, if I'm taking the
derivative of a constant times

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.580
something, I can take
the constant out.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.550
So let me just do that.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.625
Pi times the derivative with
respect to time of r squared.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.000
And to make it a little bit
clearer what I'm about to do,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.458
why I'm using the
chain rule, we're

00:03:54.458 --> 00:03:56.732
assuming that r is
a function of time.

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:58.190
If r wasn't a
function of time then

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.690
area wouldn't be a
function of time.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.240
So instead of just writing
r, let me make it explicit

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.490
that it is a function of time.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.290
I'll write r of t.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.319
So it's r of t,
which we're squaring.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.610
And we want to find the
derivative of this with respect

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.880
to time.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.270
And here we just have
to apply the chain rule.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.990
We're taking the derivative of
something squared with respect

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.756
to that something.

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:20.089
So the derivative of that
something squared with respect

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:25.810
to the something is going
to be 2 times that something

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.415
to the first power.

00:04:27.415 --> 00:04:28.290
Let me make it clear.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:37.420
This is the derivative of r of t
squared with respect to r of t.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.630
The derivative of something
squared with respect

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.461
to that something.

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.710
If it was a derivative of x
squared with respect to x,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.500
we'd have 2x.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.990
If it was the derivative of r
of t squared with respect to r

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.247
of t, it's 2r of t.

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:50.580
But this doesn't get us just
the derivative with respect

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.080
to time.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.450
This is just the derivative
with respect to r of t.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.270
The derivative at which this
changes with respect to time,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.830
we have to multiply this
times the rate at which r of t

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.400
changes with respect to time.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.960
So the rate at which r of t
changes with respect to time?

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.270
Well, we could just
write that as dr dt.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.240
These are equivalent
expressions.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.680
And of course, we
have our pi out front.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.930
And I just want to
emphasize this is just

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.590
the chain rule right over here.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.060
The derivative of something
squared with respect to time

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.310
is going to be the derivative
of the something squared

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.559
with respect to the something.

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.960
So that's 2 times the
something, times the derivative

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.860
of that something
with respect to time.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.260
I can't emphasize enough.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.370
What we did right over here,
this is the chain rule.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.150
That is the chain rule.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.160
So we're left with
pi times this is

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.290
equal to the derivative of
our area with respect to time.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.534
Now let me rewrite
all this again

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:51.950
just so it cleans
up a little bit.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.050
So we have the derivative
of our area with respect

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.594
to time is equal to
pi times-- actually

00:05:58.594 --> 00:05:59.760
let me put that 2 out front.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.510
Is equal to 2 times
pi times-- I can now

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.990
switch back to just
calling this r.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.760
We know that r is
a function of t.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.970
So I'll just write 2
pi times r times dr dt.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.180
Actually, let me
make the r in blue.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.225
2 pi r dr dt.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.000
Now what do we know?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.150
We know what r is.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.390
We know that r, at this
moment right in time,

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.220
is 3 centimeters.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.410
Right now r is 3 centimeters.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.420
We know dr dt right now is
1 centimeter per second.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.840
We know this is 1
centimeter per second.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.160
So what's da dt
going to be equal to?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.720
Well, it's going to be equal
to-- do that same green-- 2

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:56.140
pi times 3 times 3
times 1 times-- that's

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.240
purple-- times 1
centimeter per second.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.190
And let's make sure we
get the units right.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.880
So we have a centimeter
times a centimeter.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.836
So it's going to be centimeters.

00:07:06.836 --> 00:07:07.960
That's too dark of a color.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.540
It's going to be square
centimeters, centimeters

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.250
times centimeters, square
centimeter per second, which

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.960
is the exact units we
need for a change in area.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.730
So we have da dt is equal to
this. da, the rate at which

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.400
area is changing with respect
to time, is equal to 6 pi.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:32.590
So it's going to be a little
bit over 18 centimeters squared

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:33.220
per second.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.100
Right at that moment.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.150
Yep, 3 times 2 pi.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.970
So 6 pi centimeters
squared per second

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.190
is how fast the
area is changing.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.830
And we are done.
