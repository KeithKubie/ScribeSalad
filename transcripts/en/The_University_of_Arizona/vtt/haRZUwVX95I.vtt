[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.050
Let me now introduce
you to Feryal Ozel,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.660
who is a professor of astronomy
and astrophysics in astronomy.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.550
She has made pioneering
contributions

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.490
to the physics of neutron
stars and black holes

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.130
as well as the co-evolution
of black holes and galaxies

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.540
in the universe.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.390
Feryal is a fellow of the
American Physical Society,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.790
current Guggenheim fellow.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.210
She received the Maria Goeppert
Mayer Award from the American

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.440
Physical Society, the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.570
Fellowships, the Bart
Bok Prize from Harvard,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.231
and the Miller Institute
Professorship from Berkeley.

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:44.980
She serves on a large
number of committees

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.470
for NASA and the National
Science Foundation.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.350
She's a chair of the Science
and Technology Definition Team

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.600
for NASA's next large x-ray
mission concept in Lynx.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.990
And she frequently appears
in TV documentaries

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.640
on PBS, BBC, and
the History Channel.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.297
Please, welcome Feryal Ozel.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:07.219
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.576 --> 00:01:13.550
Thank you.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.110
Good evening.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.050
It's very nice to see
so many of you here.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.930
And that guitar performance
is hard to follow.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.190
But I'm hoping to do
my best and take you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.460
on a journey tonight with
me for the next 45 minutes

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.090
or so to what we
call the extreme.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.510
So extreme places in the
universe, extreme places

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.330
in astrophysics
where you might think

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.480
science meets science fiction,
is this really science?

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.040
Are you sure you're
really an astrophysicist?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.650
And I'm going to
ask questions like,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.190
what makes up the
cores of neutron stars?

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.770
Don't worry if you don't know
what a neutron star is right

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.880
now or you're not sure exactly
what a black hole is right now.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.210
Hopefully by the end of the
talk, you will know these.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.290
And more importantly,
maybe we'll

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.610
be able to answer
the questions like,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.240
what particles make up the
cores of neutron stars?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.450
What is the dividing line
between more or less matter

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.740
as we know it, even
if it is in a state

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.020
that we don't
recognize on Earth,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.150
and what we call a singularity,
where black holes appear?

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.630
And are black holes
really what we predict?

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.660
Do they really have event
horizons that cut them off

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.670
from the rest of the universe?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.510
So these might be some
far-fetched questions,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.270
but really there are
underlying reasons

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.580
why we ask these questions.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.640
For example, we want to know
if our theories of physics

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.380
fail somewhere.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.240
We can design experiments.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.720
We can think of mathematical
frameworks in which we

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.580
explore physics, and we try to
push it to their boundaries.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.990
And the universe provides
us with ample places where

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.220
we can actually really
push that frontier and say,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.650
do they break somewhere?

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.570
Is there something
else that appears

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.430
that we don't know of yet?

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.470
Do they contradict each other?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.270
We have different
physics theories

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.090
that describe the
subatomic, like you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.990
heard in Keith Dienes' lecture
last week if you were here--

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.340
and I will introduce it
again a little bit today--

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.230
and gravity that acts on the
scales of stars and galaxies

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.060
and the entire universe.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.580
Is there ever a
tension between these,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.130
and can we exploit
that tension in order

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.330
to further our understanding
of physical reality?

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.250
And other questions like,
what experimental evidence

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.030
do we have for the physical
theories that we write down

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.330
here, mathematically
formulae, because physics

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.050
after all is based on evidence.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.130
It is based on facts that
are based on experiments.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.279
So whatever we can
think of, we would

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.010
like to see it in
order to believe it.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.070
We would like
quantitative data in order

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.230
to really move forward.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.030
So this is going to be the
backbone of my lecture.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.990
As we move to the brink
of a black hole, the edge

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.890
of a black hole, going from a
neutron star to a black hole,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.360
can we break our theories?

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.640
It might sound weird,
but that's actually

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.130
something that excites me.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.530
So before we go too far
down that rabbit hole,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.980
though, let me bring
you back to Earth,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.400
where we know what
atoms are made of.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.910
And we can test a lot of
our theories experimentally.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.920
So this is where
Keith Dienes left off,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.170
the building blocks of normal
matter, where we know matter

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.110
is made up of atoms
with nuclei that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.100
carry most of the mass and a
cloud of electrons around them

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.720
that make up most of the volume.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.570
So anything from water to one of
the densest elements on Earth,

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.720
platinum, just has
this structure.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.360
And platinum and water differ by
density by only a factor of 20.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.620
You might think 20 is large.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.200
Just wait.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.540
So under these
circumstances, there

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.200
are protons and neutrons
that make up matter.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.930
Now there are places
in the universe where

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.590
we start crushing matter
further and further

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.880
under the weight of gravity.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.850
And at that point,
the electrons that

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.180
make up the bulk
of the volume get

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.970
pushed into the nucleus
and start combining

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.870
with the protons, making more
and more neutron-rich matter.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.110
So at that point, we
have, if you will,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.320
a neutron soup that
is still in some ways

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.270
reminiscent of the nucleus.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.930
It's just that the
density has increased

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.420
by a very large factor.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.480
All the electrons are
now in the nucleus,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.980
and this matter that we
call neutron matter is now

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.200
extremely dense.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.390
Now there is a question
that we cannot answer by any

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.000
experimental evidence on Earth.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.410
Even when you make
neutrons matter and make it

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.350
this extremely dense
stuff, we still

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.970
think that the quarks, the
constituents of both protons

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.900
and neutrons in normal
matter, might remain bound.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.630
We've never seen a free quark.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.170
If we keep on squeezing
matter further and further,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.180
the free quarks appear.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.760
So can we ever reach
a form of matter

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.190
that we've never seen before?

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.830
And does this happen
in the universe?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.110
So think of taking
a bunch of grapes

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.780
and squeezing them further
and further and further.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.730
As one of my colleagues
likes to say,

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.370
eventually you will
get grape juice.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.010
So can we get to that point
somewhere in the universe where

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.680
we've squeezed matter so
hard that the constituents

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.560
of protons and
neutrons have broken up

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.400
to their original form,
which is free quarks?

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.820
So when I put this on some
line going from normal matter,

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.120
at lower density with
its electrons around,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.070
to neutron matter, is
there this next step

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.170
made up of free quarks?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.930
So from here to
here, take a guess

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.180
as to how many factors of 10
we have increased in density.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.280
Remember, from
water to something

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.840
like iron or platinum,
it's a factor of 20 2-0.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.950
From here to neutron
star cores where

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:38.030
we think this matter appears,
it is a factor of 100 trillion.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.549
That's why we can't
make it on Earth.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.000
We can temporarily form matter.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.160
We can probe the constituents
of the nuclei of atoms

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.430
by smashing particles
together like Elliott Cheu is

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.110
going to talk to you about.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.140
But that's a very
temporary state of matter.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.930
We can't make it
sustained, and therefore we

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.800
can't say if there is a stable
form of matter that actually

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.107
is made up of free quarks.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.180
That we can only do if
we find the right places

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.250
in the universe where
gravity comes to our help

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.080
because whatever
we can do on Earth

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.240
is limited by the
amount of force

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.270
that we can apply
to the particles.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.750
But out there in the
universe, our sun, which

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.310
is a pretty ordinary star--

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.880
I know we don't
like to hear that.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.890
But it's actually
kind of a wimpy star.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.620
Imagine the amount
of crushing force

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.960
it can apply inward to
every bit of that star.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:48.070
There are stars that are 300
times the mass of our sun.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:53.680
So gravity plays a huge
role in shaping everything

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.570
that we see in the universe.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:00.280
And in that state, we
think stable configurations

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.540
of this dense matter that
is 100 trillion times more

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:10.210
dense, that a teaspoonful would
weigh as much as a mountain,

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.070
can actually occur.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.930
This just means more matter
packed into a smaller volume,

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.350
so that's how much
it would weigh.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.340
In order to understand
what type of settings

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.370
would allow us to
reach that, let's just

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.060
think for a second of how
stars spend their lives.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.280
Actually, stars
spend their lives

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.150
fighting against this inward
pull of gravity, this crushing

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:43.090
force that they feel
just by their own weight,

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:47.170
the walls trying to
collapse onto them.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.980
But stars, during
their regular lives,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.540
produce a lot of energy--

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.530
produced heat, light
through nuclear reactions,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.130
combining hydrogen into
helium, helium into carbon.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.880
That's what generates the
energy that holds a star up.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:09.010
So a star is always a fight
between the inward pull

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.120
of gravity and the
outward push of pressure.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.230
During their lifetimes,
this pressure

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.320
is always equal to the
gravity, and it always

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.500
comes from the fusion
reactions that take place

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.900
at the cores of these stars.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.140
But a star has a
finite amount of fuel.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.770
Eventually, it will go
through all of its elements,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.610
fusing them, and run out
of the source of energy.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:42.610
When that happens, it starts
actually collapsing and losing

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:47.200
that pressure support that it
has enjoyed through its life

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.700
and gets to a point where
gravity seems to be winning.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.610
So at this point,
when all these atoms

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.890
are squeezed against
one another and turned

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.580
into this neutron-rich matter
that I was telling you about,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.500
there are two options.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.230
Either those neutrons,
pushing against one another,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:12.650
are going to win and
stop the collapse.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.220
And we will end up
with a neutron star.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.390
Or they will lose this
fight, and the walls

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.140
will come crushing down
on the entire star.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.850
And we will end
up with something

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.910
that shrinks
infinitely to the core,

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.910
and we will end up
with a black hole.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.640
So thinking back to the
very first questions

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:41.540
that I tried to present to you,
as far as rethinking reality,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.690
I said, do our
physical theories fail?

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.280
And do they
contradict each other?

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.510
This is an excellent place
to look because you've

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.940
pushed gravity to its extreme.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.540
You've pushed your understanding
of particles to its extreme.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.820
And they are in this fight
for their lives basically.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:06.080
So it's that interface that I've
been studying for the last 20

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.690
years or so.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.450
Ever since I was a
graduate student,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.420
I have been fascinated
with what happens

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.270
if the outcome is a
neutron star, what happens

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.660
if the outcome is a black hole.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.880
So let's go a
little bit further.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.500
First, follow the first
path that I just mentioned,

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:32.140
which is let's say that the
neutrons that are formed

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.090
can stop the collapse.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.450
But there are still
those nagging questions.

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.740
Is it just neutrons, or do we
actually encounter free quarks

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.420
in that advanced state?

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.830
How do we answer that question?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.370
So it turns out even
though they are tiny--

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.600
they are give or take
15 miles across--

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.910
and even though they
are very distant--

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.030
so take the size
of a city that's

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.760
much smaller than
Tucson, and put it

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.950
at astronomical
distances where we

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.610
can't send probes
to actually find out

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.470
what's in the interior--

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:17.030
it turns out that neutron stars
aren't very shy about revealing

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.490
what's in their interior.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.060
And the reason for
this is the following.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.000
If the interior
is pure neutrons,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
like in the first case
that I showed you,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.360
it turns out they can withstand
a little bit more pressure

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.630
if they don't dissolve into
their quark constituents

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:40.460
and can make stars that are
a little bit bigger in size

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.370
and a little bit
heavier, more massive.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:48.770
Whereas if they do dissolve
into their core constituents

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.550
and become some sort of a
quark star or a hybrid star,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.120
then they can not
support as much mass.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.592
And they tend to
be smaller in size.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.620
What we've been trying
to do is measure

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.850
the sizes of neutron stars and
the masses of neutron stars

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:14.950
to see if they look more
like this or more like this.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:20.440
Now these are tiny objects, very
massive, but tiny and far away.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.450
So again, we can't send probes.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.370
We can't go near them.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.760
We'll have to use the light
that's emitted by them

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.720
and reach our telescopes
either on Earth or in orbit

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.910
around the Earth in
satellites in order

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.010
to answer this question.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:39.060
So what do we do?

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.810
We weigh them.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.490
It's not that hard.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.350
How do we weigh the sun?

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.760
We don't go there with a scale.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.360
What we do is follow
the motions of things

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.080
that are orbiting the
sun, in our case planets,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.200
and apply the same
principles to things

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.280
that are orbiting a neutron
star and use Kepler's laws.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.180
Kepler wrote down these laws
several hundred years ago,

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.610
and it works.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.830
This could be another
neutron star orbiting

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.480
around the neutron star.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:16.300
This could be a normal star
orbiting around the neutron

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.370
star, but the same
principle will apply.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.540
So we weigh them.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.556
How big are they?

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:29.990
Can they have quark cores, or
do they have neutron cores?

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.720
And we measure their sizes.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.350
Again, sort of like a
ruler, but what we really do

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.930
is collect all the light
that comes from the sun.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:43.430
This is, again, very similar
to what we do for normal stars.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.130
We separate that light
into its components,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.090
into different wavelengths,
and form a spectrum.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:54.500
And the combination of the total
light emitted by the neutron

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.460
star and the breakdown
of that light

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.150
into its elements,
the spectrum, gives us

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:07.220
an exact measure of the size
that is emitting that light.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.589
So this is a
technique that we use.

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.250
And in the past few years, we've
actually made a breakthrough

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.730
in this technique, both
because of more sophisticated

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:21.890
calculations and better data
that we were able to obtain.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:30.800
And so far all the data that we
have points to smaller stars,

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.700
so something more like
12 miles across as

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.890
opposed to more like
18 miles across.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.260
We can tell the difference.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:45.850
It's mind boggling that
these faraway objects can

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.150
differ by such small amounts and
yet we can tell the difference.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:53.920
But they turn out to
be the smaller kind.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.420
So what we think is happening
with the current data

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.060
is that free quarks
most likely appear

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:03.190
in the cores of neutron stars.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.760
If this result holds,
if we subject it

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.150
to many independent
tests, find other ways

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.870
of weighing them and
measuring their sizes,

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.600
and we believe our
result at the end,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.720
it would be the first time
anywhere in the universe

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.560
that we have evidence
for a state of matter

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.090
that is made up of free quarks.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.850
The second thing that
this result tells us,

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.130
all the data that
we've gathered,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:37.020
is that anything that's more
massive than about twice

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.160
the mass of our sun is bound
to collapse into a black hole.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.480
So there is no stable neutron
star configuration or quark

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.480
star configuration
that will hold up

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.410
anything against collapse that
is more massive than about

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.923
twice the mass of our sun.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:03.580
So the regime we are
in is that we have now

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.280
pushed matter,
squeezed matter down so

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:12.230
much that nothing can stop
its collapse against gravity.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.510
So what happens?

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.300
I said in that diagram,
a black hole forms,

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.090
but I haven't really
introduced black holes to you.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.720
In order to do that, I'm
going to take a tiny detour

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:26.080
and talk a little bit
more about gravity

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.550
and tell you why black holes
are inevitable in our current

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.180
understanding of gravity.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.240
So, of course, in
order to do that,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.080
we go to our friend,
Albert Einstein,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:47.110
who is one of the people who
rethought reality in many ways,

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.720
in almost all of
his contributions.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.180
But probably the
most phenomenal one

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.610
is when he rethought gravity.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:00.230
Any other force, any other
interaction in physics,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.610
we write it down as a
force between particles

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.820
and interactions that take
place between two particles.

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.880
Until Einstein
came along, when we

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.730
had Newton's
formulation of gravity,

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.320
the same thing was true.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.170
Gravity was an interaction
between two masses,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.970
and that's how Newton's
theory was formulated.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.470
However, when you look
at Newton's theory,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.890
it's actually incompatible
with the special theory

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.840
of relativity, which
Einstein had worked

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.270
out several years earlier.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.450
So he thought, hmm.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.760
These two theories contradict.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.860
That is a great place to look.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.020
When your physical theories that
have been individually tested

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.800
start conflicting
with each other,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.240
the discovery potential
there is huge.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.090
And that's exactly what
Einstein used in order

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.170
to rethink our
understanding of gravity.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:04.760
And what he said is that
actually gravity is not a force

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.810
at all.

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:11.090
Gravity is just a geometrical
bending of spacetime.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.270
So in some ways, we can
picture this, right?

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.110
We can take a fabric, put
four people on its corners,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.680
stretch it out.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.650
And then let's say we put
a cannonball at the center.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:23.900
What do we expect?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.390
We expect that fabric to bend.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.700
So Einstein applied
the same principles

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:30.920
to now not just
the normal fabric,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.920
but the fabric of
space and time,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.470
and said, every
object with a mass--

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.420
let's say our sun--

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:48.610
bends, makes these curvatures
in the space and time around it.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:52.810
So in this geometrical
formulation,

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.240
there are immediate
consequences.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.740
If you bend the space
of fabric and time--

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:00.520
so let's go back to
our cannonball example.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.820
Now take a small marble
and put it on that fabric.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.390
What is it going to do?

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.250
It's going to go down that path.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.870
It's going to follow
that spacetime,

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.720
except that that
spacetime will be curved.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.910
So what Einstein said is that
not only matter, but light,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.050
will also follow these
curvatures of spacetime.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.720
So let's say that we are
sitting here on Earth.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.830
We are looking behind our sun.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.420
The sun has bent the paths of
all the light coming to us,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:40.520
which means that a star that is
actually here and emitting its

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.030
light in all directions-- and
some of it reaches us here

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.140
on Earth--

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.000
has to follow this
down and back up

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.890
of that curved
fabric of spacetime.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.810
Now this is just like a lens.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.170
If you put a glass of
water, it bends the light

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.450
that goes through that water.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.320
So what's the net result?

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.390
An observer sitting
here on Earth

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.190
would think that
the light actually

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.630
came from here, because we just
follow it back in its path.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.630
And we would think that
the star is actually

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.570
here because of that
bending of light.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.140
Kind of strange, is it true?

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.800
So this is now 1915.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.710
Einstein formulated
this entire theory

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.050
that explained
some of the things

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.110
that Newton's theory of
gravity couldn't explain.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.720
But there was no
experimental evidence

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.280
that this was actually what
was going on until Sir Arthur

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:51.870
Eddington took advantage
of a solar eclipse

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.740
in order to arrange an
expedition to a small island

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.170
off the west coast of Africa.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.104
And here is what they did.

00:24:00.104 --> 00:24:01.770
I know this is a
little bit hard to see,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.250
but it's the original image.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.090
So I wanted to
share that with you.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.490
This is now 1919.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:14.110
And what they say is
that, OK, if the sun

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:19.940
is in our line of sight, and we
are looking at stars behind it,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.180
then we should see this
shift in their position,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.840
in the perceived
location of those stars.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.060
Now when the sun
is up in the sky,

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.740
obviously we can't see
the stars behind it.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.130
That's why the solar
eclipse was so important.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.070
It blocked the
light from the sun

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:42.590
for six minutes, enough for them
to see where those stars are.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:47.060
And they compared this to
data taken six months prior

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:52.160
when the sun was on the other
side of the Earth's orbit.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.030
And they saw--

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.150
I don't know if you
can make it out--

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.060
this shift in the positions
of stars in the sky.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.260
This one is not visible, but
hopefully you can see these.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.950
So this is data combined from
the solar eclipse with those

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.700
taken six months
apart, when the sun was

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.160
in the other direction,
when it wasn't

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.460
giving this curvature to the
spacetime in front of us.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.540
So this became instant success
because seeing is believing.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.830
And it was on the cover of all
major publications of the time.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.880
Basically, the day after Sir
Arthur Eddington took the data,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.460
Einstein became an
instant success.

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.290
And this is the cover of "The
New York Times" from 1919.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.320
And "men of science
more or less agog over

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.090
results of eclipse observation."

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.030
So basically, it changed
people's world view,

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:54.140
that, yes, this geometrical
formulation of gravity

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.250
is the right one.

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.270
And Einstein's
theory is correct.

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:02.130
So if it naturally
predicts this what

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:07.950
we call gravitational lensing
in the sense that paths of light

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:14.220
are bent and masses act like
lenses, just like the lenses

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.350
that we know that make
things look distorted,

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.980
so if this gravitational
lensing happens,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.370
then we should be able to see
it elsewhere in the universe.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.930
And, indeed, we do.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.470
One of the places that
we see this beautifully

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:34.460
is clusters of galaxies where
there is so much mass packed

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:40.730
into a small volume that all the
background galaxies are lensed.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.900
And this is a Hubble
Space Telescope image.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.480
Showing the giant blue arc.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.300
It's also called
an Einstein ring.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.240
This is actually one
galaxy that happens to be

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.810
behind this galaxy cluster.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:03.560
And because light is now coming
to us from all directions,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.240
encompassing that
galaxy cluster,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.020
we see it as a ring in the
sky, even though it's one point

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.840
object behind this cluster.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.840
So gravitational
lensing happens.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.770
Take this to its
next logical step.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.600
Now I have a neutron star.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.990
I have packed so much
matter into a small volume,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.270
it's going to curve
the spacetime around it

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.130
pretty drastically.

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:39.100
What if I cross that one extra
step and put so much matter in

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.470
that now it's
collapsing inwards,

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.190
and all the light
paths are bent inwards?

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.500
I mean, all the light paths.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.090
There is no light that's
approaching that object that

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.350
can make its way out.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:59.020
So they are lensed inwards
so much that they're

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.080
absorbed by that mass.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.876
That is what we
call a black hole.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.850
Let me just show you, if we
were able to take our journey

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.050
physically into a black
hole, what our computer

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.990
simulations, actual
calculations,

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.070
would show as far as what
our journey would look like.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:29.130
So we are going to
now in the next movie

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.190
that I'm going to show you
dive into a black hole.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.550
On the lower-left corner, you're
going to see our trajectory.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.640
We are not going straight.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.480
We are kind of
taking a swirly path.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.160
And we're going to cross
that point of no return

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.930
called the event horizon, OK?

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:52.940
And even though it looks like
the black hole is moving,

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.850
actually what's happening
is we are moving.

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.090
This is our trajectory,
and this is just

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.566
a grid painted on there.

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:02.190
Of course, you wouldn't
see this if you

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:08.750
were falling into a black
hole, but it's there just

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.930
to make it clear.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.170
But it's there to show
you that, for example, you

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.920
would see the two poles
of a sphere at once

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.450
because everything
is bent inwards.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.110
And we are approaching
the horizon.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:24.380
The red circle here
is the horizon.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.190
Look at what happens.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.190
All the lines that
were behind us

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.010
and all the lines that
were in front of us

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.510
now collapse into one.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:36.220
We are now in the singularity.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.410
So it would look
something like this.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.540
And if I could, I
would go and enjoy it.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.160
I wouldn't be able
to report back

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.190
to you what it looked like.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.940
And I don't think I can convince
a graduate student to go.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.960
So we are going to do
the next best thing.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.660
We can't go there, but we know
what a black hole should do

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.270
to any light that is around it.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.720
And we've known this
since the '70s actually.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:12.280
There are calculations,
literally hand-drawn diagrams

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.690
and long pages of
calculations, calculus,

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:22.570
that people have carried
out as far back as 1973

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.780
to tell us the telltale
signature of a black hole.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.770
There is something
that is uniquely

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:32.980
predicted by the
existence of a black hole.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.750
And that is that shadow, that
silhouette that it leaves

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.210
on the light surrounding it.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:44.110
In the early calculations, the
pen-and-paper calculations,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.920
they imagined a source of
light, somebody kindly holding

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.980
a flashlight behind
the black hole for us

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:55.540
and what it would look like
if this was a black hole,

00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:00.490
what it should look like if
we could take a picture of it.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.310
And what they said
is that there should

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.870
be a bright ring of light.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:12.540
And interior to it, there
should be absolute darkness.

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:14.940
That is the telltale signature.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.960
It's a shadow.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.790
It's a silhouette.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:22.860
And that would define
that point, that presence

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.190
of the event horizon
where we are disconnected

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.520
from the universe, where
the rest of the black hole

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:32.720
is disconnected
from the universe.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.870
Again, why are we
looking for this?

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.450
Let's think back to
some of our questions.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:42.510
We now want evidence
that this actually

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:45.890
happens, not just
gravitational lensing happens,

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.040
not just that the
photon paths are bent.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:53.090
This is a logical conclusion
of general relativity.

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.480
It's almost inevitable.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.980
And yet at the same
time, it is so bizarre.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:02.650
It is bizarre because
it's predicting regions

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.380
of the universe that are
completely disconnected

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.010
from the other regions, that
information goes in but doesn't

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.600
come back out.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:14.950
And, two, it actually
contradicts everything else

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:18.340
that we know about particle
physics because in particle

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.160
physics, where we formulate
things as an interaction,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.230
as a force, what we say is
that if I combine two particles

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.950
and make a third one, the
reverse reaction should always

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.420
be possible, too.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.080
It may not happen often,
but it should be possible.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.450
If I go in this
direction, I should be

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.580
able to go in this direction.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:41.800
Clearly, that's
breaking down here.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.830
I can go in, but I
can't come back out.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:48.370
So if I now try to write
the laws of particle physics

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:52.900
around the event horizon,
I get nonsensical results.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.260
Again, our theories are
clashing with each other.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.020
Even though they are
individually well tested,

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.000
they are taking us
to a place where

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.240
it might be fruitful
to really look at,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.160
is physics breaking down?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.340
Do we have to rethink reality?

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.190
That's what's so
attractive about looking

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.210
around black holes and
looking for signatures

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:20.410
of this black hole
event horizon.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:24.100
As time went on,
in about year 2000

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.220
we started doing more
realistic calculations

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.920
where somebody didn't have to
hold the flashlight for us.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.970
But the source of the
light was actually

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.810
the hot gas that's swirling
around the black hole itself.

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.450
Because black holes
have such a strong pull,

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.730
they pull gas from
stars or clouds

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:45.880
or whatever might cross
their path around them.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.120
And as this matter swirls
around and makes its way

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.550
towards the black
hole, it heats up

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.580
because it's gaining
so much energy

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:59.920
from this gravitational field
that it heats up and starts

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.240
emitting light.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.000
So we started being
able to do somewhat more

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.500
realistic calculations
right around the year 2000,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.199
and this is one of those images.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:16.810
Now instead of a donut
like you see on this one,

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:18.940
this is more a crescent.

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.750
The reason for that is the
light is no longer uniformly

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:24.250
coming from the back.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:27.760
But it's coming from the
swirling, hot plasma, which

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.850
means that the part that's
moving towards the observer

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.139
is brighter.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.719
And the part, just
like an ambulance siren

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:37.420
that is higher pitch when it
comes towards you and lower

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.909
pitch as it's going
away from you,

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.010
one side becomes
brighter than the other.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:46.510
So instead of
looking for a donut,

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:49.510
we should really be
looking for a crescent.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.389
It still has this other
side, but it should really

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:55.010
be brighter here.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:35:02.420
Now since the year 2000,
a lot has happened.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.130
And a lot has happened both on
the experimental side, where

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.400
we actually started
a campaign to take

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.130
a picture of a black
hole, and on the theory

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:16.630
side, where we had to know what
really we were looking for.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.000
Everything that I've
shown you so far

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.100
has been highly idealized.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.570
So if you want us to
now take this concept--

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.900
that is look for the
shadow of a black hole,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:33.970
take a picture of it, and apply
it to a real-life experiment--

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.520
you would fail, because
of all the complexities

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.430
you haven't taken into account.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:43.510
So what we have done here
at the University of Arizona

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.370
is develop new computational
techniques, new algorithms,

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:51.820
that allow us to do these
calculations millions

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.310
of times faster than it
has been possible before.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.290
And, in fact, it has
been such a breakthrough

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:04.360
that I want to show you not an
animation that we did with it,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:09.640
but a movie of one of our
research associates, CK Chan,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.280
actually running the
simulation in real time.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.900
And we filmed him
running the simulation.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.610
What made that possible?

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:22.960
What made it possible is that
little graphics processor unit

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.470
that you have on your
phones, on your laptops.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.680
Instead of the
CPU, we now started

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.560
using the graphics card, GPUs.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.010
And it's almost like
writing a computer game,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.150
except that it's not.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.030
It's solving the equations
of general relativity.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:44.410
But making use of that graphics
processor unit, as I said,

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:49.100
we sped it up many, many
orders of magnitude.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:53.200
So what you're going to
see here is this hand.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.210
And there is a
motion sensor device

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.100
that's sitting right here.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.160
We programmed it so it
would read hand gestures

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.770
like your Wii or Xbox.

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.230
And this is the black hole.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:09.370
And he's going to shoot a
million photons, a million rays

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.900
of light, at this
black hole all at once.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.960
So let's see.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.550
He's initialising
the simulation.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:21.510
He's running time forward.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.960
So you see that wall of
light running and being

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:29.090
rendered visually in real time.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:33.440
Now we can zoom in and look at
all the light that's already

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.570
trapped around this black hole.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.100
Their paths have been changed.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.690
Some of them already went in.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.300
Some of them are just circling
around the black hole,

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.210
depending on how
close they came to it.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.910
Running time forward again,
and now running time backward.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:48.576
Why not?

00:37:48.576 --> 00:37:49.950
We are allowed to
do that, right?

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.390
It's a computer simulation.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.040
So now he's going
to zoom back out.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.910
And you're going to see the
effect of this black hole

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:01.630
on this.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.360
So these are all
the light rays that

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.080
traveled a little bit
longer and got left behind.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.260
And when we run time
backwards and zoom out,

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.480
there it is, the shadow
of the black hole.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.800
Now again, this is
highly idealized,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.980
but I want you to understand
that this is running

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.850
on his laptop, on a single GPU.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:33.410
And our goal is to be able
to scale this up and really

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:38.090
look at swirling, hot
plasma around a black hole

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:41.480
and calculate this
for every situation

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.330
that we can think of
and in order to take it

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.550
from this realm of theory into
what is really experimentally

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.560
visible.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.990
So in order to do
that, of course,

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:57.810
we couldn't rely on
individual GPUs on laptops.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:03.110
So the University of
Arizona, a number of us,

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.320
applied for the National
Science Foundation grant.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.910
And we brought a GPU cluster
to the University of Arizona

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:16.250
that we lovingly named
El Gato, the cat.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.830
And that was a
major breakthrough.

00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:24.800
Even this amount of investment
in computational facilities,

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:30.440
in hardware, in theory,
really gives enormous results.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:36.100
With this, we were number seven
for a small period of time

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.310
on the world's Green500 list,
meaning the highest number

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.440
of computations you
can do with the least

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.780
amount of energy spent.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.110
These glories don't last very
long in the computer world,

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:51.530
but so we were super happy to
be number seven in the world

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.550
here at the U of A.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.320
And this allowed us to
really scale up our game

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.860
and, as I said, take it
from that realm of this

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:08.600
is what general
relativity predicts--

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.450
this is what our theory
of gravity predicts-- to,

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:15.220
OK, let's turn this
into a real experiment.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.130
And I'm going to skip this.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.720
So what do you need
in order to take

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:26.340
a picture of that shadow of the
event horizon of a black hole?

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.040
You need a few things
to go in your favor.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.830
First one, it's kind of obvious.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.010
You want the Earth's
atmosphere to be transparent.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:39.110
You know some
wavelengths of light

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.480
can't penetrate
through our atmosphere,

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.520
so we would like to
do this experiment

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.140
at a wavelength
that can actually

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.880
make it through our atmosphere.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.210
We want the galaxy
to be transparent.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.620
We are going to be looking
for nearby black holes

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.040
and the light emitted from
them to look for this crescent

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.120
or donut.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.730
And we are going to
snap a picture of it.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.030
So if the light
doesn't make it to you

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.050
between the black hole
and your telescopes,

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.360
then you're not going
to get a good picture,

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.750
as every photographer knows.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.380
There is another component.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.670
We have been talking about
this hot gas swirling

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.270
around a black hole.

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.090
And what if that
obscures your view?

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:28.450
So you need to pick a wavelength
where you have enough light so

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.700
that there is this
shadow forming

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.690
against that backdrop of
light, but it's not so much

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:36.100
that it's obscuring your view.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.530
You need to be able to see down.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.630
So this is one of
the simulations

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.360
that we've done using El Gato.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.150
What you are going
to see is we are

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:48.310
going to change the
wavelength at which we

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.050
are looking at the black hole.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:55.510
Initially, you'll see this
huge plasma blocking our view.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:42:02.400
And as I run this forward
and increase the frequency,

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.470
or decrease the
wavelength at which we're

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.080
observing the black
hole, what you'll see

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.110
is at right around 1 millimeter
this crescent appearing here.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:19.220
So three requirements-- the
atmosphere to be transparent,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.340
1 millimeter actually
fulfills that criteria.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.530
The galaxy to be
transparent, 1 millimeter

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.600
is a good wavelength to look at.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.150
And the plasma
around the black hole

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.200
to be transparent
so that all you see

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.990
is that crescent, 1
millimeter fulfills that.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.880
So it's a very
lucky coincidence.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.740
And we've been working,
again, with all

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.340
of these types of simulations
at very large scales in order

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.850
to look at any complexity
that might come our way.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:50.770
So there is a
fourth requirement,

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.650
which I didn't write down,
but it's kind of obvious.

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.240
This thing that
you're looking for

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.190
should be big enough in the
sky for you to be able to see.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.010
So you might think, well,
where is the closest

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.180
black hole that we know of?

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.310
Is that what we're going after?

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.460
There are about 30 black holes
that we know of in our galaxy

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.980
that we definitively
know through other means,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.190
for example, stars
circling around them,

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.920
that they are black holes.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.570
Most of them, all except one,
tend to be about 10 times

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:23.950
the mass of our sun.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:30.200
So they are kind of close,
but they are very, very small,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:34.450
which means that
the size in the sky

00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:36.820
is not something
that we can measure.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.710
But there is one black
hole at the center

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.560
of our galaxy, the
center of Milky Way,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.790
called Sagittarius A star,
Sag A star for short.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:48.260
And that one, even though
it's farther away--

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.050
it's all the way at the
center of our galaxy--

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.140
it actually fulfills
the requirement

00:43:53.140 --> 00:44:00.500
of being large enough
to be visible to us

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.760
as long as you have an
Earth-sized telescope.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.136
How hard can that be?

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:17.580
OK, so our best target
is Sagittarius A star.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.980
It's shadow size,
for those of you

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.040
who actually know the
sizes of things in the sky,

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.420
is 50 microarcseconds.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:28.620
How tiny is that?

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.830
That's like putting a donut
on the moon and saying,

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.320
take a picture of it.

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.090
That's how big it is in the sky.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.790
But again, if you have
an Earth-sized telescope,

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:41.450
that's OK.

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:44.250
You can do it.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:46.860
Unfortunately, the
National Science Foundation

00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:50.070
gives us money for El Gato,
but for some reason not

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.590
for an Earth-sized telescope.

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.830
So we go to the next
best alternative,

00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:01.690
which is we pretend we have
an Earth-sized telescope.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.610
What that means
is that we hook up

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.820
telescopes that are
scattered across the Earth

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.510
and use a technique
called interferometry.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:12.100
The name doesn't matter.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.200
All it means is
that you are looking

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.230
at a distant
object, in this case

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.920
your crescent with your shadow.

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.000
And you're looking at it with
telescopes across the Earth

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.920
at the same time.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.370
And you're recording
your signals

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:34.630
with such high precision,
with an atomic clock, which

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.490
are the hydrogen-maser
clocks that

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.550
are at each radio telescope.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.470
And you are recording
so much data

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:44.890
as these wavefronts come
in and hit your telescope

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.940
that after the fact you
can take these data drives,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.570
and you can combine them and
look for a signal of where

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:53.680
they match up.

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:57.490
Where they match up, you
get this booming signal

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:02.980
that tells you how big was
the object that emitted it.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.720
It's like treating the
Earth like a telescope dish.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.090
Obviously, you're not going
to have the collecting

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.790
power of that dish,
but you're going

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:17.520
to have the resolving
power of that dish.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.820
So we then send this to
correlators, right now

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:25.500
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and there

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.320
is a backup one in Germany.

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:34.050
And we've been building this
Event Horizon Telescope, both

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:38.640
the array and the collaboration
and all the data analysis tools

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.750
and the theory,
for about 15 years,

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:45.000
starting in the year 2000.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.460
And Arizona has been
involved since the beginning,

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.800
not just for the
theoretical calculations

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.050
that I already told
you about, but also

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:56.820
because of our submillimeter
telescope, this telescope that

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:00.690
allows us to do the
1-millimeter observations right

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:02.410
here in Arizona.

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:05.670
So the array over
the 15 years has

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.300
grown to include these
9 telescopes that

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.090
span the Earth from
the South Pole,

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:19.220
to the Atacama Desert in Chile,
to Mexico, to Arizona, Hawaii,

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.220
and a couple of
stations in Europe.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.880
And some of the dishes existed.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.320
Other ones we had to outfit.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.970
And here is the principle
that we are operating under.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:34.790
We are going to look at
as the Earth rotates,

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:38.560
we are going to be looking
at it with as many subsets

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.310
of these nine dishes as
we can at any given time,

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:46.390
record the data, and
then combine it in order

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:50.640
to form the picture
after the fact

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.870
and see if the shadow
is there and if it's

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:58.290
as big as general
relativity tells us it is.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:01.350
It's a very clean
experiment in some ways.

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:03.650
There is no wiggle room.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:06.440
The donut needs to be
there, the crescent,

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.780
and it needs to be
a particular size.

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:14.110
So for some of the
telescopes, the dish

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.130
was there but the
appropriate receiver

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:20.080
that we needed to use
in order to record

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.970
the data were not there.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.820
This is another U of A
contribution to the Event

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:26.200
Horizon Telescope.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.440
My colleague Dan
Maroney's lab here

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.560
in the astronomy department,
he's a professor.

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:38.590
And he and his team have
built the millimeter receiver

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:41.470
for the South Pole
telescope, all shiny.

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.320
I mean, obviously how
beautiful is this gold?

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.540
It's a very good conductor.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.860
So it just keeps the temperature
uniform across this receiver

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.140
and reduces the
noise that you get.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:56.980
And I just like it
because it's shiny.

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.920
So he wants to know why
he let's me in his lab,

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.270
and I look at it, but not
anymore because they have taken

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.310
it down to the South Pole.

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:08.890
This is now Dan on a balmy day.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:10.990
He's thrown off his jacket.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.540
And this is how we treat
our graduate students.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:16.250
This is Jun Han
Kim, who slaved away

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.230
on this instrument for
about three years now.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:24.760
It's really a beautiful
success story.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.310
And this is the purple cover
that they put on that receiver.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:32.090
They are installing it in the
South Pole Telescope Dish.

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:35.200
The South Pole Telescope Dish
does many other experiments,

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.770
but it is part of the Event
Horizon Telescope Array,

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:42.990
now with the addition
of this receiver.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:44.670
They did some testing.

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:49.140
This is between the APEX
and the Atacama Desert, one

00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.530
of the telescopes that is in
the array, and the South Pole

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:53.610
Telescope.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:58.350
And as I said, when it works,
when the two stations can

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:03.310
record the data faithfully and
then combine it after the fact,

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:05.640
this is the kind of
signal that you get.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.390
And obviously, this has
been a success story.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:14.190
So what we expect to see
for Sagittarius A star,

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.010
this is now a movie
rather than a still.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:19.560
Because of the plasma
swirling around,

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.170
there are some fluctuations
in the brightness that we see.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:27.190
But ultimately, that
crescent is always there.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.270
So now if I combine
all of these images

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:36.250
and show you what the computer
simulation should look like,

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:41.890
and now pretend that this was
processed through all nine

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.200
stations and recombines.

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.880
Then this is what the
expected data looks like.

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.620
We are all ready.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.260
We are ready from the getting
the nine stations ready point

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:56.760
of view.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.880
We are ready from the data
analysis point of view.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.820
And our first full
array observation

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.910
is going to be in the
first week of April.

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:15.690
Thank you.

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.030
Keep your fingers
crossed because we need

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:20.130
good weather in nine stations.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:24.900
And if we can't get
it all this time,

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.170
obviously we are going to keep
on doing this experiment now

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.270
that all our tools are ready.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:33.710
But April is around the corner.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.550
I'm going to be at the SNT,
even though I'm not needed.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.080
I just want to be there.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.335
And hopefully, we are going
to come up with something

00:51:44.335 --> 00:51:48.410
that either proves the
theory of relativity

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:52.310
or, even better, maybe
conflicts with it,

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:55.970
maybe shows us some signs of
where we should be looking

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:58.580
when we rethink reality again.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:51:59.480
Thank you.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.530
[APPLAUSE]
