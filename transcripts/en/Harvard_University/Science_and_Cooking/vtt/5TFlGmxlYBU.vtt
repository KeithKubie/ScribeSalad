00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:21.150
DAVID WEITZ: So welcome, everybody.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.460
We have certain traditions
in this lecture.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.870
If you haven't been here, I will
teach you about our traditions.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:34.270
First of all, you know, these lectures
are associated with a lecture series,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.810
a class at Harvard.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.360
It's a science and cooking class.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.320
And so we may see equations.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.255
And if we do, what do we do?

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.390
I see only a small fraction
know that we have to do that.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.690
Everybody has to do that if
you happen to see an equation.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
Also, just to encourage people
to come to these public lectures,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.170
we have a quiz about the last
lecture, and we give out prizes.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.940
Where did our prizes-- oh.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.460
Can we show a prize?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.717
So it's an apron with
all the equations on it.

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:21.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.360
OK.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.630
So those of you who were
here at the last lecture

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.740
will have a little bit of a head
start, but anybody can answer.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.610
And just raise your hand
as quickly as you can.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.580
And if I see you first, I'll ask you.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.446
So from before, why does sparkling water
taste so different from normal water?

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:43.959
AUDIENCE: It has carbon dioxide.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.000
DAVID WEITZ: Oh, come on.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.660
That's easy.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.650
Why?

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.620
What does it do?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.452
Anybody else?

00:01:51.452 --> 00:01:56.853
AUDIENCE: The carbon dioxide comes
up from the-- or through the water.

00:01:56.853 --> 00:01:58.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:00.480
DAVID WEITZ: I'm going to be tough.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.350
It's carbon dioxide.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.850
So what?

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.509
AUDIENCE: Makes it acidic.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270
DAVID WEITZ: Ah, he wins.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.680
It's acidic.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.820
So what did we learn?

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.979
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.378
Do you know what the pH is?

00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:15.050
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I wasn't here for that.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.716
DAVID WEITZ: Oh.

00:02:15.716 --> 00:02:17.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.790
It's 4.5.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.040
And it turns out that all good foods are
much more likely to be acidic than they

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.510
are to be basic or even neutral.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.620
And so that's why.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.350
So sorry.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.930
You missed the main point.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.330
OK.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.280
Harold talked about tea, and we
had black tea and green tea and--

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.420
AUDIENCE: Oolong.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.770
DAVID WEITZ: Oolong tea.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.380
Very good.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.356
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:52.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.550
DAVID WEITZ: Two lessons.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.690
If you're closer to the front, it helps.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.230
And if you come to the-- if
you come to the next lecture,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.290
you'll be all set for this quiz.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.240
Let me hand it back to Pia.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.530
PIA SORENSEN: OK, thanks Dave.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.829
So I thought we should
go into this lecture.

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.620
So very soon, I'm going
to introduce Lidia.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.880
But I thought we should just
start pondering a few questions

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.880
that we can keep with us as
we go through the lecture.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.610
And the question I want to
ask is, what is cooking?

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.770
So when you cook, what is
the definition of cooking?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.760
Are there any ideas?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.480
No aprons.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.720
Well, actually, we have one apron left.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.640
Any ideas?

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.740
What is the definition of cooking?

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.125
All the way in the back.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.610
AUDIENCE: Altering raw
ingredients with heat.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.800
PIA SORENSEN: Altering
raw ingredients with heat.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.895
Good.

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:47.800
Any other ideas?

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.172
Yeah?

00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:55.028
AUDIENCE: Altering the chemical
structure of ingredients so you can

00:03:55.028 --> 00:03:56.474
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:57.970
PIA SORENSEN: Uh-huh.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.300
Altering the chemical
structure of the ingredients.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.350
Anything else?

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.662
Yeah?

00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:10.372
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] together
to make the food edible.

00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:11.080
PIA SORENSEN: OK.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.270
Make the food edible.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.640
I like that.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.730
So if you go to the
Oxford English Dictionary,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.041
it says, "To prepare
or make ready food."

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.290
So that's kind of along the
lines where you're saying.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.540
And then it mentions the heat.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.790
It says, "To make fit for eating
by due application of heat

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.990
as by boiling, baking,
roasting, broiling, et cetera."

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.400
So I would probably argue that
cooking is a very broad term.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.650
How you define it is kind
of a philosophical question.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.500
But the fact that you
apply heat, I think

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.200
that is one of the things that comes
foremost to mind for a lot of us,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.740
that you somehow add heat in some way.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.350
So that I want you to keep in mind.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.040
And the next question to
ask is, well, how much heat

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.130
do you have to add to food to cook it?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.850
Like, when is it cooked?

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.250
And I would say that this depends on--

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.530
so you want to add some
heat to food, some cue.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.340
That's barely an
equation, but thank you.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:18.820
There is an equal sign,
so it's an equation.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.170
Good.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.520
Good.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.020
Good.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.050
Good.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.962
So I would say--

00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:26.920
so if something is very big, you're
going to have to add a lot of heat,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.220
right?

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.928
If something's very small, you're
going to have to add less heat.

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:33.366
So I would say that the
mass is important, right?

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:36.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.390
And then I would say, well, it kind
of depends on what kind of food it is.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.812
Let's say you're cooking pasta, or let's
say you're just cooking a marshmallow.

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.770
They have very different
textures, so maybe you

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.200
have to add different amounts of
heat to the food to make it cooked.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.950
And for that in science,
we have something

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.610
called the specific heat, which is CP.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.480
See, you'll get tired doing this.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.000
And then I would say, well, it depends
on how hot you want to make the food.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.240
So if you just want to heat it up
a little bit and make it lukewarm,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.698
you don't have to add as much heat.

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:11.750
But if you want to make
it really sizzling hot,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.208
then you have to add a lot of heat.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.739
So it depends on the
temperature difference, right?

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:18.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.220
And now-- and now if I
put all of this together,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.890
I get the equation of the week.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.734
Now you clap.

00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:30.491
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:31.990
So this is the equation of the week.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.370
And if you were a college
student in this class,

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.950
you would now go into
lab, into our cooking lab,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.540
and you would explore this
question by cooking pasta.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.080
So the dish of the week
is pasta puttanesca,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.890
and we would ask all kinds
of questions about pasta.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.770
Pasta seems to be one of
those really basic things

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.370
that most people have cooked, right?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.722
Right?

00:06:55.722 --> 00:06:57.680
But there are all kinds
of questions around it.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.630
So do you add salt to your water or not?

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.190
How much salt do you add?

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.820
Do you add the pasta--

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:11.990
so how many here waits until the water
is boiling until you add the pasta?

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.050
Who does not?

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.840
Yeah?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.040
Why?

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.720
Why?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.220
Right?

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.045
I mean, it's just a question.

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:21.110
It's just a question.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.040
But questions you can
find the answer to.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.510
So this lab was actually
born out of an article

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.400
by Harold McGee, who was here last week.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.790
Who was here last week?

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.290
Wonderful.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.190
So then you listened to
Harold talk about tea.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.910
But this is an article from
2009 in The New York Times

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.110
where he asks the question--

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.450
and this is another question related--

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.180
so for example, when you cook
pasta, do you have a lot of water?

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.260
Do you, like, fill the pot?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.430
Who just fills the pot
with a lot of water?

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.450
I do.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.550
Who is, like, no, I just try
to take the bare minimum water?

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.050
OK.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.280
So we're a bit more divided.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.289
So Harold asked this
question, and he said--

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:08.080
let's see up here--

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.170
why boil so much more water than
pasta actually absorbs, only

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.340
to pour it down the drain?

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.130
Couldn't we just cook pasta just as
well with much less water, less energy?

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.550
Another question quickly followed.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:28.220
If we could, what would the
defenders of Italian traditions say?

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:35.200
So next he goes on and I described
my method in email messages

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.919
to two of this country's best
known advocates of Italian cuisine.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.690
Lidia Bastianich told me, my grandmother
would have thought of this idea

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:47.470
surely as blasphemous,
but I think it's curious.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.830
And so she went into her kitchen,
and she actually did this experiment.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:56.950
And she finally concluded
that the cold water pasta-- so

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.420
if you add the pasta to the cold water
and then you wait for the whole thing

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:07.570
to start to boil, you boil it that way,
it had lost some of its nutty flavor,

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.290
right?

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.820
So she thinks, yes.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.870
I think it's good and doable to
reduce the cooking water by a third

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.090
from six quarts to four quarts.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:20.910
But please, (ITALIAN ACCENT)
put-a la pasta in boiling water.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.780
So there you go.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.120
So with this-- and
I'll show you this too,

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.600
because this is what we do in this class
here for those of you who were really

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.530
into the structure of pasta--

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:35.890
this is a graph of what pasta
looks like in a SEM microscope.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.690
This is dried pasta.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.970
This is pasta that has been--

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.710
has been hydrated-- sorry.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.190
That has been-- what's the name?

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.460
Cooked, hydrated,
rehydrated in 20 degrees.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.270
20 degrees.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.920
And this is 80 degrees.

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.300
So you can actually, on the
microscopic scale, see a difference.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.560
I'd like to argue that
maybe chef Lidia could

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.420
taste that difference with her mouth.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.790
So with this, I'm going here
is what we would do in lab.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.720
So with this, I'm going
to soon introduce Lidia.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.660
So this is very fitting
in a number of ways.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.120
For those of you who attended
this lecture series last fall,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.080
Eataly had just opened in Boston,
and we were all really excited.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.950
And Mario Batali came and
gave the last lecture.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.630
Was anyone here?

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.440
Yeah.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.050
So I thought it would be
fitting now to start off

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.950
this lecture series with Lidia
Bastianich, another co-founder

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.090
of Eataly.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.580
Also the person behind Lidia's
Kitchen, Felidia, Del Posto,

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.640
many other restaurants.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.650
And the other reason
this is very fitting

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:53.280
is because what we're doing here
is we're applying heat, right?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.170
In the first lecture by Harold
McGee and Dave Arnold, we cooked--

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.640
Harold talked about tea, right?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.690
Very simple manipulation of
water to make a delicious drink.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.360
Dave Arnold talked
about sparkling water.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.760
Also very sort of simple manipulation
of water to make it delicious.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.820
Here we're going to add heat.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.800
I mean-- and some more things.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.360
But essentially, we're now
adding heat to our food.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:26.070
And we're doing it to a kind
of basic material in a way,

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.110
just to grain, to rice grains.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.100
So as scientists, we like
to study simple systems,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.030
and I'd like to propose that
we're kind of doing that here.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.950
Although as you'll see, it's
actually very complicated.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:41.940
So with this, please
welcome Lidia Bastianich.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:47.341
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.706
LIDIA BASTIANICH: Thank you.

00:11:59.706 --> 00:12:00.580
Thank you, professor.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.080
Thank you, professor.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.310
Mia grazie for the invitation.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:05.360
Thank you very much.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.450
And it's a pleasure being here with you.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.580
Where are you two guys?

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.540
Come on out.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.890
[LAUGH]

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.650
So you know, we have--

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.680
there's here the executive chef
of Eatily down at the Pru Center,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.420
and his assistant Daniel.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.730
And we chose to make risotto today.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.130
And risotto's all about the technique.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.210
But you know, as she said, they
told me, well, you could cook.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.770
You can talk about it.

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.514
You can taste things.

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:37.180
And I says, how are we going to
have all these people look at me

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.370
and not give them a tasting?

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:39.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.422
So we have the two of them,
which they're mixing the pots,

00:12:43.422 --> 00:12:45.130
so there will be a
tasting for everybody.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.850
Because I think--

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:51.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.560
Because-- because I think, you know,
yes, you listen to the technique

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.870
and to the whys and to the
hows and answer the questions.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:02.170
But at some point, you know,
you've got to record it.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.090
You've got to record the flavor,
the textures, and all of that.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.306
So we made sure that you had that.

00:13:07.306 --> 00:13:10.250
So risotto.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.140
Risotto.

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.740
What is risotto?

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.920
Risotto is an Italian
technique of cooking rice.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.700
And it is a technique.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:25.420
It's considering Italian
culinary sort of sequence.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.056
It's a primo.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.860
A primo is usually a starchy dish.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.667
So you have dente pasta.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:32.750
Then you have your primos.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.910
It could be pasta, it could be
soup, and it could be risotto.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:42.270
And it is very much
appreciated by the Italians.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.820
And yes, it's in the
ingredients, but there's

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.850
so much in the technique
of cooking this dish.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.060
And once you have the technique
down-- and by today, you should--

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.530
you can go home and
make any flavor risotto.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.210
And I'm pretty sure of that.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.840
So pay attention.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.590
But what-- you know,
let's talk about rice.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:13.190
Rice is the one food that feeds
the most people in the world.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:20.530
There's records of 2500 before Christ
that rice was already being used.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:27.910
75% of the world cultures, the
cultures use rice in their meal.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:33.190
And rice is grown in every part
of the world except in every--

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.260
except Antarctica.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.050
So rice is quite an important
element in our cuisine.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.680
There's more than 400 different--

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:46.790
4,000-- no, 40,000
different species of rice.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.900
So you know, there's
a lot to select from.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:55.840
The rice that we use for
risotto is the short grain rice.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.300
So you hear the word arborio.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.560
You hear the word
carnaroli, vialone nano.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.290
These are all specific kinds of--

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.930
they're in the same
species, but there have

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.830
little nuances and little differences.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.800
But all of them are for making risottos.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.740
And in Italy, which is the
largest country growing rice--

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:27.520
the largest rice-growing
country in Europe,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.540
basically they grow
the short grain rice.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:39.730
So let's-- when did rice come to Italy?

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:46.610
Rice sort of initiated in China,
Middle East, North Africa,

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.080
and it crossed over into
Sicily about the 700s.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:59.850
Sicily, if you look at the Sicilian
recipe repertoire, you see rice.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.460
But rice, even though rice
grows in all parts of the world,

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.260
Sicily wasn't the ideal
conducive to rain for rice,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.250
and rice slowly traveled
up to northern Italy,

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:19.190
and it really gained a hold
in the 1200s up in Lombardy.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.610
Of course, Lombardy is the Po River
that comes down from the Alps.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:28.290
It has all its divisions, and
it's a great setting for rice.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:34.230
So the Po Valley, the Po Valley
starting from Lombardy into Piemonte,

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:39.470
that is the area in Italy
where rice is really grown.

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:49.160
Vercelli one of the cities is the
capital of rice growing in Italy.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:57.470
So what is the difference between
short grain rice and long grain rice?

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.943
Now let me-- maybe I'll begin to cook so
that, you know, you get to the tasting.

00:17:02.943 --> 00:17:04.795
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:12.890
Rice, one cup of rice will
yield two cups of risotto.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.599
It will take about 3 and 1/2 cups
of liquid to get there in about 17

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:18.530
minutes.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.240
So the formula is not that complicated,
but everything else that comes in.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:28.930
What's important is that
you have some good stock

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.480
to coax that starch out of that kernel.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.740
The stock, because rice, once it's
milled like this, rice has a bran.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.867
It's brown.

00:17:40.867 --> 00:17:41.450
It's a kernel.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.280
It's brown.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.000
And then it also has a germ.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.800
So when you look at the rice kernel,
and you see almost like a chipped tooth,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.635
that's the rice that has
been milled of its bran.

00:17:54.935 --> 00:17:58.160
The germ has been taken off.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.160
Germ is the food of the rice kernel.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.080
So it has fat.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.580
It has nourishment.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:11.390
When you have brown rice, brown rice
has its bran on and it has the germ on.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:17.470
That's why brown rice oxidizes fast
on you, because it has the germ

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.300
and it has the fattiness,
and it oxidizes.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:24.140
So brown rice, you keep
in the refrigerator,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.340
whereas regular rice keeps well
three months with no problem.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.910
The one thing, when you buy rice
and you run it through your hands,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.900
you don't want it to feel floury.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:41.460
You don't want the rice kernel to
have begun to open up, in a sense.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.370
Lose its starches.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:47.660
You want a nice dry kernel,
and it has the chip.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.220
That's perfectly fine.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.940
At that point, rice
has about 95% starch.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:58.790
So when we cook it, we need to add
the flavorings every step of the way

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.470
to flavor that rice.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.160
And what we get out of
that rice is the texture,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.210
and it is that it absorbs
the flavor, and the flavor

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:14.330
that we impart on the starches
that make the risotto creamy.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.490
So the first is to get
a nice hot stock, and it

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.620
has to be hot at the same
temperature, you know?

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.930
Heat, catalyst.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.000
You have a chemical reaction going.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.280
You put another
temperature, your stop that.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.620
And you do not want to do
that in this cooking process.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.400
You want to continue, continuously.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.060
You're coaxing up
those starches, and you

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.870
want to continue at the same
temperature to add so it continues.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:48.401
But what you do need is a
wide pan like this so that--

00:19:48.401 --> 00:19:48.900
yeah.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.305
Am I speaking too close?

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:55.980
So that as you're coaxing that
starch and add in the stock.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.730
The stock, you put it
in, pulls out the starch,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.220
and it evaporates, and
this process continues.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:04.880
So it's back and forth
of pulling that out.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.560
So a pan, a wide pan
with a nice thick bottom

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.460
so that this heat is spread evenly.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.770
If you were to do it in this pan here,
you would have the rice up to here,

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:22.250
and that rice wouldn't be at the
same temperature as the bottom rice,

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.160
and whatever.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.430
So a nice open-- and
this is a big portion.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.570
I'm going to make quite a bit of rice.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:35.100
If you make, you know, a
portion for four or six people,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.340
all you really need is two cups
of rice, three cups of rice.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.500
So you need a smaller.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.110
But that's important,
a constant temperature.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.280
And what I like wooden spoon.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.190
And you can get all in the corner
so that the starch doesn't scorch,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.970
because then you have another flavor,
another element, which you don't want.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.980
So we have the pan.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.760
The olive oil.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.880
Get olive oil.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:07.370
Let me raise the temperature here.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:15.980
And we'll-- you don't wash
the rice before cooking.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:21.560
The rice is milled, the bran
is off, and it is clean.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.200
In that package that
you get it, it is clean.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.360
So you do not wash it.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.710
You do not introduce
water, because then you

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:33.230
begin already to break those starches
down, and you don't want to do that.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.170
So some oil.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.150
You guys are going to
do it on that side.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.070
Onions.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.980
I like a lot of--

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.950
this is the flavor.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.450
So you can make a
risotto just with onions,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.870
like the risotto Milanese
that is made with onions.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.990
But the risotto Milanese has a
little bit of bone marrow in it

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.480
and a little bit of saffron.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.920
But you can make a simple
risotto with the onion family,

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.560
and then you can add the
different flavorings.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:13.840
So shallots and get
a little bit of salt.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.810
Salt. And if you notice
this, I'll go along.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.050
I'll salt as I go along.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:23.180
Right here I need salt,
because you want it--

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.170
I want to disintegrate these
onions as soon as possible.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.480
I want to pull out the water in them.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.640
And of course, salt will do that.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:38.420
And I must say, this is fine salt. If
you want to do that, the flake salt,

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:44.120
the bigger the kernel, the more
it pulls out of whatever you want,

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.080
especially if you're
curing meats or something.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:54.135
The size of the salt is important
on pulling out those liquids.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.620
Here I have some--

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.600
so we're going to make mushrooms.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.810
The flavor is going to
be mushroom, basically.

00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.080
Love mushrooms.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.700
We have some porcini, dry porcini.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.885
Porcini are the boletus mushrooms.

00:23:14.885 --> 00:23:20.120
You know, in Italy, of course,
they are very much prized.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:26.120
But dried porcini for me, it's
an essential in my kitchen.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.060
It is one of the umamis that
we have in the Italian cuisine.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:35.150
It has a tremendous amount
of flavor concentrated.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.690
So in this case, what I'm going
to do is that I'm going to--

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:40.300
you did yours, right?

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.050
That I'm going to take
some of this stock.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.820
And this is all vegetarian today.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.250
The stock is a vegetarian
stock, so for anybody.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:53.220
I'm going to reconstitute
the porcini just like that.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.780
And then I'm going to
chop them and add them on.

00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.720
But the porcini are also
good if you have them at home

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.870
when you have them dry like that.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.110
You put them in a little food
processor, and you get porcini powder.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:14.930
And they are great for meats, for
barbecues, if you have steaks.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.740
You put a little porcini--

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.282
yeah?

00:24:17.282 --> 00:24:17.990
A little bit of--

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.890
I put a little bit of porcini,
a little bit of brown sugar.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:23.163
What else do we put in there?

00:24:23.163 --> 00:24:25.163
JASON: Sugar, a little
chili flake, a little bit

00:24:25.163 --> 00:24:27.287
of salt. Giving all our secrets away.

00:24:27.287 --> 00:24:28.370
LIDIA BASTIANICH: It's OK.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.388
It's OK.

00:24:31.388 --> 00:24:32.790
They'll still come and visit you.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:33.289
OK.

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:34.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:39.800
So the light went off, but
I-- you can hear me, right?

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.980
I think the light, the switch jumped.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.705
So you make this
powder, and you keep it,

00:24:47.705 --> 00:24:53.270
and you season your steaks,
your chops, and you leave them

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.135
outside with this porcini
and sugar and salt powder--

00:24:57.135 --> 00:24:57.926
JASON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:57.926 --> 00:25:00.056
LIDIA BASTIANICH: Huh?

00:25:00.056 --> 00:25:01.872
Yeah.

00:25:01.872 --> 00:25:02.372
OK.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.520
OK.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.690
Now this is on.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.620
Am I on?

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.320
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.195
LIDIA BASTIANICH: No?

00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:15.126
OK.

00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:17.000
This is important, as
long as the risotto's--

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.270
I can project.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.030
OK.

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.550
So I want to get those
onions a little bit wilted,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:32.860
and then we will add the rice
directly into the onions that

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.850
have been already wilted.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:39.965
And what we're beginning
to do is to create kind

00:25:39.965 --> 00:25:44.180
of a little capsule out of this kernel.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.930
I'm going to coat it with
a little bit of-- here,

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.390
toast it first so the
first layer of the starch,

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.720
of the outside starch kind
of cooks a little bit.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.440
I say toasted, but it doesn't
take on a toasty look,

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.290
and doesn't even smell toasty.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:02.150
But sort of, it's a clickety
sound, a few minutes.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:08.840
And I have coated that kernel with oil
and with a little bit the first layer

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.020
of starch that has been cooked.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:34.860
The addition of flavoring elements,
you have 17 minutes for a risotto.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.667
So if I'm going to add the
mushrooms, the mushrooms,

00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:40.250
I'm going to add them halfway through.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.450
Sometimes I even saute them
before to give them some flavor.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.685
But here, we're just didn't
have that the fires to do that.

00:26:48.685 --> 00:26:50.810
But I would recommend, if
you have it, you take it,

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:54.590
put a little bit of garlic and oil,
saute them, put a little bit of thyme

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:56.880
in there, and give them the flavor.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.760
So every element has a flavor.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.390
And then you add them on.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.730
But I'll add them about halfway through.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.720
If I wanted to do a shrimp risotto,
shrimps, two, three minutes,

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.940
they're done.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.120
I would saute them quickly,
also flavor them, and then

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.470
add them in the last two,
three minutes of the risotto

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.730
so that they finish together.

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:26.410
If you have a venison ragout, a
venison ragout risotto is delicious.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.890
The venison ragout takes about two hours
to break down and braise and whatever,

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.170
so you make that first.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.220
And then you add it about halfway,
like once the rice is already

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.960
releasing some starches.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:46.020
It takes in the ragout,
and it finishes that way.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.420
Now OK.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.581
So I'm going to take one
third, and 2/3 is yours.

00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:53.081
OK.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:09.340
Also if you take a look at rice, at
the kernel of rice and you look at it,

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.610
you will see an opaque center.

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.100
It's the core.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.220
And that, what that is, that
will give me an indication.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.560
But this is really fine tuning
how big that core is, that center,

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.625
how packed the starches are.

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:30.060
You know, so in the
center he has a lot of--

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.630
so the wider that center is, the
more of the packed starches are.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:44.280
And the chances that the
rice will maintain its shape.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.980
So what the ideal risotto
is that the rice remains--

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.240
it's thoroughly cooked,
but it's al dente.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.770
Al dente is the word to describe a
sensation, a feeling that for Italians,

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:04.260
when they bite into their pasta or
into their risotto, the resistance

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.110
against your--

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.080
as Italians like that little
resistance in their mouth.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.850
But you know, it's
not just the Italians.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.290
Think about yourself.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.610
You love texture.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.250
You love-- celery has to be crunchy.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.380
Asian pear, nice and crunchy.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:26.130
So you know, an element in cooking and
in creating sensation is that tactile.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:31.260
We always talk about flavor and
aromas and taste, and so on.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.140
But the tactile element
of food is very important.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:43.650
And I think because it just sensitizes
our receptors here, more or less,

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:48.190
and gets them kind of
excited about enjoying food.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:56.050
So al dente for an Italian is
imperative for pasta and risotto.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:30:01.450
So I'm looking-- it's being tested.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.900
It's toasting slowly.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:14.390
So I said that rice has 95% starch,
and it's not tasty, as it is.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.010
It's starchy, as a matter of fact.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:19.560
So you have to kind of season it.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.460
So at this point where it's nice
and dry and when it's thirsty,

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.710
you put white wine.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.490
And wine.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.300
I always get, what kind of wine?

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.840
A good wine.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.250
A wine that you would drink.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:36.650
A wine that you have some left over.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.830
Just don't do cooking wine.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.990
Cooking wine has all kinds of
seasoning and salts and all kinds.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:43.982
And at this point, nice and dry.

00:30:43.982 --> 00:30:45.830
[SIZZLE]

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.280
You'll hear that-- that siz.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:54.330
And what's happening is that
the rice is taking it in.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:59.120
So when you're cooking with
wine, you want the acidity.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.800
You want the flavor.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.130
The alcohol dissipates
in 10, 15 minutes.

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:11.930
The alcohol will have dissipated and
the rice will be balanced on the inside.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.930
So when you eat that
rice, it has flavor.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.630
It has the acidity, and it has
some of the flavor of wine.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:21.990
And then it will take on the
flavor of everything else.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:29.170
But at this point, I want to bring
the rice again down completely

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.085
to a dry level before I add the stock.

00:31:42.353 --> 00:31:42.853
OK.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.460
So that's all.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.750
You don't need any more time.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.520
This is-- so, they're great in soups.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:04.750
I told you how to make
the marinade for the meat.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.184
Porcini mushroom, soup,
braising, roasting.

00:32:09.184 --> 00:32:12.100
You know, when you're roasting a
piece of meat and you put your celery

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.570
and carrots and whatever.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.220
Put some porcini mushrooms in there,
and they are really fantastic.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:19.690
Cut them up.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:26.410
So be careful, because they do tend
to have a little bit of sand or Earth

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.530
because, you know, they
are from the Earth,

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:33.470
and the stem usually
maintains some of that.

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:46.260
So I will-- you can strain it
through a cheesecloth or a clean rag.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:53.140
But I will just kind of pour and leave
a teaspoon at the bottom with the dust.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.620
You guys have already divided it, right?

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.417
Did you use wine?

00:32:56.417 --> 00:32:56.916
Did do--

00:32:56.916 --> 00:32:57.870
JASON: We added wine.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.910
LIDIA BASTIANICH: You added wine.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.130
JASON: Yeah.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.010
We have more mushrooms.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:00.360
LIDIA BASTIANICH: OK, no.

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.920
I'm OK with the mushroom.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.570
So OK.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.110
So here it is.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.730
It's nice and dry.

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.340
I'm going to throw this in.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.685
This is really going to give the flavor.

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:33.860
So if I were to do this with
vegetables, all kinds of vegetables,

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:42.730
string beans and squash and
whatever, let me just add this,

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:46.760
and then I'll get back
to the vegetables.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:54.730
So you add another stock.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.850
You see I always make sure
that you scrape everything off.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.970
And a little more stock.

00:34:08.318 --> 00:34:08.818
OK.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:17.469
And always you see me scraping off the
sides, because if it stays up there,

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:22.250
some kernels will not be cooking
at the same-- given the same time.

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:26.230
So I'm always trying to get everything
in there, cooking at the same time.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:32.380
Just enough liquid to kind of-- when
you press like this, you see the bottom,

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.969
but not that much.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:43.340
And again, you know, if you're
doing in chemistry or whatever,

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.790
you put ingredients
together in a liquid.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.800
They'll try to neutralize each other.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.320
Pull everything out
of one so it combines.

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.389
And this happens here as well.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:54.080
You say, OK.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.504
You're going to stay there
18 minutes and going to stir.

00:34:56.504 --> 00:34:57.920
Just-- you know how much it takes.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.370
Put all that liquid in there,
and go and do your chores.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.260
But it doesn't happen,
because the technique,

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.890
you know, it's not that kind
of pulling out of the starches,

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:11.480
retaining the kernel whole,
and yet a creamy result.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.615
Because if I put all of
this, the rice will open up.

00:35:14.615 --> 00:35:15.937
It will open up.

00:35:15.937 --> 00:35:18.020
And I'm sure that you've
had that experience where

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.840
you eat this mushy rice
and the heart isn't even--

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.240
it's not cooked yet.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.930
And that's exactly what happens.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:31.010
Too much liquid all at once in the--

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.930
OK.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.210
So now that's going.

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.220
I'm going to put the juice.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.230
I'm not going to waste this.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.470
As I said, you know, you
see the sand on the bottom.

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:43.420
And I'm going to just toss this away.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.210
Mushrooms, we have here--

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.410
this is-- what is it?

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.497
The king--

00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:03.330
JASON: King trumpet.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.665
LIDIA BASTIANICH: King
trumpet is delicious.

00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:06.180
It's a delicious mushroom.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.000
It's an expensive mushroom,
but it's a delicious mushroom.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.080
It's in season.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.290
It's as close as it
gets to porcini for me.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:15.930
This is the hen mushroom.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.753
This is--

00:36:20.753 --> 00:36:21.378
JASON: Cremini.

00:36:21.378 --> 00:36:21.987
Cremini.

00:36:21.987 --> 00:36:23.070
LIDIA BASTIANICH: Cremini.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.340
You know better than I do.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.200
Cremini and chanterelles.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.420
Whatever the mushrooms, the more
diversified, the better it is.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.340
But can you make it only
with champignons and cremini?

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.880
Of course.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.660
Substitute a little bit more
of the dried porcini, which

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.040
will give you really that
kind of mushroom feeling,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.820
and you are on your way.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.420
So let's return to those vegetables.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.720
And everybody loves-- you know,
I myself a vegetable risotto.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.860
But I like my vegetables to kind
of break down in the risotto,

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:05.340
but I also like to have a little crunch.

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.620
So I split it in half.

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:13.500
I throw half in like I do the mushroom,
and let that half cook and cook.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.730
And then the other half that
I want just to remain crunchy.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:21.560
So it's a question of,
you know, just timing.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:24.225
It's like dancing.

00:37:24.225 --> 00:37:26.640
You do those steps and then
you do the other steps,

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.270
and then together, it looks good.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:28.770
So--

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.360
So you do that.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:39.170
And taste as you go along.

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:41.330
I always say, I even taste like--

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.880
you know, let me taste this.

00:37:47.201 --> 00:37:47.700
OK.

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.420
That has-- it's flavorful,
but it doesn't have any salt.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:54.360
And that's fine, because I
know what to do here now.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.670
So when you're cooking, you
have a fabulous apparatus here.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:00.690
You really do.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:04.140
It knows your whole history of what
you like, what you didn't like,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.930
what you ate, which you didn't
eat, how much salt you like.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:07.740
It's all in here.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:10.230
So use it to tell you.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.455
Taste as you go along.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:18.090
Salt. If you have a recipe
and you don't know, you know,

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.530
how to gauge yourself
with salt, let me first--

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.530
OK.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.350
Let me add a little bit more stock.

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:34.240
How you guys doing?

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.140
OK?

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.640
OK?

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.048
Did you put your porcini in?

00:38:38.048 --> 00:38:38.762
JASON: Yes.

00:38:38.762 --> 00:38:39.637
LIDIA BASTIANICH: OK.

00:38:39.637 --> 00:38:43.522
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.410
So when you go to Italy,
you go-- look for Jason

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.040
and tell him, I want one of those
risottos, or whatever you want.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.760
He hangs around.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.262
Where do you hang around mostly, Jason?

00:38:55.262 --> 00:38:56.101
JASON: All over.

00:38:56.101 --> 00:38:56.600
Everywhere.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.140
LIDIA BASTIANICH: You're all over.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.359
There can-- yeah.

00:38:58.359 --> 00:38:59.900
They can find you all over the place.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:00.664
OK.

00:39:00.664 --> 00:39:01.532
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:11.210
So a little more salt. I'm going to add
salt, because I've salted the onions,

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:17.090
but I didn't salt the rice and
the liquid that I put so far.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.660
When you have a recipe
and you say, OK, I

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:27.140
believe in salting every product
at its optimal time, you know,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.610
when it really takes in the salt.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:34.247
So if you throw all the salt in the
onion at the beginning, yes, it's OK.

00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:34.830
It dissipates.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:35.750
But this is better.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.040
You're dividing it.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:40.850
You take whatever the recipe tells you--

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:45.170
let's say it says one
teaspoon of salt like that--

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.430
and you put it on the side.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:48.916
I have a little--

00:39:48.916 --> 00:39:51.260
a little-- whatever.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.370
You put it on the side.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:54.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:02.000
And then from here, you salt every step
of the way, every major ingredient.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.940
Salt, rice, stock.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:11.780
And when you come down to the end, the
recommended salting of that recipe,

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.760
you know, that you've been using it.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:19.820
Always leave a little bit, because
then you taste your apparatus here,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.690
and you add if you feel
you need it or not.

00:40:34.506 --> 00:40:35.006
OK.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.930
So you can see that this is a big pot.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.640
The center is here.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.930
I am moving it around.

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:53.190
It does-- the center
does stick a little more,

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.850
and I make sure that I address that.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.840
Because-- so if you're doing a
wide pot and you have-- make sure--

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:05.350
sometimes when I'm at home, I even move
the pot a little here, a little there.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:10.440
You know, you have to
distribute the heat evenly.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:17.010
And you know, what temperature
do you cook your risotto?

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:18.990
Certainly not at maximum.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:23.700
You cook it so that everything
continues, that this reaction that's

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.640
happening continues at the same speed.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:32.520
That as you can see, that the stock
evaporates, the flavor of the stock

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.660
remains there.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.860
But at the same time, it
pulls out the starches.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.450
And so it continues.

00:41:46.785 --> 00:41:48.750
OK.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:54.450
So at this point, mushrooms
are quite resilient.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:42:00.600
And they just clean and cut, you know.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.910
I don't believe in
washing in a lot of water,

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:06.180
because mushrooms absorb
water and are porous.

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.710
So sometimes if you take--

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:13.770
you cut off the base, the dirt very
well, and then you take a wet towel

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.790
and you clean them off,
usually that works well.

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.320
So I'm going to put my mushrooms in.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.772
You guys?

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:23.920
No, no.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.200
They have their own--

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.445
I mean, this is-- they've
made many risottos.

00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:28.320
They have their own--

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.290
--they have their own rhythm.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:32.370
But I'm just checking.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.625
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:38.940
OK.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.870
So I have here a little pepper.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.330
I like that.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:50.275
But pepper has tannin.

00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:52.200
It's a seed.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:59.280
And it's a seed that has its
flavor, but it also has tannins .

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.080
And if you cook it,
the more you cook it,

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.670
there's a bitterness that comes out.

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:10.260
That's why you see the
pepper mill on the table.

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:12.930
It's not because, you
know, initially, oh, they

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.090
want it to look good and serve you.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.380
It's because it just makes sense.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.250
You add pepper for maximum.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:27.330
And purest flavor of black pepper
is to add it the last minute,

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.680
not to really cook it.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.860
Maybe a few minutes before,
but not to overly cook it.

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:37.220
So I have it there, and I'm
going to leave it there.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:41.765
And I'm going to salt a
little bit of mushrooms.

00:43:41.765 --> 00:43:43.830
Not too much.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.630
And continue the cooking process.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.225
So this continues back and forth until--

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:17.250
so here we have the long grain rice.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:18.700
the difference in it.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:21.090
I just put it there
because they show here they

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:31.320
have the carnaroli, the arborio,
and the different rice to cook.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:35.250
When you use rice--

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.850
and because rice has
certainly many uses.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:45.760
We use it in Italy a lot for
soups, especially vegetable soups

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.600
just as that extra.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.630
We use also pasta, tubettini
or whatever we put in the soup.

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:57.910
But rice, if you do use it for
your soup, as well as pasta,

00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:59.210
you boil it in the soup.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:03.160
You don't make a whole pot of soup,
put the rice, and then put it away.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.380
And then you pull and you reheat it.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:11.230
The rice and the pasta should be
cooked in that soup before serving.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.370
It should not be--

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:16.720
the one option that you have
is that you cook the rice maybe

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.230
separately in water and even pasta,
and you leave it on the side.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:26.140
And then when your guest comes,
you leave it a little bit al dente.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.710
You just add it the last
minute, and then you serve it.

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:40.000
The risotto, when my
grandmother always used to say,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.750
if you're not home to eat the
risotto when it's finished,

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.480
the risotto will wait
for you at the door.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.110
That means, you know, that just--
it grows and grows and grows.

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:50.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:52.360
And so it becomes thick.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.170
But also risotto, you say, OK.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:57.410
All of this now.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:58.150
[SIGH]

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:59.710
Can I prepare myself?

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.940
Can I do something in advance
instead of standing here?

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:09.284
I think if you do it at home and
you have your guests or your family,

00:46:09.284 --> 00:46:11.200
then it's a beautiful
thing to do, because you

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.150
can converse like I do with you.

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.210
You can have some of the
kids mixing it or whatever.

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:17.860
And you know, the aromas.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.810
And you look like a great chef.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:23.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:27.892
But if you want to prepare some,
certainly the mise en place,

00:46:27.892 --> 00:46:30.850
as we call it in our industry, the
preparation and everything, cutting,

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.250
everything, that's permissible.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:37.600
The only part of the risotto
that you can do ahead

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:46.300
is that you toast them and you
add the wine and you dry it back,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.820
and then you spread it and you leave it.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.390
But still, you know, it loses
something, because then it's cold.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:55.690
It has congealed to some
extent, the starches.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.800
And then you have to bring it
back to life, bring it back to--

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.780
so I think if you're seeing--

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.250
do you see how the liquid is getting--

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.510
is there too much light?

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:13.630
Can you see the creaminess of the rice?

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:24.460
Risotto, the one thing that's good
about the risotto is that, you know,

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:31.270
you can make one pot, and it would
feed a substantial amount of people.

00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:35.110
But you have to serve it
as soon as you make it.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:42.250
And you know, risotto, as well as pasta,
you know, one is concerned evermore,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.450
you know, of starches.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.000
So much starches today, everybody.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.556
You just kind of change the ratio
of your vegetables, your proteins,

00:47:51.556 --> 00:47:52.180
and your pasta.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.440
And instead of having
80% pasta, 20% vegetable,

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:01.370
you can have one third vegetable, one
third proteins, and one third pasta.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:03.260
Who says you can't?

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.660
You can get the satisfaction
and the pleasure,

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.490
and you're balancing your meal.

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:10.130
And you can do the same with risotto.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:16.375
Add more vegetables and proteins.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.390
The last step in--

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.194
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:28.194 --> 00:48:29.120
Coming along.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:29.995
JASON: Getting there.

00:48:29.995 --> 00:48:32.032
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.032 --> 00:48:32.740
Did you taste it?

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:33.887
Is it salty?

00:48:33.887 --> 00:48:34.470
Where are you?

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.600
Did you guys taste everything?

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.410
Yeah?

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.850
How about you?

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:40.844
Did you taste yours?

00:48:40.844 --> 00:48:46.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:52.390
You know, I opened my first restaurant--
maybe I'll share a little bit about

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.890
my--

00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:58.390
I opened my first restaurant in '71.

00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.530
I was rather young.

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:03.080
So it's been a long road in
restaurants for me, and I love it.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.320
I still have a good
time, as you can see.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:10.720
And along the way, those
restaurants and all the restaurants

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.140
that we have now in Italy and all
of that, one of the great pleasure

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.870
is precisely working with young people.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.090
Young people that are
enthusiastic, that are passionate,

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.190
that are sweating over those stoves.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.510
And I think to myself,
then why are you doing it?

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:30.970
I did it because, you know, I had to
do it, in a sense, and I loved it.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:34.980
But for me and evermore, you know,
as you grow into your profession

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:40.900
and you kind of develop this collection
of information and maybe knowledge

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.440
to share it, to cook with them, to
work with them, it is really wonderful,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:45.940
you know?

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.400
And it's not that I have
time now to go everywhere .

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.560
And plus, I have this Achilles tendon.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.080
If you didn't-- if you
saw me hopping around,

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.392
my Achilles tendon is
ripped a little bit.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.530
So it's a pleasure to
work with you guys.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:07.180
I work with them on and
off, but now especially.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:14.036
But I come from a part of
Italy that is no longer Italy.

00:50:14.036 --> 00:50:16.380
I was born in Istria.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:19.240
Istria's a little peninsula.

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.280
It was Italy.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:27.970
And after World War II, it was
given to communist Yugoslavia.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:36.220
And 350,000 ethnic Italians
actually left Istria back

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:42.220
into Italy and into the world.

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:45.550
I was just born, 1947.

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:46.918
I'll tell you my age.

00:50:46.918 --> 00:50:48.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:51.430
And that was just the--

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.210
I was born, I think, three or four
weeks before the peace treaty.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:58.015
So my mother was expecting me.

00:50:58.015 --> 00:51:00.700
They decided not to go anywhere.

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.760
Where are you going to go
in the world expecting?

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.820
But I was born and the
Iron Curtain went down.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:12.250
And so my formative years,
I spent with my grandmother

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.010
who remained there under communism.

00:51:15.010 --> 00:51:17.560
And the beauty of it was that--

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.630
still is-- that my grandmother,
because food was scarce,

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.670
was not all that available-- the
regime, the Iron Curtain went up,

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:29.650
the regime was tight--

00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:32.440
and she had everything
to feed the family.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.730
We had chickens, we had
rabbits, we had two goats.

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.710
Every year, she had three pigs.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:42.700
And you know, she grew everything.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.170
We made olive oil.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.090
Grandpa made a little bit of wine.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:47.350
We even grew our own potatoes.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:52.270
I remember, you know, going with her
to harvest the potatoes from the Earth.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:56.170
And she would pick up-- pluck--
because, you know, it's a bush.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:59.680
She would pluck it all up, take
the big potatoes off the roots.

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:03.700
Mine was to collect the little
ones that was left in the dirt.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.110
And I still recall holding the
potato in my hand, and it was warm.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.750
It was warm as it had life.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.240
And you know, I can't get that out of--

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:18.450
that connection of food
out of my system, you know?

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:24.410
The appreciation that we should
have and my connection to food.

00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:25.910
So I work with--

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.559
I cooked with, how we
used to have beans,

00:52:28.559 --> 00:52:30.100
eat them when they were string beans.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:30.760
They got bigger.

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.426
We shelled them.

00:52:31.426 --> 00:52:32.920
That was for the winter.

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:39.370
Even wheat, the kernels, she would
harvest, and we would have the kernels.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:42.100
She would keep them in
the canteen, as we said.

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.730
And when she needed flour, we
would take two, three burlap bags,

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.325
go to the mill, come
back with fresh flour.

00:52:48.325 --> 00:52:54.850
Now the flour was quite different,
because those kernels had the germ.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.770
You remember I was
talking about the germ?

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:57.910
Had the germ.

00:52:57.910 --> 00:53:02.650
And so it had more flavor, more
nourishment, and more-- you know,

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:08.530
sometimes you think why today
the flavors are different.

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:10.180
Why?

00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:13.110
And it's those memories, you know?

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:18.700
Collecting that cherry,
that fig, that perfect fig.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:24.130
It would hang, and it had almost,
like, stretchmarks on its skin.

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:27.760
And it had, like, a drop of
honey on the bottom, nectar.

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.870
I mean, I still remember.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:31.840
I go back, and I still
look for those figs.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:37.060
So I think that, you know, that
connection to food and to flavors

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.730
stayed with me.

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:46.360
And in 1956, my parents decided--

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.920
I was nine something--

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.250
that they could no longer-- my mother
was an elementary school teacher,

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.810
my father a mechanic.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.240
And they just couldn't
continue to raise--

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.310
and I have a brother
that's older than me.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:01.510
So they decided that they were
going to go back to Italy.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.660
But they didn't give you
permission to go back to Italy.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:05.770
You had to stay there.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.620
You couldn't get a visa or something.

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:12.220
But we had family on the other side.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:17.680
So my mother decided that
my brother, myself, and her

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:23.350
would go to visit Aunt Nina,
supposedly who was ill.

00:54:23.350 --> 00:54:27.850
And my father had to remain
as a hostage, in a sense.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:30.550
But two weeks later, he escaped.

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:33.680
Actually, the border, the
barbed wire and the whole thing.

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.440
Met us in Trieste.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:43.900
And in Trieste, we stayed with our
cousins, but also we stayed in Trieste.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:48.340
We couldn't depend and stay
there on another family's weight,

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:51.166
as we called it.

00:54:51.166 --> 00:54:56.470
We entered-- my parents entered a
political refugee camp, San Sabba.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:58.740
Now it's a museum.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:01.320
And for two years, we were in that camp.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.270
And again, in that camp, waiting for
a possibility to migrate someplace.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:11.110
So you know, when you talk
about migration today, for me,

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:17.650
it's very moving, and I
really feel what that meant.

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:21.940
And there we were for two years
in there, almost like today.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.560
Where did we go for lunch today?

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.336
We went to the--

00:55:25.336 --> 00:55:29.230
yeah, to the freshman
cafeteria, in line.

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.970
I was in camp also in line.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:34.330
Waiting.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:37.210
Waiting for food.

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:40.060
But you know, when you have
these connections to food,

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.930
really visceral from one to the other,
it just stayed with me, and it just--

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:46.055
you know.

00:55:46.055 --> 00:55:48.190
Food for me is--

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:52.330
because when we left
there, I didn't know

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:55.150
that we were not going to
come back, and I had not

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:57.370
said goodbye to my grandmother.

00:55:57.370 --> 00:56:00.100
So food was my memories.

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.600
I would cook the flavors, the
thing that grandma taught me.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:10.270
And they remain my connection to her
and to the place where I was born.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.500
And I continue that.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:12.550
I did go back.

00:56:12.550 --> 00:56:16.210
I did see grandma after I was
married, so that was settled.

00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:23.170
But for me, at that age, because
in 1958, Dwight Eisenhower

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.520
was the president.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:29.400
He opened-- we had a visa, and
we came to the United States.

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:33.160
The Catholic Relief
Services brought us here,

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.410
because we had nobody here either.

00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.481
We were kind of-- oh.

00:56:42.604 --> 00:56:43.930
There's the salt missing.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:48.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:49.818
It Is.

00:56:49.818 --> 00:56:52.058
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.070
But we were almost--

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.230
are you guys almost there?

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:57.831
Did you taste the salt?

00:56:57.831 --> 00:57:00.717
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:01.679 --> 00:57:04.565
Yeah?

00:57:04.565 --> 00:57:05.530
OK.

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:07.120
You will tell me if they didn't.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:09.108
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:19.070
So the last step in a
risotto is the mantecare.

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:21.330
Mantecare is sort of the whip.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:27.420
And you do that--

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.500
some great cheese.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.790
Grana Padano cheese.

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.350
I love that cheese there.

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:33.940
100% cow's milk cheese.

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.560
It's in the Emilia-Romanga in Lombardy.

00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:41.770
And cubes of butter at room temperature.

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:47.850
So when you have products like
this like butter or cheese,

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:51.420
these are products that
are almost finished.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:55.350
And the more you cook them,
the more you lose their flavor.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:57:58.680
If you cook with butter from the
beginning-- had I put all this,

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.120
it would have separated.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.040
I would have gotten all the fat.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.400
The flavonoids, the nice
aroma would have dissipated,

00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.090
and I would have gotten maybe half of
the value in flavor of that butter.

00:58:10.090 --> 00:58:14.100
So if you love butter, but you
don't want to use it that much,

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.750
add it at the end.

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:18.030
At the end, the last
moment, just let it--

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:21.880
you'll get the maximum of the flavors,
the flavonoids, and everything,

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.670
and it will not separate.

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:28.480
Cheese is sort of a
pre-digested product,

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:33.270
because you know, the bacteria
of the cheese itself break--

00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:35.370
that's what aging cheese is all about.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:42.090
Breaks down the proteins into these
wonderful kind of molecules of cheese

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:43.530
with all its aroma.

00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:48.820
If you cook it, if you apply heat, you
get the string and the puddles of fat,

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:54.130
I'm sure when you cook cheese, because
you are breaking it down further.

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:55.260
So you want it--

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.900
this is maximum for cheese and butter.

00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:05.480
And mantecare is the last step
when you will take it off the fire,

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:09.230
or just shut the fire, and
whip it in the last minute.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:11.270
And you'll get the
maximum, one or the other.

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:14.630
And then just a little bit of
scallions, just a little greenness

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:21.657
to freshen up this
complexity of flavors.

00:59:21.657 --> 00:59:22.490
How are yours, guys?

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:25.108
Sky At what point are you?

00:59:25.108 --> 00:59:25.608
Huh?

00:59:30.568 --> 00:59:32.552
You know--

00:59:32.552 --> 00:59:34.536
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:34.536 --> 00:59:37.020
Yeah, but it's-- it does--

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:38.818
I wouldn't kid you.

00:59:38.818 --> 00:59:39.774
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:39.774 --> 00:59:41.208
It's missing.

00:59:41.208 --> 00:59:44.076
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:44.076 --> 00:59:45.545
Oh.

00:59:45.545 --> 00:59:47.356
Oh, it's-- I'm talking too much.

00:59:47.356 --> 00:59:48.480
It's sticking a little bit.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:53.230
So I'm looking.

00:59:53.230 --> 01:00:01.380
So risotto, sometimes people
prefer it nice and dense.

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:07.470
Means only being careful of towards
the end how much liquid you add and let

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:11.330
evaporate, and the
risotto is nice and dense.

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:18.390
In Italy, we like it also loose, and
it's called all'onda, to the wave.

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:21.580
And that's, again, you see
now it's kind of looser.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:26.860
It's just a question of gauging
the liquid towards the end,

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:29.620
but not overcooking it.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:36.130
And all'onda risotto usually is
best with lighter-- with seafood,

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:37.930
with vegetables.

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:46.210
And then denser risotto is maybe
better with meats and game and so on.

01:01:02.012 --> 01:01:02.512
Yeah?

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.290
I'm on the cusp with salt.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:21.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:22.510
I'm neither here nor--

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:23.570
I don't know.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:28.820
But I'm going to add the cheese, and
cheese has a little salt. Always--

01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:32.360
because once it's in there,
you can't get it out.

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.530
You know?

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.970
By the way, I get that
question a lot, you know?

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:38.520
I always salted my soup and whatever.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:43.180
There's not much that you can do
except dilute it, add more liquid.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.550
Sometimes what works is if you take
potatoes, whole potatoes, raw potatoes,

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:52.510
you peel them, and you throw
them whole in the soup,

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:56.200
and they will take
some of the salt away.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.930
But you know, once you
have oversalted something,

01:01:58.930 --> 01:02:00.700
it's not easy to go
the other way around,

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:03.520
unless you just dilute it with more of--

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:10.490
so pretty soon, they're going to--

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:14.350
we're going to let you taste that, and
then we'll open it up to questions,

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:15.700
and we'll have some more fun.

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.666
Do you have your cheese and your butter?

01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:23.600
JASON: I'll get it.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.720
LIDIA BASTIANICH: You got it in already?

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:25.345
JASON: Not yet.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.322
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:33.322 --> 01:02:34.280
LIDIA BASTIANICH: Good.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:41.000
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.135
And I think it's cooked.

01:02:46.135 --> 01:02:46.760
I think-- yeah.

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.960
I think you can shut it off.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.650
And mantecare, you're OK.

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:55.070
So I'm going to shut it off.

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.840
So you know, you're looking
at this-- oh my God.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.670
All this butter.

01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:03.970
I'm not going to put it all in.

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:04.470
But--

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.190
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:08.740
--but you saw, just the oil is in there.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.180
There's a lot of rice here.

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:15.460
I think I started maybe with four
or five or six teaspoons of oil.

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.450
So there's not a lot of condiment, and
you have a lot of starchier mushrooms.

01:03:19.450 --> 01:03:21.225
So this is the mantecare process.

01:03:39.342 --> 01:03:39.842
OK.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:58.870
So like this, the last--
you've just maximized--

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:00.420
I feel the butter.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.140
And you know, and I'm trying to make it
quick, because this is how you lose it,

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.370
you know?

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.420
When you cook and it goes away.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:08.918
But-- and the cheese.

01:04:24.534 --> 01:04:27.950
AUDIENCE: Is the burner off?

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:29.820
LIDIA BASTIANICH: The-- off, off, off.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:30.570
I turned it off.

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:32.760
Once I started with
the butter, it's off.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.160
I just keep it here
because it's underneath.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.570
You see it.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.383
But it's off.

01:04:59.068 --> 01:04:59.568
OK.

01:05:03.019 --> 01:05:04.960
I have no more tasting spoon.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.830
This is it.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:07.300
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:11.760
Oh right.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.400
You have the salt here.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.785
You need-- you need the--

01:05:20.785 --> 01:05:21.910
JASON: Yeah, we'll take it.

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:22.785
LIDIA BASTIANICH: OK.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:25.000
So they'll portion it
off, and you'll taste it,

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.835
and you'll tell me what you think.

01:05:28.835 --> 01:05:30.960
PIA SORENSEN: So thank you
very much for coming in.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.293
Let's thank Lidia one more time.

01:05:32.293 --> 01:05:35.650
[APPLAUSE]
