00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
Vsauce!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Kevin here.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:11.240
I’m going to cook and eat this here... oh
man... brain.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.610
Here we go.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.970
The zombie fanatics who made The Walking Dead:
No Man’s Land wanted my thoughts on why

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.650
people are fascinated with the brain-eating
undead.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.069
&nbsp;So I’m going to tell you in one take with
no edits while this brain cooks.

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.529
Here we go.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.500
The modern zombie creature -- contagious,
flesh-eating, rising from the dead -- is not

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.680
that old.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.390
Your Grandpa Joe didn’t grow up knowing
what a zombie is the way you do now.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.030
Our zombie launched into the collective imagination
with George A. Romero’s 1968 classic film,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.550
Night of the Living Dead.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.250
The zombie has since become an awesome video
game enemy, a horror and action entertainment

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.390
staple, and a barometer for modern social
roles -- as well as a psychological mirror

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.260
for our own hopes, fears and anxieties.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.750
We live in a mass information, global society,
and zombies help us confront our individuality

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.650
and our mortality.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.440
One of the main themes of zombie stories is
powerlessness in the face of the impending

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.130
doom they bring.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.520
The hordes of zombies never stop coming and
every new victim who falls prey becomes part

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.640
of their sea of decay.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.920
What’s unique about zombies as a foe as
opposed to say, aliens, is that they aren’t

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.330
outsiders… they’re us.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.040
And because zombie-ism is a seemingly incurable
contagion that spreads to anyone, it becomes

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.250
a pandemic, capable of infecting not just
strangers but friends and family.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.162
Panic over the widespread breakout of a fatal
disease is an unfortunate, but all too real,

00:02:07.162 --> 00:02:08.162
part of history.

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:09.700
I think my brain is burning.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
Woah.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.360
Things are getting crazy in Brainland.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.630
Oh my god.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.310
Listen, the Black Death wiped out somewhere
between 30 to 60% of Europe’s total population

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.080
in the 14th century.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.690
We all know what it feels like to be sick,
and we know the struggle to get healthy and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.069
get back on our feet and live our lives.

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.280
The struggle to return to normalcy.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.930
By fighting back against the symbolic zombie
sickness, we stare death in the face and choose

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.569
life in the most literal way.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:55.320
But it’s not just a simple life and death
conflict, it’s also consciousness vs. unconsciousness,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.660
a battle to prove that we are human.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.570
While you can only stop a zombie by damaging
its brain, zombies already suffer a great

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.040
deal of brain damage.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.790
They have a damaged cerebellum which causes
lack of motor skill coordination, a loss of

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.400
hypothalamic functioning that leads to insatiable
hunger, they have no language, no memory,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.480
no frontal lobe functioning.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:28.830
&nbsp;No area of the brain responsible for consciousness
and making humans… human.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.300
Zombies are the mindless masses.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.030
And becoming one of the mindless masses is
a worry for individuals overwhelmed by the

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.180
infinite information, connections and communication
modern society provides.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.220
Our fear of slowly shuffling around reality
in obscurity due to the complexity of our

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:58.250
world makes us fascinated with what would
happen if it all stopped… being so complicated.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.629
Post-apocalyptic scenarios give us a window
into the simplicity of a life focused solely

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.099
on basic survival against the backdrop of
a fallen contemporary civilization.

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:15.400
&nbsp;Peeling back the layers of interpersonal
and societal problems and saying, “Your

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.590
Facebook drama doesn’t matter now.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.750
Do you want to survive?

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.880
Then grab a barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat
and let’s go.”

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.470
Let’s stand up to the temporal limits of
our existence and figure out the best path

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.490
forward.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.500
Together.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.340
Because we aren’t zombies.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.360
Our mental capacity for consciousness is what
makes us human.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:57.520
So when it comes to zombies it really is all
about… brains.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.940
This doesn't look very cooked.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.320
Wish me luck.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.699
Oh, it's hot.

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.160
Ooooh.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.080
Oh yeah.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.690
I don't know what to say about that.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:21.880
Ugh.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:29.240
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:39.180
