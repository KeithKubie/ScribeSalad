00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.390
In 3JS a directional light is created and added to a scene by code like this.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.537
The 1st value is the color of the light, in this case the light yellow. The

00:00:07.537 --> 00:00:11.656
second is the intensity. Setting the light's position is how you actually set

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:14.950
the vector, by setting 200, 500, 600 we're saying that the light, which is

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.460
infinitely far away, comes from a direction that goes from point 200, 500, 600

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.678
to the origin. Note that the length of the direction vector does not matter. We

00:00:24.678 --> 00:00:27.765
could of just as easily set 2, 5, 6, or even smaller for the so called position

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:30.170
and we'd get the same result.
