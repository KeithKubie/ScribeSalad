Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich. Today on radio lab,

2
00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:06.140
our topic is the music in our heads. How does it get there?

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Where does it come from and why won't it go away? Yes. No,

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.230
you think that the music you listen to is your music.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.450
It comes from the place you live,

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.670
but there is such a thing as everybody's music.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.730
And we offer the next story as a kind of proof comes to us from reporter Gregory

8
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.090
Warner, Gregory Warner. You won a journalism fellowship and they said to you,

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.120
you could go anywhere in the whole world. Where did you decide to go?

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.720
So I went to Afghanistan. Have you ever been to a war zone before by any chance?

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.340
Yeah, I mean I've, no, but have you done any international reporting before?

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.210
Well, actually earlier that year I had been in Astonia covering and accordion

13
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:46.620
festival. So that was a, a prime piece of, uh,

14
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.870
so you play the accordion? I play accordion.

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:51.840
Do you like that an accomplished accordionist? No, no, no, no.

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.410
I'm just an amateur. Accordionist okay. So when you go to Afghanistan,

17
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.960
do you bring your accordion with you? Yeah, I brought my card.

18
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.620
How does that work out? Well, I show up in Afghanistan.

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
I'm carrying my accordion and I'm thinking maybe this wasn't the smartest idea

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.320
because it did. It wasn't an accordion playing crowd. I mean,

21
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:14.610
I was coming down the street and women in Burkas are holding their babies and

22
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:19.320
little boys will actually sob, sob, begging you to sort of buy a piece of gum.

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.270
Here I am with my shiny red accordion and it's just not very appropriate.

24
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.810
Does there come a time when you're actually willing to use the accordion? Well,

25
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.970
it was a weeknight and was in my living room.

26
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.810
They find the jeep who's my fixer and translator, he's working for me.

27
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.350
He's lying on his back and he's flinging his legs up into the air.

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.320
A guard is catching his legs and flinging the back down. Well,

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.290
this is a kind of Ab crunches. That's what we're listening to now. Yeah,

30
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:50.490
there he's throwing his legs up. [inaudible] pushes him back down, going up,

31
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.400
back down. So I figured I'd help him out.

32
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.710
So I started playing my accordion for him.

33
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.043
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

34
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.310
<v 0>it's going well. The Jeep's bopping his head too,</v>

35
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.820
and then he kind of looks at me. This is [inaudible].

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.640
How do you know Afghan music?

37
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.900
I see I'm not playing African music. And he says, yes, you are. I say, no,

38
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.180
I'm not. Yeah you are. I said, no, no, no, that,

39
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.240
that's like folk songs from the 60s called. Those were the days my friend,

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.580
some song that my, my mom used to sing.

41
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.880
<v 2>Oh, so [inaudible] is my friend. That's my mom.</v>

42
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[inaudible] we'd sing him dance forever and a day.

43
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.390
<v 0>He says, no, no, that's an Afghan Afghanistan.</v>

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.330
And then he's back to the app crutches and I'm like, no, no, no way.

45
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.410
Wave it to please tell me the story of those were the days my friend.

46
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.890
So what's the story of a, those were the days my friends,

47
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.830
that's what we call it. Tell me about that song.

48
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.870
[inaudible]

49
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.860
<v 3>talking as from all senior who is famous for being the classic Nova.</v>

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.690
His name is [inaudible] feminists and Guy Gudnason.

51
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.530
It's 25 years ago, but not [inaudible].

52
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.040
Then Paul showed them time. [inaudible] done house for them. Done. Huh?

53
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.153
[inaudible]

54
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.210
<v 0>wait, wait, wait. That's not [inaudible]. Okay. It's true.</v>

55
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:31.910
He did get it wrong, so I forgot about it. I thought he was crazy.

56
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.810
Then he kept happening. I would bring my accordion played for some people.

57
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.260
Every time people would say, hey, isn't that an homage to your song?

58
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.950
How do you say, oh, how do you spell this name? Z. A. H. I. R. I'm e. Z.

59
00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:44.750
Who is he? Well, that's what I wanted to find out.

60
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:49.400
So the first thing that deep gave me was his entire CD collection and one night

61
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.820
I sit down and listen to it. I'm hearing one western riff after another.

62
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.730
John Lennon, Nat King Cole. Definitely a lot of Elvis.

63
00:03:55.731 --> 00:03:56.840
Like I realized on this tune

64
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.040
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.510
<v 0>isn't Ahmed's at year two you can actually overlay the Elvis version.</v>

66
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.040
<v 1>No,</v>

67
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.380
<v 4>right on top of it.</v>

68
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.340
<v 0>Is he stealing these tunes? Is that what you're saying?</v>

69
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.490
It's more like he Afghan eyes them like here's one of his biggest hits.

70
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.093
Don Harstad them ton

71
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.300
<v 3>[inaudible]. I'll show them time [inaudible]</v>

72
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.420
<v 0>hey, you remember this is the song that the jeep sung to me,</v>

73
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.700
but it did sound familiar. So I emailed this tune to an old friend at St Louis.

74
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.470
He immediately said, Oh yeah, that's that western disco hit lb.

75
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.440
<v 4>Ah, that's a daisy. This is the Western version.</v>

76
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.290
It's the same melodies. Ahmed's a year version. Same Keven.

77
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.220
Now let's just go back to the Ahmed Sayer version for a second.

78
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.530
<v 3>Listen to this by Linda [inaudible].</v>

79
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.530
This is east meets West. I'm and say your style.

80
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.150
And this is like the mega hit in Cabo 1973

81
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.980
this is the sound of Afghanistan.

82
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.000
[inaudible] yeah.

83
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.030
<v 0>So I begged the chief to tell me more, but this Ahmed's say guy.</v>

84
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:25.350
And finally he says, okay,

85
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:29.730
I'll take you to meet the old childhood friend of the man himself.

86
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.110
So we drive up to this gate. This guy with white hair opens the door. Whoa.

87
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.240
In a jeep chat for a bit. [inaudible] said that dark,

88
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.900
dark said that died down. He's been friends with them.

89
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.020
It's been here since the fourth grade and he takes us inside.

90
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.910
He closes the gate behind us, the scene changes. Suddenly it's a garden.

91
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.400
Birds are chirping and then sit out,

92
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:57.560
stops and he points to this old fountain in the courtyard and he says something

93
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:00.890
in the jeep and the jeep starts laughing and jeep says, you know,

94
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:04.940
this is the fountain where Ahmed Z or used to play his cordia

95
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.720
Zaire plays accordion just like me. They're saying that a force,

96
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.630
the girls were lying down there and he was playing accordion here,

97
00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:19.070
you know 40 girls, 40 girls.

98
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.700
Oh they, they did call them Casanova for a reason. What was that? Okay,

99
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.650
cause in Afghanistan maybe girls and boys aren't supposed to like be hangouts

100
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.260
because Afghanistan was a pretty different country in those days.

101
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:32.600
It's something I didn't even realize until I got there.

102
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.710
This is the 70s the women are wearing skirts and Jane Fonda haircuts.

103
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.910
The men are wearing sideburns and they're doing their James Dean and it's not

104
00:06:40.911 --> 00:06:42.200
just what people are wearing,

105
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.010
it's that there's this sense of possibility in there that things are opening up.

106
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.310
Finally, and the poster boy for all this is almond Sayer.

107
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.510
He's a bad boy that I'm even going go on with the pitch and Nami Poma they can

108
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.440
have the concert. Everybody,

109
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.270
all the girls would come to his concerts.

110
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.640
We are in new clothes and not on all the girls of Afghanistan,

111
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.060
but the foreign girls, they also weren't in love with him.

112
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.070
Let me just play one little clip from one of his shows and I want you to hear a

113
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:17.330
little screen that comes right in right here.

114
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.620
[inaudible] for young Afghans at the time, especially young African women. Um,

115
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:28.420
it's a year. He was like, God, what does that accomplish?

116
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.240
No, mother will give birth a child to as good as [inaudible]

117
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.760
and this is where the story gets a lot darker.

118
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.120
It's 1973 the Russians start to move in and the new president that they put in,

119
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.640
he doesn't really like him. It's like year at all. Why? Well,

120
00:07:51.641 --> 00:07:55.300
it was really in their interest that Ahmed's a year would come out publicly

121
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:59.100
praising the government and he always refused to do it. Anything political,

122
00:07:59.101 --> 00:08:01.170
he wouldn't play the show. And some of his songs,

123
00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:06.171
especially the later songs started to actually have coded anti government lyrics

124
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:07.530
in them. Oh yeah. Yeah.

125
00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:10.650
And then he would have other lyrics about how freedom is the most important

126
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.340
thing. So what did the government doodle? They ban his songs from the radio.

127
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.380
They start throwing him in jail kind of regularly,

128
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.090
but even when he gets out of jail,

129
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.940
he refuses to play any of the communist party event.

130
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.780
But he plays plenty of his own shows. In fact, after one concert,

131
00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:28.610
he meets this beautiful woman named for Hero. The way she tells the story,

132
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.320
he taps her on the shelter. He says, Hey, says hi. Can I talk to you?

133
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.490
I turned my face. I said, yeah. He said, no, never mind.

134
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.120
He tapped you on the shoulder and he said, can I talk to you? And then he said,

135
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.700
nevermind. And he walked away and he just walked away.

136
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.600
That was pretty good seduction technique, I guess. He was very good in it.

137
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.650
You got some guns like that and he got hurt and they got married, right.

138
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.560
And she got pregnant. Meanwhile,

139
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.130
the political situation was getting worse and worse.

140
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.990
All his friends are fleeing the country.

141
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.840
<v 5>There are murders, tortures. Somebody came to our house, knocked the door,</v>

142
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.820
and he said, can I talk to Ahmad site please? Ms [inaudible] offered him,

143
00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:08.560
can I get you a drink? I said, no, no, no.

144
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:12.790
I've just come from the Ministry of Interior. There's a plan for you.

145
00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:14.410
I don't know what they're going to do to you.

146
00:09:14.411 --> 00:09:17.830
That's all I want to tell you to be careful, but I'm

147
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.240
<v 0>say you're in his wife. They don't do anything. They don't. They don't leave.</v>

148
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.900
Why? He says, oh, we'll go after the baby's born. Five days later,

149
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.810
it's his birthday. June 14th,

150
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.350
1979 he's actually signing a contract for a concert that they went to sign a

151
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:33.600
contract. As he's driving away, he tells her to make some lunch.

152
00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.653
<v 5>It wouldn't be come back.</v>

153
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.270
We'd go shopping and then I will make Lasagna and then we'll go out.

154
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:44.540
<v 0>So she makes Lasagna and she waits for him to come back and she waits and then</v>

155
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:45.384
she falls asleep.

156
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.800
I had a very weird dream.

157
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:56.390
<v 5>I'm somewhere very high in the mountains and I have no shoes and there's a very</v>

158
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.150
strong wind blowing and my hair is everywhere. I,

159
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.890
I see him, not the way he went in the morning.

160
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.750
His beard is out,

161
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.340
like he hasn't shaved for past two days and he has something white around him

162
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.550
and something is pulling him.

163
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.940
And he's calling me that I don't want to go.

164
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.390
And second day I woke up, I ran down, I saw my father in law.

165
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.790
He wouldn't talk. He was just bending the know,

166
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:33.300
like shaking himself and bending and just holding my hand.

167
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:38.900
I didn't know anything. What, what, what happened? So what happened then?

168
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.240
<v 0>Well, the government says that, um, it's a year, had a traffic accident,</v>

169
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.850
but everybody else tells me he was shot in the head,

170
00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.210
probably by government operatives and the news spreads through all the

171
00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:51.880
neighborhoods in town. So you have Tajiks, poshed tunes,

172
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.540
Uzbeks they're all getting up and not really knowing what else to do.

173
00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:57.670
They come walking to Ahmed's Edgar's house,

174
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.810
the courtyard starts filling up with people. 5,000, 200.

175
00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.610
They're inside the house. They're outside that has,

176
00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.320
they're on the street at this point.

177
00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:09.070
The body comes Bourne by six policemen on a stretcher.

178
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.820
People start to whale, they start to push. In fact, all the windows break,

179
00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:13.780
the doors break.

180
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.160
They bring the body through the courtyard into the living room and for here

181
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.610
pushes through the police and she sees her husband's body on the stretcher.

182
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.810
So I thought he was hurting,

183
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.320
<v 5>does something. And when I pulled the sheet from his face,</v>

184
00:11:26.321 --> 00:11:30.610
that's when I fell down on top. And when I fell,

185
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.620
they took me to the hospital and that's how [inaudible] was born. So

186
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.280
<v 0>does she go into labor cheap? She goes into Labor right there. Yeah.</v>

187
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.750
And she almost dies in childbirth. Yeah. But her baby saved.

188
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.240
She saved and her baby has the same birthday.

189
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:47.970
Then her baby was born on that very day. That very day.

190
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

191
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.010
<v 3>what happened was then the music basically stopped.</v>

192
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.380
It's that winter that the Russians and invade starts a long period of war.

193
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.880
You have the jihad, then the mujahideen and the civil war.

194
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.400
When the Taliban come in, they just band music

195
00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.540
<v 0>entirely. I mean, no instruments.</v>

196
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.310
We're talking 20 years where the cultural life of this country,

197
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.160
basically, it's frozen.

198
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.830
I can't even imagine what that's like.

199
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.580
I can barely go a day without hearing some tunes.

200
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.990
2001 the Americans come in, Afghanistan opened back up,

201
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:33.610
the radios turned back on

202
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:35.810
<v 3>and who comes out of them?</v>

203
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.310
[inaudible] so Greg, when you turn on the radio today in Kabul,

204
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.020
do you hear I'm in Zaire,

205
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.710
I'm telling you it's my main way that I connect with taxi drivers and variably

206
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:53.590
they're listening to nods. I hear song even now. Oh yeah. Why?

207
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:54.424
Because there's just nothing

208
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.710
<v 0>been a chance for new artists to emerge or it's just, you know,</v>

209
00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.970
it was a deep freeze.

210
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.090
And also I would say he reminds everybody of what cobble used to be.

211
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.090
I had this experience with my accordion again and again myself.

212
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.920
Even when I played people in my music,

213
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.600
they get this smile on their face as if I was reminding them of something they

214
00:13:11.601 --> 00:13:13.160
knew before me. In fact,

215
00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:17.180
there was one time I was up north and there was this big music festival and I

216
00:13:17.181 --> 00:13:20.690
had brought my accordion and they said, well, why don't you play? And I said,

217
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.630
well, I mean I could play for you. Sure. And they said, how bout right now?

218
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.010
And so they kick the band is on their off. They send them to drink green tea,

219
00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.370
they shoved me up on stage. I'm standing in front of 300 Afghans.

220
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:32.563
And these guys,

221
00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.120
<v 3>they're not from Cabo, they don't speak English,</v>

222
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.000
they're not wearing suits and ties. This is a very Afghan crowd.

223
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.510
So I figure I should play some Johnny Cash.

224
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.453
<v 1>Lauren</v>

225
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:01.343
[inaudible] [inaudible]

226
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.340
[inaudible] do you was the best crowd I've ever had.

227
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.773
[inaudible]

228
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.080
<v 3>Greg Warner traveled to Afghanistan with support from an international reporting</v>

229
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:48.010
project fellowship from the John Hopkins School of Advanced International

230
00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:52.370
Studies. And if you visit our website, radiolab.org you can see

231
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.340
<v 6>video, actual video footage of that Johnny Cash concert.</v>

232
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.350
It's worth checking out each. She shot it.

233
00:14:57.351 --> 00:15:01.160
So there you see them all in their strange non-country Western clothing.

234
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:03.950
Well we should, we're out. We're out of time. When you're on our website,

235
