00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.330
RYAN (VOICEOVER): Wendy came
by with a motorcycle that

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.120
needed some custom touches.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.620
But Wendy ain't just
your average rider.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.960
She's actually at competitive
racing motorcycle rider.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.380
And this bike is a
rare racing motorcycle.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.330
She wanted us to move
some things around

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.710
on it for her leisurely
2000 mile rides.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.040
And Ryan did his
amazing custom touches

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.330
on it to make this thing as
cool as the lady that owns it.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.420
Shannon, you come on, brother.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.670
Bring out that beautiful bike.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.080
Oh, wow.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.420
Just from here.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.080
Walk around, tell
us what you think.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.750
WENDY: She's beautiful.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.580
SHANNON (VOICEOVER): This
was a different kind of job

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.330
for a different kind of rider.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.540
And man, I think it came out as
cool as the lady who owns her.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.920
Wendy's the real deal
when it comes to racing.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.500
So she wanted to keep all
the performance of that XR

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.540
1200 while giving her some style
and creature comforts as well.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.580
Wendy packs a lot of coolness
into a small package.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.120
So we adjusted the
handlebars and the seat

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.460
so she could sit and
steer comfortably.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.790
And adjusted the kickstand
so she can actually reach it.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.250
Ryan took the original
look of that 1200

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.250
and added some perfectly subtle
touches that let the world

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.420
know this is a special bike.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.790
And it belongs to a
very special lady.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.580
- First impression.
- This is amazing.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.790
It's beautiful.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.080
It's more than I
could have imagined.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.710
RYAN: I love it.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.750
Shannon, walk Wendy around
everything that you've done.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.120
The bars, you needed
them pulled back to you.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.580
- Yep.
- Which was great.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.210
I mean, I feel comfortable
on this bike, so.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.460
We did repad the seat--
- Nice.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.540
And bring it down.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.620
SHANNON: She can slide-- yeah.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.790
Slide around.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.620
RYAN: Drag her knees
around corners.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.080
Imagine that.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.830
I don't know if I'll
be dragging my knees.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.420
Your sissy bar is on here
so you can hold your pack.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.120
This is just an extended bag if
you were taking a longer trip.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.330
OK.
It looks fantastic.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.830
MAN: Well, speaking of looks.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.250
Ryan, please explain the
beautiful visuals on this.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.830
I'm a huge fan
of gold leafing.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.670
And it was used
heavily in racing

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.830
because that was the
original reflective material.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.670
So I did all the
lettering in gold leaf.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.290
You can't be missed.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.500
I wanted to commemorate your
cannonball experience, and

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.170
especially your Isle of Man.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.830
But I didn't want to
stand out and be gaudy.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.000
I wanted it to be classy.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.750
So I did that in gold leaf.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.290
It's perfect.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.670
MAN: Subtle, beautiful,
the styling bro, I love it.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.170
It was stressful.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.670
I mean, it was worse than
doing something for you.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.420
Cause she--
MAN: Well, bro.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.960
She's badass.
MAN: That's the key.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.790
Not that you're not, but--

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.210
Trust me, man.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.620
I would not do the things
that Wendy has done.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.040
You and me both.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.620
We all love this
bike like crazy.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.380
This thing is totally cool.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.790
How do you feeling about it?

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.000
I can't wait to ride it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.040
That's the best
compliment I can give.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.290
It's the best thing I own.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.790
Don't let us
stand in your way.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.330
I've got one more thing for you.
Give me a second.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.710
OK.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.670
MAN: Tell me about the
cannonball experience.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.000
OK.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.170
So I was fortunate
enough to be asked to be

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.880
on a relay team across country.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.880
And I ran Pulaski, Virginia
to Memphis, Tennessee.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.000
It was 520 miles in six
hours and 15 minutes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.210
That's amazing.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.880
Oh my Lord.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.080
You can't do any of those
things in most of the states

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.330
without that.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.040
Oh my goodness, look at this.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.710
This is fantastic.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.580
Helmets are so personal.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.380
Look at it, it matches.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.380
Yes.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.920
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.830
- Are you kidding me?
- Thank you, Thank you.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.040
Thank you for trusting
us with this bike.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.380
The bike is
magnificent, we dig it.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.580
But the story behind it just
makes it so much cooler.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.080
WENDY: She's beautiful.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.330
MAN: Well you know what
would look more beautiful?

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.920
Seeing you slip on
your lid and take

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.580
this thing down the street.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.420
We should do that.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.920
I think you should.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.880
I'm not going with you.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.380
You're not going--

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.000
I was going to ask, you
want to ride on the back?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.080
Nope, nope.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920
Not after hearing your stories.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.960
No way.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.420
I'll just watch from way behind.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.210
She looks like she's
going over 100 miles an hour

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.250
just standing.
MAN: Right?

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.750
Right?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.790
Real gloves, real lid,
she got on the real shoes.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.880
Look at this.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.540
Look at this.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.250
Wendy, you rock.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.420
Thanks, guys.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.120
MAN (VOICEOVER):
Man, meeting Wendy,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
you wouldn't guess in 100 years
that she's a motorcycle racer.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.960
But watching her throw
her leg over this thing

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.250
and taking off down the
road, it was obvious she

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.290
knew what she was doing.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.750
That is one cool lady.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.250
She's going to be enjoying
this bike for miles,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.080
and miles, and miles.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.250
And that gives me smiles.
