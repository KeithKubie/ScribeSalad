00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.759
It turns out that even the
most random day of you life

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.075
might follow a global pattern.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.220
Anthony here for DNews.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.330
Think about your weekend.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.745
You head out to hang
out or do errands.

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:17.835
Do you think much about
the route that you take.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.320
You probably think you do
things in a very patterned

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.710
or a totally random way.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.010
But research says,
you're probably

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.000
following the same
pattern whether you're

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.130
thinking about it or not.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.800
There's an order to your day
that you're not even aware of.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.090
And it's called the Levy Walk.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.732
The Levy Walk describes a
pattern of hunting in animals.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.190
And if you take a
look at a couple,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.970
they're not exactly the same.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.600
Though you can see
a clear pattern.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.390
And the idea is
this, animals when

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.530
hunting make these random
clustered movements to find

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.635
food in a small space.

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.260
And then when they
decide they probably

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.480
exhausted their possibilities
in an area, they just bolt.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.930
Tearing off in one random
direction for a while

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.720
and then clustering again.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.160
It's been found
in birds and bees,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.535
it's been found in land mammals,
and sharks, and spiders,

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:58.550
and even bacteria.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.100
It seems to be
the go to strategy

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.930
for just about any
living thing out there

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.319
that needs to find food
in its environment.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.210
But it's been thought that
early humans might not

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.815
have fallen into
the Levy pattern.

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:12.800
That because of our higher
cognitive ability and or more

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.690
advanced memories,
we'd of somehow

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.020
been more systematic
in our searches.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.970
So Anthropologist David Raichlen
at the University of Arizona

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.470
decided to test that.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.730
He asked members of the Hadza,
a group of hunter gatherers

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.390
in Tanzania, to wear GPS
loggers on their arms.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.040
The Hadza gather 95% of
their food in the wild.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.480
They hunt warthogs, and
they eat tubers, and greens.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.660
But by watching how they
moved for about a year,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.260
Raichlen found that
regardless of how

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.550
they were getting their food
foraging, or hunting they

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.225
followed the Levy pattern
about half the time.

00:01:43.225 --> 00:01:44.600
And it makes sense
up to a point,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500
you use up the resources
of a small area.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.000
And then you take
off for a new one.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.470
But why move so far?

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.430
Why hasn't a tribe like
the Hadza developed

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.800
a more ordered or
sophisticated system?

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.175
Is there really
even significance

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.216
or is the Levy pattern
one of those things that's

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.640
just random enough that we
can fit it into most places?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.370
Now, Raichlen said that we can
see the Levy pattern in more

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.060
of our everyday
lives then we think.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.080
We might have even built
our cities around it.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.900
For instance, I do
most of my errands

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.449
or hanging out in
my neighborhood

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.380
within a short distance
of my apartment.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.470
And then I shoot off for a while
in one direction towards work.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.470
2007 study showed that
statistically people walking

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.270
around a city center, College
campus, theme park, shopping

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.840
mall, basically any walk around
10 kilometers or shorter,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.080
tends to follow a Levy pattern.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.730
So the goal now is to figure
out if a Levy pattern really

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.700
is as ingrained
in us as it seems.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.195
And if so, why?

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.500
Why do we set out
completely randomly

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.140
and then naturally
follow this pattern?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.790
And now that you know about it,
can you see it in your life?
