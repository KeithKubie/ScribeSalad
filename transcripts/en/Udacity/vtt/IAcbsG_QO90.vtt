00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, this is a really tricky question and that's why we saved it for last.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I always save the good stuff for last.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This problem involves two masses

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
connect by a string which is draped over this pulley, so it's free to rotate.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What we're going to do is solve this question algebraically to get an equation that tells us

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"If we let the system go, what will happen?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Will it accelerate counterclockwise or just stay in this sort of equilibrium where nothing moves?"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In regardless of the motion, I want to know some numbers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I want to be able to quantify this. What exactly will the acceleration be?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's see if we can solve this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
When we look at a complicated problem like this, we don't want to get scared.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The first thing we want to do is make some sense of it in our heads.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
once we do that, we might have some bright idea about how we approach it quantitatively.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When I'm doing this sort of thought experiment in my head,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
one question I'm going to ask is--what happens when the masses are equal?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Will this whole system be motionless? Will it accelerate clockwise?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That would mean this guy goes up and this guy goes down.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Or will it accelerate counterclockwise?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
That would mean this mass will go up, this one would go down,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the pulley would spin that way.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'm also going want to think about "What will happen when m₁ is the bigger mass?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This guy is heavier than this guy. Or when M₁ is the smaller mass?"

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you, for each of these three cases, tell me what you expect the motion to look like?
