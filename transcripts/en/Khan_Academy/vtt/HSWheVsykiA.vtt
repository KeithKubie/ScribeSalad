00:00:00.838 --> 00:00:03.738
If two m times k is equal to 6.

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:06.317
Them m times k is equal to.

00:00:06.317 --> 00:00:08.914
So let's rewrite that down here.

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:11.225
Two m times k is equal to 6.

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:13.976
And we need to figure out what m times k is.

00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:17.377
Well we can really just put these parenthesis around mk.

00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:23.294
Multiplication is associative. So this can be rewritten as two times mk is equal to 6.

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.335
And that becomes pretty obvious how to solve for mk.

00:00:26.335 --> 00:00:29.764
Divide both sides by two you're just going to have mk on the left hand side.

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:30.841
So let's do that.

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.662
Divide both sides by 2.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:39.452
You're left with m times k is equal to six over two. Or three.
