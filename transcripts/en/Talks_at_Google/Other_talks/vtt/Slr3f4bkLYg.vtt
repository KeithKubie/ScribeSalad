00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.210
&gt;&gt;Boris: Welcome everybody. Thank you for
showing up at another Authors at Google talk.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.900
It is my distinct pleasure today to welcome
Nicholas de Monchaux who's a professor at

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.400
UC Berkeley, graduate of Yale and Princeton,
and he's going to talk today about the design

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.939
of the Apollo spacesuit. It's an interesting
not only technological story but a design

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.620
process story and I think it will reverberate
with some designs decisions that we ourselves

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.560
have to often make at Google.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.340
So please give a warm welcome to Nicholas.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.340
[applause]

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.379
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Thank you very much
Boris. Thanks a lot for having me here today.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.020
I'm just gonna introduce myself a little bit
because I'm not actually a professional spacesuit

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.040
historian at all and so I think especially
in front of an audience like this I think

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.890
it's maybe interesting to say just a few words
about what I actually spend much of my time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.420
doing and how my interest in this project,
this history of the Apollo spacesuit actually

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.470
developed out of that.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.470
I'm an architect and urban designer and I
spend most of my time thinking about cities

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.299
and how we can use technology to make better
cities, which is probably not unrelated to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.970
some issues that you guys are thinking about.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.229
This is an exhibit that I have up at the moment
at the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.720
Association or SPUR on Mission between Second
and Third. And the exhibit it's a bit dark

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.530
but I'll show you I can't resist showing you
my Google map browser of the exhibit's material

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:57.299
and the exhibit is of a set of landscape designed
for 1600 city owned vacant parcels in San

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:06.070
Francisco that uses computer simulation and
modeling to design thermodynamically sustainable

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.510
landscapes with low albedo surfaces and storm
water retention, and that we calculate could

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.470
save the city some billions of dollars in
energy and environmental costs.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.989
But that's not what you came here this morning
to hear about. So let me get on to the actual

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.230
topic of my talk and I'll tell you a little
bit at first about how I'm structuring the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.549
talk. The Apollo spacesuit, that is to say
this object, was made of 21 different layers

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.940
of fabric each with a separate function, each
hand stitched by women taken from the bra

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.990
and girdle assembly lines at the Playtex Corporation.
And the talk today will be assembled much

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:55.989
like the suit itself in 21 different layers
or anecdotes dealing with different topics

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.889
that add up to make a comprehensive and robust
picture of what this object was and why it

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.410
was the way it was.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.630
The fundamental question of course is why
was this spacesuit soft? This is especially,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.850
this is not just a rhetorical question in
fact for most of the 1960's it was assumed

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.250
automatically that the clothing that protected
astronauts on the surface of the moon would

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.750
be made of hard, interlocking layers of fiberglass
and aluminum and would resemble very much

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.209
the spacecraft and larger infrastructures
of the vast Apollo enterprise. And in fact

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.610
as I said this turned out not to be the case.
The spacesuit that was successfully launched

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.729
onto the moon was this 21 layered soft, almost
couture sewn assemblage.

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.859
This fundamental question is the question
I'll try and answer a little bit in the talk

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.440
and which the book of course goes into at
much greater length.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.720
[pause]

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.329
So before we start talking about spacesuits
we need to really understand what space is.

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:16.120
There's a couple of things that make space
really interesting in this context. By definition

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:22.720
space it turns out is the environment which
we cannot go into without the help of technology.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.150
We are all familiar with the Montgolfier brothers'
[inaudible] balloon ascension in the 18th

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.940
century. But almost immediately a week later
a much more powerful hydrogen balloon was

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.460
sent up by a scientist named Jacques Alexandre
CÃ©sar Charles and he went to about 18,000

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.820
feet in a hydrogen balloon in the 18th century
and he complained of intense earaches, cold,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.060
bleeding from the nose and mouth, and he never
flew in a balloon again; he was quite chastened.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.290
But this was the first intimation we had that
this natural environment that our bodies are

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.840
well acclimated to didn't extend infinitely
and in fact was very limited.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.600
This is a slide from a 19th century balloon
expedition in which the aeronauts found themselves

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:18.800
paralyzed by lack of oxygen. It's a lesson
that we didn't, that we kept on learning well

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:28.210
into the 20th century. This is Captain Hawthorne
C. Gray who went up to 4,000 feet in a open

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:36.080
balloon gondola in 1927 to explore upper atmospheric
effects for the Army. He of course did have

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.580
oxygen equipment but that equipment failed
and he was paralyzed by the effects of high

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:51.060
altitude and came back to earth as a corpse.
I can't help but reference you his citation

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.170
for a posthumous distinguished flying cross
which said, "No doubt his bravery exceeded

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.810
his supply of oxygen."

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.240
[laughter]

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.580
But suffice to say that the older explorations
of the early 20th century came up in fact

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.740
with many different definitions of space.
For astronomers space starts at about five

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.230
million feet of altitude where the atmosphere
no longer distorts at all star light; for

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:24.830
aviators space came to begin at about 250,000
feet above the earth where air no longer supports

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:33.880
winged flight; for rocket engineers space
begins at 100,000 feet; but for doctors, for

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.690
the physicians of the human body, space begins
at the lowest definition of all, about 15,000

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.370
feet where an ordinary human who's not acclimated
needs oxygen in order to survive.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.750
[pause]

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:55.780
So when we look at the beginning of the 20th
century one thing is very important to understand

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:02.590
and that is the newness of all the new looks
that came to define the cultural and technological

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.110
world in which we came to exist after the
Second World War.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.240
The first of these new looks and the most
famous was of course to do with fashion; it

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.620
was the new look of Christian Dior a phrase
coined by the fashion editor Carmel Snow editor

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:24.680
of Harper's Bazaar. It was interesting to
this story for a couple of reasons: one it

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.910
was the first fashion, that is to say, the
first fashion design that was promulgated

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.490
almost exclusively by media. It was in the
words of Dior, "A bloodless but inky revolution."

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:43.220
It didn't happen so much on the body as in
all the different newspapers and media outlets

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.490
in which it took place.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:53.169
The second important point of relevance with
the current story is it was also a business

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:58.240
and management revolution. Dior was the first
fashion designer to invent the modern couture

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.060
system with advice from Stanley Marcus, the
proprietor of Neiman Marcus. He turned fashion

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:09.169
into a massive business, a massive organizational
enterprise as well as a couture assembly.

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:14.930
And the last point of relevance with our story
is that undergirding all of these new looks

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:20.820
especially in fashion in the post-war era
was this distinctive devise the girdle which

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.620
shaped and gave architecture to women's bodies
in a way that wasn't necessarily comfortable

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.180
but lined up with the visual and aesthetics
of the era.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.930
[pause]

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:39.040
So from the new look in fashion we come to
a different new look: what was called the

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:45.450
new look in defense planning. It was literally
so called by Admiral Arthur Radford who was

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.310
chair of Eisenhower's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.231
And the new look in defense planning is something
that's very important to understand in the

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:58.240
history of the space race and indeed in the
history of 20th century itself. It had to

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.820
do with the fact that Eisenhower when he came
into office was burdened with the Korean War,

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:13.200
with many more of these ground wars or proxy
wars of the Cold War on offer. And he convened

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:19.130
his National Security Council to think deeply
about the future of American defense and American

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:26.550
defense spending, and he made a crucial, fateful
decision that instead of fighting the Cold

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:31.980
War through ground battles as was the case
in Korea he directed that the Cold War would

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.860
be fought instead through technology, through
developing better and more threatening nuclear

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:45.450
technologies that would establish this tense
stalemate that defined the Cold War era. Now

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.100
of course he would warn against the effects
of the vast military industrial complex that

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:56.360
was the main product of that in the last speech
he gave in the Presidency.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:03.750
But this new look, this is the new look of
the bikini tests soon gave way to this new

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.750
look. To the attempts to make the highest
tech weapon that had heretofore been assembled

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:15.089
which is the intercontinental ballistic missile.
And the intercontinental ballistic missile

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:21.080
was first designed by a single company as
had every single weapon that the American

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:25.920
defense establishment had constructed up to
that point. That company was Convair and the

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.850
results of their attempts to design the first
American ICBM was disastrous, the things just

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:38.850
kept blowing up and they blew up for all kinds
of reasons that could not possibly be anticipated.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.370
These were the most complex mechanisms ever
assembled by man and they had all kinds of

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:49.870
crazy problems which would not surprise any
engineer. The gyroscope in the guidance system

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:54.360
happened to resonate at the same frequency
as the turbo fans and the rocket propulsion

00:10:54.360 --> 00:11:00.140
device. All these things which couldn't be
anticipated before the launch and which led

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:06.000
to a series of cascading catastrophic failures
when these complicated mechanisms were tested.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.649
In response to this came yet another new look:
the invention from whole cloth of something

00:11:13.649 --> 00:11:18.190
called systems engineering which we're so
used to by now that we take for granted but

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:24.380
which itself was a substantial and major innovation
of the Cold War. Systems engineering was invented

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:30.230
by the people on the covers of Time Magazine
here: Bernard Schriever and Dean Wooldridge

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.320
and Simon Ramo, who founded what would later
become TRW.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:42.290
And systems engineering was a system of mathematical,
cybernetically inflected virtual relationships

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.750
that were designed in the informational centers
of these design efforts, control rooms they

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:53.300
were called, in which the organizational structure
of a bunch of people designing something was

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.770
given explicitly to mirror the physical structure
of the thing that they were designing: inputs

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:04.070
and outputs, black boxes, and in order to
be able to start to master the complexity

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.470
of these vast industrial enterprises.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:13.870
Interestingly enough of course it was this
vast mechanism, this military industrial complex

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:19.930
that Eisenhower warned us of that came to
be repurposed into the civilian, ostensibly

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.890
civilian National Air and Space Administration.
All the rockets on which American astronauts

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.330
were launched except for the Saturn V were
repurposed nuclear missiles.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:35.280
Dwight Eisenhower, in as far as I can figure
out his only direct design decision that he

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:41.300
ever made while President, directed very particularly
the vast complicated architecture of these

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.680
ICBM's all made by, each part made by different
companies: North American Raytheon, etcetera

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.450
would all be whitewashed into a single color
and painted only USA so as to give the illusion

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.459
of a unitary effort to what was in fact a
vastly networked enterprise.

00:12:56.459 --> 00:13:01.660
[pause]

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.660
So what about suits?

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.910
[pause]

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.490
[laughter]

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:12.800
Well the first ever pressure suit, that is
a piece of clothing designed to allow a human

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.000
being to exist for long periods at a very
high altitude, was also not incidentally the

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.790
first one to appear in film or television.
The suit worn here, the suit on the left hand

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:32.330
side is a mock up made by the Columbia Pictures
scene shop, but the suit on the right is a

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.620
real pressure suit and it's worn by, making
a cameo appearance in this film called Air

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:42.209
Hawks from 1931, by an aviator by the name
of Wiley Post.

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:48.440
Wiley Post was one of a pioneering generation
of barn storming pilots who attempted to outdo

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.800
each other setting records in order to both
compete with each other, but also set the

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.029
groundwork for what would later become the
civilian aviation industry.

00:13:57.029 --> 00:14:02.550
Wiley Post bought his first flying lessons
with the money that came from a settlement

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:09.019
from a mining accident where he lost his right
eye, but he got a bunch of money from it and

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:14.860
he taught himself to be a pilot and he became
this astonishing one-eyed pilot who set the

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.670
first, was the first person in fact to fly
all the way around the world non-stop landing

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:26.970
of course to refuel, thus beating the record
set by the Graf Zeppelin, the giant inflatable,

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:32.680
that had done the same in three weeks by about
14 days.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.620
In an attempt to fly higher and faster, Wiley
Post was also the first to discover the jet

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.649
stream, this massive superfast stream of air
that goes across the country from West to

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:48.550
East. And trying to set an aviation record
by flying into the jet stream and using its

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:56.180
power he encountered all the physiological
difficulties of aviation encountered by the

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.490
first balloon explorers of the upper reaches
of the atmosphere. But he had a thought that

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.140
was entirely original.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.550
When trying to set these aviation records
he decided it would be too cumbersome to try

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:13.190
and pressurize the cabin of his aircraft,
the technology to do that in a way that the

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.050
aircraft could lift and move didn't exist
at the time, but he could make a pressure

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:21.910
vessel the shape of his own body. He called
up the B.F. Goodrich Company and asked them

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:28.250
to make quite literally in his own words,
"A tire in the shape of a man." A rubber device

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:34.769
in which he could move very slowly and primitively
like a basketball inflated pressure vessel

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:43.709
wants to be very stiff. And in this suit he
started towards setting the most astonishing

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:50.339
aviation records for fast times across the
country that would ever be set in the early

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:52.800
part of the 20th century.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.380
Unfortunately Wiley Post died in a plane crash
with Will Rogers who he was piloting around

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:05.290
Alaska to go fishing and the record was never
set. But the research that went into the making

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:09.690
of his suit lay dormant until it was picked
up much later in our story.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:14.060
[pause]

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:20.600
In contrast to the pressure vessel made for
Wiley Post this device that would bring an

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:27.279
earthly, a low altitude atmosphere up into
high altitude to allow a human being to exist,

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:33.160
the first proposal for how men would walk
on the moon was the opposite. It was invented

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:39.950
by these two fellows. Their names are Manfred
Clynes and Nathan Kline and at the time of

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:45.209
this photograph and at the time of their invention
they worked at this place: a 10,000 patient

00:16:45.209 --> 00:16:47.870
mental hospital on the outskirts of New York
City.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:57.550
At that mental hospital Nathan Kline, the
chap on the right here, was in fact the first

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:03.240
physician in the United States to discover
both the first anti-psychotic drug fighting

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.789
schizophrenia and the first MAOI inhibitor
which was the first major drug against depression.

00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:13.889
And as a direct result of Kline's discovery,
the early part of the post-war era saw the

00:17:13.889 --> 00:17:20.699
vast deinstitutionalization of previously
intractable mental patients and thus gave

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:27.789
the two, Nathan Kline was a doctor and Manfred
Clynes was actually an analog computer programmer

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:33.700
who worked with him, the sense that if the
physiology of the brain could be so readily

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.220
controlled with drugs in these revolutionary,
what was called the new look in psychiatry

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:44.080
at the time, could be accomplished then why
not the entire remaking of the human body

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.909
to travel into space?

00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:50.990
To describe this concept which the two presented
to the Air Force in 1958 they invented a new

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:58.679
word: the word is cyborg, cybernetic organism,
a human body controlled and manipulated by

00:17:58.679 --> 00:18:04.870
the insertion of various chemical and mechanical
mechanisms. And for several years in the late

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:11.289
50's and early 1960's this was assumed to
be a viable and indeed most attractive option

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:13.509
for how to get human beings to operate in
space.

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:19.480
United Aircraft was commissioned to produce
a vast study of how this thing might be accomplished

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.480
and it was only when various other exigencies
of the space race, which I'll talk about in

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:29.380
a moment, came into place that the concept
was abandoned.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.059
[pause]

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:37.899
To talk about a very different kind of body
it's about time that I presented to you the

00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:43.659
history of this particular company: the Playtex
Bra and Girdle Company that was in the end

00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:49.820
to create the clothing worn on the surface
of the moon. In describing his new look Christian

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.970
Dior himself had said, "Without foundations
there can be no fashion." And these foundations,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:19:01.859
the most popular and successful foundation
garments of the post-war era, were made by

00:19:01.859 --> 00:19:03.659
the company Playtex.

00:19:03.659 --> 00:19:09.880
Playtex had been founded by a chap named Abram
Spanel from Rochester, New York who had made

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:18.419
his first fortune selling rubber impregnated
garment storage bags that could be vacuumed

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:24.519
out with the new vacuum cleaners that were
being popular. He turned this fortune into

00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:29.799
another business making diaper covers for
babies from which the name Playtex came. And

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:35.529
the reason he made diaper covers for babies
is that latex had a habit at the time of splitting

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:40.139
and so he couldn't make garments for adults
because the garments might suddenly decide

00:19:40.139 --> 00:19:42.230
to dissolve at any moment.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:43.490
[laughter]

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:52.639
But in the late 1930's Spanel figured out
a way to make latex durable enough to make,

00:19:52.639 --> 00:19:57.700
replacing the fabric and whale bone corsets
of the time with rubber girdles, what he called

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:04.279
"the living girdle" since it was made from
a living material. In the post-war era of

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:10.350
course Playtex became vastly popular, vastly
successful as a company. Its headquarters

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:15.679
were in the Empire State Building. Spanel
moved into Drumthwacket, the mansion that

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:18.419
he would donate to become the New Jersey Governor's
mansion.

00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:23.669
But during the Second World War the company
almost went broke because it had no government

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:30.429
contracts and latex was judged to be a protected
material. So to safeguard the future of his

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:38.590
company after the Second World War Spanel
funded out of his own pocket a research division

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:46.440
that could work on potential government applications
of Playtex's technology. As chief executive

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:53.169
of this research division Spanel appointed
a man whose technical and engineering skills

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:59.109
he respected enormously, that is to say his
television repairman, a guy named Lenny Shepard

00:20:59.109 --> 00:21:05.159
who was to become the engineering head of
the Apollo spacesuit project later on the

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:07.669
20th century.

00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:09.559
[pause]

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:18.919
So what happened to derail the cyborg concept
and to start to derail these military industrial

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:24.179
utopian imaginings of how man might go into
space and start to put enough pressure on

00:21:24.179 --> 00:21:30.879
the process that something really unexpected
like the commissioning of Playtex could happen?

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:35.539
What's happened of course is this: according
to a statement released by the Soviet Union's

00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:41.940
TASS News Service on April 12, 1961, "After
the successful completion of the planned investigations

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:47.100
and of the flight program the Soviet spaceship
Vostok made a safe landing at the predetermined

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.159
place. The pilot cosmonaut Major Gagarin made
the following statement, 'I beg to report

00:21:52.159 --> 00:21:56.169
to the party, to the government, and to Nikita
Sergeyevich Khrushchev personally that the

00:21:56.169 --> 00:22:01.179
landing was normal, that I am feeling well,
and have sustained no injuries or disturbances'."

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:06.019
[pause]

00:22:06.019 --> 00:22:12.179
What the report failed to own up to was a
fact that was in fact was covered up by the

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:17.090
Soviet authorities until the 1980's which
is that Gagarin did not land in his spacecraft

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:25.139
at all. Russian spacecraft were sufficiently,
the geopolitics of the time meant that Russian,

00:22:25.139 --> 00:22:29.869
Soviet spacecraft unlike American spacecrafts,
could not land in the oceans controlled by

00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:37.379
American Navies but instead had to land in
the vast plains of Kazakhstan in Siberia.

00:22:37.379 --> 00:22:41.590
The retro rockets that were designed to slow
these capsules enough so that they would not

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:47.779
produce a giant crater in the flat plains
of Siberia were judged to be sufficiently

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:52.080
unreliable at the time of Gagarin's landing
that he in fact ejected from his capsule in

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.580
the stratosphere and landed separately only
in his spacesuit. And in fact those famous

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:04.629
letters CCCP on his helmet were painted just
minutes before launch when an engineer realized

00:23:04.629 --> 00:23:09.480
that because he was going to land only in
a parachute and a spacecraft he could be mistaken

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.559
for an American spy plane pilot unless his
uniform contained an identifying marking.

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:18.019
[laughter]

00:23:18.019 --> 00:23:21.489
[pause]

00:23:21.489 --> 00:23:25.899
Now the person who really had to respond to
the perceived threat of the Gargarin launch

00:23:25.899 --> 00:23:30.269
was John F. Kennedy. And John F. Kennedy plays
a distinctive and really fascinating role

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:36.999
in this story especially around considering
the fragility of the human body and how it

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.279
must be protected in space.

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:44.649
John F. Kennedy changed his shirt five times
a day, he changed his suit up to two times

00:23:44.649 --> 00:23:50.890
a day, and he was uniquely conscious of image
and the presentation of the body. This was

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:57.009
in fact because he was enormously sick for
his entire life. He had been pronounced dead

00:23:57.009 --> 00:24:03.330
in 1947 and resuscitated because of problems
with his adrenal disease, Addison's Disease,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.859
for which he had pellets of time released
medicine implanted in his thighs every six

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:13.239
months for the rest of his life. He walked
most of the time with crutches when he was

00:24:13.239 --> 00:24:22.269
outside of the public view and he had injections
of Novocain put deep into his back up to three

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:27.119
times weekly by a doctor throughout his White
House years. In fact there was a betting pool

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:33.749
in the Secret Service as to whether he would
spend most of a second term in a wheelchair.

00:24:33.749 --> 00:24:39.020
Perhaps because of his need to constantly
mask his illness and present his own body

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:48.849
[clears throat] as a crisp, mobile, athletic
figure, Kennedy was also uniquely able to

00:24:48.849 --> 00:24:53.610
understand the power of the new communication
media of his own time, of television.

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:54.859
[pause]

00:24:54.859 --> 00:25:02.639
When Gagarin was launched and made such an
incredible impression on the media of his

00:25:02.639 --> 00:25:07.789
age, Kennedy demanded immediately of Lyndon
Johnson, who is the titular head of the U.S.

00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:13.499
space efforts, as to whether there was any
particular effort that the U.S. could make

00:25:13.499 --> 00:25:18.729
in space that would promise results by the
end of the decade and results which could

00:25:18.729 --> 00:25:19.960
especially be televised.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.250
[pause]

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:32.090
Johnson reported back that it would be possible
if vast investments were made to land an American

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.190
on the surface of the moon and return him
to the earth.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:44.099
Only three weeks after Gagarin's launch this
policy was enacted by an act of Congress and

00:25:44.099 --> 00:25:49.539
funds were commissioned that were by 1966
would amount to 5% of the entire U.S. federal

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:58.190
budget. Thus any conception of American space
exploration in the 1960's as being a slow,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.610
expanded, engineering effort in which things
were prototyped and slowly worked out over

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:09.609
time is completely false. This was a completely
crash effort in which no expense was spared

00:26:09.609 --> 00:26:15.950
and in which only efficiency and effectiveness
of function was the defining criteria.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:23.320
[pause]

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:29.190
In the early 1960's it was popularly understood
that American astronauts were going to have

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:33.359
to be paragons of physical function. We've
all seen The Right Stuff where they're tested

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:37.860
and twirled and moved around. In fact this
was not the case at all.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.149
[pause]

00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:46.669
The defining engineering characteristics of
the human body that were to control the space

00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:52.360
race mostly shaped around the body of this
man, John Paul Stapp, who operating a series

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:59.259
of rocket sleds in the Mirock Desert established
the limits of human resistance to acceleration,

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:06.200
to spin, using his own portly middle-aged
physique. These limits were then engineered

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.331
into the vast contractual web of relationships
that would control the space race.

00:27:10.331 --> 00:27:14.279
[pause]

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:19.830
What in the end though scotched the attempts
by NASA to display their astronauts as paragons

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:26.099
of physical form was the fact that it turned
out as tested by Randall Lovelace, a subcontractor

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:33.129
to the Aerospace School of Medicine in San
Antonio, women could it turns out pass most

00:27:33.129 --> 00:27:40.419
of the acceleration and twirling tests, etcetera
far better than men which immediately led

00:27:40.419 --> 00:27:46.440
to a whole separate mythology, that of a qualification
as a test pilot for being an astronaut from

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.440
which women were, of course by nature, excluded.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:55.129
[pause]

00:27:55.129 --> 00:28:02.399
So what were spacesuits? The truth of the
identity of especially the early spacesuits

00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:08.759
of the American space program, the Mercury
and Gemini suits which only as we should remember

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:15.099
only were used four or five years before the
Apollo suit is shown up by this image in which

00:28:15.099 --> 00:28:22.039
Alan Shepard's Mercury suit bleeds Army green
from underneath the silver coating. The silver

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:28.279
coating was in fact simply a sprayed on finish
to give a space age look to a military high

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:35.769
altitude pressure suit built by B.F. Goodrich
based on their expertise with Wiley Post and

00:28:35.769 --> 00:28:36.970
used by Mercury astronauts.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:43.330
Now most of the pressure suits of the mid-century
era were like this one. They were what's called

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:48.820
partial pressure suits that exerted mechanical
pressure on the body to avoid all the physiological

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:55.619
effects of altitude. They used these inflated
tubes on the side to squeeze that form fitting,

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:58.599
tight cloth around the body.

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:05.600
Full pressure suits were by contrast cumbersome
and bulky. But substantial innovation did

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:14.179
come in the 40s and 50s when the same engineer
who had outfitted Wiley Post in the 1930's

00:29:14.179 --> 00:29:20.969
for B.F. Goodrich watched a bug called a tomato
worm crawl around his garden. And like any

00:29:20.969 --> 00:29:26.679
if you can visualize the caterpillar, the
caterpillar has these kind of banded bubbles

00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:33.159
around it that allow the pressure within the
organism to remain constant as it moves and

00:29:33.159 --> 00:29:43.320
articulates its body in order to move around
a leaf. And so these kind of ribs were used

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:52.070
and became the popular image of spacesuits
as seen here in Herge's Explorers on the Moon

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:56.759
which was written in 1951.

00:29:56.759 --> 00:30:02.019
The later public image of spacesuits of course
became of these shiny suits. The first shiny

00:30:02.019 --> 00:30:09.250
suit was made for the X-15 high altitude research
program. And the reason it was silver was

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:15.379
very simply because the company that made
the suit, David Clark Company, had been really

00:30:15.379 --> 00:30:22.399
excited in about 1956 to get its suit on the
cover of Collier's, which was like getting

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:30.269
on Good Morning America or something like
that today and they'd been bumped at the last

00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:34.389
minute because they were told by the editors
of Collier's that the suit did not look spacey

00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:35.389
enough.

00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:36.389
[laughter]

00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:42.049
And so immediately they revised the suit to
be coated with this silver lame fabric and

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:47.179
they claimed, as in this photo here of test
pilot Scott Crossfield, that this was to resist

00:30:47.179 --> 00:30:55.169
the thermal rigors of space but in fact this
was not the case at all. And in fact early

00:30:55.169 --> 00:30:59.880
Gemini astronauts who still had silver suits
found that when they got out into space the

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.289
silver coating was the least functional thing
of all because it dazzles you with the unprotected

00:31:05.289 --> 00:31:08.649
rays of the sun as they reflected off your
own clothing.

00:31:08.649 --> 00:31:14.389
So for the first American EVA's as with here
with Ed White the spacesuits became white

00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:20.450
instead of silver with a commensurate effect
on science fiction of course as Buck Rogers

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.710
in the middle of the 1960's stopped wearing
silver and started wearing white on American

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.710
television.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.249
[pause]

00:31:27.249 --> 00:31:34.350
But the spacesuits themselves for Gemini were
not much better than the tight, constricting

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:41.539
suit worn by Wiley Post in the 1930's. This
is a picture of Gene Cernan after his Gemini

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:49.639
EVA and if he looks completely exhausted it's
because he is. When he got to the ground,

00:31:49.639 --> 00:31:58.389
the suit technicians after his splash down
removed about a liter of water from each leg

00:31:58.389 --> 00:32:08.169
of his spacesuit of his own sweat. He lost
all 10 fingernails from clenching the tightly

00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:20.129
inflated rubber gloves of his suit. And against
this background the suits of the Mercury and

00:32:20.129 --> 00:32:26.419
Gemini efforts were judged completely inappropriate
for the massive and essential extravehicular

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:30.139
activity of the lunar launch.

00:32:30.139 --> 00:32:33.529
Now whoever's phone that was I have a rule
in my lectures at Berkeley that if a phone

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:38.230
goes off I get to answer it, but I won't impose
that rule here.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:39.230
[laughter]

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:40.379
&gt;&gt;male voice: [unintelligible]

00:32:40.379 --> 00:32:42.539
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: [laughs]

00:32:42.539 --> 00:32:49.570
So, now of course, as they'd sought to design
these pressure suits NASA engineers were getting

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:54.570
quite nervous about this prospect of doing
something they'd never done before which is

00:32:54.570 --> 00:33:00.950
to say landing something on the moon. And
the very nature of this enterprise, a vast,

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:06.589
expensive, truly important engineering endeavor
designed to do something that would never

00:33:06.589 --> 00:33:13.039
be done until the first time it was done,
meant that Apollo's, that one of the other

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:19.330
fundamental technologies that is the legacy
of Apollo today is the technology of simulation

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:24.809
itself. That is to say of, and specifically
of digital simulation, of trying to do things

00:33:24.809 --> 00:33:27.509
before you have to do them.

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:29.339
[pause]

00:33:29.339 --> 00:33:35.490
Simulation technologies and flight simulation
was first invented in the 1930's by the Air

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:41.499
Force in order to train pilots in foul weather
flying without actually having them go up

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:50.179
in bad weather. The first simulator company,
The Link Company, was an organ company not

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:54.769
coincidentally because all these simulators
used pneumatic tubes to provide a kind of

00:33:54.769 --> 00:33:58.480
analog computing model of simulation.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:04.070
And interestingly enough also in this context
the very first digital computer with magnetic

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.760
stored memory, the World Wind computer, was
itself originally designed to be a flight

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.780
simulator to allow the Air Force to test out
aircraft before they had been actually designed.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:22.860
This project grew far outside of this origins
to become for a stored program computer that

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:29.970
you can see over in the Computer Museum. Interesting
enough its main simulation technology was

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:34.270
in the end used to do was to do the very first
[clears throat] electronic map projection

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:40.300
for the Air Force's early warning defense
systems also in the 1950's.

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.490
[pause]

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:44.200
But I digress.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:53.100
Each space mission: Mercury, here Gemini,
and here Apollo had commensurately massively

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:58.420
larger and massively more complicated simulation
devices. I don't know if you can see but that's

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:05.990
a little model of the, well full scale model,
of the Apollo command module here with these

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:12.620
vast architectures of simulator lenses around
it. The glass in this simulator alone weighed

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.730
more than the actual Apollo capsule.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:22.170
In fact highly sophisticated techniques of
projection were deployed to give a pseudo-three

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.480
dimensional aspect to the pictures outside
the window. When you moved your head the pictures

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.910
themselves would simulate parallax and move.
But the complicated analog computing of these,

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:38.410
but when it came to simulating the Apollo
mission soon gave way to this: the very first

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:45.700
digital simulation; a program which could
store 256 edges and polygons that was used

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:50.890
by each Apollo astronaut to simulate over
and over again the process of landing on the

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.150
moon with the lunar lander.

00:35:52.150 --> 00:36:01.350
[pause]

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:08.740
In 1962, NASA had the task of designing and
making a suit that could not only allow a

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:14.790
man to be outside in space but allow him to
walk around, to do work, to fix his spaceship

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:21.110
if need be, and they had no idea how this
would be done. They did what any good governmental

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:29.020
organization does which was put out an RFP
and winning suit by far was this suit, the

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:34.690
SPD 143 named for the, the SPD stood for the
very same specialty products division that

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:40.100
had been set up by Spanel at Playtex to do
government research. And the great innovation

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:47.010
of the suit was these rubber pieces here which
combined the tomato worm bellows that had

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.890
been invented for the Tintin suits with the
sophisticated assemblage, internal assemblage

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:59.420
of nylon tricot, a fabric used for bras that
allowed these convolutes as they were called

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:07.390
to both be flexible and also under an enormously
high pressure. These convolutes formed the

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:12.840
joints of the suit and formed the basis of
the suit's success.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:19.570
But Playtex at the time was a small company,
a company associated with women's underwear,

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.920
and you can just imagine how the same NASA
which had so quickly scotched even the idea

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.400
of women being involved in the space program,
you can guess how excited they were to have

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:35.360
Playtex as their main subcontractor for the
suit. So instead of hiring Playtex they made

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:41.130
Playtex into a subcontractor to a large company,
Hamilton Standard, a division of United Aircraft,

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:48.740
that they judged to have the best organizational
skills and paper engineering skills to make

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.740
the process work.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.370
[pause]

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.570
But this was a shotgun marriage --

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.170
[laughter]

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:03.630
that was singularly unsuccessful. The cultures
of the two companies were enormously different

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:09.080
not only was the main engineer of Apollo,
Lenny Shepard a television repairman, his

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:15.701
main lieutenant George Durney was a former
sewing machine salesman. In fact, both NASA

00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:24.440
and Hamilton Standard were accused of with
derision calling these guys, saying that these

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.730
guys were not qualified to design spacesuits
because they had only graduated from the school

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.730
of hard knocks.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.470
[laughter]

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:36.420
Instead within Playtex the phrase hard knockser
then came to be a badge of honor for people

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:42.100
who understood the empirical way of working
with the body sometimes it at the expense

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.780
of paper efficiencies.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:52.780
The whole prospect came to a head in 1965
when ILC was removed for a whole variety of

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:58.410
reasons, some cultural, some engineering related,
from the spacesuit contract, but successfully

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:06.420
argued its way back into a competition between
an ILC suit, this suit made by Hamilton Standard

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:09.180
and a suit made by the manufacturer of the
Gemini company.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:15.470
When one of the other competing suits was
going down a model of the lunar lander ladder

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:21.220
the helmet blew off. When another suit was
being tested on a simulated lunar surface

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:26.120
the shoulders of the suit slowly expanded
enough that the astronaut would not have been

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.960
able to get back into the hatch of the lunar
module and would have been stranded on the

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.000
moon forever.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
[laughter]

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.700
So there was actually indeed in the end very
little competition. Playtex by far had the

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:42.580
best suit and they were hired as the prime
contractor for the Apollo spacesuit from 1965

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:51.300
onward supplying every suit that walked on
the surface of the moon. When in 1967 their

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.600
position was again threatened, in this case
by another set of suits made by a company

00:39:55.600 --> 00:40:02.550
called Litton Industries, they sent with a
modified version of their original suit called

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:09.390
the A7LB, this film of a fully pressurized,
fully suited suit technician playing that

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:14.970
most masculine of games football on the Dover,
Delaware football field. They were victorious

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.921
and they made the rest of the suits for Apollo.

00:40:16.921 --> 00:40:18.420
[pause]

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:25.050
So how was the suit actually made? Well it's
mostly made by hand and it was mostly made

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:30.910
by women taken from the bra and girdle assembly
lines of the rest of the Playtex company who

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:38.041
had to sew to one-sixty-fourth of an inch
tolerance 21 layers of thin, gossamer thin

00:40:38.041 --> 00:40:43.350
fabric, each slightly larger to the next,
it was like a giant Russian doll, all without

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:47.101
the aids of any pins or fasteners that could
potentially puncture the suit if they were

00:40:47.101 --> 00:40:53.050
left in this massive assemblage. They did
it on Singer sewing machines. The only modification

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:57.460
was one of them was given a very long arm
as you can see to allow the whole suit to

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.470
be moved around underneath it and sewn together.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:02.220
[pause]

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.980
Drawings which as architects and engineers
were used to creating objects, were used to

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:11.970
drawing things before we actually make them
were only produced after the fact. They were

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:20.380
a contractual obligation that ILC had to NASA
and the suits were slowly taken apart and

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:28.140
enumerated by hand in order for this contractual
obligations to be met.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:32.370
One of Playtex's biggest arguments with NASA
was over the fact that within this larger

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:37.110
systems engineering hierarchy anytime an object
was modified to be different from any other

00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:41.470
object it had to have a separate serial number.
This meant that when it came to fitting the

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:47.240
bodies of the astronauts NASA's proposal was
to have every single part of every single

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:52.020
astronaut's suit, these were all custom fit,
have a different serial number which ILC said

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.011
was ridiculous. They wanted to instead use
just the designations small, medium, and large.

00:41:57.011 --> 00:41:58.250
[laughter]

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:04.580
ILC was in the end victorious and all the
suit elements were sized small, medium, and

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.630
large except for the urinary collection device
which after an incident, I kid you not with

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:16.690
the first astronaut fitted, was sized large,
extra large, extra, extra large.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:18.440
[laughter]

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.190
[pause]

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:25.620
So this is a fascinating history but it was
not at the time the public face of spacesuit

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:32.350
design. At the time the public face of spacesuit
design focused on suits that came from this

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:37.210
one. This was a suit made by Litton Industries,
another big engineering conglomerate at the

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:45.270
time. It was originally made to allow components
of vacuum tubes to be tested under electrical

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:51.290
load inside a vacuum chamber by a technician
suited in this hard, heavy suit. But as you

00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:59.360
can see in the late 1950's when space travel
was on the rise culturally, post Sputnik,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:06.740
and vacuum tubes were being replaced by transistors,
Litton quickly repurposed this effort into

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:13.020
making spacesuits leading to this press release
by NASA titled, "Nothing New Under Ye Oldie

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:22.620
Sun" of 1959 which trumpeted this hard prototype
aluminum suit as the iconic image of space

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.600
travel.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.810
And these kinds of suits which reduced human,
the vast mobility of the 37 degrees of freedom

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:36.470
to the human body to a system of engineered
joints and swivels, etcetera were the suits

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:41.310
that most preoccupied spacesuit designers
at the time. These suits were labeled RX because

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:48.710
the main suit technician of NASA, Joe Kosmo,
called them the "prescription for suit design."

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:52.490
And they were also beloved of the military
who commissioned for their own space station

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.420
under planning at the time this suit which
would have lots of different modules to fit

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.800
different parts of the body and actually would
have a rocket pack to allow quick evacuation

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.140
from the capsule if necessary.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:09.060
The suits were very beautiful but they were
never to actually fly on the moon. But they

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:16.790
remained, interestingly enough, the public
face of space travel as here in the 1970 American

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:21.830
Pavilion of the Osaka World's Fair where the
last prospect facing the audience was these

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:27.992
hard, beautiful suits against a prospect of
the moon.

00:44:27.992 --> 00:44:28.992
[pause]

00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:34.220
Of course at the time a much more compelling
picture was being made, was being promulgated

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.470
which was this picture, a picture of Neil
Armstrong on the surface of the moon. What's

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:44.110
particularly interesting about this picture,
again in the context of relating this to our

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:53.000
current historical moment, is as least two
things. One that CBS, which more than 70%

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.950
of Americans watched the lunar landing on,
invested massively in its own simulations

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:03.910
inventing such things as green screen technology
for the purposes of effectively communicating

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:10.080
what was going on with the lunar effort. This
was a rubber lunar landscape that rolled --

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.210
[laughter]

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:17.710
underneath the superimposed lander to give
a sense of what was going on.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.150
This is Walter Cronkite sitting at the set
that was designed for it. The set was called

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:27.270
Hal 10,000 because it was actually designed
by the same set designer, Douglas Trumbull,

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:34.670
who had worked on 2001. And not incidentally
the producer of this vast non-linear experiment

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:39.700
in television broadcasting was this fellow,
Robert Wussler, who would become with Ted

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:44.860
Turner the founder of CNN.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.010
[pause]

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:54.430
Now the other component, I'm gonna talk especially
to this audience about the main other manufacturer

00:45:54.430 --> 00:46:00.080
of beautiful hard suits, in fact those most
beloved by designers and engineers which were

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:06.981
invented just hundreds of yards from here
at the NASA Ames Research Center. These suits

00:46:06.981 --> 00:46:12.690
called the AX series of suits were called
by the noted architectural critic and urbanist,

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:19.040
Michael Sorkin, some of the most beautiful
objects ever made by man. Like the Litton

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.020
RX suits with which their engineering was
related they reduced the movements of the

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:32.950
human body to these elegant conic surfaces
and Teflon lined sliding bearings.

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:36.650
[pause]

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:43.300
One of the reasons that I ended up writing
my book was precisely because it was only

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:48.330
these suits that had ever been written about
by designers. They're kind of balletic movements

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:52.241
and reduction of the body to a single set
of variables.

00:46:52.241 --> 00:46:58.220
[pause]

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:03.070
The question of variables is particularly
interesting. If we were to trace the architectural

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:08.480
legacy of Apollo one component is of course
the suit. But another component is these kinds

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:15.300
of spaces. This is the first control space
made for the North American Air Defense Command,

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:22.460
immortalized in War Games if you remember.
This is the second. And this was the proposal

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:27.030
for the space that was fundamentally based
on it that was to be constructed in Houston

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:33.330
for the manned space flight center, a space
that we now know as Mission Control.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:38.630
In Mission Control all the variables of space
flight, all the vast amount of information

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:43.940
were all brought into one single architectural
space and all the decisions incumbent upon

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:51.560
this vast infrastructure were also projected
from that space. In fact this vast web of

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:59.950
control and connection only broke down in
the Apollo program two times. The first, of

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:06.670
course, was Apollo 13 in which again an unexpected,
catastrophic failure beset the Apollo capsule

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:14.800
leading to one of the world's most immortal
hacks of a air filter from a lunar module

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.990
being adapted with of course Duct tape to
that of the command module.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.690
But I talk about it here not so much because
of this hack, which I of course very much

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:29.140
appreciate, but because at the same time as
they built this the astronauts who had been,

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.370
were it's safe to say a little frustrated
with the whole enterprise of Apollo at this

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:40.080
point, also were the first Apollo astronauts
to disconnect all the biomedical needs which

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:46.500
were otherwise plugged directly into this
output of data. And they felt the need during

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:51.060
this crisis to in fact divorce themselves,
at least divorce at the most intimate level

00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.610
from this larger mechanism of control.

00:48:54.610 --> 00:49:00.540
The other major breakdown was in a follow
on from the Apollo, the Apollo Application

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:06.680
Project as it was known or Skylab in which
the third crew of Skylab, whose every action

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.170
was controlled by a teleprinted instructions
faxed from the earth every morning, felt the

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:18.470
need in the third week of their extended mission
to, as a Harvard Business School study would

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:24.450
later call it, "go on strike in space" and
turn off all communication with the ground

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:30.230
and do something which will be particularly
understandable to a Google audience, which

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:32.350
is just look at the earth.

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.710
[pause]

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:39.260
Interestingly enough they all became committed
environmentalists and devoted their report

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:45.990
of their mission to Congress to an extended
essay on the effects of human technology on

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:48.150
the environment.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.190
[pause]

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:55.930
This is particularly relevant because the
other major architectural application of Apollo

00:49:55.930 --> 00:50:01.800
was announced by Hubert Humphrey in 1968 with
the following words: "Precisely the same techniques

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:05.921
that are going to put our man on the moon,"
he was speaking in 1968, "are going to be

00:50:05.921 --> 00:50:11.020
the techniques that will clean up our cities."
Unlike today where we're used to hearing a

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.680
comparison of difficulty with putting on a
man on the moon with any technological endeavor,

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:21.540
if we can do this put a man on the moon surely
my iPhone can work in downtown San Francisco.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.540
[laughter]

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:27.500
But this was not the case. In fact Hubert
Humphrey was saying that precisely the techniques

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.681
and even precisely the personnel that put
an American on the surface of the moon were

00:50:31.681 --> 00:50:34.930
going to solve the problems of American cities.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:39.880
Starting in 1962, NASA and what was to become
the Department of Housing and Urban Development

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:45.180
had been working closely together and produced
reports like this one which announced that

00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:49.380
"creating a safe, happy city is a greater
challenge than a trip to the moon because

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.080
housing is more complex than a rocket and
the city is subject to more perturbations

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:58.890
than the moon. It's ever changing problems
nevertheless can be attacked in the same logical

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:02.680
way that we've gone about exploring the universe."

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:09.910
This lead to, for instance, that Apollo landing
simulator being used to simulate a modernist

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:16.860
proposal for downtown Los Angeles, the very
first 3-D architectural rending ever made,

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:22.570
and it lead, most interestingly, to the designer
of this space craft a guy named Harold Finger.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:27.450
This is a nuclear propelled deep space propulsion
craft that was designed by NASA and used as

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:36.760
Kubrick as the basis for the spacecraft Discovery
in 2001. Finger was by 1969 Director of Research

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.100
and Development for the Department of Housing
and Urban Development where he directed a

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:47.640
vast digital enterprise called Operation Breakthrough
that sought to remake American communities

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:50.760
through electronic simulation and prefabricated
designs.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:58.010
While they never found success on earth, one
of the five pilot projects were built but

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:02.780
they had terrible technical problems with
things like pneumatic toilets which I won't

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:10.220
go into because it's messy, but you can imagine.
They did in the end find their ultimate expression

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:15.510
in this study which was done by Ames, a study
for a space station built using these Operation

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:23.190
Breakthrough components to be positioned at
Lagrange Point 5 between the earth and the

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:29.400
moon and settled by persons from western industrialized
nations and managed perfectly according to

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.790
"principles from government and industry."

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:34.590
[pause]

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:40.930
The actual Apollo suit we should remember
by contrast was a very different kind of object

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:46.790
and is to this and to the beginning of the
conclusion of this talk that I now turn.

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:53.410
The spacesuit contained 21 layers of fabric;
not one of those was invented from scratch.

00:52:53.410 --> 00:52:59.660
All were repurposed from applications on earth
where a single quality that they had such

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:07.190
as fire retardance or resistance to micrometeoroids
or something like that was their primary use.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:14.000
They were mostly made by the DuPont Chemical
Company which in fact had made most of these

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.700
different kinds of materials as isomers or
slight variations of a fundamental chemistry

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.810
that underlied their business.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:30.340
And what we see if we look at the first Gemini
suit, a later Gemini suit, and then the Apollo

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:37.620
suit is not a kind of singular engineered
from scratch solution but in fact a multiply

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:43.690
adapted layered resilience solution that comes
from adding one thing to another slowly over

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.570
time.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.540
And this brings me to my conclusion

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.470
[pause]

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:59.750
which is to ask you to consider these two
images. The first one of the astronaut at

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:06.090
the very apogee of his expedition on the surface
of the moon sustained only by this beautifully

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:13.520
engineered what was called a PLSS or portable
life support system that was made by Hamilton

00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:21.200
Standard in which the astronaut himself becomes
simply a mechanical figure, another device

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.400
in the kind of cybernetic loop.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.860
[pause]

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:27.010
See that figure a bit more largely here.

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:29.170
[pause]

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:36.470
Contrasted with this image which was a mobility
study of the ILC spacesuit made by the crew

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:44.090
systems division of NASA in which an x-ray
shows both the beautifully handcrafted convolutes

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:49.230
of the ILC spacesuit but also of course the
fabric of the human body itself.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:56.240
And it is the essential point of my book and
of this talk that the spacesuit made by Playtex

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.970
was successful not just because it did in
the end manage to accommodate itself to that

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:07.500
larger military industrial system, but also
because it was in a very important and fundamental

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:14.870
way different from that system, and in a way
that made it resemble nothing more than the

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:21.369
actual body itself it protected, the epidermal
logic if you will of our own multiply resilient,

00:55:21.369 --> 00:55:26.730
multiply adapted machine of a body.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.610
[pause]

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:34.890
This other image points us a bit further and
it's a funny image, of course it's John Young

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:41.640
in his silver Apollo spacesuit, but this image
which I turned up in a folder in an archive

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:50.020
in Houston is particularly, was never published
because of course he's vamping, he's like

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:54.430
being a bit stylish which is not the image
of astronauts. But it is a really interesting

00:55:54.430 --> 00:56:02.520
image because of course it was very much about
fashion and the word fashion here is a particularly

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:06.871
interesting one. Because we should remember
in the context of the way in which a spacesuit

00:56:06.871 --> 00:56:13.260
was made from a girdle was made from a tire,
we should remember that to fashion means on

00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:18.490
the one hand to make something that is superficial
and superficially useless, but on the order

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:22.600
hand the verb to fashion means to make something
out of something else, something it wasn't

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.470
originally intended to do. I don't how many
MacGyver fans are in the audience, but MacGyver

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:31.960
was fashioning the whole time: making a bomb
diffuser out of a paper clip, a parachute

00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:38.369
out of bubble gum and an umbrella. And making
something out of something else something

00:56:38.369 --> 00:56:44.800
to which it's originally not originally intended
is actually the underlying logic of this spacesuit

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:49.020
and of much that amazes us in the world.

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:50.730
[pause]

00:56:50.730 --> 00:57:00.869
The logic of the spacesuit and spaceman was
fundamentally one of, in the end, conflict

00:57:00.869 --> 00:57:06.940
which we can see here. This is possibly my
most favorite photograph of all of Apollo

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:13.720
of Neil Armstrong safely back inside the lunar
module after his EVA. And should see that

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:21.570
he is not only elated but he's also exhausted.
This system, this vast architecture of Apollo

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:29.170
wrung every last ounce out of the astronauts
because it was fundamentally at odds with

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:35.220
what the body wanted to do. And the spacesuit
was an object that not only mediated between

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:41.130
the lunar vacuum and the body but it also
mediated between this vast organizational

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:47.060
system designed enterprise with its utopian
vision of how things could be done and the

00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:53.490
real robust logic of the human body in all
its energy and exhaustion.

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:58.390
We might see here then a similarity between
two of the most discordant elements I brought

00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:04.480
into this lecture: one is Dior's new look
here seen above a map of Paris. This is Paris

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:10.900
even before Houseman when it was only a kind
of medieval fashioned grain and here Alan

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.680
Bean in front of the blue marble of the earth.

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:20.390
And it's of course on the blue marble that
I have to end, but I want to say a couple

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:27.500
of things about this image which we all know
really well and which your company has done

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:34.250
so much to popularize as a modern day interface.
But this is the blue marble, the whole earth

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:42.040
as we know it and I show it to you in its
original orientation because of course the

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.970
capsule harbors its own micro frame of reference
and happened to be inverted from that of the

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:50.590
earth when the photograph was taken and NASA
immediately flipped it around for the press

00:58:50.590 --> 00:58:55.800
release. But I think it's much more interesting
this way. I also want to introduce you through

00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:02.260
the mechanism of that illusion of the images
orientation. As an Australian of course I'm

00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:05.740
intimately contest the northness of all maps,

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.280
[laughter]

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:13.590
but also because this image is also a bit
of an illusion. The earth is huge. This massive

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:19.520
sphere weighs six, six sextillion tons. But
the actual habitable atmosphere is just like

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:26.950
the spacesuit itself fragile tissue around
the outside. And especially in a moment where

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:33.800
we're having discussed broadly that we can
or should re-engineer the earth itself to

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:39.420
technologize our way out of climate change,
the lessons of technology and nature in their

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:45.080
most extreme moments as in the Playtex spacesuit
might be particularly relevant.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:49.150
[pause]

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:52.950
Twenty-five years after walking on the surface
of the moon Neil Armstrong wrote his own letter

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:56.950
of appreciation to the Apollo suit makers.

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:57.950
[pause]

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:02.780
"The suit," Armstrong wrote, "turned out to
be one of the most widely photographed spacecrafts

01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:07.971
or objects in history. This was no doubt due
to the fact that it was so photogenic. Its

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:13.930
true beauty, however," he expounds, "was that
it worked. It was tough, reliable, and almost

01:00:13.930 --> 01:00:14.930
cuddly."

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:15.990
[laughter]

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.750
[pause]

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:23.140
The last and possibly best argument for the
special affinity between the nature of the

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:29.830
bodies of the Apollo astronauts and this object
which protected them is not a matter of storytelling

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:34.930
so much as history, which is to say the continued
attention of the Apollo astronauts to their

01:00:34.930 --> 01:00:40.380
spacesuits to the exclusion of all other artifacts
of the space age. When they come to Washington

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:46.970
Apollo's elite alumni do visit the Smithsonian
but they don't go to the vast cathedral of

01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:53.170
the Air and Space Museum on the Mall instead
they go to a small storage complex, in I kid

01:00:53.170 --> 01:01:01.000
you not Suitland, Maryland, where the remaining
Apollo spacesuits are stored. They want to

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.980
see always if their suits are being looked
after and taken care of as the living material

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.170
of the latex continues to change and transform.

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:12.330
[pause]

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:15.100
They regard the suits fundamentally as part
of their own selves.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:18.350
[pause]

01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:24.101
So, in some ways then, we can look at the
suit as part of all of ourselves and look

01:01:24.101 --> 01:01:30.130
at the suit as a quintessential part of this
most heroic of narratives as a place holder

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:35.560
for all of our own bodies in the endless architecture
of space.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.790
[pause]

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:38.441
So thank you very much.

01:01:38.441 --> 01:01:41.550
[applause]

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:44.660
[pause]

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:53.870
I'd be delighted to take questions if anyone
has any.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:55.140
[pause]

01:01:55.140 --> 01:02:02.380
&gt;&gt;male #1: You contrasted the methodologies
of the corporate cultures between the NASA

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380
--

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.010
&gt;&gt;male #1: contractor system and the Playtex
company's school of hard knocks.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.010
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.940
&gt;&gt;male #1: How far would you push that difference?
Were they just different cultures or were

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:18.190
they really a contrast between the systemic
method of invention and development versus

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:21.251
the sort of anarchy kind of --

01:02:21.251 --> 01:02:22.251
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:02:22.251 --> 01:02:23.251
&gt;&gt;male #1: individuals? How far would you
--

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:27.670
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: It was a massive conflict
and it was not, it was a problematic conflict

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:33.540
too because Playtex had a huge difficulty
with all the reporting mechanisms, the reliability

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.200
indices, everything that needed to be part
of something like Apollo. And I wouldn't single

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:44.780
out any one contract in particular but the
whole history of the kind of military industrial

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.870
spacesuit design is full of things like for
instance a double bladder. It looks on paper

01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:53.359
like the most, like it's gonna be the best
solution because you have, all of a sudden

01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:58.130
you have nine nines reliability because the
change of two bladders breaking is so much

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:04.619
less than one bladder breaking. But then you
also reduce the astronaut to total immobility.

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:09.750
And the Soviets did this with their first
EVA spacesuit that Leonov wore when he became

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:15.050
the first man to walk out in space protected
only by a spacesuit. And the spacesuit became,

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:19.110
this double-aired spacesuit became so immobile
that in the end he needed to let air out of

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:23.480
it by hand in order to make his way back into
the capsule.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:31.560
But the Ames suits and the Litton suits, there
is this, as an architect I design environments

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:36.040
for people all the time and there's always
a difference between the logic of how something

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:40.670
works on paper, the logic how an office building
is supposed to make you all work and how the

01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:48.080
office actually works, and how a power plant
actually works and what actually happens.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:52.670
And there's always this difference and we're
always in some ways designing for people,

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:57.609
designing for human environments is always
a process of managing this gap.

01:03:57.609 --> 01:04:02.200
But it was particularly because it was in
the nature of the space race that the logic,

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.150
this seemingly invincible systems logic that
had made these incredible objects in terms

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:15.650
of ICBM's was a logic which had been developed
only in a kind of closed world of these technological

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:21.890
devices in which it worked very well but not
that had a fundamental difficulty when it

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.500
came to human environments. And that's why
I'm so interested also in all the urban proposals

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.810
that came out of the space race and in their
problems and difficulties which I see as all

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:34.600
the same piece with the problems and difficulties
that the same companies had designing for

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.030
the human body.

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:38.180
That make sense?

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.320
&gt;&gt;male #1: Um-hum.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.320
[pause]

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:46.619
&gt;&gt;male #2: So when you speak about the differences
in culture --

01:04:46.619 --> 01:04:47.619
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:04:47.619 --> 01:04:49.050
&gt;&gt;male #2: in these two companies I mean we're
talking about the 60s.

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:50.050
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:56.690
&gt;&gt;male #2: I mean for your own experience
can you tell is there similar tensions in

01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:58.890
today's companies? I mean is there --

01:04:58.890 --> 01:04:59.890
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Well I mean I have
--

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:01.660
&gt;&gt;male #2: Are there lessons that were learned
--

01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.660
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Yeah.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.750
&gt;&gt;male #2: and are actually like have been
applied?

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:10.790
&gt;&gt;Nicholas de Monchaux: Well, I think it's
really interesting in the context of to be

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:14.970
talking about this here in Silicon Valley
because of course every Silicon Valley company

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:21.980
whether it's HP or Apple or Google starts
with a hack in a garage right? That's the

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:28.460
founding mythology. And so you have I think
especially embedded in the DNA of every technology

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:34.120
company is a conflict between these enterprises.
At some level it can't stay the same as things

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.890
change from being a hack in a garage to being
a massive company with all kinds of issues

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:42.650
of liability and accountability, etcetera,
etcetera.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:49.300
And it can seem though sometimes in managing
this conflict like the kind of, that you can

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:54.241
draw a diagram always and this is the problem
that all of us has of designers is that we

01:05:54.241 --> 01:06:00.970
mistake a simulation; whether it's a diagram
on a piece of paper or a complex fluid dynamic

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:08.600
model, we mistake the kind of seeming legibility
of something that tells us it will work for

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:13.660
something that actually does work. And the
reality of making things work is always a

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.670
balance between the two.

01:06:14.670 --> 01:06:19.270
So to the extent that a company like Hamilton
Standard succeeded it was in its own way through

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:27.840
managing that conflict. ILC was particularly
good at the practical, the kind of boots on

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:33.740
the ground level of hacks and the kind working
all this together and it was particularly

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:37.320
bad at everything else. I mean you see that
in the paperwork all through. It's not like

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:43.359
in 1965 they suddenly learned how to interact
with NASA. They had a terrible time. If you

01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:48.030
through the weekly memos and things like that
they were always being abraded and censured

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:53.000
and they hadn't adequately reported this and
they hadn't adequately reported that. I don't

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.350
mean necessarily even to idealize them as
a company 'cause they had a lot of difficulty

01:06:58.350 --> 01:07:02.600
but they did one thing really, really well
which was understand on a very intimate scale

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:08.750
how the human body really worked. And they
also to their great credit did manage through

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:13.380
appropriating personnel and systems from other
military contractors to in the end make it

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:20.270
all the way through Apollo and engage robustly
with this larger military industrial system.

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:21.440
[pause]

01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:24.380
Thank you for taking time out of your busy
day everybody. I appreciate it.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:24.609
