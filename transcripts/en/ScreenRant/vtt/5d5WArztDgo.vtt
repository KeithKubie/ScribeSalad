00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.559
Most movie audiences head to the theater to
see a story exactly as its told, without looking

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.029
too closely at the plots, characters, or lines
of dialogue. But for the diehard fans always

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.199
searching for added meaning, some twists,
names, or confusing quotes can make even a

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.369
classic movie twice as much fun to watch.
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Hidden Messages

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.130
in Popular Movies.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.269
The Matrix

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.809
There's plenty of symbolism in this sci-fi
series, but younger fans probably missed one

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.110
clever reference. When Neo has gone as far
down the rabbit hole as possible, and is fleeing

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.350
from enemy agents, he makes a strange demand
of his operator outside of the system. The

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.840
line is lifted from an old cartoon series
starring Tooter Turtle, whose adventures in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.510
different time periods would always go wrong
- only his friend, Mr. Wizard could save the

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.760
day. Apparently the show also existed in the
Matrix's artificial reality. Either that,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.229
or Keanu Reeves felt a kinship with the monotone
turtle.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:07.260
Jurassic Park

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.960
It's hard to believe Jurassic Park was originally
NOT going to use CG dinosaurs, but Steven

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.360
Spielberg spent months working with stop motion
guru Phil Tippett to create his dinosaurs

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.590
with the same technique used to bring the
Imperial Walkers and Tauntauns to life in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
The Empire Strikes Back. When the director
asked ILM to show him what a computerized

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.509
dinosaur could look like, the decision was
clear. When Tippett learned he'd been beaten

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.720
out by newer tech, he told the director that
"he'd just became extinct." Luckily, that

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.450
wasn't the case - but Spielberg made sure
to put that very line into the movie.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.450
Jackie Brown

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.880
Every fan of Quentin Tarantino knows that
the director likes to connect his films into

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.280
one universe, with characters living in the
same world, or some films existing as movies

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.890
for those characters to see in a theater.
But what about a movie that reveals it's just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.259
a movie in its own story?

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.219
That's what some fans claim about Jackie Brown.
When a character walks out of a movie theater

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:06.149
to the sound of its credits score, the music
is what's expected of Tarantino. But viewers

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.610
will eventually realize that it's the same
music that plays over the movie's own end

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.870
credits. A shared universe wasn't enough:
the director had to hint that Jackie Brown

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.550
was already playing in theaters while the
cast was still living through it.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.550
Die Hard

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.700
Now known as one of the greatest action movies
of all time, it's easy to forget the softer

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.620
side of hero John McClane. When the New York
cop flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.870
with his family, he brings a gift with him:
a large stuffed bear, complete with a red

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.290
ribbon tied around its neck. If the movie
followed the novel it was based on, that bear

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.610
should have made it to John's daughter, but
director John McTiernan never got to show

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.690
that scene. Apparently, nothing said fatherly
love to the director like a teddy bear, since

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.060
his next movie The Hunt For Red October doubled
down on the idea. When Jack Ryan had saved

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.730
the day and headed home to his wife and daughter,
he did what any good dad would do: picked

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.890
up a teddy bear f his own, red ribbon and
all.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.700
Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.370
It doesn't usually pay to look below the surface
of a movie based on grown men getting hit

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.330
in the face with inflatable balls, but this
is one exception. When the team at Average

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.870
Joe's Gym goes up against the cocky, well-funded,
testosterone-fuelled Purple Cobras, it's a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.200
battle of David vs. Goliath. But viewers might
not realize that seeing the "Joes" vs. "Cobra"

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.610
is one big nod to G.I. Joe and their greatest
enemies. With that in mind, audiences should

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.920
have realized that the Joes would always come
out on top.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Harry Potter

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.739
A good witch or wizard needs a trusty pet,
and for Harry Potter, Hedwig the Owl went

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.769
above and beyond the call of duty. The bird's
dedication to the boy wizard made her a hit

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.989
with fans, and broke their hearts when she
sacrificed her life to protect Harry. A righteous

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.769
death for the boy she loved should have been
expected. In the books, Hedwig takes her name

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.610
from a medieval witch or wizard. But in the
real world, Hedwig is the patron saint of

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.470
orphaned and abandoned children - making her
the perfect guardian for the movie's hero.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.700
Ant Man

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.689
Marvel's Avengers universe is based on fantastic
figures, science, and otherworldly adventures,

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.069
but they're apparently even hard to believe
for the everyday characters inside the films

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.900
themselves. When Ant-Man villain Darren Cross
references the old stories of a miniature

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.110
superhero working in secret, he claims they're
nothing but "propaganda, Tales to Astonish."

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.629
He's not wrong, either. Ant-Man's unbelievable
powers actually debuted in the comic "Tales

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.009
to Astonish", making this one of the most
meta moments Marvel has included, and a major

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:24.040
statement about the hero's entire story for
the viewers who manage to catch it.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.900
Ferris Bueller's Day Off

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.110
Director John Hughes had a knack for churning
out classic movies in the 1980s, and decided

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.820
to remind audiences of that fact in as subtle
a way as possible. The license plate of Cameron's

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.590
father's Ferrari reading "nervous" fits his
character, but it's the rest of the cars that

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.310
deliver the nods to the director's previous
movies: the plate on Ferris' mother's car

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.290
refers to Vacation which he wrote, his dad's
to Mr. Mom, and the principal's plate clearly

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.910
made for Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.910
Avatar

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.290
From the moment Avatar hit theaters, it was
clear that James Cameron had filled the movie

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.300
with tons of political messages. From deforestation,
over-aggressive military, to the destruction

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.360
of Native peoples and the discovery of the
New World - you name it. It didn't take long

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.440
for people to notice that there was one country
in particular that the director was singling

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.370
out. When the movie's villain is explaining
the risks of the planet to his new recruits,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.229
it's hard to miss the stripes of the American
flag shining behind him - once you see it,

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.740
it's not even that subtle.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.740
The Matrix

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.419
Aside from pop culture references, the Wachowskis
also managed to include one massive hint that

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.740
most fans probably never noticed. When Neo
finally confronts the Architect of the Matrix

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.470
in the first sequel, he learns that the creator
of the system has been following him his entire

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.930
life (or lives) - and the first movie already
offered proof. When Neo is first captured

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.800
by enemy Agents, a bank of surveillance monitors
shows him being interrogated. The exact same

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.780
monitors the Architect is surrounded by in
the next movie. Critics may claim the directors

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.810
never planned on more than one film to start,
but some of the bigger ideas were clearly

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.199
there right from the start.

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.620
