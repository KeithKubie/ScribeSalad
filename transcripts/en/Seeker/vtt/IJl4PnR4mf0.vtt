00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.260
The obvious danger, when you're working on a volcano, is dying.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.960
We know that at any point things could go
south in a bad, bad way.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.640
We take respirators to deal with
poisonous gases,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.100
we take hard hats to deal with small ejecta from the volcano

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.240
...but there's only so much you can prepare.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.240
When I've stood at the rim of an active volcano,
I feel like I'm getting a window

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.580
inside the heart of our planet.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.040
It's like looking into something from another world.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.560
That is when you can get really great data

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.480
about the chemistry of the lava, 
about the makeup of the gases,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.629
about how explosive the lavas might be,

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.100
and about how much pressure you're seeing in the magma chamber.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.240
More people than ever before are living in
areas that are volcanic hazards.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.310
We have millions and millions of people who live around these amazing things, but that are also deadly.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.159
My work involves looking at volcanoes in every different way you can imagine, to try to understand

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.470
what makes them tick, and help me someday predict how they're going to erupt.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.340
I mean, that's really the holy grail of volcano research,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.960
because we really want to save lives.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.540
Field work when you’re studying volcanoes is different every single time.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.720
First you’ve got to get to the area, and that may mean taking a helicopter in,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.380
it may mean hiking through jungle-like vegetation or tromping through a desert.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.060
Volcanoes are unpredictable, and that is because we don't have a good window inside of them.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.660
It's not like you can drop a little robot
down and have it measure everything that's going on.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.680
What we're really looking for when we're out there collecting data

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.760
is information that shows a change.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.620
Is the composition of the gas different?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.060
Do we see that the volcano is inflating?

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.900
Is the ground actually moving up or moving down as the magma chamber fills or evacuates?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.540
A volcano could be building up pressure inside of it without any outward indications.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.220
We make hazard maps, we look at old lava flows, map out where the lava has gone previously,

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.700
and then say, “okay, worst case scenario,
what could this volcano do?”

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.740
A lot of the data that we collect when we're out in the field is used to make models

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.020
and help to try to forecast eruptions.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.760
We can't do that yet with any degree of certainty,
but we're getting better.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.700
There have been many deaths, actually, of
volcano scientists while working on active volcanoes,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.780
and it's very sad.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.370
But we’re prepared to take that risk, because we think that what we’re doing brings value

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.780
to our greater society around us, and we want to add to

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.940
that body of knowledge out there about our planet.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.880
All of us have a really healthy respect for
all the different parts of the natural world.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.720
It's some sort of hell-scape, but it's also
beautiful.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.300
The lava is this brilliant, brilliant red
and orange and it's constantly moving.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.980
It never stops. It's like an angry ocean.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.320
You get to see the freshest earth on the planet.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.440
So it really, to me, shows in the clearest
possible way that we have a living planet.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.580
And that is why I love it - that's why I keep
coming back.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.880
In another episode of Science In The Extremes,
a biologist in Antarctica

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.240
vlogs about the extreme conditions 
in which he conducts research.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.160
