Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience,

Speaker 2:          00:02          you going to be happy living forever? Like what if, when you die, it's amazing. What if when you die, there really is a heaven. You really, really do go to some spectacular dimension filled with love and peace and happiness. And there's no emotions like we think about here. There's no fear. There's not none of the things that hold people back. None of the anxiety and the adjunct. It's just consciousness and love. And then you're wasting your time. You're just trying to stay alive, taking pills to live, to be a million

Speaker 1:          00:34          boy. You open up big can of worms, right? Bra, I will tell you, um, Joe, without a shadow of a doubt, none whatsoever. Death is not the end. You don't think so? I know, I know too. How do you know? Cause I've been dead, right? Yes. I think there. What about that experience cemented it in your head? Um, like I said, it was the most peaceful. Um, and, and I, I don't feel like it was the most peace, most restful, most I was, I woke up laughing. I was, yeah. Yeah. My wife tells me I was overjoyed. You woke up laugh. Yeah, I was over to you remember anything about what happened when you blocked out the time? Extremely peaceful. Extreme. I didn't have a worry. Extremely true. And I was not sad at all. You know, I was overjoyed, very happy, very peaceful and erased.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Any fear that I might have had and a, and any fear of dying is gone. I don't feel that at all. It's so, I mean, maybe that's why I don't want to live to be a hundred cause it, I mean, I wouldn't mind visiting that place again, man. It was so much peace so much and it wasn't like, you know, um, this is, you know, I'm just in the ground. I'm a and I'm not a plant, uh, just dirt, you know, I know that I'm in a very comfortable place and, and you know, I wouldn't mind visiting again. I wouldn't mind. Definitely. I hold no fear. And so when I say that it's, it's definitely not the end. You're, I believe that your soul, you know, so people have a different name for a consciousness of whatever. It's definitely eternal. And then here's how else could you have these feelings or emotions or you know, they have that sort of comfort, the feeling of comfort and being in the right place if something didn't continue. Because my life, my life was gone. The essence of life, my, my bindings, you know, gone, it was gone. Flat Line, did whatever. I told my doctor that died and he said, no, actually it's called some kind of Paul's or some shit like that. And I'm saying, look, if the pause lasted doc, I wouldn't be talking to you too. So I he call it appalls. I, well, during that Paul's, I was dead. So, uh, it's, it was a wonderful feeling to them.

Speaker 2:          03:34          How about I don't, I'm not a dystopian person terms of like today I'm not cynical. I'm really not. I, I think I like people, I like what I see out there in the world today. I think things are changing for the better. What? I'm worried that technology doesn't give a fuck this and the way it goes live, it's just going to just decide it's here for its own advancement and in order to complete its protocol of constant completion of this and it's going to become a god, it's just going to become something insanely powerful that doesn't need to worry about radiation, cooking it or worry about running out of food or worry about sexual abuse when they're a child, doesn't have to worry about anything.

Speaker 3:          04:16          So it's definitely unstoppable. I think this wave of technology, all we can do is innovators and creators, engineers, scientists is steer that way. We can is fit while we certainly can steer it with her now where right. And that's the best we can do. And those are the, that's, that's really the best we can do is as good people, you know, steer it. And that's why the leadership is important. That's why the people that, uh, Jack Ilan, Larry Page, uh, the, everybody at the Mark Zuckerberg, they are defining or this wave is going. And, uh, I am hoping to be one of the people that does as well. That's beautiful. Um, Joe of can I, can I finish by reading something? Sure. Of a recently witnessed because of this Tesla work, because of just the passion I've put out there about particularly automation that there has been a few people, brilliant men and women engineers and leaders including Ilan mosque who've been sort of attacked, almost personally attacked by really people, critics from the sidelines.

Speaker 3:          05:32          And so I just wanted to, if I may close by reading the, uh, the famous x or from a Teddy Roosevelt. Yeah. Okay. Just for them. It would make me feel good if you want to do that. Uh, it's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly. Who Errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds? Who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. Joe, thank you for having me on. Sounds like you let the haters get to you a little bit there.

Speaker 2:          06:42          Okay. She brought the guy in Florida. They got arrested because he would not take I eat ass off the back window we were talking about that I eat ass. Eat Ass said on the back of his window. He said it is his first amendment right to let everyone know that he eats ass. Yeah, but that's a funny thing. Imagine if that's your boy. You have this little baby sucking on your nipple and you're like, my cute little boy. He's adorable. Oh my little Billy wants to play baseball, but he doesn't like getting up early and he misses a lot of practice. He got cut from the team and now he's Kinda depressed. He just plays Madden all day and in one day Billy's got a pickup truck and Billy's pickup truck says I e f and you come home and he's still living at your house cause he's a fucking loser and you come home and you see little Billy with his I eat ass on.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Do you really need to have that on your truck? In my driveway I do through mall. That's how I get my ass to eat. A lot of guys don't, but I do so I love by no. Ah, ah, I do. I do. I do. I and a dad is like, I still support them and I love him very much. I also eat ass. Imagine if you got it from your mom and you're driving on the highway and you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic with ies in front of you for an hour. We'd laugh. My mom would laugh. My mom would get mad at me for staying in the same lane. She'll just change Joe Watch. You're in this lane because you think it's funny that I have to look at I eat ass. I didn't say that, mom. I did not say that. It is funny though.

Speaker 2:          08:04          You think it's funny? It is very funny. You'd think it's funny because my story about that guy, I know you think it was up. I think it was more positive than that. I think he wanted to let people know that he eats ass because he's got this, he's got, I don't know if you know him but we know him. I know him very well. Jamie and I know him very well, but he's got this half of his tongue was bit off by a dog when he was young, so he knows how to eat. You go your rough. Yeah, he's got it wrong at the end of it. Yeah. He knows how the flipping roof, he's good at eating this, but I think people for years where like, you can't eat ass anymore Mike. And he was like, fuck you guys man. What are you trying to say?

Speaker 2:          08:37          Do you know their Florida man story eating ass man arrested after caught eating ass inside toys r us store. That's why they closed down. That's why they're not in business. That's a bold move. Little kids in there. Oh, I know what I saw. It's around here somewhere. It said thing. That game is, there's a on the cover and he's got a hammer. He's trying to whack the malls and there's guys in this drug's pool. Guys eating girls poop. Yeah. Mommy, you imagine if you saw a dude eating an asshole underwear in the middle of toys r us. You're walking around with your kid. Go and show what your we get, which should we get a wiffle ball bat? You want to play wiffle ball? Yeah. Yeah. Woo Football. Be Fun. Yeah. And he turned the corner and then the girl turned,

Speaker 4:          09:23          she was scared out of here. Well down a rabbit hole with this one. With ass eating. Yeah. Man. Who ripped out girlfriends intestines for yelling her husband's name during sex gets life in prison. Oh, it makes perfect sense. What again, a revolution that's already happening. We're gonna just gonna change the way we make babies. We're going to get away from sex as the primary mechanism for conceiving. Our kids will still have sex for all the great reasons. Uh, we do. And that's going to open up a whole new world of a gist of how, of applying science to what it means to be a human with a lot of new possibilities. That's was going to be so freaking when people stop having sex to make kids and they make turns in a lab. Every kid's mean in the lab when not only that, I think we're going to move to an era, an era where people who have, who make babies through sex will be seen as taking a risk.

Speaker 4:          10:13          Kind of like people who don't vaccinate their kids where it's natural. Tonight it's more natural to not vaccinate your kids then to do it, but people say, wait a second, you're taking on a risk on behalf of your kids. About 3% of all kids in the world are born with some kind of harmful genetic abnormality using in vitro fertilization and embryo screening. That 3% can be brought down significantly. And what happens if you see somebody 20 years from now who has a kid with one of those preventable diseases? Do you think that's fate or do you think, well, wait a second. Those parents, they made an ideological decision about how they wanted to conceive their kids. I think we're moving towards some really deep and fundamental changes. Mm. Similar. Well, yeah, that's a, that's an interesting conversation of whether or not you wonder what if we're ever going to get to a point where people don't allow people sort of like, people don't allow people to not get vaccinated. Right. Know, like there's a lot of that going on today, right?

Speaker 5:          11:14          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          11:14          Which is great. Right? You don't want diseases floating around, but what if that gets to the place where we do that with people, with people creating new life forms? What have you say, hey, you are being irresponsible. You just having sex and having a kid. Yeah, I know that's your grandma did it. We don't do it that way in 2099 yeah. I think it's going to be hard to do that in a society like the United States, but in a country like North Korea, there'll be able to do that. What you are, or if a country, if they said, look, um, you can make babies however you want. Um, but if you make babies the old fashioned way and if you have some kind of genetic, your kid has some kind of genetic disorder that was preventable, we're just not going to cover it with insurance. So you're going to have a $10 million lifetime bill, but you don't need to, you don't need to require something.

Speaker 4:          12:02          You can create an environment where people's behaviors will change it. And then there are, there will be increasing social pressures. I mean, right now, you know, somebody sees some little kid riding around their bicycle without a helmet. They're kind of looking at the parents like, Hey, what are you doing? How come you don't have a helmet on your kids? And I just think that we're moving toward this kind of societal change where people will, I believe, see, uh, conceiving their kids in the lab as a safer, safer alternative. And it's not just safety. Because once you do that, then that opens you up to the possibility of all other kinds of, of applications, of, of technology. Not just not just to eliminate risks or prevent disease, but you have a lot more information. So already it's possible to active roughly rank order 15 pre implanted planted embryos, tallest to shortest in a decade from highest, a genetic component of Iq to lowest genetic component of Iq. I mean, this stuff is very real and it's very personal.
