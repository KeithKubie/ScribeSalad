00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.380
ROSE YAO: Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.410
Welcome My name is Rose Yao, and
I lead product for Google Maps

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.360
platform.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.110
MIKE PEGG: And hi.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.570
I'm Mike peg, and I lead the
Maps Developer Relations team.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.050
So thanks everyone for joining
us here at IO this morning.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.230
And for those of you
from all over the world

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.180
on the livestream
watching on YouTube,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.470
either right now or maybe
later after IO, welcome.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.279
So some of you know that we
need a Google Maps platform

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:37.570
announcement last week, and
we want to talk to you more

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.799
about that today.

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:40.840
Many of you are interested
in learning more about

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.900
how some of these changes will
impact your implementation.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.970
And we hope this session
will help you to answer

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.780
some of those questions.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.810
So let's get started.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.980
First, back in April of 2005,
and before I joined Google,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.190
I was amazed by what
developers were doing

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.490
with open data and Google Maps.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.350
Here's the first
Google Maps mashup

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.515
created by Paul Rademacher.

00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:06.756
Paul was looking for an
apartment in San Francisco,

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:08.380
and he was really
frustrated by needing

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.890
to go back and forth between
apartment listings and Google

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.860
Maps, which had just launched
only a few months earlier.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.500
So Paul did it himself.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.640
He matched up Craigslist housing
data and map tiles directly

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.510
from Google before
there was even an API.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.580
So I personally
got really excited

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.400
about this, all the
creativity that was coming

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.410
from developers and designers.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.230
And I decided to start a blog
that was devoted entirely

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.370
to this topic.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
And I called it
Google Maps Mania.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.640
This was my first post
in April 13th of 2005.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.350
So for the next two
years, I would get up

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.260
every morning attempting
to chronicle everything

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.649
that developers were
doing with Google Maps.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.190
And I formed some
lasting friendships

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.273
with a lot of the developers
from around the world

00:01:53.273 --> 00:01:55.030
that were doing this.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.640
So there was a lot of really
cool mashups and tools

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.280
being created.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.710
And I think one of
my favorites was

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.710
tools that would let you
drill through the earth

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.126
and figure out where you would
end up if you went straight

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:06.400
through the earth.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.160
There was a video
blogger named Ze Frank

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.650
who decided to make this
earth sandwich project.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.900
And he made a tool with a
map on the left and the map

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.350
on the right.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.849
And when you moved the map, you
could see if you centered it

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.100
where you'd end up.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.250
And he challenged people
to place a piece of bread

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.670
on one side and the exact
opposing point on the Earth

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.820
to place a piece of bread, and
make the world's first earth

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.320
sandwich.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.430
Super awesome.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.240
So in June of 2006,
Google invited

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.880
me to speak at its first
ever developer event.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.820
This is me at the Geo Developer
Day at the Googleplex,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.920
and I'm really excited.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.260
A few months later
my dream came true.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.120
Google offered me a job, and
now here I am talking to you.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.000
ROSE YAO: Continue your journey
in history a little bit.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.140
Back in June of 2005, Brett
Taylor penned this blog post.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.560
The world is now your
JavaScript enabled oyster.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.140
Introducing the Google
Maps API to the world.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.060
At that time, with the
help of Mike's blog,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.770
Google saw all the
incredible things

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.220
that you guys were doing with
your data and Google Maps.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.410
So we decided to create
an easier way for you

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.900
to build these awesome
tools and mashups.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.120
I also joined Google in June
of 2005 in the APM program.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.610
It stands for associate
product manager.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.815
But in reality, it was a
warning label for engineers

00:03:24.815 --> 00:03:27.920
that I really didn't know
what I was doing yet.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.040
So it was a really amazing
time to join Google,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.900
because we were
going beyond search

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.040
into products like Gmail,
video, and Google Maps.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.920
My first job was on Gmail team.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.810
But I have to admit, Maps was
always really near and dear

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.200
to my heart, because I literally
have no sense of directions.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.610
I leave a store at the mall,
and I go the wrong direction

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.200
every single time, guys.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.690
So Google Maps has been
a lifesaver for me.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.830
So I'm really excited, 13 years
later, to stand in front of you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.170
guys as someone who works
on Google Maps platform.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.860
I think it's really amazing how
life has changed since Brett

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.300
penned that blog post.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.100
First of all, we have more than
JavaScript enabled oysters.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.370
We have iOS and Android
enabled oysters, too.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.750
We have more than maps.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.660
We have places, and routes,
and all sorts of products

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.360
that Google has launched
into this platform.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.130
And I think the
key is our product

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.430
went from really simple
web-based use cases,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.270
like store locators, to
powering billions of users

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.640
across multiple
industries like ride

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.800
sharing, real estate, travel,
gaming, and so much more.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.350
Our expectations of
consumers have also changed.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.450
Today, we really
expect technology

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.900
to help us with our daily
lives, like getting to work,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.780
buying groceries,
or getting dinner.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.560
Google Maps platform is the
foundation for this new wave

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.205
of products and services.

00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:52.580
So I'm really, really excited
to be part of that journey,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.170
to stand in front of you guys
today, to partner with you

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.270
developers to see how we can
build things to help people

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.540
as they move around the world.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.450
We're constantly iterating
to deepen our understanding

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.760
of the real world, and to
bring those improvements

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.770
to our users, and to
you, our developers.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.020
So let's talk about a
few of these things.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.440
First, I want to emphasize,
on a daily basis,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.800
we make over 25
million edits a day

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.440
to reflect the pace
the world is changing.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.090
Your users are benefiting
from these same updates.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.010
It's backed by
infrastructure that

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.070
serves billions of daily
requests to Google Maps.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.880
And we serve more than 1 billion
users in over 200 countries

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.850
and territories.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.860
To better serve
those users, we want

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.150
to make sure we speak
the local language.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.500
So that's why we launched
support for 39 new languages

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.470
on Google Maps and Google
Maps platform this year.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.770
We added support for languages
like Albanian, Danish,

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.540
Icelandic, Ukrainian,
Vietnamese, Zulu, and more,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.330
because after all, what is a
local product or service if you

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.310
don't speak the local lingo?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.390
And these languages are
spoken by more than 1.25

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.760
billion people worldwide.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.060
So that means that the
applications you build

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.280
will also have that support.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.140
You heard from
the IO keynote how

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.370
we're using AI and ML to
help users on Google Maps.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.310
We're using the same technology
on the developer platform.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.950
So for example, we know
that getting good address

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.590
and geocoding coverage globally
is really, really hard,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.720
particularly in
countries like Brazil,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.750
where buildings
change pretty often.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.630
So this is a typical street
view imagery in Brazil.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.600
This is a typical
apartment building.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.980
And I don't know if you guys
have better eyes than I do.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.320
Can you find the actual
address in this image?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.960
It took me a little bit, too.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.490
So the good news is we were able
to train a ML model to do this

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.400
better and faster
than I can, and that's

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.245
really what street numbers
look like in most parts of Sao

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:02.850
Paolo.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.790
So using our machine learning
and vision technology,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.210
we were able to add over 30
million geocodes to Brazil

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:11.670
this year.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.159
Finally, we know that
details really matter.

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:15.950
So let's talk about a
few things that we've

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.130
done with both our Maps
and Directions API.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.560
So two recent changes to Maps.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.810
We made a number of
visual improvements

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.630
to our base Maps design.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.100
The new style comes with
an updated color scheme

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100
and topography to make it
really easier for users

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.600
to focus and read.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.016
We also updated
the pinstyle mark

00:07:35.016 --> 00:07:36.890
that marks points of
interest, so they really

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.670
pop on the map compared to
the previous circular icons.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.860
The great news, you
don't need to do anything

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.390
to get this new map design.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:47.060
It's already being served
to you through our APIs.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.540
You can still customize
this using our styling APIs

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.290
so that it reflects your
use case, your brand,

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.340
and your details.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.850
But you can also just
get this out of the box.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.330
The other thing we did
was improve our render.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.300
So the Web Maps API launched
eight years ago before tablets,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.030
smartphones, touch
screens were widely used.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.010
We just completed
an effort to revamp

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.200
the internals of
this client library,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.630
allowing it to better
handle touch events

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.280
and take advantage
of modern browser

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.160
features such as
request animation frame

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.030
and enhanced GPS support
via well-changed CSS.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.210
Tiles now load continuously
during touch gestures

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.280
such as pinch, zoom, or pin.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.270
And no more unfilled gray
areas or over-zoomed tiles that

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.429
only refresh when you let go.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.280
Markers and info windows
stay the same size

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.130
during these zoom animations.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.940
They don't get
oddly small or big.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.700
We know that the details
matter to you as much as they

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.440
do to us here at Google Maps.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.230
So we want to think our
app developer community

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.650
for helping us test and
roll out this change.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.945
As develpors, you guys
know how challenging it

00:08:56.945 --> 00:09:00.150
is to get something this
universal to work right

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.430
for every browser
and every use case.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.440
We couldn't have done
it without you guys.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.410
And we really want to make
sure that this launch reach

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.300
the quality bar that
we set for ourselves.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.000
So this has been our
experimental branch

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.850
for several months, and will
be coming to all developers

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.290
in the next couple weeks.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.000
If you want to get
a head start or just

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.310
help us test new
features, you can always

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.400
change your version
number to 3.exp

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.940
so you always get the latest
and greatest from our JavaScript

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.660
APIs.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.190
And I think the
greatest validation

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.440
doesn't come from me,
or anyone else on stage

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.340
who works at Google.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.560
That comes from
you, our developers.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.770
So thank you, Alex on GitHub,
for giving us this feedback.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.980
This API has such
sweet, smooth zooming.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.608
What else can we say?

00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:49.120
All right, so you heard about
[INAUDIBLE] walking nav and AR

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.970
walking nav via the camera.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.560
So you know that to make
that happen, we really

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.890
need to understand what the
world around us looks like,

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.290
and really understand
where sidewalks are,

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.720
and crosswalks are, and
how we can give people

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.110
great experiences as they're
walking through busy cities.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.540
So we're excited to announce
the latest improvements

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:13.360
to our Directions API,
our HD Walking Directions.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.410
So basically, we've improved
our understanding of the world

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.300
for walkers, particularly
sidewalk geometry

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.810
and pedestrian walkability.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.600
And we're bringing that
improved model to our APIs.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.610
In the last month, we've
been getting feedback

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.020
from our app developers.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.870
In the next few weeks, we'll
be launching this to everyone.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.050
If you're using
Walking Directions API,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.549
no code changes needed.

00:10:35.549 --> 00:10:37.090
You'll just get an
automatic upgrade.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.050
MIKE PEGG: So Rose just talked
about some recent improvements

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.540
that we're making and
rolling out to you.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.640
As we continue to make
these improvements

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.734
and look back at
the last 13 years,

00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:52.150
we just want to thank you for
everything that you've done.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:54.570
And the journey we've
been on together.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.070
We're continuing
that journey today

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.650
as we introduce the
Google Maps platform.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.620
It includes all the same
APIs that you know and love,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.290
and a streamlined
developer experience,

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:07.320
new industry-specific solutions,
like our recent gaming

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.190
offering, and a smooth
path to scale as you grow.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.700
We want your experience building
on the Google Maps platform

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.070
to be a more simplified
development experience

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.100
that's scalable to your
needs and easy to use.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:27.560
To start, we're simplifying
our 18 individual APIs,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.260
and putting them together
into three core products--

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.146
Maps, Routes, and Places.

00:11:33.146 --> 00:11:34.520
These core products
work together

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.590
to provide the building
blocks you need to create

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.960
location-based applications.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.420
Maps is a great set of
tools for visualizing

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.480
the world through maps,
satellite, and aerial imagery,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.830
and street view.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.950
Routes is optimized for figuring
out how to get from point A

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.430
to Z. Places is
perfect for answering

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:54.290
simple questions
around the world like,

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.270
what is this place or address?

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.714
And the good part is that
all these new updates

00:11:58.714 --> 00:12:01.130
will work with your existing
code with very little changes

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.850
required.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.960
Now let's talk about pricing.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.850
We're simplifying
our pricing for you,

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:12.500
and moving from several
pricing plans to just one.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.810
With this new pricing
plan, all developers

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.660
will receive the first
$200 of monthly usage

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.260
for free per registered account.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.850
Most of our active
developers today

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.610
fall into this
free monthly tier.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.811
To gain access to this
$200 of monthly usage free,

00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:31.310
you just need to sign in and
set up an account on the Google

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.512
Cloud console.

00:12:34.512 --> 00:12:36.470
And when you set up
billing for the first time,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.870
you can also take
advantage of a $300 Google

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.020
Cloud Platform
free trial credit,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.180
which you also can put
toward your Maps platform

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.860
monthly usage.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:48.590
We've also done away with
annual upfront commitments,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.190
termination fees, and usage
limits with this new pricing

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.414
plan, just to keep it
super simple for you.

00:12:55.414 --> 00:12:57.080
Let's take a look at
some of the changes

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.950
we're making to help you to
optimize your monthly usage,

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.150
starting with Place
AutoComplete within the JS API.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.130
So first, Place
AutoComplete returns

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:09.150
placed predictions for your app.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.480
So it takes a text search
string from your user,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.550
like restaurants or
museums, and then it

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.410
provides auto
complete functionality

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.250
as the user types.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.290
So think of when you
type in Google Search

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.332
or in Google Maps how
that autocomplete works.

00:13:21.332 --> 00:13:22.790
So in Place
AutoComplete, we're now

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.340
giving you the option for
session-based billing instead

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.890
of charging for the individual
characters a user would

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.870
type to find something.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.970
That used to include
backspaces, even.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:34.520
So this is done now
as a complete session.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.580
And you also don't need
to worry about languages

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.200
that would have long names.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.140
So this slide here shows the
on-page load configuration

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.670
steps you'd take.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.270
You set up the map and you
create a session token.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.290
Then once you have
that token, you'll

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.690
use it for all
requests in the session

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.440
through auto completion usage
and the final place details

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.650
lookup.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.070
So next, we show how it looks
to hand that session token off

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.159
to our get details endpoint.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:03.700
And then this will
supply information

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.770
about the places that are
returned from the autocomplete

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.990
get query predictions
as a total session.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.720
So you can also end
a session easily

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.060
by generating a
new session token.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.550
And you should do this when
your user very obviously starts

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.080
a new activity.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.800
So here, place detail
with field masking

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.890
is applied to optimize the
efficiency of the queries

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.410
by only retrieving the
specific fields that you

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.670
want to return to your user.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.160
So these are just a few
examples of optimizations

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.400
we're suggesting to increase
the overall efficiency

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.431
of your implementation.

00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.680
We've prepared a full guide
of these optimization tips

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.680
that you can take
a look at as well.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.250
So registered developers
of the Maps API

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.530
should have received an
email with the subject

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.120
line, important changes to
your Google Maps API account.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.440
And that details all
the changes for you.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.600
And if you're new to
Google Maps platform,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.160
you can check out
this short link,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.230
g.co/mapsplatform/pricing
to learn more about pricing

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.730
information there.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.360
So we want the management
of your projects

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.860
to be really easy as well.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.000
To make this happen, we're
using the Google Cloud Platform

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.580
console, which the Maps
platform is integrated in.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.130
So when you're on
this console, you

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:23.200
can do things like
create projects.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.390
You can manage,
track, and analyze

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.640
your API keys and usage.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.740
You can even generate
billing usage reports

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.230
by exporting out
to Google BigQuery.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.660
And you can easily access
new Google Cloud products,

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.290
since you're on the
cloud platform console.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.800
So starting this week, all
Google Maps platform developers

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.100
will also receive
free customer support.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.770
We want this to be a platform
that you can rely on no matter

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.130
what you're doing with it.

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.460
So we're offering 24-hour
support, seven days a week,

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.550
365 days a year.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.680
And you can also access
that free customer support

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.560
from the console.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.490
So how do we scale
all this for you?

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:05.630
What happens today when your
site or app becomes popular

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.250
is that there's a
manual effort that's

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.210
followed, which you have to do
to upgrade your pricing plan.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.480
So with Google Maps
platform, if your product

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.379
grows beyond that $200
of free monthly usage,

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:19.670
we'll automatically update
you to the next pricing tier

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.770
without any action on your part.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.450
And we'll apply
pricing discounts,

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.880
and let you scale easily
with less downtime

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.790
and potential performance
issues along the way.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.020
You also scale quickly with
Google's global infrastructure

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.480
without having to think
about capacity, reliability,

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.880
or performance, no matter what
causes your service to peak.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.250
Go-Jek is a really
great example of this.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.860
They're one of Indonesia's
largest ride sharing

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.350
and delivery companies, with
over 30 million downloads

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:52.100
and 250,000 drivers
working for it.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.460
And they're mostly on
motorbikes in Indonesia.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.670
So they use Google Maps
platform in all components

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.780
of their service.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.750
The passenger app
displays maps and allows

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.470
users to select a destination
using our Places API,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.680
while address entry is handled
through the AutoComplete API

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.420
that I mentioned earlier.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.420
The driver uses an app to
connect with the passengers,

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.450
and then the Directions
API provides the best route

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.609
and an accurate ETA time.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:20.109
So there's actually
a lot going on

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:22.442
in the background with the
help of Google Cloud Platform

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:23.349
as well.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.630
Go-Jek generates
about 4 terabytes

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:27.880
worth of events data
per day, and they

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.760
use GCP to enable
hundreds of thousands

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.839
of concurrent transactions.

00:17:33.839 --> 00:17:35.380
One of the more
interesting use cases

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.990
is how they use Google BigQuery
through that data that's

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.080
being exploited to enable
better insights and faster data

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.380
discovery as a business.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.390
We also know and care
about the unique needs

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.230
of nonprofits, crisis
responders, startups, and news

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.830
organizations.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.880
So starting today, we're
significantly scaling our teams

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.930
to accept more applications
for these public programs.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.050
We offer these programs
to provide support to you

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.750
in a number of ways,
including financial credits

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.960
that you can put toward
your monthly usage.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.510
One great example of a
nonprofit currently taking

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:13.890
advantage of this program
and the monthly credits

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.530
is PulsePoint.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.290
PulsePoint is an app
that crowdsources

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:20.840
where life-saving measures
are needed for cardiac arrest

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.530
victims.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.530
PulePoint alerts
its app users who

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.010
are in walking distance of one
of these medical emergencies

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.530
that assistance is needed
right away, ensuring

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.080
that lifesaving
CPR can begin even

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.767
before an ambulance arrives.

00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:36.350
Let's take a look
at this quick story.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.330
MIKE PEGG: So it's in situations
like this where an accurate

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.670
understanding of the real
world and the ability

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.437
to connect people in times
of need are important.

00:19:31.437 --> 00:19:33.520
These are the kinds of
nonprofits that Google Maps

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.826
platform is eager to support
through these public programs.

00:19:36.826 --> 00:19:39.200
To learn how you might qualify
for one of these programs,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.210
visit the FAQ section
of our pricing page.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.364
So many of you
over the past week

00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:46.780
have wondered how
this new pricing

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.660
will apply to your specific
Google Maps platform

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.120
implementation.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.830
We've built the transition tool
to easily identify and merge

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.830
all of your projects together
into one view on the console,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.190
and make monthly
use adjustments.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.230
When we first launched the
Google Maps API, clear,

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.800
easy-to-understand
technical documentation

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.580
was at the center
of this for you.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.830
We're keeping our focus on
this by making a detailed guide

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.780
available to dig
into all the changes

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.780
that we're making with
the Google Maps platform.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.620
ROSE YAO: Thank you, Mike.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.600
So Mike just spent a
lot of time talking

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.360
about the product changes and
our principles behind them--

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.482
simplified, scalable,
easy to use.

00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:30.690
Those are things that we're
keeping in mind no matter

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.400
what we're building.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.260
We also talked about
our core products--

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.780
Maps, Routes, and Places.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.910
These three products make
up the building blocks

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.580
of any location-based
experience.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.790
But I want to spend a little
bit more time today diving

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.240
into new category products
we've been building

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.080
called Industry Solutions.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.570
Our first three offerings
in this category

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.780
are Asset Tracking, Ride
Sharing, and Gaming.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.480
These represent when
we want to go deep

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.990
in an industry with a
strong location-based need,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.580
and really work
with the developers

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.400
to understand how we can partner
with them beyond the basics.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.300
So let's take a look
at a few examples.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.980
We talked about ride sharing.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.830
It's an industry that I think
we're all using the products.

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.740
We're all getting to work,
and dinner, and home, right?

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.730
And we realized that it was
growing really, really fast,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.100
and understanding
of the real world

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.470
was critical to the industry,
and we wanted to partner

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.520
with developers in this space.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.446
So when we talked to Lyft,
and Go-Jek, and Grab,

00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:32.070
we realized there
was a lot of products

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.720
we could build together
that would make

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.680
a real difference in key
metrics like driver efficiency,

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.260
customer cancellation
rates, and honestly,

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.990
just how they run their
business and their product.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:45.450
So let's talk about one
of the first features

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:50.190
we launched in this industry
and why it really matters.

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.350
An average ride
sharing driver has

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.830
to constantly switch between
the driver app and Google Maps

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.090
for directions.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:58.830
In the time of the
app switch, they

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.680
could've missed the critical
turn, adding minutes

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.190
to the customer pickup,
especially in busy city

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.780
centers with one-way streets.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.760
Those of you who live
in SF, you probably

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.680
know exactly what I mean.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.720
Today, it takes about
three taps for a driver

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.270
to get from accepting
a new passenger to turn

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.830
by turn in Google Maps.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.350
So when we talk to these
developers, we said,

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.860
what if we build an SDK
completely optimized for driver

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.830
efficiency, and provide
turn-by-turn directions

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.667
in the driver's app itself?

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:30.000
This is one of the first
features we've been rolling out

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.670
with ride sharing
partners like Lyft,

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.330
and it's really
just the beginning

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:35.700
of what we can do together.

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.610
The same thing happened
when we looked at gaming.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.230
We started talking
to developers.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.410
We asked them what they
wanted to build and why,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.810
what tools they
used, and how they

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.030
wanted to run their
business, and what success

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.020
looks like to them.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.490
So the result is a
highly-customizable 3D map

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:57.540
render based on our model, the
real world, built on Unity,

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.510
a platform we've never
supported before, but the most

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.050
popular platform for
mobile game development,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.090
and a custom API to
answer a question,

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.280
where can you play
games in the world?

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.620
Now, this may seem
like a simple question,

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.440
but let's talk about why it's
a little more complicated

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.070
than it sounds.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.350
So let's say you're
figuring out how to do

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:20.130
a really fun scavenger hunt.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.700
That sounds doable.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.460
OK, but how do you pick
the best points in Delhi?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.740
And then you also have players
in other parts of the world,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.940
let's say Sydney.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.500
How do you make sure
that they always

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.060
find the best most prominent
places to find the treasure,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.040
to hunt the dragon,
to do whatever you

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.170
want them to do in that game?

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.140
Sao Paulo is another
example where we just

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.690
talked earlier about
how hard it is to find

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.010
great POIs in that city.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.840
So you can imagine scaling
this globally, because you want

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.210
your game to be played
by everyone in the world,

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.230
becomes a really hard problem.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:03.860
And this is one of
the core problems

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.910
that the playable locations
API is designed to solve.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.680
So I'm talking a lot.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.120
Let's just see a game in action.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.986
In this case, let's
catch some ghosts.

00:24:14.986 --> 00:24:16.027
Can we turn the sound up?

00:24:16.027 --> 00:24:16.693

And now I'm just going to
go hand it back to Mike.

00:24:46.407 --> 00:24:48.490
MIKE PEGG: OK, so you've
just heard about the ways

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.980
that we want the Google Maps
platform to be simplified,

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.690
scalable, and easy to use.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.220
And Rose has given
you a sneak peek

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.770
into what's ahead, whether
industry solutions including

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.890
gaming and ride sharing we want
you to know that we're making

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.470
