00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.160
A quick Google search will yield several,
not so reputable, websites claiming this is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.750
true; but the short answer to your question
is, “No.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.460
Egg whites do not help with burns, and they
can actually make the situation worse.”

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.290
As many know by now, and some lament, I’m
not one to say something here without giving

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.080
the long, medically detailed answer- occupational
hazard to being a nerdy paramedic.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.930
So you can either take my word for it, or
to truly understand why egg whites are not

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.510
a great choice for burn treatments, read on
and let’s look at what we’re trying to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.600
treat when burned, and what’s in egg whites
to see if that helps.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.610
On the surface, this theory does seem plausible.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.699
The egg whites are made mostly of water (90%)
and numerous proteins (10%) like albumin and

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.890
globulins.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.980
Cooling with water is a well known and time
tested treatment for pain relief associated

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.660
with minor burns.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.839
Most egg whites tend to be cooler than the
area being burned, so that only leaves us

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.050
with the proteins to consider.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.479
So now let’s look at burns and what we’re
trying to treat and see if the added proteins

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.949
to the water are more helpful than plain water.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.390
There are several types of burns, including
chemical, electrical, friction, radiation

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.100
and thermal (both hot and cold).

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.489
No matter the cause of the burn, the result
can leave the skin and underlying tissues,

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.969
extremely damaged.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.619
When it comes to the severity of the burn,
they are separated into 3 main classes, denoting

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.370
the depth of the burn.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.560
First degree burns involve only the outer
layer of the skin (epidermis).

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200
Second degree burns involve both the epidermis
and the layer underneath (dermis).

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.430
Third degree burns involve the epidermis,
dermis, and the muscle tissues underneath.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.560
Some medical professionals have advocated
for a 4th degree that denotes when the person’s

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.229
bones are also burned.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.049
This hasn’t seemed to gain much traction
in most medical circles though.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.070
The focus on treating burns revolves around
4 main things.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.049
Stopping the burning (obviously), pain relief,
infection control, and warding off dehydration

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.380
and hypothermia.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.740
The skin is a fantastic organ that’s responsible
for protecting our bodies from outside pathogens

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.799
like bacteria and viruses.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.659
It also helps keep our precious body fluids
in place and gives us a nice bone blanket

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.039
to keep warm.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.450
When the skin gets damaged, it can no longer
provide us with those benefits.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.650
It’s no surprise then; infection dehydration
and hypothermia are the most common lethal

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.670
complications of burns.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.970
For instance, infection is the leading cause
of death in burn victims accounting for approximately

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.270
10,000 deaths per year in the United States.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.350
Now that we know what we’re trying to treat,
let’s see if egg whites help.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.520
Stopping the burning- When it comes to chemical
burns, egg whites definitely won’t help.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.110
To stop the burning, you need to brush the
chemical off and then flush the area with

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.430
copious amounts of water to get any microscopic
material left.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.080
Obviously egg whites will do nothing to stop
electrical, thermal, nor friction burns either.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.050
Unless, of course, you have something like
a bathtub filled with egg whites for the burning

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.670
person to jump into, but that seems a bit
far-fetched.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.680
In the end, egg whites won’t stop the burning
processes.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.730
Now that one’s somewhat obvious; what about
pain relief?

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.830
Pain relief- Third degree burns have damaged
the nerve cells so badly that the areas affected

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.940
by these types of burns don’t hurt, so we’ll
focus on 1st and 2nd degree.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.010
The only study I was able to find that looked
at treating burns with both water and other

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.730
substances, including egg whites, was done
in Milas, Turkey.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.460
The results of that study showed subjects
treated with egg whites had no greater decrease

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.960
in pain compared to those who used only water.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.810
While many substances that are cool and cover
a burn area will provide some pain relief,

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.730
numerous studies have shown the use of most
home-burn-remedies to treat burns greatly

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.760
increases your chance of complications, compared
to those using only water.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.800
In the end, even though you might get some
initial pain relief from applying cold egg

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.550
whites on minor burns, water does the same
thing, without all the complications, which

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.000
I’ll talk about shortly.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.970
Infection control- Infections are the leading
complication associated with burns.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.150
Because of this, they’re arguably the most
important thing to consider when treating

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.400
someone who’s been burned.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.860
The proteins in egg whites do nothing to help
with infection.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.970
In fact, they will most likely increase the
chance of infection as egg shells, yolks,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.960
and whites all can contain numerous types
of bacteria including salmonella.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.500
So if you thought egg whites might help with
infection, they actually do the opposite.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.880
Dehydration and hypothermia- Dehydration is
a big concern for those treating burns.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.090
A person whose skin has been damaged will
begin leaking fluid from their bodies.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.110
Not from their vascular system, but from all
the areas around your cells, organs and blood

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.400
vessels, known as your interstitial space.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.100
Once that fluid begins to be lost, you will
start to draw fluid from within your cells,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.170
organs and blood vessels, further complicating
the dehydration.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.430
This is such a concern, due to the amount
of fluid burn patients lose, there is a standard

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.370
formula for how much you need to give them.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.570
Known as the Parkland formula, you take the
patient’s weight in kilograms, multiply

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.410
it by 4 and then by the % of body surface
area burned.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.320
Half of that volume will need to be given
in the first 8 hours and the other half in

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.240
the next 16 hours.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:11.840
For example, a 180 lb person (82 kg) who has
about 50% of their body area burned will need

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.690
((82 * 4) *50)/2 = 8200 mL = 8.2 liters in
the first 8 hours and the same in the next

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.690
16.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.870
For reference, that same person has only about
5.4 liters of blood volume.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.940
Egg whites will certainly not help with rehydrating
someone, and since we’ve already discussed

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.440
that it’s a cooling substance, it’s not
going to help them with hypothermia either.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.360
The last vestige of this myth is one where
some people say it helps with skin regeneration.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.410
The problem with this thought process is how
skin repairs itself.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.690
In order to not make this article too much
longer, if you’re interested, for a full

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.520
explanation on how the skin repairs itself,
you can read my article here: How Scars Form.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.310
The short version is that the proteins that
are involved with skin regeneration don’t

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.590
begin weaving their magic (they form in a
basket weave appearance) until after a scab

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.590
is formed.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.150
The scab will certainly prevent any egg proteins
from assisting in regeneration.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.850
If it didn’t, bacteria would be able to
enter and we would be back to the infection

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.120
problem again.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.300
There you have it Craig, egg whites will not
play a positive role in helping treat burns,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.400
particularly not over something like water,
though, of course, they’d be better than

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.210
something like, say, treating a burn with
battery acid…

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.270
But, over simple water, the egg whites might
even just make it worse.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.830
Now, if you are interested in a home remedy
that actually works and has several positive

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.070
benefits on burns, try some raw honey.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.070
Really.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.860
Honestly, I was extremely skeptical on this
one myself, but after doing the medical research,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:52.610
I was wrong and the honey touters were right.
