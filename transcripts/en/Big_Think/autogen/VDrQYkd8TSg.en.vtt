00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.830
 
I became interested in this phenomenon

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840
I became interested in this phenomenon
 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.520
I became interested in this phenomenon
of Constraints inspiring creative

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
of Constraints inspiring creative
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.490
of Constraints inspiring creative
outbursts and if you look at the last

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
outbursts and if you look at the last
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.279
outbursts and if you look at the last
century there were three really profound

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
century there were three really profound
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.500
century there were three really profound
examples of that I would say the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
examples of that I would say the
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.259
examples of that I would say the
earliest that I found incredibly

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
earliest that I found incredibly
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.550
earliest that I found incredibly
interesting was the limit of the speed

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
interesting was the limit of the speed
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.029
interesting was the limit of the speed
of light leading Einstein to the theory

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039
of light leading Einstein to the theory
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.009
of light leading Einstein to the theory
of relativity where a lot of other

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
of relativity where a lot of other
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.130
of relativity where a lot of other
scientists wanted to remove the limit

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
scientists wanted to remove the limit
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.049
scientists wanted to remove the limit
they wanted to say there is no limit to

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
they wanted to say there is no limit to
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.340
they wanted to say there is no limit to
the speed of light that doesn't make any

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
the speed of light that doesn't make any
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900
the speed of light that doesn't make any
sense that's impossible

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
sense that's impossible
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240
sense that's impossible
Einstein actually despite the word

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
Einstein actually despite the word
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.990
Einstein actually despite the word
relativity adhere to a very strict

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000
relativity adhere to a very strict
 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.700
relativity adhere to a very strict
absolute and that absolute was the speed

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
absolute and that absolute was the speed
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.760
absolute and that absolute was the speed
of light he took that to be his guiding

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
of light he took that to be his guiding
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.029
of light he took that to be his guiding
constraint and by sticking to it rigidly

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
constraint and by sticking to it rigidly
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.580
constraint and by sticking to it rigidly
he said I'll give up anything else but

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
he said I'll give up anything else but
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590
he said I'll give up anything else but
the speed of light the constancy of the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
the speed of light the constancy of the
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560
the speed of light the constancy of the
speed of light and by doing so he gave

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
speed of light and by doing so he gave
 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.810
speed of light and by doing so he gave
up on the absolute nature of space and

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
up on the absolute nature of space and
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.929
up on the absolute nature of space and
time so I mean that's just much harder

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
time so I mean that's just much harder
 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.580
time so I mean that's just much harder
to let go of intuitively and a much

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
to let go of intuitively and a much
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410
to let go of intuitively and a much
greater violation of our common sense

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
greater violation of our common sense
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.770
greater violation of our common sense
but it was right and so this was an

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
but it was right and so this was an
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.170
but it was right and so this was an
example where this tight constraint led

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
example where this tight constraint led
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.480
example where this tight constraint led
to a creative outburst you know from

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
to a creative outburst you know from
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969
to a creative outburst you know from
this one constraint you could trace the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
this one constraint you could trace the
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249
this one constraint you could trace the
line not only to the relativity of space

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
line not only to the relativity of space
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.780
line not only to the relativity of space
and time but the expansion of the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
and time but the expansion of the
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429
and time but the expansion of the
universe the existence of black holes

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
universe the existence of black holes
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.620
universe the existence of black holes
the idea that the entire space has a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
the idea that the entire space has a
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.350
the idea that the entire space has a
shape all of these things burgeoned

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
shape all of these things burgeoned
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300
shape all of these things burgeoned
from this really tight constraint

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
from this really tight constraint
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.999
from this really tight constraint
another great example is a Heisenberg

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
another great example is a Heisenberg
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.050
another great example is a Heisenberg
uncertainty principle

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
uncertainty principle
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:47.420
uncertainty principle
so Heisenberg begins to believe that we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
so Heisenberg begins to believe that we
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.520
so Heisenberg begins to believe that we
can't precisely know the location of a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
can't precisely know the location of a
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.090
can't precisely know the location of a
particle and its motion and its momentum

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
particle and its motion and its momentum
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.420
particle and its motion and its momentum
and this seems to violate what we

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
and this seems to violate what we
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219
and this seems to violate what we
believe that things objectively exist

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
believe that things objectively exist
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.959
believe that things objectively exist
that there should be no such limit but

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969
that there should be no such limit but
 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.149
that there should be no such limit but
he takes it very seriously he doesn't

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159
he takes it very seriously he doesn't
 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.119
he takes it very seriously he doesn't
just say oh it's often cast in this way

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
just say oh it's often cast in this way
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.490
just say oh it's often cast in this way
oh we disturb a particle when we observe

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
oh we disturb a particle when we observe
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.860
oh we disturb a particle when we observe
it therefore we can't also know its

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
it therefore we can't also know its
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.610
it therefore we can't also know its
momentum

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620
momentum
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470
momentum
once we've located it because in the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
once we've located it because in the
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.990
once we've located it because in the
process of measuring it we've somehow

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
process of measuring it we've somehow
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.970
process of measuring it we've somehow
disturbed it that's not really true it's

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980
disturbed it that's not really true it's
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.369
disturbed it that's not really true it's
much deeper than that Heisenberg took

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379
much deeper than that Heisenberg took
 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.290
much deeper than that Heisenberg took
very seriously that this was profound

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
very seriously that this was profound
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.300
very seriously that this was profound
that in some sense the particle doesn't

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310
that in some sense the particle doesn't
 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.500
that in some sense the particle doesn't
have a location or a momentum that in

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
have a location or a momentum that in
 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.850
have a location or a momentum that in
some sense the particle doesn't really

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
some sense the particle doesn't really
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.610
some sense the particle doesn't really
exist in the old-fashioned way we used

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
exist in the old-fashioned way we used
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610
exist in the old-fashioned way we used
to think it existed like a marble exists

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
to think it existed like a marble exists
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.910
to think it existed like a marble exists
you know so by taking it that much more

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
you know so by taking it that much more
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.180
you know so by taking it that much more
seriously it leads to the discovery of

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
seriously it leads to the discovery of
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.460
seriously it leads to the discovery of
the deeper phenomenon of quantum

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
the deeper phenomenon of quantum
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.350
the deeper phenomenon of quantum
mechanics and that incredibly strange

that was a real blow to this idea of a

that was a real blow to this idea of a

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889
turned out to have profound consequences
 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.330
turned out to have profound consequences
and the profound consequence was the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
and the profound consequence was the
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.729
and the profound consequence was the
invention of the computer and AI so you

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739
invention of the computer and AI so you
 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.000
invention of the computer and AI so you
can trace Turing's creation of the idea

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010
can trace Turing's creation of the idea
 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.390
can trace Turing's creation of the idea
of a machine that can think directly to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
of a machine that can think directly to
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.729
of a machine that can think directly to
his work on the limit theorems and the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
his work on the limit theorems and the
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.490
his work on the limit theorems and the
fact that there are certain things we

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500
fact that there are certain things we
 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.100
fact that there are certain things we
can never know and that limit is severe

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110
can never know and that limit is severe
 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.379
can never know and that limit is severe
and from that thinking about that

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389
and from that thinking about that
 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.629
and from that thinking about that
limit he was able to imagine how to

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639
limit he was able to imagine how to
 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.820
limit he was able to imagine how to
mechanize thought and begin to think

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
mechanize thought and begin to think
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.890
mechanize thought and begin to think
about making machines that think and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900
about making machines that think and
 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.860
about making machines that think and
begin to think that we're just machines

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
begin to think that we're just machines
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.860
begin to think that we're just machines
that think and therefore there could be

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870
that think and therefore there could be
 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.719
that think and therefore there could be
an artificial intelligence just like

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729
an artificial intelligence just like
 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.050
an artificial intelligence just like
there's a biological intelligence
