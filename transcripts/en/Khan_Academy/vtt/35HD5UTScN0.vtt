00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.637
- [Voiceover] What is 19
thousands plus seven tens?

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.370
First let's think about
what are 19 thousands,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.056
and what are seven tens,

00:00:09.056 --> 00:00:11.269
and then from there we can add them.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.417
So, 19 thousands, would
quite literally be,

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:18.000
if we had a thousand, 19 times.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:22.333
So there's a thousand one time.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.754
If we had a thousand two
times, we would have 2000.

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:29.496
If we had a thousand three times,

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.079
we would have 1000, 2000, 3000.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.656
And the pattern here
should be pretty clear.

00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:39.181
If we have 19 thousands,
or a thousand 19 times,

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.931
we would have 19,000.

00:00:43.285 --> 00:00:46.868
So, 19 thousands is
literally 19 thousands.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.550
And then seven tens, same thing,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.896
we could have seven tens.

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:54.428
We could have 10 seven times.

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:57.815
So, 10 plus another 10, plus another 10,

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:00.270
and this one's a little
simpler to do than the 19,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.848
we only have to list seven tens this time.

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:05.817
That's six tens, and there's seven tens.

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:10.344
So, seven tens would be
literally seven tens.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:11.594
Or, 10, 20, 30,

00:01:12.543 --> 00:01:13.793
40, 50, 60, 70.

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:17.613
So, seven tens is 70.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.132
And then if we want to combine these,

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.549
or add these, we would have 19 thousands,

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:29.234
zero hundreds,

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:33.882
the seven tens, and zero ones.

00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:36.314
Or 19,070.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:41.618
We could've also thought
about that question

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:42.845
in terms of place value

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:44.860
instead of listing out all the thousands,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.586
and listing out all the tens,

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.806
we could have thought of the place values.

00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:52.616
We had 19 thousands, which
means we want our last digit,

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:56.366
the nine, to be in the
thousands place value.

00:01:57.678 --> 00:01:59.416
And then the other digit, we had one,

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:00.892
would go in front of it.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:03.392
So, this is read 19 thousands,

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:07.483
and by writing that thousands there,

00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:10.769
we covered all these empty place values.

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.019
Or, the three zeros we ended up adding.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.143
The thousands can be represented by

00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:20.560
these three zeros at the end.

00:02:21.536 --> 00:02:25.914
Whereas, seven tens, we put
a seven in the tens place,

00:02:25.914 --> 00:02:28.094
and again, we have an empty
place value behind it.

00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:30.185
We had no ones with it.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:34.352
The tens, by saying tens, we
implied this zero after it.

00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:39.472
So, the thousands added
these three zeros to the end,

00:02:39.472 --> 00:02:42.889
and seven tens added one zero to the end.

00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:45.968
And again, if we combined them,

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:47.575
like we saw in the previous one,

00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:51.742
we'd have 19 thousands, zero
hundreds, and seven tens.

00:02:55.186 --> 00:02:57.808
So, either way, whether we list out

00:02:57.808 --> 00:03:01.925
what 19 thousands is
literally with 19 thousands,

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.870
or seven tens, literally 10 seven times,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.844
or we look at it in terms of place value,

00:03:06.844 --> 00:03:08.652
and add the zeros on the end.

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:11.985
Either way, our solution will be 19,070.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.095
Here's one more.

00:03:17.095 --> 00:03:21.322
We have five ten-thousands
plus 22 thousands.

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:25.006
So, two ways again we
could try to solve this.

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:29.684
One, we could think about
what are five ten-thousands?

00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:32.017
If we had 10,000 five times,

00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:37.915
another 10,000, another, that's three.

00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:41.498
Four ten-thousands,
and five ten-thousands,

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.016
that would be a total of 50,000.

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:50.008
10,000, 20, 30, 40, 50 thousands.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.390
So, five ten-thousands is 50,000.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:58.735
Let's write that up here, 50,000.

00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:01.984
Plus, 22 thousands.

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:07.760
22 thousands, remember when
we did the 19 thousands,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.024
if we wrote one 1000
it would be a thousand.

00:04:12.024 --> 00:04:14.682
If we wrote a thousand two
times, it would be two thousands.

00:04:14.682 --> 00:04:18.849
If we wrote it 22 times, then
it would be 22 thousands.

00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:22.695
There'd be 22 thousands.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.501
And we could combine these numbers,

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:30.334
50,000 plus 22,000, will
be a total of 72,000.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.324
So, one way there, that
first way we talked about,

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:43.167
is to think about what does
five ten-thousands look like,

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:45.758
and what do 22 thousands look like,

00:04:45.758 --> 00:04:48.841
to get our numbers and then add them.

00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:51.219
Or, the other way that we could solve this

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:52.655
is with a place value chart.

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:54.908
Is, thinking about place value.

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:57.735
So, let's put a place value chart in here,

00:04:57.735 --> 00:05:01.256
and then put our first number,
which was five ten-thousands.

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:05.673
So, we have five in the
ten-thousands place,

00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:07.762
five ten-thousands.

00:05:07.762 --> 00:05:09.695
And we can fill in the zeros behind it

00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:11.172
in these empty place values.

00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:14.567
There were no thousands,
hundreds, tens, or ones.

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:18.951
So, for ten-thousands, we
added four zeros behind it.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.201
And the other number was 22,000, so 22.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.538
We read this as 22,000,
always saying the place value

00:05:28.538 --> 00:05:32.147
of the last non-zero digit we see.

00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:34.230
So, 22 and then thousand.

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:37.016
And then, with thousands like before,

00:05:37.016 --> 00:05:39.766
we'll add three zeros to the end.

00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:42.990
And finally, when we
combine these numbers,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.353
when we look at the place values,

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:47.691
we now have seven ten-thousands.

00:05:47.691 --> 00:05:49.217
We have two thousands.

00:05:49.217 --> 00:05:52.550
Still no hundreds, no tens, and no ones.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.801
So, our solution for

00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:58.718
five ten-thousands plus
22 thousands is 72,000.
