Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Good afternoon.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.650
My name is Jason Steinhauer.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.910
I'm a program specialist
at the John W. Kluge Center

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.690
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.320
Before we officially
begin today's program,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.780
I'll ask you to take a moment
to check your cell phones

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.600
and other electronic devices
and please set them to silent.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.990
I'll also make you aware that this
afternoon's program is being filmed

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.050
for placement on the Kluge
Center's website and YouTube

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.720
and iTunes channels, as well
as on other library YouTube

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.140
and iTunes channels and websites.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.390
I encourage you to visit our
website, loc.gov.kluge, K L U G E,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.080
to view other lectures delivered
by current and past Kluge scholars,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.890
including several on music, music
history and folklife delivered

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.600
by our past Alan Lomax fellows.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.610
Today's lecture is presented
by the John W. Kluge Center

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.510
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.630
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholars' center on Capitol Hill

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.890
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.590
to stimulate and energize one
another, to distill wisdom

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.960
from the Library's rich
resources, and to interact

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.280
with policymakers and the public.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.260
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.380
postdoctoral fellows and Ph.D.
candidates to conduct research

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.580
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.260
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.010
and other programs, and we
administer the Kluge prize

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.800
which recognizes lifetime
achievement in the study

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.860
of humanity, and which was awarded
two nights ago here at the Library

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.530
of Congress to Jurgen
Habermas and Charles Taylor.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.930
For more information about
these and other programs,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.610 position:56%
Today's event is co sponsored by the
library's American Folklife Center.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.980
The Folklife Center was
created in 1976 to preserve

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.120
and present American folklife, and
is designated by the U.S. Congress

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.660
as a national center for folklife
documentation and research.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.940 position:56%
The center continues to collect and
document living traditional culture,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.730
as well as preserving millions of
traditional arts, oral histories,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.990
songs, stories and creative
expressions of diverse communities.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:42.180
Please visit them at their website,
loc.gov/folklife/index.html.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.280
Today's lecture is
titled Musical Crossroads;

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.870
Alan Lomax's Southern Journey
and our Musical Crossroads.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.660
Our speaker is CeCe Conway.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.170
She is our Alan Lomax fellow
in the John W. Kluge Center

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.890
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.790
And Conway's research utilizes
the Alan Lomax collection

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.340
in the American Folklife
Center here at the library

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.450
to show how music has
crossed ethnic borders

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.490
to form regional culture
in Appalachia.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.050
She has done so by tracing
the cultural heritage

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.690
of Appalachia music from African
instruments and playing styles

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.040
as interpreted in black and white
communities throughout the region.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.800
Her talk today will be complemented
by musical illustrations

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.230
from Mali Griot Cheick Hamala
Diabate playing a southern Gambian

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.110 position:56%
style akonting folk lute, the banjo,
a Malian ngoni and the guitar,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.720
and virtuoso Blind Boy Paxton
on fiddle, banjo and guitar.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.580
Her talk will be followed

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.810
by a musical performance
featuring Diabate,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.260
Paxton and the Downhill Strugglers,
who were kind enough to grace us

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.150
with some introductory
music before we commenced.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.450
About CeCe.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.970

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.610
where she teaches American
Literature of the 20th Century,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.330
Appalachian Studies and Folklore.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.920
She's the author of the
book "African Banjo Echoes

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.840 position:56%

and the Smithsonian Folkways
Black Banjo Songsters CD.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.090
From 2010 and 2014 she
directed the National Endowment

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.350
for the Arts funded project Black

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.080
she has been in residence
with us at the Kluge Center

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.120
as our Alan Lomax fellow
in folklife studies,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.830
and it has been a great
pleasure to have her with us.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.510
So please join me in
welcoming CeCe Conway.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:50.250
[ Applause ]

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.550
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: Hello.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.850
Thank you all for coming.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.160
And I want to thank Jason

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.970
for helping us get all
of this together today.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.260
Jennifer, who is in the American
Folklife Center, played me a clip

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.020
of his, it's on YouTube,
called Sugar, From You,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.520
and it turns out he's a fabulous
musician just as Jennifer is

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.110
and that so I've learned that
here in the Library of Congress,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.190
as in the Smithsonian practically,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.300
every researcher is a
brilliant musician as well.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.130
It's thrilling because there's
so much insight in that.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.520
I'm very appreciative of the
Kluge Center to have been here

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.470
and had this time to work.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.010
And I want to also thank Mary Lou,
who is the queen of cordiality

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:42.140
and brought cookies to the band
last night; to Dan, to Jane,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.320
our leader until a few days
ago, and our new leader Bob.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.850
And I also from the Folklife
Center want to thank Betsy,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.920
who's the director, and Thea,
who is a wizard at logistics,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.110
including rescuing Cheick
Hamala from the parking lot.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.890 position:56%
And also, especially Todd and Steve,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.810
and my wonderful intern Yacee
[phonetic], and without the three

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.270
of them, this presentation
would not be happening

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.310
on PowerPoint, I assure you.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.370
Just thank goodness for
the younger generation.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.450
For a little bit I'm going
to give you the short story

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.570
of the Lomaxes and the library.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.290
I did quite a bit of this the other
day, but now this is a short story.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.590
So let's see.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.430
All right, Yacee, what
am I looking for now?

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.730
Thank you.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.460
Oh, good. Okay.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.010
Now the music isn't playing.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.310
[ Music ]

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.110
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: Oh,
the music is playing.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.050
[ Music ]

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.140
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: In 1933 John Lomax

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.270
and 18 year old Alan
began collecting folksongs

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.570
for the Library of Congress.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.050
A little later John was named the
honorary consultant and curator

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.650
of the archived American folksong,
and he and Teddy Roosevelt used

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.630
to meet together to
discuss what kind

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:18.490
of folklore would be appropriate
to link to our wonderful lands,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.700
and they picked the cowboy.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.130
Now, this is Hobart Smith
who's one of the early people

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.760
that they recorded playing
"Banging Breakdown".

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.800
And you'll notice that banjo,
it's what we call a mountain banjo

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:41.980
and that's an inset rim and
it arrived near where I teach

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.170
in the northwestern mountains
just after the Civil War.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:54.920
One of the ancestral folks
stopped off there in Wilkesboro,

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.830
sometimes considered the
moonshining capital of the world,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.580
and brought back a pattern for the
first banjo that was made there.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.990
And now these banjos are made
within about a hundred miles only,

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.950
apparently, of where
Virginia, North Carolina

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:17.850
and Tennessee come together.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.510
That was Hobart Smith
from Saltville.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:27.040
So here's Alan, young Alan, who
became the assistant in charge,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.510
and he remained there until 1942.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:39.040
[ Music ]

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.290
He and his father, and
also his sister Bess,

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.970
recorded all over the south.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:49.360
And Bess was a fantastic folklorist
who became the head of the NEA

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.620
and the traditional arts and
instituted the National Endowment

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.420
for the Arts Fellowship Heritage
Awards that are being given

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.130
in this building tonight, actually.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.100
She also is, as far as I know, the
first folklorist who put the name

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.170
of her coworker, Bessie Jones

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.970
from the Sea Islands,
on the book with her.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.340
She and Bessie together
were credited with writing

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.650
that book, which was wonderful.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.400
Alan also got to go on a trip
led by Zora Neale Hurston.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.910
She took them to and Mary
Elizabeth Barnicle went, too,

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.020
and they went to the Georgia Sea
Islands and then to Eatonville,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:40.910
Florida, and then Alan
and Miss Barnicle would go

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.510
on to Nassau and the Bahamas.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:57.060
[ Music ]

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:02.370
When Alan left the Library
of Congress in 1942,

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.890
for some months he
wrote back to the man

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.080
in charge telling him
things he needed to do,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.480
and that was really wonderful
because Alan had been so busy doing

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.450
so many things while he was
here, he never wrote them down,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:20.220
and there were many things
we never found out about.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.870
And one of the ones that was
especially interesting was a letter

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.260
talking about Pete Steele,
a wonderful banjo player,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:34.070
and he said to the acting person,
get that check off to Pete Steele,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:40.420
his wife's sick, I think she has
cancer, they need the $12.43 now.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:45.690
So that was the sort of many
things he was doing daily.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.440
Something else that Alan and his
father did that was really exciting

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.390
in their work was find
very ancient instruments,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.250
and these were the quills.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.660
They had appeared played by Henry
Thomas, [inaudible] from Texas

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:09.530
who had made an earlier recording,
and along with the whoops

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.510
as well, that's part of it.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:39.200
[ Music ]

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:46.670
And the Harry Thomas
quill playing was included

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:51.340
in Harry Smith's anthology
of folksong,

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.930
which brought out a whole bunch
of 78s on long play records

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.790
and became kind of the bible

00:11:56.790 --> 00:12:01.600
for the folk festival
revival of the '50s and '60s.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:07.500
But it was interesting that
Alan had met these musicians

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.790
after he had worked with John
C. Work at Fisk University,

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:19.980 position:56%
and the paying flute player gave him
a tip about finding Sid Hemphill.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:30.500
And here we've got him imitating
the dog chasing the fox.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.170
So Sid also played the fiddle.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:40.870
And Alan went to Scotland and
England and Ireland and Spain

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:47.340
and Italy and collected from
1951 to '59, I believe it was,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.610
and he did that partly because
he had great opportunities there.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.650
He had been working with the BBC
in putting out records and getting

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.350
to work with really good equipment.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.760
And while he was there not only
did he collect hours and hours,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.020
I was staggered with
how much there was,

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:09.670 position:56%
but he also produced radio shows
and five albums for the world music.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:14.000
And so this was helping the people

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.270
who played this wonderful
music be more appreciated

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:23.630
and get more recognition, including
the kinkers, the travellers

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.400
who lived near around Aberdeenshire

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.190
and had been dismissed
by many people.

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:37.920
And eventually Jeannie Robertson
received the British Empire Medal

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.470
of Honor from the Queen and
she was the first folk singer

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.680
and the first traveller to ever
get that award in the '50s.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.190
So that was very exciting.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.620
Another interesting
find in the archive,

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:04.570
and this had not been released
on record, is a fife player,

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.170
Marion Rees, so he's
playing the tune on the fife

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.910 position:56%
and in a minute he's going to play
the same tune on the fiddle for you.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.640 position:56%
And part of what else is interesting
about this is that Alan Jabbour,

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.070
who was the first director of
the American Folklife Center,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.190
plays the fiddle, he's
a very good fiddler

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.200
and a very excellent scholar,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.300
and his mentor was an old man named
Henry Reed who had learned many

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:40.060
of his tunes from Quince Dillion,
who was a Civil War fifer.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.160
So this recording lets
us get a sense

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.510
of how a fiddler would
learn from a fifer.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:58.430
[ Music ]

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:04.720
I think I first met Alan Lomax when
he introduced the Global Jukebox

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.440
at the American Folklife meeting.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:13.030
He enacted the dances and songs
and social characteristics for us

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.800
with great enthusiasm,
and I can always see

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.810
that image of him in my mind.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.470 position:56%
And the Global Jukebox pared musical
traits with social characteristics,

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:30.060
so it's a and the anthropologists
were upset

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:35.480
because he didn't have
a Ph.D. in anthropology.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.430
However, it's an amazing work.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:55.500
And the Association for Cultural
Equity is a website where tons

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:04.350
of this material is available for
you to look at also from home.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:17.100
A little later, in 1976, the
American Folklore Conference was

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:26.580
in New Orleans for the bicentennial
and I was giving, with my husband,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.420
[inaudible] and also with
the Red Clay Ramblers.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:34.550
So the two of us were giving
our first presentation

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:41.600
on the African roots of the banjo
and it turned out that Bess Lomax

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.850
and Alan Lomax were in the crowd.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.140
It was intimidating,
but we survived.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.320 position:56%
So when Alan came back from
Scotland and all those other places,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.620
he revisited all the people
his father and he had gone to.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.220
And many of them, of
course, had died, but Estil

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.700
and Orna Ball were two
folks who were doing fine.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:08.130
And Alan felt like he was
playing better than ever,

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.130
that his guitar playing
was deeper and stronger

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.020
and his singing was more confident.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.630
And it was interesting
because Ball was the one

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.750
who helped Wayne Henderson
learn to listen and play music.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.320
That guitar was the one
that surrounded him.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.800
And he's one of the most fabulous
guitar makers in this country now

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.540
and he has also received
an NEA Heritage Award.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.840
And you saw a picture of
him just a minute ago.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.140
So I think of that
sound surrounding him

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.440
as leading him toward the
guitar sound he wanted.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.740
Now, this is Fred McDowell,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.540
a new person that Alan
met while he was back.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:43.060
[ Music ]

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.150
One of his tunes was covered
by the Rolling Stones,

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.670
and he's playing bottleneck guitar.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.960
He started with a cow
bone, then a pocket knife,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:57.550
and then finally a bottleneck.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.440
Julie Christie went on
this tour with Alan,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.330
and I think sometimes didn't
feel fully appreciated,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:09.450 position:56%
but there's a fabulous picture that
Alan took of her, that I wasn't able

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:14.330
to get hold of, that has her and
[inaudible] Almeda Riddle together.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.970
Almeda was probably close to 80

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.600
and Christie was maybe
30, early thirties.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.540
Anyway, it was a very nice
photograph and testimony.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:30.900
Hobart Smith, whom you saw
with the mountain banjo,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.200
also played the fiddle
and the guitar.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.460
And, in fact, when
he played the guitar,

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.900
at least for one year he played 365
days while his brother preached,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.780
so that really built up
his stamina in his playing.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.030
So this is Hobart playing

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.510
"John Brown Dreamed the Devil
was Dead" on the fiddle.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:18.110
[ Music ]

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.230
And here we have Alan
with Wade Ward,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:25.390
one of the earliest people
that the Lomaxes found.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:30.970
And you can say he's listening to
his music and thrilled to do it.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.630
I was lucky enough to
be alive when I did get

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.820
to meet Wade Ward and
also Bessie Jones.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.450
So those were two of the
great elders they collected

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:48.300
from that I got to and Wade Ward
also played with Charlie Higgins,

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.160
who was an older fiddle player,
and they played for auctions.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.030
And as he said, to
keep them from getting

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.530
when people got grumpy
there, they would try

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.360
to cheer them up with their music.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.660
And often those were
very sad sales, actually,

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.310
back during the Depression.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.280
Also, he claimed that Charlie
Higgins knew a thousand tunes,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.510
and he certainly did play
well and know a lot of them.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:25.070
[ Music ]

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.830
Oh, now, here we've got one
of these double items again.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:34.440
But Alan did a movie
in Williamsburg.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.850 position:56%
He took musicians to the Sea Islands
to rehearse for two or three days,

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.290
and they had never met each other,

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.120
and they were so good they
were able to play together.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:52.060
And the idea of the movie
was that it was supposed

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.300
to show late 18th century
music in Williamsburg.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.710
And he took two traditions that
had not really intermingled

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.400
at that time; one from the
upper south, the banjo,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.710
fiddle string tradition,
influenced particularly

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:19.470
by African American players,
and by Scot-Irish fiddlers

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:29.650 position:56%
and then he took the Deep South
tradition which had a lot of singing

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:36.100
and different styles of music,
like the southeast Sea Islands,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.450
and then they intermixed
all of that in this movie.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.860
So it maybe never really
happened all at one time,

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:45.260
but it was artistically
very creative.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:55.180
And it was also interesting
because after he left for Scotland

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.770
and Europe, in 1952 Harry
Smith put out his anthology,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:06.620
and I believe that was the first
released record set that had blacks

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.190
and whites intermingled
on the records themselves.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:13.880
And because the record companies,

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.700
the 78 record companies
had the hillbilly list

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.590 position:56%
and they had a race record list, and
his anthology mixed those together

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.830
and that's, again, the
work that became the bible

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:31.760
for revivalists in
the '50s and '60s.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.480
Alan was working on his video.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.730
This was one of his last
major projects, well,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.690
besides getting it all
released and everything,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:45.210
for a video of American
patchwork, and I was leading him

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.510
to black banjo players
while we were there.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:58.040
[ Music ]

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.520
This is Dink Roberts.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.700
This is a cut from our new
Black Banjo Songster record

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.370
for Smithsonian Folkways
that we hope will make it

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:10.450
out next year at some point.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.510
So you are the first audience
to hear this recording.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:19.290
[ Music ]

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.900
So we just did Joe Thompson and
Odell, and Joe was really kind

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:31.500
of the last standing black
elder player who died in 2012,

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.090
and he was the mentor to the
Carolina Chocolate Drops,

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.300
if you've gotten to hear them.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.110
So this is him as a young
man with his cousin Odell,

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.810
who played fiddle and banjo.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:52.540
And here we're at Dink Roberts'
and Dink's wife Lilly is

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.350
about to do the rabbit dance,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:24:00.730
and she's the only one
we know who did that.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:06.180
There was a lady from the Deep
South who did a rabbit dance,

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:09.920
a white lady, but she did
it leaning forward instead

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.240
of backwards, the way Lilly did.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.860
And there's Dink sitting there by
his wife Lilly, with Alan's back

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.510
to us in the white shirt,
and then the film crew.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:27.040
[ Music ]

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.840
And there's Dink on that day.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:39.510
[ Music ]

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:44.430
[ Laughter ]

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.060
Very improvisational.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.780
That's a major characteristic
of African American music.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.880
Now, this is a full spike lute.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.990
You'll see more about that later.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.890 position:56%
And here is a little video of Cheick
Hamala Diabate, who you'll get

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:05.010
to hear in person a little
later, and he's playing the ngoni

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.430
at the Prison Coffeehouse
in Charlottesville,

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.670
and this was in the 1990s.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.120
I think he had barely arrived.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.940
He spoke only French at that time,
and we did the best we could.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.220
I have a little French, but
it certainly wasn't exciting,

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.070
but we've been friends
ever since that day.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:25.140
And those of you who are
banjo players will notice

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:31.330
that there are a lot of
banjo moves on the ngoni.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:35.970
And there was his mentor,
the kora player.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.320
Okay. So that was a short story

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.410
about the Lomaxes and
their collecting.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.760
And then my main topic is the
roots of the banjo and the fiddle.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.300
The banjo's heard around the world
from the Blue Ridge Mountains

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.510
to the American Folklife
Center, to Switzerland and Japan.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:05.210
And the White Mountain musician has
been the symbol of that instrument.

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.240
And this recording of the
"Coo Coo" by Tom Ashley

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.150
with the young Doc Watson playing
the guitar, although he's not

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:19.160 position:56%
on the recording, just in the
photo, was on that Harry Smith album

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.450
and this was sort of the anthem
for those of us in the revival,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.800
so much so that we named
our son Tom Ashley.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:32.950
I'll tell you a little
story about Doc Watson.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:39.100
When Ralph Winslow from
the Smithsonian met him,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.900
Doc was playing electric guitar

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.900
and so he Ralph was only
interested in recording Tom Ashley.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:55.130
But then, one of these days in
the early meeting, Doc was sitting

00:26:55.130 --> 00:27:00.350
in the back of a truck playing the
banjo and Ralph then discovered

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.440 position:56%
that he could play old time music,
too, and really encouraged him to do

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.060
that and recorded him and
brought him a lot of places,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.590
like up here to the
Smithsonian Folk Festival.

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:16.620
And when Ralph died,
on NPR Doc said,

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:23.990
He left me better than he found me.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:32.510 position:56%
When I wrote my book, we thought
that the ngoni and the Wolff, Holum,

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:37.000
[phonetic], the semi spike griot
lutes were the primary ancestor

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.190
of our American banjo in the south.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:45.640
And partly we thought this
was because of Paul Oliver

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.900
who had written a wonderful
book, a British man,

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:54.890
on the Savannah Syncopaters and he
had heard the musical similarities

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.020
between those players and the blues
and really didn't know as much

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.480
about banjo tradition
as we know now.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:09.760
But we were wrong then and
new evidence has come I mean,

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.150
those instruments were
eventually very important,

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:18.860
I think particularly influencing
fingerpicking style, but again,

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.180
it has not always been so that the
White Mountain musician was the

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.000
symbol of the banjo because it was
brought here by Africans no later

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.030
than 1740 into Maryland
and the South,

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.940
and for a hundred years they were
about the only ones who played it.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:43.940
They came from southern Gambia,
below the Casamance River.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.980
The Jola people lived there.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:51.940
And a fellow named Daniel Jatta was
in this country getting his M B.A.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:58.820
and he began to hear
about the banjo.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:05.220
So here you can see southern
Gambian and the Casamance River,

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.720
which is below the Gambia River,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.020
and also some of the coastal areas
were places were other full spike

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.090
lute traditions existed.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:15.670
This is John Snipes.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.870
He was the first black banjo
player that I ever met.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:25.820
He lived in Dobson Crossroads near
Chapel Hill in a cabin, log cabin,

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.050
with his wife, and his
grandchildren were there often.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:32.170
He's playing the "Coo
Coo," the same song

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.510
that you heard Tom Ashley
play, but how different.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:41.070
[ Music ]

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:45.880
And notice that the banjo songs
are built on little rifts.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.940
I mean, we use that word with jazz,

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.510
but this was a much older
tradition that influenced it.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:30:01.210
[ Music ]

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.890
Another great one he played
was "The Fox Chase," where

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:08.230
and this is not the Virginia
red-coated fox chasers.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.040
These are the guys sitting out
in the woods with their jug

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:17.630
of liquor telling stories and
listening to their dogs rove.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:22.240
And in Dink's version of "Fox
Chase" he says at the end,

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.680 position:56%
God bless my red eyes, the fox says,
I've done set the world on fire,

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:30.310
because he ran all night
and the sun was rising.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.410
Okay. But again, we
were wrong to think

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:35.370
that the griot lutes
were the first ones

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.050 position:56%
because form is the most persistent,

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.420
beyond construction
and beyond function.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:50.810
And notice, this is Daniel Jatta,
whom I was just telling you about,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.980
he's playing the full spike lute,
the akonting, the folk lute,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:58.920
not the griot professionalized
instrument,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.350
and behind him is a Boucher banjo,

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.520
which was one of the most
famous first banjo makers.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.930
And notice how similar from
the front the shapes are.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.920
And it's no longer a gourd
after about a hundred years,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:20.620
but then people well, there
were a couple of white guys

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:27.810
in the 1830s started playing these
instruments, the gourd instruments,

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:34.500
and eventually Joel
Sweeney either popularized

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:40.540
or invented the five-string
banjo, which had five strings.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.520
The fifth string that was added is
not what we call the fifth string

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.670
with the short string now
that you play with your thumb,

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:52.830
but it was the fourth long string
that was added that made it a total

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.510
of five strings and it gave
more melodic capability

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:00.100
to the European styles.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.630
Just to finish with a story
about Daniel for a second.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.660
So he was here getting his
MBA and he went home to study

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.070
with his father, who died within
a year, so we're very lucky

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:16.920
that he did become
interested in that tradition.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.720
All of his African friends
thought he was crazy,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.110
why wasn't he making a lot
of money as an economist.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.260
Well, eventually then
he did go to Sweden

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:29.660
and become an economist there,
and he started trying to lecture

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.010
about this and people
were not paying attention.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:37.210 position:56%
But finally, a banjo player and
lute collector and media specialist,

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.690
Ulf Jagfors, saw how
important what he was saying,

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.370
brought him to this
country in the year 2000

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:48.390
and revolutionized our
understanding of the banjo.

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.690
So you see how different
the griot lutes are.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:56.450
And then this is Jesus Jarju, and
he's playing an akonting also.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.140
He's from the Jola people.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:04.870 position:56%
But notice that it's pear-shaped and
that was an older style instrument.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:08.300
I mean, it's the same
concept, it sounded the same,

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.370
but more recently they discovered

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.170
that the round gourd
worked better musically,

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.450
and so that's what almost
all of them are made now.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:20.740
But there's the pear-shaped,
the old pear-shaped akonting.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:30.500 position:56%
And here's the first painting that
we know of of the gourd banjo, 1792.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.660
Notice that it's the pear-shaped.

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.590
A sort of Homer like depiction
in Liberty and the Arts.

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.010
It's a painting in Philadelphia.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:42.150
And it's a fabulous
painting to have been made,

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:44.570
celebrating the new country

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.130
and including African
Americans in the painting.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.070
Okay. Now we get to hear Cheick
Hamala play, and he's going to play

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.550
at least three tunes for you.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:58.410
The first one on the akonting
so you can hear that sounds,

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:04.140
then one on the banjo, and
then finally one on the ngoni.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:08.190
Another thing that's unusual
about ngoni playing is

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:13.770
that he sometimes picks
up with his little finger,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.080
and banjo players don't
usually do this.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.890
However, Dink Roberts, who was
the person I worked with the most

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:24.070
that you heard one of
his songs, did do that,

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.370
and so that also is some evidence

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:32.380
that there were eventually
griot lute influences.

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.020
So there's the akonting.

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:40.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My name is Cheick Hamala
Diabate, from Mali, West Africa.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.320
Actually I'm griot.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.360
The griot is a storyteller.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.760
They say if one griot dies,
like one library burn, just cry.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.040
So we're happy to be here.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.990
I play this instrument
called [inaudible].

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.510

what I like to say.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.750 position:56%
Also, I have an American banjo here.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:10.700
So when I first come to
America, I bring only my ngoni,

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:17.760 position:56%
but when I come here, I was playing
with a lot of American banjo player.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:26.370
We be in travel, and I tried to
learn the banjo from [inaudible].

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:32.980
But actually the banjo come from
my instrument, and when I tried

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:40.500
to play the banjo, I told them
this is very easy for me to play.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.970
They say, yeah, it come from ngoni.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.170
And Bob Carlin find me this banjo.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:48.050
And this one, the first one I play,
I get from Peter Ross [phonetic]

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:52.420
from Baltimore, but he was coming
to my house, watch my hands

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.690
when I play my ngoni, and he
make this left hand banjo for me,

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.670
and this is a regular banjo.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:04.540

instrument and to get back to mine.

to the Black and Banjo Roots
gatherings in 2010 and '12,

of New Orleans, and plays
the four-string jazz banjo

playing together.

going to use this screen and see.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:06.350
But before we do that, I want
to say that Tuesday night

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:12.200
at the Kluge prize awards
recipient Philosophers Habermas

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.590
and Taylor spoke of their
important perspectives

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:16.890
on behalf of the humanities.

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.060
As a folklorist in the discipline
I consider especially relevant

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:27.130
to the 21st electronic and global
century, folklife offers a strategy

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:32.640
for Habermas' communication in the
public sphere and for Taylor's view

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:36.400
about a major challenge
for democracy.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.820
We cherish our sense of
community, our ethnicity,

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.970
or perhaps our nation, for
as C. Vann Woodward said,

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.940
"Our history is part
of our identity".

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.680
But then how do we
approach the other.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:56.390
Traditional music has repeatedly
offered an impressive means

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.690
for musical crossroads.

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.050
Music often crosses ethnic,

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:05.310
class and gender borders
enthusiastically rather

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:06.870
than aggressively.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.880
In many ways, for example,

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.500
African American music has
influenced the creation

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:17.610
of perhaps each of our
Appalachian and Southern creations

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.630
of American musical genres.

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.530
This gradual shift from ethnic

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:28.770 position:56%
to regional traditions may
illustrate how this process benefits

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:33.960
various ethnic groups, and so
I think it's really important.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.850
Another thing that I
didn't mention earlier.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:43.350
When Alan Lomax was in Scotland,
he and some of his buddies,

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.740
like Hamish Henderson,
created the public festival

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.050
so that traditional
singers could have a place

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:53.830
at the Edinburgh Festival,
not just classical things.

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:59.070
So they were working on this effort
to be with in the public sphere.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:03.380
Okay. I'm going to play
you a little bit of a movie

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:05.720
about Daniel Jatta interviewing one

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.090
of the oldest ngoni
players still living.

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:15.110
&gt;&gt; He said before the nylon
strings, palm tree roots were used,

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:19.170
according to the son
of the nylon strings.

00:51:19.170 --> 00:51:20.970
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: Palm tree roots.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:31.100
[ Foreign language ]

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.270
And they're going to make
getting ready to make palm wine.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:47.470
Again, the southern Gambia folks
had not been really influenced

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:53.160
by the palm at the time
of the slave trade and,

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.530
they also still have
not been influenced,

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.070
but it's partly [inaudible].

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:03.800
That is a palm bark.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.960
And that's a young Jesus
Jarju right there playing.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:13.630
But even Daniel's father
told a story --

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:19.890
or told him don't stay
out late at night alone

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:23.350
because you might get
kidnapped and taken away

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.510
by the devils in hickory shoes.

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:37.260
[ Foreign language ]

00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:40.410
And this is not an
akonting, but a different one

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.770
of these lute traditions.

00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:47.330
And there's lots of interesting
websites and more information

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:51.510
than you can probably ever read
on some of these instruments.

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:56.510
[ Music ]

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:02.310
[ Foreign language ]

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:07.570
So this is a tuning and its name
each note is part of the name

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:12.820
of the town where they believe
the first akonting was made many,

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:15.310
many years ago.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.770
And notice some of these moves.

00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:23.090
Those are the Laurent banjo
players, like heaving down.

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:28.420
&gt;&gt; From me and do you want
to started play these also.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.210
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: Hammering on is
what we call it, or pulling off.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:32.610
Those are techniques.

00:53:32.610 --> 00:53:35.550
Another thing about
Cheick Hamala's playing,

00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:40.740
notice that he was using his
foot taps to set a rhythm,

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.380
and he was also tapping the head
of the ngoni to set a rhythm,

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.900
and those are characteristics
of a lot of black banjo players

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.070
and even a few white players.

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:58.600
This is a down stroke and there's
a technique called drop thumbing

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:04.370 position:56%
that's considered what makes a banjo
player more than a backporch picker

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.770
because you not only hit the
drone string but you drop

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:17.500
down into the melody strings, and
the Jola people use that technique.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.620
So that's another piece
of evidence of continuity.

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:26.970
Okay. Here you have a
painting from the 1950s

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:32.830
by the first African American
missionary who went to Liberia,

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.760
and they're paintings
of older times,

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.980
So you can see the fellow
going up in the palm tree

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:44.260
and are they trading
with that chip or slaves,

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.430
and slave people being
taken out there.

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:52.520
This is a painting from 1800s
in South Carolina and notice

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.100 position:56%
that the skit has started to change.

00:54:55.100 --> 00:55:01.370
It has a flat fingerboard and it
has pegs and there are probably --

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:10.960
most of them designs around the
rim carved, still the gourd head.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.770 position:56%
And so this came in more
southernly than the earlier pictures

00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:17.680
of the akonting that we have,

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.990 position:56%
and probably through the Caribbean
influence and the Spanish influence.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:26.640
Here we've got a black
in minstrel clothes,

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:31.220
and notice there's an
akonting that he's leaning on.

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:33.620
Notice this is a minstrel drawing

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.040
and the [inaudible],
of course, the problem.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.580
We'll get back to that in a minute.

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:44.340
But notice that the long stick neck
is the full spike akonting there

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.440
before the minstrels shifted

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.930
from the African banjos
to their new open back.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:55:55.470
This is Joel Sweeney, one of the
first white men to learn to play.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:59.340
This is a Boucher banjo,
like the one in the painting.

00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.970
Here is one of the first
actual Virginia banjos made

00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:04.380
by a cabinetmaker.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.390
Here you have, again, a mount.

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:09.830
And then in minstrelsy
it's interesting

00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:13.160
that they began first as dancers.

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.040
And Juba Lane was the only
black in early minstrelsy.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:21.770 position:56%
He was described by Charles Dickens,
and he finally went to London

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:25.780
where he could enjoy
his talent more easily.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.790
Eventually the banjo became
the center of minstrelsy,

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:35.470
but here you have a single
banjo player with the dancer.

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:42.460
There were serious and
frustrating stereotyping during

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.830
that whole period.

00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:48.650
However, in many ways I think
minstrelsy was an attempt

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:51.820
to address the fact that in it was
the first popular entertainment

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:58.010
in this country, and in some ways
an attempt to address the new issue

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:01.230
of black and whites
living close together.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:02.840
And had it been more successful,

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.090
maybe we wouldn't have
had the Civil War.

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:07.280
What did come of interest

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:11.520
as the instrument makers were
erasing the African roots

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:17.040
of the banjo, and were beautiful
banjos, the Fairbanks banjos

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.470
of the 1900s are about the best.

00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:21.430 position:56%
Now the African roots of the fiddle.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.110
And we can zoom through
these photos.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:26.920
Jefferson practiced the
violin three times a day,

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:31.330
but he also played the fiddle
for Patrick Henry to dance

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:34.190
when Jefferson was on
his way to Williamsburg.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.540
The cittern.

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:40.060
Jefferson gave the only description
of a tuning for the banjo,

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.770
and he compared it to a guitar,
but it was an English guitar,

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:47.640
and so it's not the
tunings that we have today.

00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.410
And actually, the way
he described it,

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.480
it could have been
one of two tunings.

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:57.050
Isaac Jefferson was
his ace blacksmith.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:58:00.190
He could make more nails
faster than anybody else.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.510
And he said how Jefferson's brother
Randolph used to come and dance

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.510
and play the fiddle
with the black folks,

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.000
and he just should
have been more careful.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.280
In Jefferson's own hand he wrote
down the tune "Money Musk",

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.160
and I think Jerome's going to
play that for you a little later.

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:23.020
And it was also played by Eston
Hemmings, Sally Hemmings' son,

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:25.720
and possibly Jefferson's.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:28.090
There's Modu [phonetic],
the coolest [inaudible]

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:34.690
of the one-string fiddle,
and other related folks.

00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:38.280
This is the house where Sally
Hemmings lived with her sons

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.700
after Jefferson died that
he had arranged for her.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:45.520
I'm just going to play this split
second of Tommy Jarrell's for us.

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.820
&gt;&gt; How about playing me a tune.

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:48.560
He said you play me a tune.

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.890
Well, to kind of satisfy
him I thought

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:53.310
of something [inaudible] back
steps in there, something,

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:56.910
I don't know what, and
I handed it to him.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:00.330
I said now you play me a tune.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:02.510

first one he played.

&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: The fiddle
was in the Civil War.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.260
&gt;&gt; is where men are bald-headed.

See that there patch
place right there?

00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:34.600
That's kind of his
coppery head on there.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:38.230
And I looked at it and
where he noted that fiddle,

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:41.200
I could see every place where
he noted and it was just bright

00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:44.100
as any new penny you ever saw.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.110
&gt;&gt; CeCe Conway: Thomas Jefferson
Jarrell, a great fiddle player,

00:59:47.110 --> 00:59:50.180
and he had got the
fiddle from Zach Payne,

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.120
and that's Payne's spray
with the fiddle there.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:58.410
In the Civil War both
sides had banjo players.

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.690
In this one the black man's
getting to play his own.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:03.090
And the other one, the
white fellow sitting next

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.800
to the black man has probably
possibly taken over that one.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:12.740
But anyway, there were two styles
that black fiddlers played,

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:17.420
and they were the primary the
fiddlers in the 18th century,

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.310
all through the 1700s
for whites and blacks.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:23.610
And part of the question is

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.380
where did they learn
the white dance music.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.270
So we can be appreciative
to these folks

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:33.510

the sounds were.
