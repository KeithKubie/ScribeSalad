00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.900
AARON HIRSH: My goal in
the next 40 minutes or so

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.150
will be to get to the
deeper ideas in the book,

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.520
"Telling Our Way to the Sea."

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.750
And those are ideas not
only about ecology but also

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.240
about storytelling.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.210
So I'll be dipping
into the book now

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.235
and then to read a
little bit to you.

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:22.220
And that's actually
how I'd like to start.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.820
Let me just plunge right in.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.540
"A school of needlefish
parts to stream around me,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.600
and I find myself momentarily
among the silver traces

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.370
of a comet shower.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.020
I move to join them, but
they accelerate and dissolve

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.630
into open water, leaving me to
stare at the luminous, molten

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.080
mirror that is the underside
of the ocean surface.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.000
Veronica taps my arm-- a signal
that says both, look at that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.980
and be right back-- as she slips
from the roiled layer of silver

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
and descends swiftly, like
a being born underwater.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.790
Her skindiver's fins form
a single, broad fluke

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.500
which propels her
neoprene form sinuously

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.390
toward the rocky bottom.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.960
Bright bubbles escaping
her snorkel wobble urgently

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.380
back to the air above.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.550
A thousand times I have
seen her descend like this.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.600
Yet still, I find myself
wondering if, this time,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.280
she might go too deep
or stay too long.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.500
Here, mercifully, the sea
floor is only 20 feet down,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.810
a depth at which the
plunging chutes of sunlight

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.710
are just converging to
their vanishing point.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.680
As she approaches
the rocks, Veronica

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.170
twists, glides to a supine
and weightless pause,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.580
and gazes up at the students
who float beside me here

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.260
at the surface.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.560
She seems to be pointing at
something on the sea floor.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.580
Allie, the student to my
right, turns to look at me.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.200
Inside the partial
shade of her dive mask,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.120
her eyes are hard to read.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.986
They look puzzled,
a little concerned.

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:56.360
She's probably
just wondering why

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.980
Veronica wants
them to notice what

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.014
appears to be a mud-brown
lump of sea muck.

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.180
Though it also seems possible
that Allie has already

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.030
perceived Veronica's
tendencies underwater,

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.460
the strange private gravity
that seems to draw her to depth,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.475
and she is now asking
in her gentle way

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:14.100
whether something should perhaps
be done to bring Veronica back

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.000
to the surface.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.590
I take several long breaths,
saturating my blood with oxygen

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.250
and preparing to dive.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.370
But just as I draw my
last deep dose of air,

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.430
Veronica finally relents.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.190
She places her hand gently
around the nondescript mound

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.540
and pulls it from
the rocks, holding it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.050
as one might hold a
soft loaf of bread.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.190
Arriving among us,
Veronica holds out her hand

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.040
upon which rests
her inert quarry.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.180
What was mud-colored
below is now,

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.110
in this bright, shallow
water, more of a yellow ochre,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.560
and it is studded with pale
tubercles that are almost

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.950
the color of lemon drops.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.000
The skin, stretched taut
over the knobby body,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.240
appears thin and mucosal,
making this thing look terribly

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.880
exposed, like a bodily organ
drawn by the hand of a surgeon

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.410
into the sudden brightness
of the operating theater.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.740
The students-- there are
five of them here-- draw in

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.490
around Veronica's
palm, peering intently

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.940
through their panes
of tempered glass.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.410
They seem transfixed, certain
that Veronica's plunge must

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.620
have been for
something thrilling.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.060
The lump trembles, inches
forward along Veronica's palm.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.230
Suddenly it is less
vegetable than animal,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.780
and the students pull
back apprehensively.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.350
But as the circle of
masks starts to widen,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.950
Veronica's free hand
catches Allie by the wrist.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.630
Veronica is wise, I
think, to choose Allie,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.600
because there are others who
might not be so trusting.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.200
Carefully, she
opens Allie's palm

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.390
and holds it beside her own.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.410
As the knobby creature slides
from one hand to the other,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.280
Allie's eyes widen,
and she speaks

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.410
into her snorkel, an
incomprehensible but richly

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.070
expressive string of syllables.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.780
For a moment, she seems frozen.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.180
But even in her
astonishment, she

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.010
looks to the other students.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.720
She takes the hand of the
young man floating beside her,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.030
opens his palm, and
holds it next to her own.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.130
The animal slides
over obligingly.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.850
And as it does, Cameron
explores the creature's back

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.690
with his other hand.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.700
Cameron's hands look
muscular, well worn,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.410
and they sometimes
move in unusual ways.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.959
The fingers seem to
explore independently,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.930
executing many minor adjustments
as if they were navigating

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.300
the neck of a string instrument.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.050
These hands have learned to
perceive more than other hands

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.210
because Cameron cannot see.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.550
He is blind.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.240
And as his fingers creep
across the animal's back,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.590
investigating, it
becomes clear that they

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.370
are following a pattern.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.000
The yellow warts,
which at first seemed

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.760
to be scattered more
or less randomly,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.190
are in fact arranged, loosely
but nonetheless perceptibly,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.130
into two rows.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.400
I've never noticed
this rough regularity.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.190
But now that I see it, I
suspect it might be meaningful.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.160
I suspect, in fact, that
those two haphazard rows are

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.730
clues to a deep connection,
an invisible but very real

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.650
threat that links the ugly
animal on Cameron's hand

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.960
to far more beautiful creatures
we've seen this morning.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.770
Just moments before
her plunge, Veronica

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.860
pointed us to a sun star,
Heliaster kubiniji, a pink

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.910
and green starfish in
the unmistakable shape

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.380
of a sunflower.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.540
And before that, we all
hovered in admiration

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.990
over the crown sea
urchin, Centrostephanus

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.420
coronatus, which is a sphere
of long and slender spines,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.430
each one perfectly black but
for the occasional sharp wave

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.670
of blue light that
races from tip to base.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.210
To describe these scattered
pulses to Cameron,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.780
Allie said it looked
"like an alien's brain."

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.050
So the connection that
those little bumps

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.930
on the back of the animal that
Cameron discovered revealed

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.420
was membership in the
phylum Echinodermata.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.190
Now what that really means is
that that little ugly animal

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.740
and those more beautiful
creatures we'd seen earlier

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.690
that day on the dive
are all descended

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.080
from a single species, a single
ur-echinoderm, you could say,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.940
that inhabited the oceans
520 million years ago.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.990
That ur-echinoderm,
in its time on Earth,

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.980
hit upon some
terrific inventions,

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.410
evolutionary
innovations, basically.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.060
And those inventions
were passed down

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.780
to the various animals
that now belong

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.988
to this group, Echinodermata.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.190
The tubercles on the animal's
back bespeak one of those.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.050
But another one,
and what Cameron

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.380
wanted to show them
now, is something

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.780
called mutable
connective tissue.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.820
And I need to tell you how
mutable connective tissue works

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.210
so that you understand the
next part of the story.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.470
Mutable connective
tissue, it's really

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.970
just collagen, the
stuff that makes up

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.430
the cartilage in your knees
and the discs in your spine

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.900
and that makes your
nose kind of stiff.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.160
But whereas our collagen stays
relatively hard all the time,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.050
echinoderms have
an amazing ability

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.600
to change the nature
of their collagen.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.770
Collagen is a polymer,
meaning it's built up

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.867
of many, many copies of the
same little molecule that

00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:17.450
link together.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:23.750
You can imagine twist ties
that you wind together

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.610
into something like a
suspension bridge cable.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.650
That's what a collagen fiber is.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.970
It's basically twist ties wound
into a suspension bridge cable.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.290
Now what echinoderms can
do, thanks to little cells

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.040
embedded in their collagen,
is those little cells release

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.860
a compound, and it causes
the suspension bridge cable

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.830
to immediately fall apart
into billions of twist ties.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.050
At the level of the animal,
that looks like something

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.360
with it is hard, like
billiard ball hard one moment,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.880
going pudding soft.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.050
It basically liquefies itself.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.960
More amazingly, what
the animal can do

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.240
is those cells secrete an
antidote to the first compound.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.300
The twist ties then
quickly rewind themselves

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.050
into the suspension
bridge cable.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.340
And that animal that
was liquefying itself

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.700
becomes billiard ball hard.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.990
This is what Veronica, who
brought the cucumber up

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.380
to the surface, wanted
to show the students.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.650
Now by the time she
decided to demonstrate

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.730
the properties mutable
connective tissue,

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.660
the animal had been
passed around the students

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.670
and was now resting on the
hands of a student named Anoop.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.539
And Anoop was game, but he
wasn't quite as comfortable

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.570
in the water as all
the other students.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.929
So he was holding
this creature and just

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:41.280
barely managing to keep
his chin above water

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.539
at the moment the Veronica
decides that she's

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.460
going to show us what mutable
connective tissue can do.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.570
"At the moment, the
most pressing mystery

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.880
is why Veronica would
take Anoop, of all people,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.510
as her volunteer
for a magic trick

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.890
with mutable connective tissue.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.440
Given that we will try this only
once in our two-week course,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.940
I don't see why she
would make Anoop

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.190
the one whose nerves
will be tested.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.690
Does she think his
excitability will

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.225
enhance the shock
of transformation?

00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:15.220
Or has she really
put him on my watch,

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.110
allowing herself to
forget her own warnings?

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:20.410
In any case, when she places
her snorkel in her mouth

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.540
and puts her face in
the water, all of us

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.380
follow suit, except Anoop.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.620
With the animal stranded
on his trembling hands,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.110
he is unable to
replace his snorkel

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.960
and is left alone above
water while everyone

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.730
watches his hands below.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:37.730
Through my
half-submerged mask, I

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.250
keep a watchful eye
on Anoop's face.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.030
At first he looks
somewhat resigned,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.380
like a surgical patient
separated from the doctor's

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.170
work by a curtain
across his chest.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.310
But a second later, he whips
his head suddenly to the side,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.310
trying to catch his snorkel's
mouthpiece with his teeth.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.030
He makes three such
lunges, each of them

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.150
unsuccessful, before he gives
up, takes a deep breath,

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.090
and submerges his face, just
in time to see Veronica's index

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.090
finger pressing on
the animal's back.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.180
The creature
compresses instantly,

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.090
but Anoop holds steady.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.736
Veronica places Cameron's
hand on the frozen animal,

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:13.110
and the other
students, too, feel

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.910
the hardness of
cross-linked collagen.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.050
As Anoop watches their hands
reaching in to investigate,

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.980
his cheeks begin to
swell with the pressure

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.590
of unexhaled breath.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.090
And just when it appears
they might burst open,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.440
admitting a gasp of seawater,
Allie reaches across our circle

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.922
and places Anoop's
snorkel in his mouth.

00:10:30.922 --> 00:10:32.380
Through his glinting
mask, he seems

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.580
to look gratefully at her.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.000
Veronica begins to
rub the animal's back,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.640
and at first, it
appears to relax.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.410
But then something goes wrong.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.470
The creature skips
liquefaction and moves

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.510
straight to more
drastic measures,

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.880
the last line of defense.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.470
Because an echinoderm's
nervous system speaks directly

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.790
to those special cells embedded
in the collagen matrix,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.050
telling them when to release
their potent catalyst

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.860
of change, the animal
can freeze or liquefy

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.310
whichever piece of
tissue it needs to.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.360
This is how a brittle
star caught by the arm

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.960
can throw off the entire
limb, leaving it behind

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.280
like the detached
tail of a lizard.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.810
It simply liquefies the
narrow segment of tissue

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.600
that connects the arm
to the central disk.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.510
And when a cucumber
is under attack,

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.060
it resorts to an even
more radical tactic.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.320
It swiftly disassembles
the collagen cables

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.240
that holds its organs, violently
contracts its entire body wall,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.490
and shoots its
viscera out its anus.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.010
One can imagine that even the
most menacing predator might

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.090
be taken aback by such a move.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.040
And even if it weren't,
it might at least

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.630
be tricked into pursuing the
evacuated innards instead

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.900
of the now hollow cucumber.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.670
Taking a bite of
floating viscera,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.670
the predator would quickly
learn that the animal

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.960
is laced with a powerful toxin.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.440
The hollowed cucumber,
meanwhile, would have moved on

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.400
and would later regenerate from
stem cells and its empty body

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.050
cavity a complete set
of internal organs.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.230
But if evisceration might
distract a menacing predator,

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.610
just think what it
could do to Anoop.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.060
When the dark purple organs
explode from the animal's

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.760
posterior, he
startles and flails,

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.710
attempting to back away quickly.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:09.150
The guts purl and twist
in his turbulence,

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.180
forming a kinetic design of
dark ribbons, diffusing colors,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.350
and loose, round forms at
the center of our circle.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.380
From the bottom of
this turning mobile,

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.050
the cucumber body sinks
toward the sea floor."

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.970
So later that same
day, I was sitting

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.780
on the terrace of the
Vermilion Sea Field Station.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.250
And those same
five students were

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.201
gathered at the other
edge of the terrace,

00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:42.450
and they were reliving their
moment with the cucumber.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.010
Anoop was reenacting
the whole thing,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.990
and they were all laughing.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.650
In a moment in which
they fell silent,

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.160
Cameron, the blind young
man, turned in my direction

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.260
and yelled, hey, why doesn't
something just eat that thing?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.430
And I didn't know how
he knew I was there,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:02.120
but I picked up my chair and
walked over and sat with them.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.130
And for the next
two hours or so,

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.290
we just talked about
the sea cucumber.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:11.170
We talked first about
holothurin, that toxin

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.200
that I mentioned,
lacing the animal

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.340
and how it's now serving as a
model for chemotherapy drugs.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:22.550
And we talked about the East
Asian market for cucumber.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.860
There's a large fishery
for cucumbers, actually.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.490
And then eventually,
the cucumber

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:30.870
led us into pretty deep
evolutionary questions

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.490
about recapitulation, the
idea that the development

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.780
of an individual
organism recapitulates

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.290
the forms of that organism's
ancestor through time,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.120
from ancient ancestor
to present animal.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.940
So without getting into
any of those conversations,

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.120
I want to take a
step back and observe

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.690
what was happening there,
because that's really

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.430
what the book is about.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.970
What was happening
there, I think,

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.550
is that we had taken an
animal as the starting

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:01.800
point for storytelling.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.500
And we allowed ourselves
to be digressive.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.364
We talked about its poisons.

00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:09.530
We talked about its markets.

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.770
We talked about its
evolution and its ecology.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.290
And at the end of that
long conversation,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:19.760
there was another pause
in which Cameron summed up

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.880
what had happened in
that conversation.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.230
He was a surfer.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.330
He was from Santa Barbara,
so he talked like a surfer.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.880
And he said in
that moment, do you

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.320
realize that this entire
gnarly conversation started

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.780
with that knobby thing
that puked on Anoop?

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.260
And it sounds funny,
but it's stuck with me.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.950
And the reason it
stuck with me is

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.780
that it struck me
as the solution

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.820
to a problem, the answer
to a question that

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.770
has occurred to me often
in many different places,

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.710
certainly in Bahia
de los Angeles.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.010
Here's the question.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:05.290
Why are we such dismal
stewards of the natural world?

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.260
Why is it that place after
place, sea after sea,

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.910
landscape after landscape,
we over-fish the sea,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.030
deforest the
landscape to an extent

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.220
that it's very difficult
to bring it back?

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.660
What is it about
us that makes us

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.650
so bad at taking care
of the natural world?

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:30.800
And I think there
were two deeper

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.730
answers to this question.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:40.330
And Cameron's funny line
is a part of a solution.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.080
The first answer,
I think, is that we

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.260
have a problem of memory.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:50.320
We actually don't remember what
those seas or landscapes looked

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960
like long ago.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:58.080
And lacking a vivid
memory of their grandeur,

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.340
we also are without a
motivation to restore them

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.550
to their former state.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.820
I can illustrate
this with the sea

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.040
cucumber, this
problem of memory.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:14.470
The first time I was in
the Sea of Cortez, Veronica

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.890
brought the same animal, a sea
cucumber, up for us to look at.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:19.710
And I'd never seen
a big one before.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:24.560
I'd been diving a lot but
never seen this exotic animal.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:31.200
And so I took it as a sign
of the bay's richness.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.750
I suspected, ah, I've
never seen this thing

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.920
before anywhere else.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.260
That must mean that this
bay, where we are right now,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.290
is relatively untouched.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.990
In fact, as I learned
later, I could have taken it

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.790
as a testament to the extent to
which the bay has been scoured.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.590
Veronica explained that
the year before, a couple

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.900
years before, she'd been
sitting on that same terrace

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.120
and had watched as boat after
boat returned across the bay,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.790
piled high with
brown sea cucumbers.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.350
And that one season
of extraction

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.990
changed the Bay of LA from a
place where sea cucumbers could

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.890
be found about one every square
meter or so to a place where

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.430
finding one was a special
occasion, an occasion

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.960
to gather the students and talk
about this strange creature.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.210
The point is that I
misread that moment.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.650
Lacking a memory of a bay
rich with sea cucumbers,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.920
it didn't occur to me that
in fact what I was seeing

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.890
was a small remnant of
what was once there.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.010
And you could say
that's because I'm not

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.140
local to Bahia de los
Angeles, which I'm not.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.360
But also, there's
an entire generation

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.110
of inhabitants of Bahia do Los
Angeles who also have never

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.540
seen a rocky reef rich
with sea cucumbers.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.790
For them, too, this is
the state of nature.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.260
And in fact, for
each generation,

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.940
there is a new state of nature.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.120
Each of us takes the wildest
place we've ever seen

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.794
and thinks of it as wilderness.

00:17:56.794 --> 00:17:58.710
The place we saw in our
childhood or the place

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.126
we saw on that
nature documentary,

00:18:00.126 --> 00:18:03.350
we think, ah, now
that is really nature.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.210
But we're wrong.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.980
That's not really nature.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:11.000
In fact, nature was something
much richer than that.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.530
Fisheries managers refer to the
problem of a shifting baseline,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:18.875
which means that each
generation of fishery manager

00:18:18.875 --> 00:18:24.060
has his own baseline expectation
of what the sea can yield.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.770
But because each generation
inherits a slightly

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.740
degraded sea,
there's this process

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.815
of generational decay
in our idea of the sea.

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:38.440
You could also say, well, maybe
it's just because that sea

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.830
cucumber is an
ugly little thing,

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.890
and who's really going
to notice its absence?

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:48.650
But when I started looking
into this as a problem,

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.870
it was clear that
the same phenomenon

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.700
of drifting expectations
had occurred

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.480
with every other charismatic
creature I could find.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.100
Around the Sea of
Cortez, there's

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.270
a correlation between the age
of a fisherman and his estimate

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:10.050
of how large a fish can grow for
any number of species of fish.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.210
So for example, if you ask
a 70-year-old fisherman,

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.550
how big does a yellow tail get?

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.710
The answer is, 4
and 1/2, 5 feet.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.170
If you ask a
30-year-old fisherman,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.990
the answer is 3 and 1/2, 4 feet.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.300
And it's not, what's the
biggest one you've ever seen?

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.120
It's, how big can they get?

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.780
There's a different idea
of what the sea can do.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:36.000
Or another example-- the word
mantarraya Older fishermen

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.450
use the word mantarraya to
refer to Manta birostris, which

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.330
is an animal that grows
to about 25 feet across.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.270
You know what a
manta ray looks like.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.190
It's that thing with
the big black wings

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:51.950
and the long stingray tail.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.930
Mantarraya, to an older
fisherman, is that animal,

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:55.920
Manta birostris.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.530
To a younger person in
Bahia de los Angeles,

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.180
mantarraya actually refers to
a different set of species,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.820
because they've never
seen Manta birostris.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.440
They've seen much
smaller species

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.090
that are about 4
or 5 feet across,

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.310
members of the genus Mobula.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.724
For them, mantarraya means that.

00:20:10.724 --> 00:20:12.390
The older fisherman
has a different word

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.810
for that thing,
the smaller thing.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.230
But that word isn't used
by the younger people.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.153
So even the language
has changed.

00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:24.430
The word mantarraya now
signifies something smaller

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.960
than what it used to signify.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.240
It's not always something
disappearing or shrinking.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.000
Sometimes it's actually
something arriving.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.220
So the biggest fishery
in the Sea of Cortez

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:39.170
right now is the Humboldt squid.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.930
It's about a 4-foot
animal that looks

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:45.260
like the calamari you
eat, but it's huge.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.720
And that animal didn't show
up in the Sea of Cortez

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:55.130
until about 1974,
when fishermen removed

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.470
so many large fish,
predatory fish like tuna,

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:04.180
yellowtail-- which is what you
think of as hamachi-- mackerel,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.430
they took out so many of
those that the Humboldt squid

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.080
moved in as the new
dominant predator.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.940
And there it has
stayed ever since.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:18.210
So for anyone under the age of
30 or 40 in the Sea of Cortez,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.350
the sea of Cortez is
full of Humboldt squid.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.140
They don't remember
a Sea of Cortez

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.180
that was instead
full of large fish.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.700
So why did Cameron's
line strike me

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.740
as a solution to this problem?

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:45.300
When you take a
creature as the starting

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.170
point for your
storytelling and you

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.080
allow yourself to be
digressive, you nearly

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.690
automatically begin
to reconstruct

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.050
a vision of what the
ecosystem once was.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:08.700
The reason it happens is
that the stories essentially

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.820
serve to connect one
creature to another.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.040
And as you follow
them outwards, you

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:23.640
come to something that's now
missing in the Sea of Cortez.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.321
There's an interesting
metaphor for this,

00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:29.940
these kind of
connections, for which I'd

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.510
like to turn to Henry
David Thoreau, actually.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:41.390
So this is Thoreau.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.420
"I take infinite pains to
know all the phenomenon

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.000
of the spring, thinking that
I have here the entire poem.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.490
And then, to my
chagrin, I hear that it

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.090
is but an imperfect copy
that I possess and have read,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.330
that my ancestors
had torn out many

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.350
of the first leaves
and grandest passages

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.190
and mutilated it in many places.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:10.910
I should not like to think
that some demi-god had come

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.540
before me and picked out
some of the best stars.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:19.002
I wish to know an entire
heaven and an entire earth."

00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:22.430
I'm going to just keep
reading for a moment.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.130
"Over the past 10
years on the bay,

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.560
I have tried to gather up
scraps torn from the poem.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.360
I've collected them from
Veronica; from her mentor,

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.520
Lane; from the
turtle man, Antonio;

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.480
from the wandering drama critic,
Krutch; and from many others.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.950
With my hands full of
ragged bits and scraps,

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.350
I might be inclined to
believe that the bay has been

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.310
more severely rifled,
more drastically abridged

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.320
than other places
I've lived or visited.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.730
But the opposite is true.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:54.020
In the bay, many passages
were lost so recently

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.240
that people I knew
could recite them.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.690
And the poem, pared and
slashed though it was,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:01.410
remain sufficiently coherent
to betray certain gaps.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.810
In other places I've been,
so much was lost and lost

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.690
so long ago that
there are hardly

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.750
reminders of the
poem's former content.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:13.760
Who on the Eastern
seaboard is struck

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.120
by the absence of migrating gray
whales or nesting sea turtles

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.990
or playful and clever sea
mink or river-frothing runs

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.710
of salmon and eel?

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:27.160
Yet they were all there and
there in great abundance.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.000
We live amid the
wreckage, yet we hardly

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.630
notice that something
has changed."

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.300
When we were sitting
there on the terrace,

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.590
talking about the
sea cucumber, we

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:44.660
were reciting the extended
poem of Isostichopus fuscus,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.960
the brown sea cucumber.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.610
And when you do that, you follow
those digressive tales and run

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:57.860
into the tears in the fabric,
the ecological fabric.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.230
Or to take Thoreau's
metaphor, imagine

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.400
you're looking at the sky, and
you see the Big Dipper there.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.540
But one star is missing.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.710
You notice.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.210
If you're looking
at the Big Dipper,

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:12.840
and that star that's at the
front of the little ladle

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.380
is gone, you're going to notice.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.590
You wouldn't notice if any other
star was taken out of the sky,

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:22.440
because you don't have the shape
to give you an expectation.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.560
Stories about animals
are like that.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.640
You follow them from
one species to another

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.800
to another to another.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.841
And when you come to a
place where one should be,

00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:32.090
you notice that it's missing.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.870
I'll give you an example.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:38.400
So that manta ray,
when I started

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.330
looking in the history
of the manta ray

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:42.310
in Bahia de los
Angeles, the first place

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:48.530
I found records was in writings
from the pearl industry.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.730
In the 16th and
17th century, there

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.240
was a thriving pearl industry
in the Sea of Cortez.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.445
They thought that the manta ray
was the most dangerous predator

00:25:58.445 --> 00:26:00.180
of pearl divers.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.900
They thought that manta rays
would hover above the diver,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.400
and when the diver
came up, he would

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.260
envelop them and devour him.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.245
The manta ray actually
eats plankton.

00:26:09.245 --> 00:26:10.440
It's a filter feeder.

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.540
So it was a strange tale
that they'd come up with.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.310
But nonetheless, whenever
they saw one, they killed it.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.420
Reading this tale, the
first thing you think

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.620
is, hmm, strange idea.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.550
The second thing you
think is, pearl industry?

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.800
There's no pearl industry
in the Sea of Cortez.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.270
But in fact, the entire
coastline of the Sea of Cortez

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.830
was formerly covered in
thick reefs of pearl oysters.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.132
Now there are lovely
beaches and rocky reefs

00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:43.090
because the pearl oysters
have all been removed

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.020
and were removed by
about 1750 or so.

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.470
So there's no memory of them.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:49.875
But if you start thinking
about the manta ray

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:51.416
and what happened
to it, you run into

00:26:51.416 --> 00:26:54.010
a couple different exotic
species of pearl oyster--

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.310
the rainbow pearl oyster,
the black pearl oyster.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.210
So continuing forward
with the manta ray,

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.850
after the pearl
industry collapsed,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.520
the main danger to the
manta ray were fishing boats

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.920
because fishing boats,
if they saw one,

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.890
they'd try to kill
a 25-foot animal

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.870
because it was a
lot of free meat.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.610
They'd harpoon it.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:17.490
But a harpoon, what is a fishing
boat doing with a harpoon?

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:19.450
Fishing boats today
in the Sea of Cortez

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.680
have small fish traps
and fine-gauge gill nets.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.690
Fishing boats carried
harpoons because they

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.810
were looking for
turtles, sea turtles.

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.850
There were four
species of sea turtle.

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:36.850
You never see them anymore
in the Sea of Cortez.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:39.440
They're all four
endangered species.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.460
Now the greatest threat
for the manta ray

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.650
are the drift nets which
are placed for billfish

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.800
like marlin, but
they also take out

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.580
several different
species of shark.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.430
So you see how you can
start with one animal

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.224
and tell its stories,
and inevitably, you

00:27:57.224 --> 00:27:59.390
encounter the other things
that are gone-- the pearl

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.990
oysters, the four species
of sea turtles, the sharks.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:07.890
The reason this happens,
for you network theorists,

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.560
is that the ecosystem
is highly connective.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.290
It's a small world
topology, essentially.

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.040
When you start talking
about one creature,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.870
the ecological or
historical relationships

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.110
are so reticulate that
they're going to lead you out

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.860
across the entire network.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.430
And that's why the
process of storytelling

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:29.850
restores to you
almost inevitably

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.610
a sense of what
the sea once was.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:40.860
And the hope, of course, is that
if that vision is compelling,

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.210
we'll find a new motivation
for making our way back there.

00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:52.980
Of course, the process can also
kindle some dismay and even

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.830
despair.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.480
But here, too, I think Cameron's
observation can help us

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.390
because what are we doing
when we're situating

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:07.520
an animal in its network, in its
ecological or historical web?

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.260
We're really finding the
meaning of that animal.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.530
We're recovering a sense of that
creature's meaning and value,

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.840
because what is meaning but
a connection between one

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.140
entity and many others?

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:21.390
What's meaning in a language?

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:22.660
What's the meaning of a word?

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.840
It's the connection, the
relationships between that word

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.944
and many other words.

00:29:26.944 --> 00:29:28.360
Or what's meaning
in a human life?

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.480
It's the connections
between an individual

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.890
and larger entities
or other individuals.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.025
In the same way, the meaning
or value of a creature

00:29:36.025 --> 00:29:39.090
is apparent when you situate it
in its ecological or historical

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.340
context.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.920
A brown sea cucumber sitting
on the bottom of the ocean

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.735
is not an obviously valuable
or meaningful entity.

00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.110
But when it comes
to the surface,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.940
and you start talking about the
various ways in which it makes

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:57.040
sense, the various functions
it serves, the ways it works,

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:02.230
suddenly it becomes a
really valuable creature.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.160
And I think that
process can help

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.110
us reconcile two
visions of nature that

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.660
have been in play here.

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:18.220
On the one hand, the nature that
has grandeur, the 25-foot manta

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.170
ray, the sea turtles.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.520
On the other hand,
the clear sense

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.150
that this is a
degraded natural world.

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.980
How do we hold those together?

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.870
One way we can
hold them together

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:33.110
is through this process
of digressive storytelling

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:38.540
which compels us to face nature
as we contend with it today

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.350
but allows us to hold in mind,
at the same time, a sense

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.350
of what the natural
world could be.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:49.330
And I want to close
with a reading that

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.210
speaks to that difficulty.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.530
"One evening, I thought
I'd search the internet

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.730
for reports of
mantas in the bay.

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.240
I entered the words manta
ray, Bahia de los Angeles.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.040
And when I pressed Return,
I received several pages

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.610
of links.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.290
For a moment, I
thought the manta

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.140
might be faring better
than I'd believed.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.120
But as I began clicking
through, glancing at snapshots,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.070
reading a line or
two, it became clear

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.330
that all the reports
were of leaping mobula.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:33.030
None actually involved
Manta birostris.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.900
Most of the photos,
however, bore

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.470
captions that identified the
flying creatures as manta rays.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.340
What was in the process of
happening in Bahia to the word

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.060
mantarraya had already happened
on the internet with the term

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.810
manta ray.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.800
And this struck me as
a very vivid instance

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.750
of the quiet, stepwise
change in our idea of nature.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:59.220
The name of a huge species had
been bequeathed to a small one.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.190
Alongside some of
the mislabeled photos

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:05.120
of Mobula munkiana were accounts
of nice trips people had taken.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.210
Here are some excerpts.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.590
'It's not easy to reach
but worth the journey,

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.540
especially for those who value
unspoiled nature more than

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:18.240
a mint on the pillow.' 'If Baja
is one of North America's last

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:22.300
great wildernesses, then LA
Bay is Baja's crown jewel

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.410
of untouched beauty.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:29.710
Civilization hasn't
changed the place much.'

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.940
We go in search of
wilderness, and so it

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.720
is wilderness we find.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.870
And we write home about it.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.780
We tell the story of our
rediscovery of nature.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.410
We compose suitably
lyrical prose.

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:45.500
We send back photos, and their
iconography is just right.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.620
We hold up the large
fish we've just caught.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.790
We recline on a
white, sandy beach.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.010
A winged ray leaps
from the water.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.940
These are our dispatches
from the wilderness.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.260
But when those snapshots
are held up against images

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.660
from the past,
something is a bit off.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:02.690
Our fish is rather small.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.970
Or maybe it's not a fish at all
but rather an enormous squid.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.380
That beach is hardly pristine.

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.000
In fact, before the
oysters were removed,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.940
it was not a beach at all.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:18.090
And that ray, it is 2 and
1/2 feet across, not 25.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.760
I, too, am awestruck by
the monstrous squid, lured

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.970
by the beach, thrilled
by the leaping ray,

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.470
but how can we reconcile
our sincere wonderment

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.330
in the face of
what natural worlds

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:31.030
we still have with
our recognition

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.150
that what we are seeing
is miserably dilapidated?

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.840
On the one hand, a skein
of rays, and on the other,

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.890
the likelihood that
they are but fry.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.920
We must be careful, I
think, to hold on to both,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.430
not to let one wash
away the other.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.910
For if we permit ourselves
to indulge too thoroughly

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.910
in wonderment, we
will forget where

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.614
we are on this long
stairway downward.

00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:54.030
But if we let our
sense of history

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.110
overwhelm our
wonderment, leaving us

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.690
with nothing but blase weariness
of the unimpressive present,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.170
then we won't much
care where we are.

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:04.600
What we must do,
perhaps, is cultivate

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.290
our craft of seeing more
than one thing at the time."

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:09.400
Thank you.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:15.675
AARON HIRSH: Happy to
take any questions.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.501
Greg?

00:34:22.501 --> 00:34:23.875
AUDIENCE: Are
there any solutions

00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:27.020
to the jellyfish problem
that you could talk about?

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.185
AARON HIRSH: Just so you
can hear the question,

00:34:36.185 --> 00:34:38.060
are there solutions to
the jellyfish problem?

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.790
The jellyfish problem
that he's talking about

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.100
is something I've
talked about before.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:48.060
It's this phenomenon
that, as we fish our way

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.699
down the marine food web,
starting with the big fish--

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:52.780
we take out the big fish.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.310
Then we take out
the little fish--

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.960
and again and
again, it seems what

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.750
replaces those
species are jellyfish.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.080
And it's happened in a number
of different ecosystems.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.820
It happened off the
coast of Namibia,

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.720
in the most productive
water in the world.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.520
And it has happened recently
in the Sea of Japan, also

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.570
a big fishery, that
the ecosystem is now

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.790
dominated by large jellyfish.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.010
Which is a problem
because jellyfish,

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.850
although they are
eaten in East Asia,

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.510
they don't bring the
same price for fishermen

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:28.560
that the predatory fish do.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:35.600
Solutions for it-- one thing
that we need to try first

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.360
is just to stop
fishing for everything

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.160
else, for the large fish,
for a brief period of time.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.670
We haven't been able, even in
fisheries that have collapsed,

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:52.910
to stop altogether to see if
the ecosystem might rebound.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:58.340
So we don't actually know if
the jellyfish are maintaining

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.260
their own stable
place in the ecosystem

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.330
by eating the young
of everything else

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.705
or if we just leave the
ecosystem alone maybe

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:08.080
everything else will come back
and replace the jellyfish.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.500
So that's the
first thing to try.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.660
There are a lot of managerial
challenges to that, which

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:18.290
I talked about a bit last night,
but that's the first thing.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.420
The second thing, which
would be more radical,

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.750
is to actually try to manipulate
the ecosystem actively,

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.700
to engage in
biomanipulation, which

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:31.360
would mean to try to fish
the jellyfish intensely

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.990
and even possibly to fish, at
the same time-- after we've

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.050
let them rebound and seen
that it doesn't work,

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:40.590
if it doesn't
work-- even to fish

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.384
at the same time some of
the large predatory fish

00:36:43.384 --> 00:36:45.300
to see if you can bring
back the forage fish--

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.430
the sardines, the herring, the
anchovy, that kind of thing.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:50.970
You could try to
manipulate the ecosystem,

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.260
but this is a high-stakes
game because it

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.954
can go terribly wrong.

00:36:55.954 --> 00:36:57.870
Off the coast of Namibia,
there was an attempt

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.430
at biomanipulation
to fish anchovies

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:02.430
hard to let sardines
bounce back,

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.340
and it backfired terribly.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.660
And we are left with the richest
water in the world now occupied

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:14.400
by jellyfish and bearded gobies
in a stinking hydrogen sulfide

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.360
swamp.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.200
So biomanipulation
can backfire badly.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.980
But in places where
we've tried other things

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.780
and the stakes are really
high, the potential rewards

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.840
are really high, it might
be worth investigating.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:29.635
Other questions?

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:34.900
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thanks for being here,

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.580
and those are great readings.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:41.850
In particular, so we talked a
lot about what's to be mourned

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:43.030
and the downsides.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:46.330
So I'm wondering, are
there any good results

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:50.240
of these ecosystems being
drastically changed?

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.914
Are there any bright lights
or anything to be happy about?

00:37:53.914 --> 00:37:55.830
AARON HIRSH: About the
transformed ecosystems?

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.553
AARON HIRSH: That's a
really interesting question,

00:37:58.553 --> 00:38:04.960
and it presents us with a tough
decision to make as a society.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.170
So yes, there are places where
the transformed ecosystem

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.920
can be really
valuable to people.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.840
And the most familiar
one is off the coast

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.700
of Eastern Canada,
Nova Scotia, that area.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.290
So you've probably heard
of the collapse of cod.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:24.510
There are books about cod and
what an incredibly important

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:27.030
fishery it was for
hundred of years.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.820
And then it collapsed once
and for all in the '80s.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.870
That was devastating for a
lot of fishing communities

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:36.420
on the coast of Canada.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:40.340
But a decade later,
in the absence

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:44.150
of those large, predatory
cod, the populations

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:48.720
of shrimp and crab began
to expand enormously.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.080
And now, the value of the
fishery for shrimp and crab

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.740
is greater not just than the
value of the fishery for cod.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.430
It's greater than the
value of the fishery of cod

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:02.760
formerly was at its height.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.600
So now, actually,
that cod are beginning

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.950
to come back thanks
to protection,

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.390
there's a real dilemma.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:18.610
Do we manage to let cod back,
or do we manage to keep cod out?

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.960
There are many fishermen who
think this would be a bad idea

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.625
to reintroduce cod
to the ecosystem.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.230
Something I talked
about last night

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:35.510
was the possibility of
privatizing ecosystems,

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.840
essentially turning
the ecosystem over

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.330
to local fishermen to give
the local fisherman a chance

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.350
to manage it.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.280
In that case, with the
assistance of managers,

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.580
the fishermen can decide what
is it that we want to fish for?

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.370
What is it that we want to
draw from this ecosystem?

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:59.260
And I think their long-term
interest will probably

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.580
serve the ecosystem
well because they

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.590
will want to sustain an income
from as many different species

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:07.610
as they can.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.900
If you can have, to some extent,
income from shrimp and income

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.560
from cod, you're not only
going to make a lot of money.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.450
You're going to have a
diversified portfolio, which

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.180
is appealing for other reasons.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.240
That is, it's not as volatile
as a portfolio consisting

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.510
of one stock or one fish stock.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.020
Other questions?

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.050
Great, thank you very much.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:34.883
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:34.883 --> 00:40:39.200
