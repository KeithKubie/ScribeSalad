00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.129
Come with me, children, to a magical island
full of deadly snakes! Wait, that's a terrible

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.469
idea. Do not follow me.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.469
Anthony here for DNews. When I was a kid I
used to read comics and books and watch old

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.000
movies that were all about setting foot on
a weird, uncharted island where animals had

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.760
their own advanced society.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.660
No, I'm not about to tell you there's an island
of Ape Scientists out there.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.399
And I'm sorry for that.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.210
But there are a lot of islands that do have
a magical, overrun by animals vibe- from the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.890
scary to the adorable to the weird.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.109
Like Japan's Cat Island, Tashiro-jima. It's
a small fishing island off the coast of Ishinomaki

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.809
City that's home to about 100 people- and
way, way, way more stray cats. There's no

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.609
official population count, but thanks to a
local belief that feeding strays is good luck,

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.339
the cat population keeps growing.

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.400
Cat Island loves their cat population so much
that there's a shrine to them in the center

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.950
of the Island and tons of cat shaped buildings.
There are no pet dogs and they're pretty much

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.450
banned from being on the island at all.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.700
While the cat population is growing, the human
one's falling- 83% of the people on Tashiro-jima

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.830
are elderly, with 50% of them being over 65.
They were also hit very hard by the 2011 tsunami.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.980
Which means eventually, the island's going
to be cats only.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.730
Then there's Christmas Island, which is a
territory of Australia and the only home in

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.190
the world to the Christmas Red Crab. They're
interesting because they can't swim- they

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.740
live entirely on land underground, away from
the seashore. But their young can only live

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.820
in water- so every year during monsoon season,
they make a long migration out of the rainforest

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.270
to the ocean- ALL 120 MILLION OF THEM.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.190
They go in a completely straight line, following
these ancient migratory paths- they go right

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.880
through towns and roads. THEY DO NOT CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING. About a million of them die

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.740
in traffic every year but they're just like
"Whatever, I just laid 100,000 eggs. Deal

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.460
with it."

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.550
And if you live on Christmas Island, that
is exactly what you do. You just sort of avoid

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.440
them and step through them the best you can.
So ridiculous.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.510
And finally, beware the deadly Snake Island.
Ilha de Queimada Grande- a 110 acre island

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.899
of the coast of Sao Paolo, Brazil. It's the
only home in the world of the Golden Lancehead

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.969
Viper, which is a species of pit viper.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.900
And it's a deadly, mean-tempered sucker.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.249
The effects of its venom are swelling, local
pain, nausea, vomiting, blood blisters, bruising,

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.049
blood in your vomit and urine, intestinal
bleeding... etc etc. You get it.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.379
It's so deadly that the Brazilian navy won't
let anyone land on the island. There are anywhere

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:29.379
from 2000 and 4000 Golden Lanceheads just
lying in wait- which actually makes them endangered.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.909
Due to inbreeding, wildfires, and illegal
animal poaching and trading, these guys are

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:37.810
dying out.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.859
Okay, choose your own adventure time. You
can vacation on one magical animal island.

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.859
Which do you choose? I go christmas island-
I'll take weird over cute or deadly any day

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.319
of the week.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.269
Hey, by the way, we've been doing this for
about two months now and we just wanted to

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.499
