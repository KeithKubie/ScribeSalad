00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.392
Now, the first way I thought of solving this problem, or just simplifying the

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:06.512
left hand side rather, was to go through and multiply every term from the first

00:00:06.512 --> 00:00:11.619
set of parentheses by every term in this second set of the brackets. But that

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.153
way, we end up this really, really long polynomial, and it does reduce, but

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:19.526
it's not very pretty. So, I'm going to show you a different way of thinking

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:23.674
about this multiplication. We can start off by distributing this negative sign

00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:27.779
to each of the terms inside this inner set of parentheses. We can do this for

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.914
both of the sets of brackets. Now, this is pretty interesting. You see that we

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:35.677
have x minus 2 here, and x minus 2 here. Why if we see if we can just consider

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:39.664
those as a unit, and see what happens. At this point, we can recognize that

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:44.150
we're going to end up with a difference of two squares as our final polynomial.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.610
Let's see that happen. Since we have an x minus 2 in both of these expressions,

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.322
and then opposite signs of negative 3i and positive 3i here, we end up with x

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:59.264
minus 2 squared plus 9. Notice I've already multiplied the i's together and

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:03.885
switched the sign. Multiplying out this square and adding the 9 gives us a

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:09.762
final polynomial of x squared minus 4x plus 13 equals 0. And this is a pretty

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:13.654
cool trick, definitely saved a lot of space and a lot of writing for me. And,

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:16.643
you know, I always love ways to be a little bit more lazy with my math.
