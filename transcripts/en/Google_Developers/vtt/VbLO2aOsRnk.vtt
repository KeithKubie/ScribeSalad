FRED SAUER: So the App Engine
documentation is incomplete.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.510
For example, the NDB docs, so
NDB is a Python library for

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.630
the data store, remain
minimal and early

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.140
document possible errors.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.830
Anything you can do about this,
or is there other places

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.790
they should be looking?

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.430
MANDY WAITE: I guess really, one
of the standard answers to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.160
this is to go to
Stack Overflow.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.620
You're going to find
documentation--

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.170
you hear people talking about
things that are undocumented

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.045
or not so well documented,
providing examples and such

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:31.650
like in Stack Overflow.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.908
Pretty much everything anybody
has tried to do is going to be

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.290
documented on Stack Overflow.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.340
Things that have worked and
things that haven't worked.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190
So you can probably find
good answers there.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.610
If you want to contribute
information as well, Stack

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.200
Overflow is not just for
questions, it's also for

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.660
sharing information as well.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.232
So if you actually have some
useful information, so

00:00:48.232 --> 00:00:50.030
something you've written
about, something you've

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.970
documented, you can share that
on Stock Overflow as well.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.520
And that would be a good
place to put it.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.270
And it also stops it from
being spread around

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.610
everywhere.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.176
I mean we have multiple places
where people go to find

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:00.100
different documentations.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.830
So that kind of ad-hoc
documentation is really

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.770
probably the best place
in Stack Overflow.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.370
FRED SAUER: I think of the App
Engine core documentation as

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.810
the reference material,
the baseline.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.190
Sometimes there is Javadoc or
Pydoc to the methods that may

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.120
help a little bit further.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.550
But some of these--

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.520
like how do I use these
specifically?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.580
Stack Overflow is a
great place to go.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.880
And we do sometimes, if we find
that there's a lot of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.840
questions around a particular
area in Stack Overflow, we do

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.950
go in and update the
documentation and maybe add

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.580
some clarification.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.350
So that's definitely a
place to contribute.
