00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
The factors of this polynomial function are each of these expressions that are

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:09.154
multiplied together. X minus 2, x plus 7 and x minus 1. The x coordinates and

00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:13.306
the x intercepts are the numbers we get if we set each of these factors to 0.

00:00:13.306 --> 00:00:18.402
2, negative 7 and 1. These are also the numbers that are the zeros. But what

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:22.470
does all this information mean for us and mean for the graph of the function?

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.131
Well we'll figure that out pretty soon. You can start to think about it on your

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:26.289
own for now though.
