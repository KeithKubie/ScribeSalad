00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.650
Long before Descartes famously declared,
"I think, therefore I am,"

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.251
and long after that,

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.282
scientists and philosophers alike

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:19.095
have puzzled over what they call
the mind-body problem.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:23.562
Is the mind some separate, non-material
entity piloting a machine of flesh?

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:27.321
Or if it's just a particularly elusive part
of our physical body,

00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.323
how can it translate the input of our
animal senses

00:00:30.323 --> 00:00:34.771
into the seemingly non-physical
experiences that we call thoughts?

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.215
But though the answers have been
debated endlessly,

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:39.884
new research suggests that
part of the problem lies

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:42.549
in how we pose the question 
in the first place,

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:46.614
assuming a distinction between our
sensory perception and our ideas

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:48.872
that may not really be there.

00:00:48.872 --> 00:00:51.074
The traditional model of our mental
function

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:54.778
has been that the senses provide
separate data to our brain

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:58.725
which are then translated into the 
appropriate mental phenomena:

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:04.509
visual images into trees, auditory
experiences into bird songs, and so on.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.793
But occasionally, 
we have come across people

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:10.914
whose senses seem to mingle together,
allowing them to hear colors,

00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:12.771
or taste sounds.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.901
Until recently, the common understanding
was that this phenomenon,

00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.061
called synesthesia,

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.905
was a direct connection between the
parts of the brain

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:22.039
responsible for sensory stimuli such as

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.825
seeing the color yellow immediately
upon hearing the tone of b flat.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.095
But newer studies have 
shown that synesthesia

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:31.742
is actually mediated through our 
understanding

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:36.193
of the shapes, colors and sounds
that our senses apprehend.

00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:39.060
In order for the cross-sensory
experiences to occur,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.032
the higher level ideas and concepts
that our minds associate

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:46.060
with the sensory input must be activated.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.831
For example, this shape can be seen as
either the letter "s" or the number "5,"

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:54.525
and synesthetes associate each with 
different colors or sounds

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:56.437
based on how they interpret it

00:01:56.437 --> 00:02:00.615
despite the purely visual stimulus 
remaining identical.

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:04.484
In another study, synesthetes created
novel color associations

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:08.488
for unfamiliar letters after learning
what the letters were.

00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:12.433
So because it relies on a connection
between ideas and senses,

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.321
this mental phenomenon 
underlying synesthesia

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.187
is known as ideasthesia.

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:20.467
Synesthesia only occurs in some people,

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.179
although it may be more common
than previously thought.

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.890
But ideasthesia itself is a 
fundamental part of our lives.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.336
Virtually all of us recognize the color
red as warm and blue as cold.

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.920
Many would agree that bright colors,
italic letters and thin lines

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.066
are high-pitched,

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.439
while earth tones are low-pitched.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.348
And while many of these associations
are acquired through cultural exposure,

00:02:43.348 --> 00:02:47.241
others have been demonstrated even
in infants and apes,

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:51.021
suggesting that at least 
some associations are inborn.

00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.263
When asked to choose between two
possible names for these shapes,

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:57.480
people from entirely different cultural
and language backgrounds

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.976
overwhelmingly agree that "kiki"
is the spiky star,

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:03.654
while "bouba" is the rounded blob,

00:03:03.654 --> 00:03:06.875
both because of the sounds themselves
and the shapes our mouths make

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:08.050
to produce them.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.923
And this leads to even more
associations

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.069
within a rich semantic network.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.390
Kiki is described as nervous and clever,

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.896
while bouba is perceived as lazy and slow.

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:20.873
What all of this suggests is that our
everyday experiences

00:03:20.873 --> 00:03:25.889
of colors, sounds and other stimuli
do not live on separate sensory islands

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.627
but are organized in a 
network of associations

00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:30.837
similar to our language network.

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:33.102
This is what enables us to 
understand metaphors

00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:35.033
even though they make no logical sense,

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:38.244
such as the comparison of snow
to a white blanket,

00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:41.555
based on the shared sensations of
softness and lightness.

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:44.385
Ideasthesia may even be crucial to art,

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:48.196
which relies on a synthesis of
the conceptual and the emotional.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.023
In great art, idea and aesthesia
enhance each other,

00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:54.894
whether it's song lyrics combining
perfectly with a melody,

00:03:54.894 --> 00:03:56.690
the thematic content of a painting

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.058
heightened by its use of
colors and brushstrokes,

00:03:59.058 --> 00:04:01.135
or the well constructed plot of a novel

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:03.555
conveyed through perfectly 
crafted sentences.

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:07.968
Most importantly, the network of
associations formed by ideasethesia

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:10.731
may not only be similar to 
our linguistic network

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.457
but may, in fact, be an integral part of it.

00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:15.075
Rather than the traditional view,

00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:18.226
where our senses first capture 
a collection of colors and shapes,

00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:19.769
or some vibrations in the air,

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.884
and our mind then classifies them as a
tree or a siren,

00:04:22.884 --> 00:04:27.523
ideasthesia suggests that the two
processes occur simultaneously.

00:04:27.523 --> 00:04:32.526
Our sensory perceptions are shaped by
our conceptual understanding of the world.

00:04:32.526 --> 00:04:36.284
and the two are so connected that one
cannot exist without the other.

00:04:36.284 --> 00:04:39.777
If this model suggested 
by ideasthesia is accurate,

00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:42.311
it may have major implications
for some of the biggest

00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:46.578
scientific and philosophical issues
surrounding the study of mind.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:48.739
Without a preexisting concept of self,

00:04:48.739 --> 00:04:52.761
Descartes would not have had an "I"
to attribute the thinking to.

00:04:52.761 --> 00:04:56.856
And without a preexisting network of
interrelated and distinct concepts,

00:04:56.856 --> 00:05:00.969
our sensory experience of the world
would be an undifferentiated mass

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.751
rather than the discrete objects
we actually apprehend.

00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:08.232
For science, the task is to find where
this network lies,

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:11.950
how it is formed, and
how it interacts with external stimuli.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.572
For philosophy, 
the challenge is to rethink

00:05:14.572 --> 00:05:18.601
what this new model of consciousness means
for our understanding of our selves

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.107
and our relation to the world around us.
