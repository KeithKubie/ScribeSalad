00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:01.828
- [Voiceover] The first,
I guess you could say,

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:04.487
modern conception of an acid and base

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:06.634
comes from this gentleman right over here,

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:08.665
Svante Arrhenius, and he was actually

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:13.665
the third recipient of the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1903.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.228
And his definition of
acids, under his definition

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:20.607
of acids and bases, an acid
is something that increases

00:00:20.607 --> 00:00:23.186
the concentration, increases

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:29.106
the concentration, concentration

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.770
of Hydrogen protons,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.482
and we can say protons

00:00:37.648 --> 00:00:40.445
when put in an aqueous solution,

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:45.685
when in aqueous, aqueous solution,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:48.065
and that's just a water solution.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:51.083
And then you can imagine
what a base would be.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:52.369
You could think, oh
maybe a base is something

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:54.074
that decreases the protons and that's

00:00:54.074 --> 00:00:54.991
one way to think about it.

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.799
Or you could say, it decreases,

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:00.769
or actually let me
write this, it increases

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:07.730
the hydroxide concentration.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.277
It increases the hydroxide concentration.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.583
when put in aqueous solution.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:23.619
When in aqueous, aqueous solution.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.849
So let's make that concrete.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:27.159
Let's look at some examples.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.622
So a strong Arrhenius acid, and actually,

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.279
this would be a strong acid
by other definitions as well,

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.380
would be hydrochloric acid.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.983
Hydrochloric acid,

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:38.166
you put it in a an aqueous solution.

00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:40.220
So that's the hydrogen.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.681
You have the chlorine.

00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.745
You put it in an aqueous solution.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:47.978
You put it in an aqueous solution,

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:50.057
it will readily disassociate.

00:01:50.057 --> 00:01:51.775
This is a, this reaction occurs,

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:55.024
strongly favors moving
from the left to right.

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:58.565
You're going to have
the chlorine strip off

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:03.186
the two electrons in the
covalent bond with the hydrogen,

00:02:03.186 --> 00:02:05.310
leaving the hydrogen with no electrons,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.356
so the hydrogen is just going

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:09.454
to be left as a hydrogen proton.

00:02:09.454 --> 00:02:11.811
And then the chlorine,

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.191
the chlorine has just
nabbed that electron.

00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.548
It had the electrons it had
before, and then it just nabbed

00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:19.450
an electron from the
hydrogen, and so it now has

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.971
a negative charge, and these are

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:23.153
both in aqueous solution still.

00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:27.356
It's still, they're still
both dissolved in the water.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:28.935
And so you see very clearly here,

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:30.571
you put this in an aqueous solution,

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:33.532
you're going to increase the amount of,

00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.075
you're going to increase
the amount of hydrogen ions,

00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:38.397
the amount of protons in the solution.

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:39.844
And we've talked about this before,

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:42.235
you'll often see a
reaction written like this,

00:02:42.235 --> 00:02:44.414
but the hydrogen protons,
they just don't sit there

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.911
by themselves in the water.

00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:48.930
They are going to bond with the water

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.856
molecules to actually form hydronium.

00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:54.908
So another way that you'll
often see this is like this.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.184
You have the hydrochloric acid,

00:02:57.184 --> 00:02:59.366
hydrochloric acid.

00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:01.351
It's in an aqueous solution,

00:03:01.351 --> 00:03:04.126
just a fancy way of saying
it's dissolved in the water,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:07.632
and then you have the H2O.

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:09.188
You have the water molecules,

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:13.995
H2O, and you'll sometimes see written,

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.583
okay, it's in its liquid form,

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:19.195
and it's going to yield.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.714
Instead of just saying that
you have a hydrogen ion

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:24.165
right over here, you'll
say, "Okay, that thing,

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.138
"the hydrogen is actually gonna get bonded

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:27.822
"to a water molecule."

00:03:27.822 --> 00:03:29.083
And so what you're gonna be left with

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.249
is actually H3O.

00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:37.707
Now this thing, this was a water molecule,

00:03:37.707 --> 00:03:39.587
and all it got was a hydrogen ion.

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:41.049
All that is is a proton.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.988
It didn't come with any electrons,

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:46.029
so now this is going to
have a positive charge.

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.969
It's going to have a positive charge,

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.232
and we could now say
that this is going to be

00:03:50.232 --> 00:03:53.587
in an aqueous solution, hydronium

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:56.745
is going to be in an aqueous solution,

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:59.508
and you're going to have plus,

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:02.179
now you're going to still
have the chloride ion,

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:04.662
or it's a negative ion,
so we call it an anion.

00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:07.681
Chloride, chloride anion,

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:11.233
and this is still in an aqueous solution.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.102
It is dissolved in water,

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:14.576
and remember all that happened here

00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:17.003
is that the chlorine here
took all of the electrons,

00:04:17.003 --> 00:04:18.536
leaving hydrogen with none.

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:21.078
Then that hydrogen proton gets
nabbed by a water molecule

00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.843
and becomes hydronium.

00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:24.699
So even by this definition you might say

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.219
it increases the concentration
of hydrogen protons.

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.119
You could say it increase the
concentration of hydronium,

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:33.696
of hydronium right over here.

00:04:33.696 --> 00:04:36.924
Hydronium ions.

00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:39.339
So that makes, by the
Arrhenius definition,

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:42.707
that makes hydrochloric
acid a strong acid.

00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:44.589
That makes it a

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:50.446
strong acid.

00:04:50.446 --> 00:04:53.743
Now what would be a strong base
by the Arrhenius definition

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:55.682
of acids and bases?

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:59.025
Well one would be sodium hydroxide.

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:00.430
So let me write that down,

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.531
so if I have sodium hydroxide,

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.028
sodium Na, that's the sodium,

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:07.292
and then I have the hydroxide.

00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:11.649
That's an oxygen bonded to a hydrogen.

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.457
So that's sodium hydroxide, and actually

00:05:13.457 --> 00:05:15.930
if you wanted to see what
this molecule looked like

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.930
you have a oxygen having a covalent bond

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.195
to a hydrogen.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.250
Let me do these in different colors.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.132
Oxygen has a covalent bond

00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:27.584
to a hydrogen.

00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:30.911
to a hydrogen right over here.

00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.670
And it actually has three alone pairs.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.815
It actually has three alone
pairs right over here.

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:40.998
It's actually nabbed the electron from,

00:05:40.998 --> 00:05:42.832
from somebody some place,

00:05:42.832 --> 00:05:45.654
and so it's going to
have a negative charge.

00:05:45.654 --> 00:05:47.197
It is going to have a negative charge.

00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:48.162
Actually I could write it both,

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:48.938
let me just write it like that.

00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:50.622
It has a negative charge,

00:05:50.622 --> 00:05:54.082
and then you have a sodium ion

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.496
that has lost its electron somehow.

00:05:56.496 --> 00:06:00.083
So you have a sodium ion that has lost

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.148
an electron somehow, so
it has a positive charge,

00:06:03.148 --> 00:06:05.609
and for all we know, it
could have lost the electron

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:09.742
to the oxygen right over
here, making the oxygen

00:06:09.742 --> 00:06:12.065
negative and making the sodium positive,

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:14.211
and so this is now
positive, this is negative,

00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.884
they're going to be
attracted to each other,

00:06:15.884 --> 00:06:17.950
and they form an ionic bond,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.724
so sodium hydroxide,
they have an ionic bond

00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:23.011
because the sodium is actually positive,

00:06:23.011 --> 00:06:25.101
and the hydroxide part right over here.

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:27.225
That is negative,

00:06:27.225 --> 00:06:29.466
and that's what draws them together,

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:32.728
but anyway, you put this
in an aqueous solution.

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:36.768
You throw some sodium hydroxide
into an aqueous solution,

00:06:36.768 --> 00:06:40.034
it will disassociate into,

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:44.931
into sodium with its positive
charge, the sodium ions,

00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.137
and actually you know the sodium
ion is still part of this.

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:50.595
That's what makes it attracted
to the hydroxide anion,

00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:52.607
but it's still going to be

00:06:52.607 --> 00:06:55.440
in an aqueous solution,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.866
and then you're going
to have the hydroxide.

00:06:57.866 --> 00:07:00.759
You're going to have the hydroxide anion,

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:04.364
so essentially this
thing just disassociates.

00:07:04.364 --> 00:07:05.977
This has a negative charge,

00:07:05.977 --> 00:07:08.566
and it's still going to
be dissolved in the water,

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:10.726
so aqueous solution.

00:07:10.726 --> 00:07:12.838
So you throw sodium hydroxide in water,

00:07:12.838 --> 00:07:15.045
it's going to increase the concentration.

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:18.414
It's going to increase the
concentration of hydroxide

00:07:18.414 --> 00:07:19.108
in the water.

00:07:19.108 --> 00:07:21.232
It's going to increase the
hydroxide concentration,

00:07:21.232 --> 00:07:24.284
and so by the Arrhenius
definition of acids and bases,

00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:27.213
this would be a strong Arrhenius base.

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:30.352
This would be a strong,

00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:35.135
a strong base by the Arrhenius definition.

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:38.084
Now, and I encourage you to look at that

00:07:38.084 --> 00:07:39.988
relative to the other definitions,

00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:42.844
the Bronsted-Lowry
definition of acids and bases

00:07:42.844 --> 00:07:45.224
and the Lewis definition
of acids and bases,

00:07:45.224 --> 00:07:48.132
and see how you would think
about categorizing things.
