00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.430
- [Instructor] When Quinn
returned from vacation,

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.000
he turned the heat back on in his home.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.370
He set the temperature
as high as it could go.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.870
Q represents the
temperature in Quinn's home

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.380
in degrees Celsius after t minutes.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.930
This Q is equal to 15 plus 0.4t.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.040
What was the temperature when
Quinn returned from vacation?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.890
So pause this video

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.520
and see if you can work
this out on your own.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.560
All right, so they wanna
know the temperature

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560
and you might get a little confused,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.880
hey maybe t is for temperature.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.230
No, t is time in minutes.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.680
Temperature is Q.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.730
Q represents the temperature.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.890
So they really wanna know is,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.670
what was Q when Quinn
returned from vacation?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.970
Well, right when Quinn
returned from vacation,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.010
that is when t is equal to zero.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.530
So this is equivalent to saying,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.020
what is Q, our temperature,
when zero minutes have elapsed?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.790
Well, if you go back to
this original equation,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.460
we see that Q is equal to 15

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.580
plus 0.4 times the amount
of elapsed time in minutes.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.490
So that's times zero.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.980
So that's just going to
be 15 degrees Celsius.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.470
If you're familiar with
slope intercept form,

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.550
you could think of it as our temperature

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.550
is equal to 0.4 times
the elapsed time plus 15.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
So t equals zero, you're
left with just this term

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.830
which in many cases we
view as our y-intercept.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.980
What is going on right when
we're just getting started?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.000
Right when our horizontal
variable is equal to zero.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.050
And our horizontal variable

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.023
in this situation is elapsed time.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.690
How much do the temperature
increase every minute?

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.060
There's a couple of ways
you can think about this.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.700
One if you recognize, this
is slope intercept form.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.800
You could see that 0.4 is the slope.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.760
So that says for every one minute

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.830
change in time,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.940
you're going to have an
increase in temperature

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.520
by 0.4 degrees Celsius.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.320
So you could do it that way.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.260
You could try out some values.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.170
You could say, all
right, let me think about

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.880
what Q is going to be based on t.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.020
So time, t equals zero
right when you got home.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.853
We're to figure out

00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:09.490
that the temperature
is 15 degrees Celsius.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.670
At t equals one, what happens?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.500
It's going to be 15 plus 0.4 times one.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.420
That's just gonna be 15.4.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.780
Notice, when we increased our time by one,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.160
our temperature increased
by 0.4 degrees Celsius

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.240
by the slope.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.250
And what happened again
if we increased time

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.380
by another minute, if
we go from one to two,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.630
we would get two, 15.8.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.240
We would increase
temperature by another 0.4.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.430
How much will the temperature increase

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.800
if Quinn leaves the
heat on for 20 minutes?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.370
Pause the video and see
if you can solve that.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.410
All right, now we have to be careful here.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.280
They're not asking us

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.470
what is the temperature after 20 minutes.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.110
They're saying, how much
will the temperature increase

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.420
if he leaves the heat on for 20 minutes?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.820
If we just wanna know
what is the temperature

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.270
after 20 minutes, we would just say,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.880
okay, what is Q when t is equal to 20?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.180
So it'd be 15 plus 0.4 times 20.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.880
0.4 times 20 is eight.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.560
Eight plus 15 is 23.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.850
So it's 23 degrees
Celsius after 20 minutes.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:14.910
But that's not what they're asking us.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.060
They're asking, how much will
the temperature increase?

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.460
Well, where did we start from?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.690
We started from 15 degrees Celsius

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.260
and now after 20 minutes we
have gone to 23 degrees Celsius.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.300
So we have increased by
eight degrees Celsius.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.170
Or, another way to think about it,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.420
we have increased by this
amount right over here.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.150
We started at 15 and after 20 minutes,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.690
we have increased by 0.4 times 20

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.380
which is eight degrees Celsius.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.213
We're done!
