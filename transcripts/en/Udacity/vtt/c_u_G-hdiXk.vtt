Previously, we've shown you how to access data that sits

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.930
in a file or a database. But what do you do

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.560
when you want to access data that sits in some website,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.240
like Twitter data? We could just go to twitter.com and search

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.280
for Udacity, but then we'd have to manually write down

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.080
all the data. We could try to rate a web crawler

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.400
to go through the pages HTML, but as you can imagine,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.260
that could get kind of complicated. Luckily, many tech companies like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.940
Twitter allow users and developers to access data directly

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.210
in a simple, machine readable format. They do so

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.940
through something called an Application Programming Interface, or API.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.580
There are several different kinds of APIs, but one of

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.910
the most common types, and the one used by

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.080
Twitter, is a representational state transfer or REST API. I

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.750
know I sound like a broken record here, but

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.530
if you'd like to learn more about the nitty gritty

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
behind REST APIs, I'd recommend you take the data wrangling class with MongoDB.
