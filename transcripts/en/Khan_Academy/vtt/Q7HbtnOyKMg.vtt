00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.060
Let's do an example of how a
housing bubble can lead to

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.290
wealth destruction.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.920
And I really just want to hit
the point home that once

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.110
wealth is destroyed, all
legislation can do is

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.270
redistribute who takes
the losses.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.340
That you can't create wealth,
all of a sudden, out of

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.880
legislation.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.180
You can maybe create incentives
for investment et

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.120
cetera, et cetera, but
we'll talk about

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.570
that in a future video.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.090
So let's say, in year one, I
have a neighborhood and Toll

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.770
Brothers goes out and builds a
new development and they build

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.350
five houses.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.880
Let me draw those five houses.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.975
House one, house two,
house three, house

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.710
four, and house five.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.520
And let's say, that this was
a normal home buying

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.190
environment.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.710
This could have been 1995.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.430
Let's just say, for the sake
of argument, this is 1995.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.410
Although, I want this to be an
abstract example, so we could

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.830
call that year one.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.000
But in 1995, these people
find five new families

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.920
that go buy the house.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.730
They pay $100,000 each,
for the houses.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.910
These were conforming loans,
there wasn't this whole CDO

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.580
and mortgage-backed
security market.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.820
So essentially, these people
have to put 20% down, and they

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.460
had good credit scores, and all
the rest. So immediately,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.900
they have $20,000 equity
and an $80,000 loan.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.365
It's my code, E for equity.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.760
Now, we have this whole
securitization, lending

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.310
becomes a lot easier, becomes
easier and easier every year

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.170
because housing prices go up,
so people stop taking risk

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.030
into consideration.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.130
And let's say, we get
to the year 2005.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.600
This could be an abstract
example, it could be year two.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.430
In 2005, all of a sudden
everyone is

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.960
getting access to funding.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.930
The people who have houses
actually don't want to sell

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.490
the houses because they're
convinced that their housing

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.290
prices are going up so fast,
that it's only a matter of

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.400
time before they're millionaires
just with the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.780
housing wealth, and then they
could maybe retire off of it.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.110
But there's so much funding
and anyone can get a loan.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.950
And let's say, that these first
homeowners, maybe they

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.900
have to move, or maybe they just
want to move to a cheaper

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.730
location, or maybe their kids
have gone to college, so they

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.930
just want to downsize.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.900
They decide to sell
their house.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.770
And because there's so much
demand out there, anyone can

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.310
get a loan, frankly, the person
who's going to be able

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.260
to give the highest bid on the
house, is a person, to some

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.010
degree, who's most reckless
or most prudent.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.630
And anyway, I won't
go into that.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.780
But let's say, they pay $1
million for the house.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.670
They have no money down, $1
million loan, subprime,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.870
negative amortization, they
had no credit rating, et

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.490
cetera, et cetera.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.570
They pay $1 million.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.260
Now, that was the purchase
price of the house.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.205
And we could just say, that
they have zero equity.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.240
And of course, this
guy's great now.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.020
He probably did build equity
over that ten years from 1995

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.440
to 2005, but even if he didn't,
even if all he did was

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.370
pay the interest on
this $80,000 loan.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.150
This guy, he had $20,000, now
he gets $1,000,000, pays off

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.290
the $80,000, so he essentially,
gets $920,000

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.110
plus the $20,000 had before.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.530
So he moves to Costa Rica
with $940,000 and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.900
lives like a king.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.930
Although, I've heard Costa Rica

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.630
has also become expensive.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.190
But anyway, what happens now
in the neighborhood?

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.580
These people didn't
sell their houses.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.370
They didn't find some subprime
individual that was willing to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.350
bid up the house.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.350
Nothing happened, no money
changes hands, but all of a

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.980
sudden, these people say, well
you know what, our houses are

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.500
just as nice as this first
house that sold.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.340
Maybe it's even better.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.790
So our houses are also
worth $1 million.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.570
So we all have this kind of you
could say, paper wealth

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.550
here of $1 million.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.620
Just from one transaction.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.670
And actually, this is a five
house neighborhood, this could

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.839
happen in a 500 house
neighborhood.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.220
You just to find one person to
overpay for a house and then

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.480
everyone in the neighborhood,
all of a sudden, feels at

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.790
their house is worth
that much.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.490
And just out of thin air, just
by one person getting cheap

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.180
credit and overpaying for
something, everyone in the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.450
neighborhood thinks that they
just got $900,000 of wealth,

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.070
or at least in this example.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.260
You never see a nine-fold
increase in property prices

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:46.030
but it wasn't crazy to see a
two-fold increase in a year.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.420
Well, we have seen nine-fold
increases over ten years, it's

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.370
the example here, it's actually
not that crazy.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.390
Anyway, that's all of their
notional wealth.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.500
But all these people
don't want to sell.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.560
One, they like their house,
their kids are still there.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.570
And they say, wow, in ten
years my house went from

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.880
$100,000 to $1 million and in
another ten years, my house is

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.730
going to go from $1 million
to $10 million.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.830
Why would I sell it; I can then
retire off the house.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.360
They don't think, who could
buy a $10 million

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.130
house in ten years.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.540
The only people who could-- well
anyway, I'll do another

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.730
video on that, I just don't
want to run out of time.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.390
But they can still
monetize this.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.300
They could say, well when I go
to my financial planner, they

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.250
said, oh, it's so inefficient
for you to have all of that

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.890
equity sitting in your house.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.830
How much equity do they have?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.490
They had $20,000 before and even
if they didn't build any

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.060
equity while they paid their
mortgage, they now have

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.190
another $900,000 of equity.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.660
So these people, their financial
planner, and their

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.810
siblings, and their friends at
work say, oh, your balance

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.320
sheet is so inefficient, why
don't you take some of that

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.710
equity and invest it
or put it to work.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.830
So they say, that's
a good idea.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.260
I'll go get a home
equity loan.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.020
So let's say, this person
goes to a bank.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.310
A bank says, OK, sure, I'll
give you a $500,000 home

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:14.650
equity loan, and in exchange,
get 8% interest on that loan.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.900
So this is the bank.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.630
And the bank thinks it
got a great deal.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.750
Because this $500,000 loan
is not an unsecured loan.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.670
It's not as if this person
can't pay, they just file

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.340
bankruptcy and there's
nothing that the bank

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.350
can get ahold of.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.170
This home equity loan is
secured by the house.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.030
So the bank says, well if this
person doesn't pay that

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.550
$500,000 loan, if they default,
for whatever reason,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.970
I get their house.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.600
And their house is
worth $1 million.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.800
And why do I think
it's $1 million?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.840
Because a house in the
neighborhood sold for $1

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.860
million and frankly, that's how,
unfortunately, housing

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.770
was assessed.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.240
People would just say, oh,
another house in this

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.780
neighborhood sold for $1
million, this one must be

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.880
worth $1 million because it's a
very similar or maybe even a

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.670
better house.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.440
So this banker thinks they
have a great deal.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.940
This is better than
buying treasuries.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.670
I'm getting 8%, maybe
treasuries are

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.970
giving me 3% or 4%.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.230
And if they default on it, I
actually get an asset that's

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.400
probably worth more than the
loan amount, and I can auction

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.630
that off and easily get
my $500,000 back.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.270
So the risk managers within
the bank think they have a

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.730
great deal.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.300
And they probably sliced and
diced these things and sold it

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.670
to other people and
got it rated as

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.700
triple-A and all of that.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.220
But what happens next?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.460
Well let's say, 2005, in our
imaginary universe was the

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.320
peak of the credit cycle.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.590
That was the year that credit
was the loosest. And as soon

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.320
as some of these people who had
no jobs and got these $1

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.630
million loans, they probably
couldn't even pay the mortgage

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.590
on their loan, not to speak of
continuing it, or even pay the

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.810
low rate on the original
teaser loan.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.430
So maybe, they start to default,
credit starts getting

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:59.180
tighter, and let's say, this guy
actually gets foreclosed.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.380
And so he gives the house
back to the bank.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.620
The bank auctions it off and
let's say, when the bank

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:15.550
auctions it off, it only gets
$300,000 for the house.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.760
And in the meantime, what did
all of these people do with

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.370
the $500,000 that they had?

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.810
Well their intention was to take
these home equity loans

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.050
and put that money to work,
invest it in some way.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.490
And they say, well what's a
better investment than doing

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.370
home improvements?

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.750
Because we all know a house
is the best investment.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.470
So unfortunately, a lot of
that $500,000 it gets

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:43.970
quote-unquote invested in
granite countertops, two more

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:55.850
bathrooms per house, hardwood
floors, and you can imagine.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.920
They wanted to treat themselves
too, so they did a

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.980
little vacation.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.640
So it was invested quote-unquote
in their house.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.700
Because they said, oh well, this
will increase the value

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.520
of my house.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.230
And oh, as a side benefit,
I will really look good,

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.700
relative to the neighbors
and live it up.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.220
I can live beyond, essentially,
what my income

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.590
would predict.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:18.000
And I've done some videos on
investment versus consumption,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.420
but I'd argue that
this wasn't real

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.510
investment, that $500,000.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.330
That this was consumption
because it's not making the

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.420
world more productive in any
way; it's not increasing the

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.750
total economic pie for the
world, so it's not investment.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.450
It may be an investment if it
somehow makes your asset more

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.790
emotionally appealing to
some greater fool to

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.840
pay more for it.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.540
You didn't build a factory or
you didn't invent some new

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.040
technology that will make all of
us richer, you just poured

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.650
some money into something that's
going to make your

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.750
lifestyle a little bit better,
and maybe the next person who

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:52.160
buys your house.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.350
But anyway, this house
got foreclosed upon.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.490
It gets auctioned off
for $300,000, maybe

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.360
this is the year 2006.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.700
Now, all of a sudden, all of
these people, probably all of

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.630
whom who took these home equity
loans, let's say all of

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.320
them did it.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:10.930
They all say, gee, I'm paying
a $500,000 loan.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:15.100
Actually, I'm paying $500,000
plus my original $80,000 loan,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.980
so, I have $580,000 of
debt on an asset that

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.470
just sold for $300,000.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.110
So what do you think they're
going to do?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.410
And I just realized I'm out of
time, so I will continue this

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.070
in the next video.
