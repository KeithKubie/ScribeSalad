00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.130
A fundamental part of
understanding restful APIs

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.640
is understanding the components that
make up the client-server flow of HTTP.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.810
HTTP can be described as pull protocol.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.400
Communication is always
initiated by the client

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.259
sending an HTTP request to the server.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.440
In turn, the server responds
with a response message.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.600
These messages are just bodies of text
that the machines can later interpret

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.740
into actions, images, and
even multimedia content.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.450
Let's briefly discuss some of the major
components of HTTP requests and

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.830
responses, starting with requests.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.320
Every HTTP message consists of a message
header, and an optional message body.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.390
These two entities are separated by
a space, like in the diagram here.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.880
In an HTTP request, the first line of
the header is called the request line.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.740
The request line contains the HTTP verb,
the URI, or

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.040
Uniform Resource Identifier,
and the HTTP version number.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.710
Take a look at these
examples of request lines.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.880
We see the verb here, the resource we
want to access via the URI here, and

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.680
the version of HTTP we
are using at the end.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.060
After the request line we have
the optional request headers.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.830
These are perimeters that can be
used to describe specific properties

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.090
about a request.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.970
Request headers appear
in name value pairs.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.460
Multiple values can be
separated by commas, like so.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.350
A blank line separates the header and
body of an HTTP request.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.070
In the body, we can add any other
information about the request that we

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.880
want to send along to the server.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.870
An example of a complete HTTP
request message is shown here.
