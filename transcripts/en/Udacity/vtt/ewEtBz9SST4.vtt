00:00:00.126 --> 00:00:02.907
Let's take a look at the next step in searching for a business model,

00:00:02.907 --> 00:00:04.824
and that's customer validation.

00:00:04.824 --> 00:00:07.332
By now to get to this step

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:11.124
we assumed you believe you have product market fit.

00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:14.290
Now, you would say, "Okay, now I can hire people."

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.158
"Now I could run my million dollar Google AdWords campaign,"

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:19.457
and we say, "No, not really."

00:00:19.457 --> 00:00:22.172
We don't really think you have enough evidence to do so.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.190
We kind of hear you that you believe you do,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.189
so we're going to do this again, but this time try to get orders

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.921
or users or both, depending on what your business model said.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.423
Phase 1 is you're going to get ready to sell.

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:38.421
If it's a physical product, you're going to develop sales collateral,

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.789
meaning the data sheets and price lists and demos, etc.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.805
If it's a web and mobile product, you're going to try to

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:47.424
acquire and activate customers, and you're going to build a

00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:50.972
high fidelity, minimum viable product, which is a fancy word for

00:00:50.972 --> 00:00:53.991
your website or mobile app will look like it's almost done,

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.107
maybe the help files aren't there, et cetera, and maybe not all the features

00:00:57.107 --> 00:01:01.122
but the core features that people will use, and then you get out of the building,

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.972
physically or virtually, and you try to get out and sell

00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:07.456
and see if you get users or payers or both.

00:01:07.456 --> 00:01:10.223
The other thing you'll be doing simultaneously with this

00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:13.390
is to develop positioning, which is a fancy word for saying

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.123
"Okay, I now have a lot of customer feedback."

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:20.690
"How could I have best described this based on what the customers are actually telling me?"

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.107
Because you'll ask "So, I explained it to you like this."

00:01:23.107 --> 00:01:24.971
"How could I have said it better?"

00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.140
And if you actually listen to them they actually would have said,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.756
"Yeah, I ignored the first 7 things you said,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:34.572
but when you said number 8 that's when I really got interested and excited."

00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:37.706
And so you're going to develop both corporate or company

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:41.790
and product positioning, and you're going to do this way before you ever spend money

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.775
on external PR agencies by actually listening to your own customers.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:49.840
And then in Phase 4 you're going to verify or repeat,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.839
and you're going to see if you're ready to start scaling

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.140
sales and marketing spending in customer creation,

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.824
which is the most expensive part of a startup.

00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:02.756
This customer validation stage actually gets you out,

00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:06.122
and you pretend you have the world's largest sales force,

00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:09.288
and you're ready to go "Okay, I think it's really going to work

00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:12.006
because I've tested it in customer discovery."

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.491
And most of the time you find out, "Oops, I really didn't quite understand

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:18.607
what those customers were saying."

00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:20.940
And instead of being out of business because you spent all your money

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.257
on sales force or Google AdWords campaigns

00:02:23.257 --> 00:02:26.473
or customer acquisition you now have the cash and time

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:30.106
to simply go back from Phase 4 and go back and pivot

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:33.472
and say, "I clearly didn't understand something about

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:38.523
my customer segment or features or customer needs or how to do customer relationships,"

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:42.174
et cetera, and so customer validation in its detail, again,

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:46.006
has 2 tracks, 1 for physical, 1 for web/mobile.

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:47.523
Get ready to sell.

00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:50.556
Sell to early customers who we call early evangelists.

00:02:50.556 --> 00:02:55.042
Develop positioning, and again, either pivot or proceed.
