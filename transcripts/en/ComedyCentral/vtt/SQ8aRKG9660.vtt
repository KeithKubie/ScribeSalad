00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.378 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DUDE, I JUST SAW THE HOTTEST
GIRL I HAVE EVER SEEN.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAD THE MOST INCREDIBLE
SPARK.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:16.081 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:19.085 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.119 size:78% position:39% line:85%

&gt;&gt; HERE, TAKE MY TICKETS.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:25.224 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:28.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR
THE COATS.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.963 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO, WE PUT THE TICKETS IN THE
TIP JAR AT THE END OF THE NIGHT

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.532 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN PEOPLE FIND THEIR MATCHING
TICKET.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.369 line:85%
THAT PROVES THE COAT'S THEIRS.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.670 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT'S HOW COAT CHECK WORKS.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:38.871 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO THAT'S NOT HOW COAT CHECK
WORKS.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:39.539 line:91%
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE

THAT SHOW.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:28.788 line:91%
IT IS SUCH A RARE QUALITY IN

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.063 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE CAN'T EVEN HANDLE
THIS. WE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:37.830 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU'RE SAYING
THAT. THANK YOU.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M GOING TO START TO
CRY.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.602 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO START
TO CRY.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.336 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT CRYING.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:43.770 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M NOT CRYING,
EITHER.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T CRY.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:45.972 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M MADE OF ONIONS. I
TOLD THE PEOPLE EARLIER.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:46.806 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT GONNA CRY AT ALL. WE
SWORE WE WOULDN'T CRY.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.980 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW ARE YOU HANDLING

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:55.214 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS?

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:56.716 line:91%
IS IT, WHEN DID THIS HIT FOR YOU
WHEN YOU REALIZE, LIKE (BLEEP)

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.317 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS IT.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.688 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS BIG TIME!

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.756 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE IS --

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:04.891 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S A GOOD INDICATOR, YOU
KNOW. FAIR INDICATOR.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:05.992 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IT'S HAPPENING.

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.260 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, NO. NO.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.629 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT I THINK THAT WE
WERE LUCKY ENOUGH THAT

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:11.631 line:91%
WE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF
THE WEB SERIES BEFORE.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.866 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; SO IT FELT LEGITIMATE TO US

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEFORE, WE HAD TO VALIDATE
OURSELVES BEFORE OTHER

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:16.535 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE DID --
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.939 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I THINK THAT REALLY FORMS
THE EXPERIENCE WHICH FORMS THE

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:21.173 align:start position:0%
PRODUCT.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.643 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: DOES IT SEEM DIFFERENT?
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE WAS TALKING

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.478 line:91%
TO ME EARLIER ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M TRYING TO GET INTO COMEDY

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.281 line:91%
WRITING AND ALL THAT, IT FEEL
LIKE THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:32.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAN THERE EVER WAS FOR PEOPLE.
IT'S BEEN DEMOCRATIZED

00:02:32.384 --> 00:02:33.119 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO SOME EXTENT.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.387 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
&gt;&gt; YEP.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.924 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: DO YOU THINK A SHOW LIKE
THIS, VOICES LIKE YOURS, UNIQUE

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:43.129 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND JOYFUL COULD HAVE GOTTEN
ON THE AIR WITHOUT THE WEB?

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.530 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO, NO.
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:45.231 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NOPE. 

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:46.499 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Jon: WAS IT HARD?

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:49.068 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, WE BOTH CAME UP
AT THE UPRIGHT CITIZENS BRIGADE.

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:49.969 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.
&gt;&gt; WOOT WOOT!

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:50.937 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TAKING CLASSES, AND GOT
REALLY --

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: GREAT PLACE.
&gt;&gt; YEAH. WONDERFUL PLACE.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.172 line:91%
AND WE GOT REALLY TUNNEL
VISIONED INTO LIKE WELL,

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:54.707 line:91%
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT IS TO
GET ON A HOUSE TEAM AND YOU

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.775 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
GOTTA DO THAT AND IF YOU DO
THAT THEN YOU DO THE NEXT AND 

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.243 line:85%
LIKE, YOU KNOW --

00:02:57.276 --> 00:02:58.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR
US.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.582 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN WE WERE SORT OF
LIKE NEEDING SOMETHING TO SEND

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:06.185 size:88% position:44% line:91%
OUR PARENTS TO PROVE THAT WE
WERE, IN FACT, DOING COMEDY.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.120 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SEND THEM A LINK.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND YOU KNOW HOW TO
USE THIS INTERNET.

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.358 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; JON, COME ON.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY CAN CLICK A LINK IN AN
EMAIL.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.563 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY?

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:19.932 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND IT'D JUST SHOW,  THE WEB
EPISODE WOULD JUST SHOW UP.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.201 align:start position:0% line:85%
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO
PRESS PLAY. IT LOADS, YOU KNOW.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.872 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NOW DO THEY UNDERSTAND
AT THIS POINT THAT THERE IS A

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:28.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUBTLE SEPARATION BETWEEN
THAT AND TELEVISION?

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:29.809 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
LIKE DID THEY UNDERSTAND ONCE
YOU GOT ON COMEDY CENTRAL

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.377 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
DID THEY THINK LIKE OH YEAH,
THAT'S YOUR WEB SERIES OR

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.045 line:91%
DID THEY THINK LIKE OH YEAH,
THAT'S A NETWORK ON THE BOX.

00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:37.083 line:85%
I DON'T HAVE TO CLICK ANYTHING.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:41.854 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOUR PARENTS HAVE A HARDER
TIME DISTINGUISHING, RIGHT?

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:47.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
