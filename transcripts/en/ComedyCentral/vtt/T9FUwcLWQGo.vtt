00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.460
- So Aria, you
  are a transgender,

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.105
Kosher,

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.107
Conservative Jew

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.842
and a bioengineer scientist.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.144
How do you exist?

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.112
- Well, it's been a struggle.

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:15.481
I've had to fight
 to exist, actually.

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:17.383
- So you grew up religious?

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.384
- Reform.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.552
- You grew up a Reform Jew

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:21.387
which to the laypeople
 watching at home

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.890
means grew up
 listening to techno.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.727
How did you make a transition
 from Reform to Conservative?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.263
- Well, in college I
 actually started going

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:33.232
to a Hasidic synagogue
 on the weekends

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:36.235
really just to find
 out more about myself

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:39.605
and about Jewish mysticism
 because I had some questions

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:43.076
and obviously I was questioning
more than I thought.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:44.844
- Why'd you leave Reform Judaism

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.746
and go towards
 Conservative Judaism?

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.248
Wouldn't Reform have been
  more accepting and loving

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.416
towards your transition?
- Especially.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.951
Especially in my family.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.387
None of my family members
 are as conservative as I am.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.688
- That's crazy!

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.556
- So I go home and
  I'm like, no Mom,

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.857
I'm not eating pork.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.358
Why do you guys do this to me?

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.760
And then they complain
 of stomach aches.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:02.161
- You said that in
  such a Jewish way:

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.330
"And then they complained
  of stomach aches.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:05.832
I'm like, well?"

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:08.334
Would you say you eat more
  lox as a man or a woman?

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.670
- That never changed,
that's always constant.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:11.671
- That's a steady...
 - Just every week.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.072
(laughs)

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.042
- What is your perspective
  on homosexuality?

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.677
- Well it's changed, actually.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.446
I was actually very
 homophobic before

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.116
and only had relationships
  with women, as a man,

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.317
for a long time.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.653
And recently, as my
body has changed a lot,

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.424
all of my assumptions
 have been challenged.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.960
I think my attraction
 has also been changed

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.628
or affected by the transition.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.332
- Orientation and
 gender-identity are separate.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.167
- My mom does not
  agree with that.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.336
- Your mom thinks
  what, you're gay?

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.139
- She wishes I
  was gay, probably.

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:49.342
- You were tired
 of the testosterone

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.477
that was biologically
  pumping through your body

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.879
and what did you choose to do?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.413
- And the hair, I mean
I had a huge hair issue.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.848
- You're a Jew!

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.650
I mean that's not
  a gender thing.

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:00.086
I just want to show you
 how bad it could have been.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.954
- Should I touch it?
 - Feel free.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.090
- I used to be very
 scared of this.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.592
I would think that
 everybody was staring

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.362
at my nude forearms or something

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.963
but then I wore a
  small-faced watch.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:14.567
It was one of the first things
 that I did to crossdress.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.269
- One of the first feminine
 things that you did.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.906
And what was that feeling
 like, when you first did that?

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.140
- Guilty.

00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:21.941
- You felt guilt.
  - I was a dude.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.142
- But was it thrilling?

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.377
- Oh of course.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.878
- So it was guilt and thrill?

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.080
- Yeah, and I would go back
 every day and crossdress.

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:30.516
And it would be
 this repeating cycle

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.618
until I decided I didn't
want to just crossdress.

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.422
- Are you a scientist
 first, or a Jew first,

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.824
or a trans woman first?

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:41.894
What's the most important
  identity marker for you?

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.229
- Musician.
 - Musician!

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.064
I didn't know that
  was available.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.299
What kind of music do you make?

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.234
- I'm a pianist and I
 like EDM production.

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:50.036
- Oh you like techno?
 - Yeah.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.737
- I told you it was
 about techno, guys.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.641
Why not be in a more funky,
 liberal strain of Judaism

00:02:55.674 --> 00:02:58.744
that would automatically
 accept your gender identity?

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:00.379
- Doesn't appeal to me.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:03.783
I really want something that's
 deep and connected to God

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:07.954
and an inspiring way that
reminds me of the ancient times

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:11.891
and really what a lot of
 history has been leading to.

00:03:11.924 --> 00:03:14.760
And of course, like a lot of
 Jews want the Messiah to come.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.096
Moshiach; you know all
 about that I'm sure.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.198
- I mean, I'm thinking
I might be that person.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:20.399
- Exactly.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.901
- I just got my own
show on Comedy Central.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.836
There's nothing holding me
 back from revealing myself.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.806
- Exactly, just take off
 those glasses and then, boom!

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.308
- Wait, why I gotta
 take off the glasses?

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:30.576
This is what the Jewish
Messiah would look like.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.178
- It's not like X-Men.
 - I'm here! Ugh.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:35.114
I'll get to you -
 that's what he'd say.

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.515
Thank you for coming in.

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:37.817
And now that we've
  figured out how you exist,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.652
I'm glad that you exist.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:40.820
- Thank you so much.
