00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
So let's talk about the four color theorem!

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.400
It's a favorite with mathematicians.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.000
It's easy to state,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.540
so the statement is, every map can be colored using four colors,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.660
such that two neighboring countries are different colors.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.700
That would be confusing if it wasn't.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.000
So all maps can be done in four colors.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.320
In other words I'm saying there are no maps that need five colors.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.360
It's not obvious,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.860
and you'd think more complicated maps would need more colors,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.500
but apparently all maps can be done with just four colors or better.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.200
So this problem was unsolved for a long time.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.700
125 years, it was unsolved.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.760
It was solved finally in the 1970s,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.020
although the method they used to solve it was a little controversial at the time,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.020
but has had a large effect on mathematics today.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.840
So the story of how this problem came around is kind of cute.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.220
Apparently there was a guy who was trying to color in the counties of Britain.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.860
I don't know why he was trying to do that, but he was,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.140
and he suspected he could do it using four colors.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.180
And he mentioned it to his brother, and his brother was a Maths student.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.680
And his brother mentioned it to his lecturer who was a man called Augustus De Morgan.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.280
He's a famous mathematician, and, well, it was De Morgan who spread this problem around.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.220
So to prove it,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.900
we either need to show that every map can be done with four colors or better,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.320
or we just need to find one example that needs five colors.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.940
So people were trying it.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.480
And if you try it with maps, it does work.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.580
If you try it with the map of the world, you can color it with four colors.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.220
If you try it with the map of the United States, you can do it with four colors.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.220
You can try any real map, you can do it with four colors.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.180
I mean you can get this problem to children, right, you want to keep them quiet.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.980
After a while, you start to think,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.240
"Well, maybe I'll need to invent a map.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.040
Maybe if I can invent a weird, complicated map,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.040
I can find one that needs five colors."

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.580
So that's what you start to do -- doesn't look like any sort of real-life map.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.420
So we got this map, and now we're going to color it in.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.880
So let's start with the middle; I think orange.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.380
Next country has to be a different color, so I'm using the purple here.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500
Let's try the next country;

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.900
so this is all fairly simple -- I can't use purple, I can't use orange, because they're touching --

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.760
I'll use the blue.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.320
Next one, uh, what do you want, what do you want, Brady?

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.540
[Brady] Well, we can't use blue or orange...
[Dr. Grime] Mm.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.240
[Brady] Oh we could use purple again!

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.380
[Dr. Grime] Ah, wise. That is a wise choice.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.320
Let's use purple again.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.720
Why not? Let's not go to the expense of using a fourth color.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.900
So now let's do this one.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.340
[Brady] We can use blue again.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.580
[Dr. Grime] And we can use blue again for that one, excellent.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.240
That might put us in a good position when we do the next country.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.680
So here we've got --

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.220
we can't use blue, we can't use purple; what should we use?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.660
[Brady] We can use orange again.
[Dr. Grime] We can use orange, why not?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.360
Uh, do you wanna use the orange on the opposite one?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.780
So we'll do this one in orange...

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.020
[Brady] And now we need a fourth color.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.720
[Dr. Grime] We do need -- we have to go to the fourth color, do we?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.740
Yeah, yeah, yep, purple, blue and orange are being used;

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.100
this does have to go into the fourth color.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.480
I've got pink here. On the opposite side, it's the same, obviously; I'll use pink over here.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.440
It looks like we had to use four colors for that.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.320
So okay, so this is a map

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.600
that was solvable with four colors.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.239
Here's another important map. I'm gonna make

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.950
it like that. There's only four

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.500
countries, but if we try and color it in,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.330
Uh, I'll do something similar. I'll do

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.420
the orange in the middle again, purple up here.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.360
Well this one can't be purple; it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.860
can't be orange. That means it's blue and this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.959
country it can't be orange; it can't be

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.750
purple; it can't be blue; so I'm forced to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.060
use the fourth color which is the pink.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.500
So this is an example of a map that

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.940
definitely needs four colors so we're

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.470
going to boil the problem down a little

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.680
bit. Let's say I took this map again -- I'll

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.050
draw it here. Same map. Instead of coloring in

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.080
all the sections, let's just say I color

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.120
in at the center of each region.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.180
That'll just get the same idea won't it? I don't

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.380
have to use all that ink. and maybe

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.209
instead of drawing out the whole map

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.459
maybe if I just said if two countries

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.740
are touching each other, they share a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.600
border. Right, I'll just connect them with

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.600
a line. What I've made is I turn that

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.410
map into a network so this map has made

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.900
this network and the question "Can this

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.110
map be colored using four colors or

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.360
better?" is the same question of saying

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.900
"can this network be colored using four

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.080
colors or better such that two countries

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.910
that are connected with a line are not

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.610
the same color?" So it kind of boils down

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.350
the problem; it makes it more abstract

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.510
but that's actually a good thing. it

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.340
makes it easier to solve, there are

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.260
things we can learn now about maps by

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.300
studying networks instead. So the reason

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.550
we want to use networks; for a start, it

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.040
shows when two maps are the same. I'll

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.660
show you what I mean. What about if I had a

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.220
map that looks like this yeah so this

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.830
this map looks like a handbag as Brady

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.410
just told me, but if we draw the network

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.570
for this map, so I'm just going to put

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.780
a dot in each region and then I'll

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.180
connect them if they're connected like

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.250
this. You will find that you get the same

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.090
network as this previous map we did. So

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.220
just 4 countries again, it gives me the

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.410
same network -- it is effectively the same map

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.480
even though it looks different. So by

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.000
studying networks we can study all the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.230
different kinds of maps even when they

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.300
look different. Now all maps make

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.080
networks but not all network are valid

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.320
maps. I'll show you what I mean this is

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.120
not going to be a valid map and I'm

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.830
going to say they're all going to be touching

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.870
each other. They're all mutually touching

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.520
countries. They all share borders so it

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.280
looks like -- if I got this right -- looks like

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.270
that. Now this is not going to be a valid

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.920
map, because if you try and turn that

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.410
into a map it's not going to work. The

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.750
problem is the lines cross which when

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.370
you try and turn it into a map doesn't

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.520
make sense. You can try but it just

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.830
doesn't make sense. It is allowed if we

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.690
can untangle the lines and that might

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.670
happen. i'll show you what i mean so say

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.940
these are countries here and let's say

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.010
these countries touch each other as well

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.710
so i would connect them with a line, but

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.479
if I do that you see the lines cross. I

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:38.460
don't have to do it that way: I could

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.669
have drawn a line like that. So I could

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.440
have untangled that. So if I can untangle it

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.660
that's fine. That's a valid map. And by

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.610
studying networks there are some features

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.550
of maps that we can learn by looking at

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.910
networks, this one in particular. In any

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.710
map you're going to have a country let's

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.010
call it A. Country A. Right, there's going

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.330
to be a country in every map that's

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.490
either just by itself,  like an

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.200
island, or country A is connected to one

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.000
other country; that might happen.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.360
Or country A is connected to two other

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.760
countries, so you'll get a network that

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.050
looks like that. That'd be country A

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.300
there in the middle, or you might have

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.010
country A which is connected to three

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.050
countries, this all seems perfectly

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.440
reasonable. That's A in the center. Country A

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.840
could be connected to 4 countries, (now put A in),

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.720
or country A could be connected

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.890
to 5 countries. And that all seems

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.280
reasonable, but every map will have at

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.710
least one country that looks like one of

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.130
these. What you can't have is every

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.940
country connected to six other countries

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.830
or more. All I'm saying is there is at

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.260
least one country in that map that's

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.720
either connected to one, or two, or three,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.240
or four, or five. But if you have a map

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.550
where they're all mutually connected to

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.760
six or more countries, that's a network

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.310
that can't be untangled. So all maps have

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.340
this feature one of the countries is one

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.010
of these on this list. Now we can start

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.540
talking about the four color theorem

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.330
this is actually going to be useful. So the

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.880
four color theorem is hard to prove and

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.500
they tried for a long time, like I said

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.850
it took 125 years. They did manage to

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.430
prove easier versions of the four color

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.590
theorem. So the four color theorem means

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.380
there are no maps that need five colors.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:40.120
I can probably prove that there are no

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.190
maps that need seven colors. That's

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.130
probably easier to explain okay. I'm

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.450
going to have a go. Okay imagine there

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.120
are maps that need seven colors. These

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.560
are maps that can't be done with better,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.790
right, so there are maps that need

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.520
seven. Pick the smallest one, okay, so

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.310
you've got a small one. Now, because it's

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.620
a map it's going to contain a country

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.330
which is going to be one of these A's

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.600
that I've called here on this list. So

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.420
take that country and pull it out, just

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.640
delete it, take it away. you've made a

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.890
smaller map. Now, because it's a smaller

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.340
map, that means you can do it in six

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.220
colors. Do you remember, the map I had was

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.310
the smallest that had to use seven? So if

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.530
I take a country away, smaller, I can do

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.590
it with six, great. If I put my country A

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.710
back in, that means i have a spare color

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.140
to use for A.  I mean the worst case

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.900
scenario is this last one here. and these

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.030
could be all different colors. If I

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:43.040
put A back in I'm still going to have a

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.020
spare color, a sixth color that i can use,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.170
which shows that the map can be done in

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.780
six colors after all. Now to show that

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.700
all maps can be done with five colors --

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.950
that's a little bit harder, the proof is

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.960
exactly the same, the proof is exactly

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.730
the same except, in this worst-case

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.340
scenario, down here at the end here um

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.860
it becomes harder, because if those are

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.350
five different colors, and you put your

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.350
country A back in, you might have to

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.120
reuse a color which you don't want to do.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.950
So the argument's a bit more complicated.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.990
you have to show that you can recolor it,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.200
and you still have a spare color for A.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.480
So it's a harder proof but it's along

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.780
the same lines. Then, they try to do it

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.570
with four; can we show that all maps can

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.610
be done with four colors? And that

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.760
argument doesn't quite work. It just

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.340
wasn't strong enough. So this went

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.260
unsolved for a long time. There were some

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.450
people who thought they'd proved it. They

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:39.800
thought they'd actually done it and

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.920
people accepted the proof, and they

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.960
thought it was solved for a decade. We

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.660
thought "Oh! It's done." And then oh! They found a

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.100
mistake and when actually that doesn't hold

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.830
up and then "Oh no, it wasn't proved."

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.390
And we have to go back to square one, we have

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.790
to find a way to prove this problem. So

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.580
it took till the 1970s to solve this

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.300
problem. So the final solution: it was

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.060
done by two guys, Kenneth Appel and

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.180
Wolfgang Haken from the University of

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.440
Illinois.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.530
They did it in 1976. It's kind of similar to my proof I

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.530
mentioned before. They made a list of

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.520
networks and they said, every map must

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.710
have at least one of these networks

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.530
within it. And they showed that every map

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.710
contains one of these networks. Each one

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.390
of those networks can be colored with

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.630
four colors or can be recolored with

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.910
four colors. And that -- that is enough to

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.490
show that every map can be done with

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.850
four colors. Now it is a hard proof and a

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:43.160
part of the problem was having to show

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.130
that this list could be colored with

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.200
four colors because it was a long list.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.320
There were -- how many networks was on this

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.060
list? 1,938 [sic] networks, and to do that they

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.760
used a computer. And that was

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.130
controversial at the time. This was the

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.710
first computer assisted proof in

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.220
mathematics. Now it's commonplace and

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.890
lots of mathematics is done with

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.620
computers, but this was the first, and

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.950
people were wary of this proof. For a

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:19.010
start, one of the problems is -- it involves

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.460
checking lots of cases. That's not the

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.740
best kind of proof. It is a proof and it is

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.310
valid, but the problem with that is it

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.690
doesn't give you a deeper understanding

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:32.900
of why something is true: just checking

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.680
lots of cases. Mathematicians not -- do not

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.230
necessarily like that kind of proof; it's

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.300
not the best kind. But it's still a valid

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.180
proof. The proof has been improved for

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.100
starts, we had this long list of networks

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.930
that we had to show we could color in.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.200
That got shortened. I think it got

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.450
shortened to some like 1400 and

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.490
something -- I think it's shorter now. I'm

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.260
not sure how short it is at the moment.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.900
At the moment though the proof still

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.720
requires this massive checking of cases,

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.900
so it's still not a beautiful proof.
