00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World
History and today in our final episode of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.020
this World History series we're going to return
to some of our favorite themes, like the rise

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.260
of the state; maybe the idea of "The West"; and also
we're going to speculate a little bit about the future.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.590
Mr. Green! Mr. Green! No, no, no...I-I thought
you were from the future.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.289
Nope! I'm from your future, Me From the Past,
so I know that NSYNC doesn't stay together,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.449
but I'm from my present. Although, now I'm
from my past. No, present again. That's the

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.249
problem with the future, me from the past. It keeps
briefly becoming present and then becoming past.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.550
And then of course people watching the videos
will be watching them in their present, which

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.339
will be my ever more distant past. And they
could be watching them in ten years, the things

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.370
that I have predicted will have come true
or not come true, and I will look like a genius

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.250
or an idiot. Ahhh I'm freakin' out Stan! Just
roll the intro.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.899
Man, I'm glad that intro pulled me out of
that logic loop. I could have been stuck in

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.479
there forever, which reminds me that forever
itself is a very weird concept. I think the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.070
only thing we can say about forever is that
the future is forever.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.119
So Americans are pretty proud of their democratic
government and its history, but in world historical

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.460
terms, democracy has not been the norm. Like
the 20th century was the high tide for democracy

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.469
worldwide with the number of democratic governments
increasing dramatically, but the 2000's so

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.609
far have seen something of a anti-democratic
renaissance with the number of democracies

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.630
that shouldn't actually be called democracies,
doubling between 2006 and 2009. Like the People's

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.299
Democratic Republic of Korea, despite having
democratic in the name, not particularly democratic...

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.460
I'm sorry for saying that Kim Jong-un, but
it's true... He's behind me, isn't he Stan?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.979
You'll be gone in 20 years, that's my first
prediction.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.999
Also, while democracy can sound great, no
countries have ever actually practiced pure

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.780
democracy. Unless you count Ancient Athens
which a) was not a country, it was a city

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.240
state and b) it excluded women and slaves
from the political process so it wasn't really

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.939
a pure democracy. Because you know, like, most
people didn't get to participate in the government.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.160
What we call democracies today are actually
the result of a number of revolutions in political

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.520
thought that happened mostly in the west between
the 17th and 20th centuries. Like, we've talked

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.940
a lot about the first of these revolutions
in political thought which happened in the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.530
17th century with the creation of the centralized
nation state in Europe. And then there was

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.910
the political breakthrough put forth by John
Stuart Mill, who envisioned a night watchmen

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.520
state that was like too small to infringe
on individuals' freedoms but efficient enough

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.950
to be functional and useful as a government.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.890
Then in the late 19th and early 20th century,
the west developed the idea of the modern

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.650
welfare state, enshrining the belief that
the state should provide things like education,

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.600
health and unemployment insurance to enable
citizens to lead fulfilling lives. The welfare

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.620
state relies on government planning and bureaucrats
who get their jobs not based on high birth

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.420
but on merits and also data-driven answers
to problems. And so we saw the rise of technocrats

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.030
and intellectuals influencing government policy.
To quote the book called "The Fourth Revolution,"

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.250
there were two things new about this welfare
state. "The taxation of the entire population

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.830
to provide benefits for the unfortunate and
the removal of the 'poor law' stigma from

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.780
social welfare. The poor were now victims,
not layabouts."

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.860
So, in contemporary Europe and the United
States, everyone pays taxes, right. Whether

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.830
it's consumption taxes or property taxes or
income taxes or whatever. And we don't view

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.670
poverty merely as personal failing but as
a problem that needs to be addressed. And

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.980
although imperialism certainly made it problematic
for these ideas to spread completely throughout

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
the world, the ideas did prove very powerful,
like India adopted a heavily top down welfare

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.820
state based on British principles once it
became independent. And even when the liberal

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.710
democratic state came under ideological attack
from fascists and communists, it was able

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.730
to triumph by mustering the resources to win
World War II and meet the Soviet Challenge

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.090
during the Cold War. And for most of the 20th
century, western democracies have been on

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.830
the whole, pretty successful in providing peace
and stability and prosperity to their own citizens.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.370
And yet, many parts of the world are turning
away from these ideas now. Why? Well, one

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.400
of the reasons democracy may be falling out
of favor is that many of the most successful

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.250
countries in the world, at least in terms
of economic growth are not democratic. There

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.630
are democracies experiencing tremendous economic
growth like Brazil and India. But then of

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.330
course there's China. And China along with
countries like Singapore have looked to the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.250
west for guidance on how to create capitalism
but they've been much less interested in adopting

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.040
Western models of governance.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.480
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.070
So Singapore might only have 5.2 million inhabitants
but it has very effective government. The

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.310
architect of its success, Lee Kuan Yew, has
argued that cultural values are the explanation

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.960
and that Asians are quote, "More focused on
the family, more devoted to education and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.960
saving; and more willing to put faith in a
Mandarin elite than the West." But it's probably

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.370
more due to Singapore's being more authoritarian,
more interventionist, and more bossy in following

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.790
Lee's Hobbesian view that, "Human beings,
regrettable though it may be, are inherently

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.880
vicious and have to be restrained from their
viciousness."

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.640
Although Singapore isn't technically a one
party state it's also very far from a traditional

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.860
democracy. Like in 2011 Lee's People's Action
Party won 60% of the vote and 93% of the seats

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.280
in Congress. That may sound terrible but it
has an upside. Knowing that their party will

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.120
win elections allows Singapore's politicians
to focus on something else. Namely long-term

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.620
planning. If any of the particularly "Asian"
traditions cited by Lee have fueled Singapore's

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.050
success it's that Mandarin ideal of choosing
and promoting skilled bureaucrats based on

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.310
merit. The most interesting thing about Singapore's
government is that, at least by Western standards,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.030
it's remarkably small, with like, for instance
a world class education system that consumes

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.050
only 3.3% of Gross Domestic Product. They
also have a required retirement fund in which

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.810
Singaporeans contribute 20% of their paycheck
and their employers kick in another 15.5%.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.820
AND as you'll already know if you watch our
show Healthcare Triage, Singapore has one

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.340
of the most efficient and fascinating health care
systems in the world. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.370
And then there's China with its gleaming skyscrapers,
enormous number of billionaires, and what

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.230
is now the second largest economy in the world.
Now, of course, there's also the air pollution,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.500
the growing income disparity, the terrible
working conditions, but hundreds of millions

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.040
of people in China have emerged from poverty
in the last 50 years. And this was all accomplished

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.780
by a very repressive state, so repressive,
in fact, that they can't see this video. The

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.200
Chinese model of governance has often been
called authoritarian capitalism and its architect

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.540
was Deng Xiaoping. He was very impressed by
Singapore and sought to copy them, and in

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.540
many ways, the Chinese Communist party has
been very successful at that. Despite some

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.550
official corruption, the Chinese state is
very efficient and has presided over an incredible

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.160
economic and social transformation in the
past 30 years. So we expect, like, rigid central

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.400
planning from Communist parties, right? But
in China, rather than setting goals for every

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.960
facet of the economy, the party makes sure
that it's represented in most big companies,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.580
private and state-owned.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.600
And the biggest companies owned by the government
dominate strategic industries like energy

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.960
and transportation and telecommunications.
The Communist Party’s Organization Department

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.199
appoints all senior corporate figures in China.
And in general they‘ve done a good job of

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.699
promoting good managers that help the companies
to grow.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.919
And China certainly wants this model to go
global, since its state owwned companies have

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:35.070
funded 80% of China’s direct foreign investment
in the last 30 years, which allows commerce

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.160
to advance Chinese diplomacy, extending the
nation’s so-called “soft power.”

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.110
So who knows if this will actually work, but
when Chinese state companies are able to build

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.870
the new African Union headquarters in Ethiopia,
for instance, it sends a powerful signal to

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.560
African nations that this is a system where
people can get things done.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.320
Meanwhile, in the United States and much of
Europe... a little bit of a struggle to get

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.919
things done. So Chinese state capitalism may
sound like the wave of the future, or at least

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:06.910
the wave of the present. But maybe not. It
has some serious drawbacks. First, the close

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.490
ties between business and politics opens the
system up to massive corruption.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.660
Fortunately, here in the United States, we
don’t have any ties between business and

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.800
politics, so you won’t see any corruption
here!

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.699
But there are also other drawbacks to authoritarian
capitalism, like state-run industries tend

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:26.560
not to be responsive to investors, which limits
private investment. And in the long-term,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.250
that may limit the money available to them
to keep growing.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.659
Also, with a lot of these state-owned industries,
it’s not actually clear that they’re productive

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.779
or profitable because they rely so heavily
on government subsidies.

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:41.229
And finally state-owned industries don’t
to a great job of encouraging the freedom

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:46.040
of expression that fuels a lot of, like, cultural
and intellectual industries like, for instance

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.779
Hollywood. Which is more cultural than intellectual.

00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:53.309
The Fourth Revolution quotes one Chinese commenter
as saying: “We have [kung-fu] and we have

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:56.689
pandas, but we could not make a film like
Kung-fu Panda.”

00:08:56.689 --> 00:09:01.110
Also, this kind of state-run industrial policy
is very effective sometimes, but it’s not

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.879
clear that it’s going to be effective all
the time. Like it may work better for building

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:08.430
roads and cell towers than for creating software,
for instance.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.360
So it seems to work for less developed nations
that need to build infrastructure and industry;

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.339
it’s much less clear that it will be effective when
they need to move over to being service economies.

00:09:17.339 --> 00:09:21.939
And what I find fascinating is that China
has created this new path to economic growth

00:09:21.939 --> 00:09:27.149
in part by looking to its ancient past to
revitalize its government. Because they've

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:33.240
created a new education-based meritocracy, which
is a modern version of the Han examination system.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.709
It’s sort of like a state run version of
Plato’s Republic, and polls indicate that

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:43.089
most Chinese people are pretty comfortable with it.
I mean, things ARE getting better in China.

00:09:43.089 --> 00:09:47.480
Like philanthropist Nicolas Berggruen argues
that "Chinese-style meritocracy is good at

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:52.250
focusing on long-term problems and bringing
in independent experts."

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.700
That said, China’s government isn’t always
as meritocratic and effective as some might

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:00.670
want to believe. I mean, the Chinese version
of twitter is a litany of complaints about

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.390
poor schools and dirty hospitals and inept
local officials.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.960
And in the wake of the Sichuan earthquake,
when many children died because of poorly

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.640
built schools, there was widespread outrage over the
government's inability to like, get things built well.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.300
All that noted, it’s important to be aware
that China embodies a challenge to the idea

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.340
that the West has all the answers in terms
of economics and government.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.339
Particularly after the 2008 financial crisis,
the Chinese were the ones lecturing about

00:10:27.339 --> 00:10:32.300
government and fiscal policy and claiming
that the American political system was rewarding

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:37.749
mediocrity over talent. And lots of Americans
would agree with these Chinese critics. I

00:10:37.749 --> 00:10:43.699
mean, we can’t even get a long-term highway
bill passed, let alone like, long-term planning

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:45.160
for the overall economy.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.790
In a representative democracy, the best way
to get elected is to make promises, usually

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:56.750
for lower taxes or for more or bigger benefits.
Or my favorite -- for both. Also, democratic

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:00.420
governments are very susceptible to interest
groups extracting benefits for themselves.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.860
Just as autocratic governments are very susceptible to,
you know, autocrats extracting benefits for themselves.

00:11:05.869 --> 00:11:09.879
And the problems of democracy can be a bit
of a vicious cycle. Like in the United States

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:14.519
at least, we're incredibly dissatisfied with
our government, especially Congress, and this

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.880
is partly because we’ve come to expect so much
from government that they constantly let us down.

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:24.069
Also, for the last 35 years or so, because
people are so dissatisfied with government,

00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:29.050
one of the main strategies for winning political
office is to talk bad about the government

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.569
and to say that government is the problem.

00:11:31.569 --> 00:11:36.569
But of course, if we have too much government,
that’s a problem that can only be fixed…

00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:39.179
by the government.
So where does this leave us? Well, maybe we

00:11:39.179 --> 00:11:44.099
have reached the end of “the rise of the
west?” that began with the nation state.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.759
But it’s really hard to predict the future!
Like when I was in high school I wouldn’t

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:52.540
have predicted that so many people would be
learning about history and science from YouTube

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.610
videos, much less that China would become
the world’s second largest economy.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.619
If you’d asked me if 500 million people
would emerge from absolute poverty between

00:12:00.619 --> 00:12:04.970
the time I graduated from high school and
the time I started hosting Crash Course World

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.319
History, I would have been like, no way!

00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:11.459
But I wouldn’t have said that. I would have cursed
in class because I was a surly, terrible student.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.860
But here are my predictions -- I think that
China will continue to be a one party state,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.509
and a very successful one, as long as that
combination of state and industry continues

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:22.929
to provide a rising standard of living.

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:25.779
But I don’t think it’s going to happen
in the U.S. or Europe, even if it would lead

00:12:25.779 --> 00:12:27.110
to more efficiency.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.879
The major differences between these two models
of governance is that unlike communism and

00:12:30.879 --> 00:12:36.720
western style capitalism, they aren’t in
direct conflict. Like, they can coexist.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.869
And I think authoritarian capitalism and western
style capitalism WILL coexist, but I also

00:12:41.869 --> 00:12:47.149
think that probably in that process Western
style democracies will find that over time,

00:12:47.149 --> 00:12:49.929
they have money to do less.

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:52.920
And I think we may have a lot to learn from
countries like Singapore, especially as new

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.519
technologies enable greater efficiencies in
providing services, thereby making a lot of

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:01.170
jobs obsolete. Possibly including mine.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.730
I mean, these days robots are writing some
reasonably good short stories, and Stan now

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.460
has enough tape of my voice that he could
make an excellent artificial me.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.499
One of the reasons we focused so much in this
world history series on the factors that go

00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:16.999
into making a nation state is that while lots
of people think that nation states are about

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:18.670
to go away, I don’t.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.920
Yes, corporations are becoming more powerful
and multi-national, but in many ways China’s

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.920
rise to power was the result of a nationalistic
desire to amass wealth and power that has

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.200
its roots going back at least to the 19th
century, if not earlier.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.600
But I want to make two observations here at
the end -- first, whatever you think will

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.549
happen in the future, whatever you think is
happening now, even what you think happened

00:13:39.549 --> 00:13:44.429
in the past, really depends on what information
you choose to focus on.

00:13:44.429 --> 00:13:48.240
So this year we’ve tried to look at really
big-picture history and approaches to the

00:13:48.249 --> 00:13:52.839
study of history and how we learn about it,
because there are choices involved.

00:13:52.839 --> 00:13:56.920
For instance, we focused a lot on the rise
of the nation state and trade, but we could

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.649
have focused on the changing role of the family
or the impact of technology on lifespan or

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:05.470
changes and continuities in religious practice
or any number of other things.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.460
The other thing I want to say about history and
the future is that neither is actually determined.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.040
30 years from now, of course we’ll know
a lot about what happens in the next 30 years,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.119
but we’ll also be looking at the past differently
from how we look at it now.

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:22.369
And YOU are a part of that. The choices that
you make over the course of your life will

00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:27.720
shape history both in the future AND in the
past. In short, we ask you to think about

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.389
history and how to study it because we are
counting on you.

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:35.999
But history encompasses a lot and there is
more than one history of the world. I hope

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:40.420
you've enjoyed some of the versions that we’ve
presented. Thank you so much for watching.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.309
Crash Course is filmed here in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio and it’s made possible

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:49.739
by our Patreon supporters, including Charlie
Shread and Scott Delea who are our cosponsors

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:53.619
of today’s video. Charlie, Scott -- thank
you so much.

00:14:53.619 --> 00:14:57.970
Patreon is a great website that allows you
to support Crash Course directly on a monthly

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.069
basis. We used to have Subbable, but it got
acquired by Patreon. It’s a great company,

00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:06.199
please check it out, there are amazing perks,
but the biggest perk is that we get to keep

00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:08.730
Crash Course free for everyone forever.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:13.119
Only about 3% of Crash Course viewers need
to pay to support the other 97%. So to the

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:18.089
3%, we say thank you, to the 97%, we want
to say thank you too. If it becomes 4%, who

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:22.679
knows, you might see more World History videos
in the future. Thanks again so much for watching

00:15:22.679 --> 00:15:25.659
and as we say in my hometown, don’t forget
to be awesome.
