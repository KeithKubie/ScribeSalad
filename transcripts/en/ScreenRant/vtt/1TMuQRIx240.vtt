00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.299
Every actor can be in a bad film; even Robert
De Niro and Al Pacino had Righteous Kill.

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:16.070
But more often than not, these are missteps
are merely blips on the radar amidst a prolonged

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.070
run of success.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.600
Then there are those who star in one bad feature
and see their Hollywood dreams come crashing

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.690
back down to Earth.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.310
Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Movies That Killed
Actors� Careers.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.310
Attack of the Clones

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.660
Hayden Christensen was coming off a Golden
Globe nod for his acclaimed turn in Life as

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.500
a House, so playing Anakin Skywalker in the
final two Star Wars prequels was his ticket

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.880
to the mainstream, right?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.540
There�s some debate as to whether it was
Christensen�s acting abilities or George

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.180
Lucas� poor writing that turned the actor
into one of the most reviled figures in the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.130
franchise, but there�s no denying he was
never the same after complaining about the

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.290
roughness of sand.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.320
Though he has lent his talents to smaller
films, he hasn�t headlined a major picture

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.220
since Jumper in 2008.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.310
His career certainly turned to the Dark Side.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.490
Showgirls

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.430
Looking to shed her Saved by the Bell good
girl persona, Elizabeth Berkley teamed up

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.200
with shock master Paul Verhoeven for Showgirls,
an exploration of the seedy world of strip

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
clubs.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.100
The film generated a lot of attention for
being the first widely released NC-17 film

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.130
and in the end it turned out to be all hype.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.909
Critics considered it tasteless and non-sexy
despite its raunchy subject matter, and the

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.700
generic script and wooden acting couldn�t
get it past the �guilty pleasure� stage.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.979
It has a cult following now, but at the time
of its release, Showgirls was heavily derived,

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.189
�winning� a then-record seven Razzies
and failing to earn back its budget at the

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.869
box office.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.549
Boat Trip

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.349
Jerry Maguire put Cuba Gooding, Jr. on the
map and his meteoric rise to stardom was matched

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.529
by how quickly he fell.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.270
After a vengeful travel agent purposely books
Jerry Robinson and his friend Nick on a gays

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.260
single cruise, the two heterosexuals are forced
to pretend they�re gay just so they can

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060
get close to the boat�s dance instructor.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.180
Accused of being homophobic and embracing
juvenile stereotypes, Boat Trip found new

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.569
and interesting ways to offend viewers of
any sexual orientation.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.290
Though Jerry does learn to view the world
in a better light, this film certainly isn�t

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.090
as progressive as one might have hoped.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.079
I Know Who Killed Me

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.420
We think we know what killed Lindsay Lohan�s
career.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.349
Looking for a change-of-pace after Mean Girls,
Lohan settled on this horror/thriller about

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.920
a serial killer victim who claims she is someone
else when found alive.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.230
That�s potentially a meaty role, but this
film was hampered by a ludicrous plot that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.510
failed to hold audiences� interest.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.900
Many saw it as trashy and distasteful, and
thought that nothing in the plot gave the

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.900
movie any suspense.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.500
Instead of embracing a B-movie campy tone,
director Chris Siverston tried to inject it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.829
with artistic sensibilities, which only made
matters worse.

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.620
Lohan never became the serious actress she
wanted to be, and has had trouble finding

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.440
work ever since.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.950
The Love Guru

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.930
Mike Myers is one of the biggest names in
comedy, but even he isn�t untouchable.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.510
The Love Guru was a critical and commercial
bomb that faded the funnyman into obscurity.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.049
The consensus was that the film relied too
much on thin gross-out gags instead of genuine

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.090
humor to get its laughs, creating a movie
that was crass and repulsive.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.510
Finding much of its �humor� in poking
fun at Indian dialect and religious beliefs,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:51.880
the film was also deemed culturally insensitive
to the Hindu people by many who saw it.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.480
Obscene and offensive, The Love Guru will
make you question if you�ll ever laugh at

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.090
a comedy again.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.170
Those are our picks for movies that killed
careers.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.019
