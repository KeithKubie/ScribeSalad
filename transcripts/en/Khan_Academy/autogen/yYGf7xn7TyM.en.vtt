00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.250
 Mohammed decides to record the count 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.019
 the leaves of the tree in his backyard every year. 

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.372
 In the first year it had 500 sheets. 

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:10.580
 Every year the number of leaves 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.101
 was 40% more than the previous one. 

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.325
 Let n be a positive integer and let f be a n denote 

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.220
 the number of leaves in the backyard of Mohammed 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.634
 during the nth year after he started tracking them. 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.840
 The expression f of n specifies a number. 

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.339
 What kind of array is f of n? 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.059
 So, some of you 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:31.933
 they can think right away. 

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.473
 Each year the number increases by 40%, 

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.978
 which is the same as the multiplication of 1.4. 

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:39.450
 Every successive period is multiplied 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.844
 or divide into the same number. 

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.126
 This will be a geometrical progression. 

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.219
 Let's make it clear a little more, 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.260
 just in case. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.720
 Let's make a small table here. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.900
 This is n, and this is f of n. 

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:57.084
 When n equals 1, 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:58.920
 the first year n is equal to 1, 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.600
 there were 500 sheets, or f of n is 500. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 When n equals 2, we will have 

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:04.884
 an increase of 40%, 

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:08.035
 which is the same as the multiplication of 1.4. 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.327
 500 by 1.4, with 40% of 500 being 200, 

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:14.440
 the number will increase by 200, 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.320
 therefore we will have 700. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.200
 In the third year we will increase by 40% to 700, 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.981
 which is 280, so we will have 980 sheets. 

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:28.376
 Note that this is definitely not an arithmetic progression. 

00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:30.300
 We add an arithmetic progression 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.425
 or subtract the same amount each time, 

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.198
 but now we do not. 

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.371
 Here, from 500 to 700, we have an increase of 200, 

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.856
 then from 700 to 980 we have an increase of 280. 

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:40.085
 We multiply or divide by 

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.467
 the same quantity each time. 

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:45.140
 In this case we multiply by 1.4 each time. 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.760
 Therefore, we definitely have a geometric progression. 

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.756
 Depending on your answer to the question above, 

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:50.256
 the recurrent definition of the row 

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:53.535
 may have one of the following two forms. 

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:55.221
 This is a good arithmetic form 

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.009
 we know we do not have in this case, so we will 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.437
 we have the geometric shape. 

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.215
 And then he asks what the values ​​are 

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:03.551
 of parameters A and B for the row? 

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:05.862
 So here's the base case, 

00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:09.246
 f of n is equal to A when n equals 1. 

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:11.190
 We know that when n equals 1, 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.220
 we had 500 leaves on the tree, 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.180
 so this A here is 500. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.920
 A is 500. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.220
 Then, if we are not in the base case, 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.320
 for each next year we have, let's see, 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.820
 we have the previous year multiplied by what? 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.039
 We will have the previous year, up 40%. 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.860
 To increase by 40%, multiply by 1.4, 

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:37.989
 so B will be 1.4. 

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.445
 You take the previous year and multiply 

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:41.565
 1.4 for each subsequent year, 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.291
 for each year other than n equal to 1. 

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.989
 So, B equals 1.4 and we are ready. 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.425
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:49.915
 This is funny. 

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:55.089
 Okay, here it says: Siu-Yun organizes a party. 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.597
 She has a 50 party gift to hand out and 

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.502
 gives 3 gifts to each guest 

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.360
 at the time of their arrival. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.150
 Let n be a positive integer and let g of n denote 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.150
 the number of party gifts that Sio-Yun has 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.906
 before the nth guest arrives. 

00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:16.090
 Well, actually, even before we even look at these questions, 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.431
 let's draw a table here because it says 

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.818
 before the nth guest. 

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.561
 I want to make sure I understand it correctly. 

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.476
 So it's n 

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.122
 and then it will be g of n, 

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:29.213
 right here. 

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.407
 When n is equal to 1, g of n is, 

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:37.012
 or g of 1 is the number of party gifts, 

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:40.005
 which Sio-Yun had before the first guest. 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.824
 Well, before the first guest she had a 50 party gift. 

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:45.775
 She had 50 gifts for the party. 

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:48.740
 Now, the second guest comes. 

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:50.600
 The number of gifts she has before the second guest, 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.460
 she had to give 3 to the first, 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.220
 so now there will be 47 gifts. 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.820
 When n equals 3, 

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.429
 how much a party present she has 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.568
 before the third guest? 

00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:06.390
 He had to give gifts 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.835
 the first and second guest, each receiving 3. 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.500
 So now there will be 44 and I think you notice the regularity. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.020
 When n is equal to 1, g of n is 50 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.596
 and every time we increase n by 1. 

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:23.500
 Every time we increase n, we increase g by n with plus 3, 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.237
 I had to say minus 3, 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.040
 because she gives gifts to the party, so minus 3. 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.058
 Because the difference between successive members 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.460
 is the same, we know that this is an arithmetical progression. 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.020
 This is an arithmetical progression and should 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.500
 to write the formula for explicit set of the row. 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.680
 Let's think about it. 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.242
 Let's say g of n will be equal to ... 

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.949
 Let's see, we'll start at 50, 

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:53.590
 then we take out 3 and let us think, 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.787
 whether we get 3 in n or whether ...? 

00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:59.503
 Let's see the first guest 

00:04:59.503 --> 00:05:01.318
 we pulled out 3 times. 

00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.406
 For the second guest we remove 3 once. 

00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:07.941
 For the third guest we draw 3 times. 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.080
 For the nth guest we will draw 3 n minus 1 times. 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.960
 Notice, for the 3rd guest we pulled out 3 times. 

00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:19.237
 The second guest - we pulled out 3 times. 

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:21.573
 The first guest - we pulled out 3 times, 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.590
 so this is so. 

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:25.576
 For the first guest we will draw 3 zero times 

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.405
 and so g of 1 will be 50. 

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:29.782
 We can see that this is consistent for all of these. 

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:34.372
 So I can write 50 minus 3 minus n minus 1, 

00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:35.871
 by really recommending making the table, 

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:37.740
 just to make sure you get n minus 1 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.915
 or n properly, and that's all.
