00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's see how do we solve this, first I want to identify

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where is that roller coaster will be going the fastest and the answer is when it's down here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is the lowest point in the roller coaster and therefore the point with the lowest potential energy,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which means the high is kinetic energy and let's see, down here, what kind of energy it does have.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It has kinetic energy. I know it's going to be moving down here and it didn't have

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a little bit of potential energy if I'm using the ground as my reference point for zero, so let's see.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Energy is conserved means energy appear equals energy down here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Roller coaster starts at rest, which means it starts with only potential energy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think we're going to call this h₁ to distinguish it from this h over here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
By the time it gets to the bottom, it still has a little bit of potential energy and it has kinetic.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
We know motion doesn't depend on mass and luckily the mass is cancelled out.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I can do a little bit of massaging of this equation to get into this form for v²

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and to solve for velocity, I just take the square root and look at that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All that matters, the only way that height comes into this equation is through the change in height, h₁-h₂,.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
This is really pointing out the fact that we can choose our zero point anywhere

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and all that matters is the change in height.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Well let's plug in our numbers, when I do this I get a very nice number, I get the √900

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which is exactly 30 m/s.
