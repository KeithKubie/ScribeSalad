Awesome. All right, does anybody
know how old this library is?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.480
Does anybody -- do you know?

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.040
How old? [inaudible
response] Little bit older.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.510
Let's count in years.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.560
Does anyone maybe have a guess?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.190
&gt;&gt; A million?

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No, it's not a million years old.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.060

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.280
&gt;&gt; Nope, so the library's
216 years old.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.670
Does anyone know someone
that's that old?

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.970
[inaudible response] No.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.270
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No. [laughing] The Young Readers
Center is only six years old, right?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.960
So we are a very, very
new part of the library.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.520 position:56%
We don lots of programs like the one

It's free and open to the public.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.940
We also do a lot of
these author events

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.900
that you're a part
of, like this morning.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.220
But I won't take up
any more of your time.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm going to introduce Chris,
who will take over from now.

&gt;&gt; You already had the slide here.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.460
Okay, good.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.760
Excellent.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.060
I'm right there.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.360
So you guys are in
the fifth grade right?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.660
[inaudible response] Right?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.960
That's my fifth grade class
picture up there on the screen.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.470
Have you guys been able to figure
out which one of those kids I was

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.060
when I was in the fifth grade?

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.820
Anybody want to take a guess?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.620
Yes?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.500
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.300
The one with the red shirt?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.600
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.900
&gt;&gt; The blue?

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.200
[inaudible response] This one here?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.500
Over here?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.800
That's the teacher.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.100
That's Misses Nays.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.400
[phonetic] [inaudible
response] I don' t know.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.560
Oh, here? No, his hair is blonde.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.860
[inaudible response] Which one?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.160
[inaudible response] This one?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.460
[inaudible response] This one?

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.760
That's a girl.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.300
&gt;&gt; No. Right there.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.600
&gt;&gt; This one?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.900
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.200
&gt;&gt; That's a girl too!

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.500
[laughter] It was 1965.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.460
Things were a little strange back
there, but her hair is blonde.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.140
What color's my hair?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.440
&gt;&gt; Gray.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.740
&gt;&gt; Black.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.750
&gt;&gt; What color did my
hair used to be?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.050
&gt;&gt; Black!

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.350
&gt;&gt; Black. It used to be black.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.650
Yes!

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.950
&gt;&gt; Is it the one with the
blue shirt right there?

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.250
&gt;&gt; Blue shirt?

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.550
&gt;&gt; By the teacher.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right there by the teacher.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.150
He's got a receding hairline,
looks like he's going bald.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.450
[laughter] No.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.750
I didn't start going bald
until like 15-20 years ago.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.430
That guy was going bald
in the fifth grade.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.070
By the time we got to sixth grade
we all called him Chrome Dome.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.460
Yes, which one was I?

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.600
[inaudible response] Black hair
with the glasses over here?

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.860
That's a very good guess.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.270
By the teacher?

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.570
Oh, that's the same guy.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.870
No, that's baldy there.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.440
No, I'm going to give
you a little clue.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.720
[laughter] When I was in the
fifth grade my eyesight was better

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.080
than it is today.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.510
I did not wear glasses when
I was in the fifth grade.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.810
Yes, back there.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Is it the one with the red shirt?

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.130
&gt;&gt; Red shirt?

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.430
That one right there?

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.730
The one who looks like
a little angel

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.800
who just fell down from heaven.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.910
[inaudible response] Yeah,
that was me in the fifth grade.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.770
[laughter] Yeah, that was me.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.340
I don't think I've ever
looked that innocent again.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.160
I show you that picture
for a couple reasons.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.020
One; to prove before my
hair started turning gray --

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.400
thank you very much --
before I started going bald

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.480
up here I was actually the same age
as you guys and the fifth grade is

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.070
when I first really
started having fun writing.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.370
I used to do these
little comic books.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.670
My mom saved one.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.920
I used to do these comic books
where I'd draw the pictures

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.220
and fill in the captions.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.520
Any of you guys do that?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.150
Anyone draw little comic --
oh, it's fun to do isn't it?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.560
And give them to your
friends and stuff.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.860
Do it during recess.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.540
You'll get in a lot less
trouble than I used to get in.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.730
And in fifth grade I won my
first writing award ever.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.530
It was the Lions Club -- I grew
up in Signal Mountain, Tennessee

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.120
and we had a Lions Club
that had an essay contest

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.930
and I won that contest.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.230
And the fifth grade is also when I
first started reading Mad Magazine.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.430
Any of you guys still
read Mad Magazine?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.970
Oh, [inaudible response]
yeah, Mad's got a TV show.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.540
I got to work with Orlando Jones.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.320
Yeah, and so that's where -- that
taught me a lot about the power

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.630
of words when I was in fifth grade
because I was the kind of kid

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.960
in the fifth grade that bullies
used to pick on and they would

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.910
like try to jump me and stuff.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.980
And I got to the point where I
realized that I could use my wits

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.080
and my words to defeat them.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.570
So Mad Magazine helped
me out a lot with that.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.990
And then when I got into junior
high school -- there I am.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.540
You can tell my mother used
to put a bowl on her -- hu?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.740
[inaudible response] Yeah, I got
a B plus on this because we had

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.240
to write an essay; "What do you
want to be when you grow up?"

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.580
And then up to that point I
wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.460
or an engineer like my father
was, but I had decided --

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.940
because in seventh grade I had a
teacher who wrote in the margins

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.580
of my paper, "You will make your
living as a writer someday."

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.250
And you know when a teacher tells
you something it has to be true

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.120
because all teachers take a solemn
vow to never lie to children.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.420
Am I right teachers?

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.720
They remember that day.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.020
It's a big day in their lives.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.590 position:56%
They raise their right hand and
say, "I will never lie to children."

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.810
So when that teacher told
me that it meant a lot to me

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.230
because you know your parents
can say stuff like you know, "Oh,

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.100
Chris you could be a writer!"

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.500
But they're your parents, they get
paid to say nice things about you.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.690
So when a teacher told me this I
thought maybe I could be a writer.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.540
So in eighth grade I
had to write this essay;

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.120
"What do you want to
be when you grow up?"

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.540
And I wrote, "But now my mind
wanders to a new thought,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.620
to be a comedian or
a writer is my quest.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.990
If this flops I would be
content to be a millionaire

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.210
and run Grabenstein's
Department Stores,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.880
if I could ever fit
the name on the sign."

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.180
I got a B plus.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.690
Anyone think I should've gotten
at least an A minus on that maybe?

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.750
A minus? Yeah, thank you mam.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.110
[inaudible response]
Basically the same thing,

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.550
but I would have felt
better with the A minus.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.850
I don't know why.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.150
As a kid, I always did.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.530 position:56%
And then I went to high school --
and we had real long hair back then.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.690
This is like -- hair down to here.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.320 position:56%
Yeah, we were all hippies back then.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.320
And I had a really, really good
English teacher in ninth grade.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.830
I went to Notre Dame Catholic High
School in Chattanooga, Tennessee,

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.190
which is where I grew up.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.560
And I had this teacher named
Shack Van Duzen [phonetic]

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.030
and he's had two books dedicated
to him so far because he

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.420
like completely changed my life.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.760
He introduced me to Mark
Twain and Shakespeare.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.530
Yes sir.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.530
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.350
Yeah, I never could do the dreads.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.650
I just had the -- I
think I had down here --

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.990
like down -- really long hair.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.080
We all had the long hair
back there in the 60s.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.130
So this Shack Van Duzen was the
one who opened up my eyes on stuff

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.230
like Shakespeare and Mark
Twain and things like that.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.580
So he was really influential.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.360
And then I went to college and
I studied theater and journalism

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.050
at the University of
Tennessee in Knoxville.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.350
Anybody here from Tennessee at all?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.700
Anyone ever been to Tennessee?

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.660
That's where I grew
up was in Tennessee.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.890
And then in 1979, before anybody
else in this room was born,

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.520
I moved to New York City and I
used to do improvisational comedy

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.950
with a troop in Greenwich Village.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.970
We would just make up stories and
songs from audience suggestions

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.180
and we had a guy named
Bruce Willis in our troop.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.950
He shaved his head and
moved to California.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.320
We don't know what happened to him.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.260
And the late Robin Williams --
that's him right there and there.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.240
Whenever he was in town he
would jump up on stage with us

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.750
and we would make up
stories and songs.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.800
So I was still like
having fun making things

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.290
up and creating things.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.590
And then I wrote for the Muppets.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.130
Do you guys ever watch the Muppets?

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.430
&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah! And then I did a made for
TV movie called The Christmas Gift,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.080
starring John Denver, with a
buddy of mine from college.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.410
We wrote this movie and it was
first on CBS way back in 1986

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.460
and it's still on television
every year.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.590
I know this because my
mother calls up and tells me.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.600
She says, "Chris, your
movie's going to be on;

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.830
three o'clock in the morning
on the Hallmark Channel."

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.020
I think my mother is the only
one still watching that movie.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.170
And then I wrote radio

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.100
and television commercials
for almost 20 years.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.800
That was my career for a while.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.600
I wrote for KFC and Dr Pepper
and 7 Up and Burger King.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.000 position:56%
And guess who my first boss was when
I wrote Burger King commercials;

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.660
a guy named James Patterson.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.100
Have any of you ever heard of him?

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.400
[inaudible response]
Oh, in the back.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.280
Yeah! [laughing] Number
one, bestselling author

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.710
in the history of authors.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.260
He's in the "Guinness
Book of World Records"

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.810
for having more number one
best sellers than any author.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.480
So he was my first boss and now
we're starting to write books.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.060 position:56%
Now we flash forward ahead and
these are all the books I've written

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.120
that -- I guess they've all -- I
think are probably in the Library

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.450
of Congress now because -- yeah!

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.750
Yeah, I wrote a bunch of books.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.960
And I write books now
with James Patterson.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.200 position:56%
We did the "Treasure Hunters" series
together and the "I Funny" series

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.500
and the "House of Robots."

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.800
And we -- this is a new book.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.100
It's not even out yet.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.400
It comes out in a couple of weeks.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.700
Called, "Jackie Ha-Ha"
that he and I did.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.490
But -- and I did these books
called, "The Island of Dr. Libris."

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:53.710
Yes, what's your question?

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.290
[inaudible question]
Did I draw the pictures?

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.340
No, someone else does
that because when I was

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.980
in fifth grade discovering that
I had a talent for writing,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.340
some other fifth graders were
finding out they were pretty good

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.020
at drawing stuff and they went

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.600
and developed all the skills
to go with their talent.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.480
So the illustrators -- there's a
lady named Laura Park in Chicago

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:14.230
who does the "I Funny" and there's
another lady in Canada that does

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.730
"Treasure Hunters"
and "House of Robots."

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.880
And "Jackie Ha-Ha" was done by
a pair of artists in France.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.680
Yes?

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.500
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.000
Uh hu? [inaudible response] Uh hu.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.240
[inaudible response]
Oh, that's good!

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.980
That's how we get started.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.280
It all starts like that.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.460
Yes? What were you going to say?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.080
[inaudible question] What's that?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.540
[inaudible question] My scary
books are these ones right here,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.010
"The Haunted Mystery."

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.910
Let's call -- "Crossroads;"
all about a haunted tree

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.590
with a ghost trapped inside
a tree and lightening hits it

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.350
and the ghost gets out and
then these four are all scary.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.490
And these "Daniel X" books
are kind of scary too.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.730
What else -- oh yeah, then this is
the book I want to tell you guys

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.090
about today was "Escape from
Mr. Lemoncello's Library"

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.290
and that's the first book
with just my name on the cover

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.430
to become a New York
Times bestseller.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.770
And it's been in the
top 10 now for 58 weeks

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.270
and then the sequel
just came out called,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.210 position:56%
"Mr. Lemoncello's Library Olympics."

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.420
And it's kind of fun for me to be
here at the Library of Congress

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.180
because it was one of the images
I used when I was writing the book

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.640
because Mr. Lemoncello -- have any
of you guys read that book yet?

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.940
"Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's
Library?"

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.240
You're going to get the second one.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.210
Well, in the first book
we meet Mr. Lemoncello

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:29.680
who is this zany bazillionaire
who grew up in a town in Ohio,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.130
where they bulldozed down
their public library.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.800
And he decides to build
a new public library

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.340
and it is the most
amazing library ever.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.750 position:56%
It's like three stories tall with a
rotunda and there's holograms inside

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.590
and all sort -- because he made
all this money making games.

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.430
So he fills the whole library
with all sorts of games.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.820
In fact I think I'll read
you a little bit from --

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.330
this is from the second book,

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.720
where we get to see a
little bit of the library.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.570
And it's funny, we were just
walking around and I got to looking

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.660
at the rotunda and in Mr.
Lemoncello's library the rotunda is

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.890 position:56%
lined with video screens so it can
change all the time and make it look

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.530
like the constellations of
the night sky or make it feel

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.740
like the whole library is
blasting off into outer space.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.960
So in this, the second book, we get
to meet Mr. Lemoncello and he works

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.320
with a lady named Dr.
Yanina Zinchenko.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.240
Dr. Yanina Zinchenko, the world
famous librarian dragged a lumpy

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.060 position:56%
mail sack to the far end of the
rotunda reading room where her boss,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.610
Luigi Lemoncello, was
flying up and down in front

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.050
of the three story
tall fiction bookcases.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.000
"I'm looking for a good
book," said Mr. Lemoncello

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.100
as his hover ladder jerked
vertically then skittered sideways.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.420
"But I'm not exactly sure
what I'm looking for."

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.640
The hover ladders were floating
platforms with handrails,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.230
book baskets, and ski boot safety
locks that allowed you to float

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.720
up to retrieve any
book you wanted simply

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.390
by entering the book's column
number into a computerized keypad.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.190
The system worked with the same
magnetic levitation technology used

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.950
in Germany and Japan
to propel bullet trains

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.740
with magnets instead of wheels.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.910
"Perhaps I can be of
assistance," said Doctor Zinchenko

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.340
in her thick Russian accent.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.240
"Do you have the code number?"

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.540
"No need!"

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.930
Mister Lemoncello said laughing.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.970
"I wanted to test drive
our new browse function."

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.260 position:56%
After several patrons had complained
of the hover ladder's demand

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.860
for a specific book code
eliminated the ability for patrons

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.710
to leisurely peruse the
shelves, the imagineers

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.750
at Mister Lemoncello's game
company had come up with a new,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:33.010
and improved, hover ladders
which featured a browse button.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.800
Once you pushed it the hover
ladder randomly flitted in front

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.890
of the shelves using advanced
biofeedback technology,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:42.570
heart rate monitors, and complex
algorithms to figure out what sort

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.450 position:56%
of story you might be interested in.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.040
"But we have a very
important matter to discuss."

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.380
Doctor Zinchenko pointed
to the mail sack.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.220
It was the size of an
overstuffed duffel bag.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.580
"Oh dear! A VIM.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.550
I don' t know if I have
the vigor for a VIM."

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.210
"We also have visitors!"

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.800
"Visitors and a VIM?

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.200
I'll deal with both as
soon as I finish browsing."

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.130
"Mister Lemoncello!"

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.560
bellowed a voice below.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.330
He glanced down and saw a
properly dressed lady flanked

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.830
by six other very properly
dressed ladies

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.240
and one properly dressed
man in a bowtie.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.620
"I'll be right with you!"

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.380
shouted Mister Lemoncello
as his hover ladder careened

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.700
across the wall of books like an
out of control ping pong ball.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.770
"I'm busy browsing."

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.130
"My name is Susanna Chiltington,"
the lady said operatically.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.210
"Misses Susana Willaby
[phonetic] Chiltington."

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.510
"Hello Susana.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.810
Don't you cry for me.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.360
The doctors say they can easily
remove the banjo on my knee."

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.170
Misses Chiltington wasn't amused.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.500
"Perhaps you've heard of
my brother," she said.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.260
"The head librarian for
the Library of Congress;

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.650
James F Willaby the third."

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.070
"What happened to the first two?"

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.370
"I beg your pardon?"

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.670
"Never mind.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.970
I am finished browsing.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.650
Pull me down 'Captain
Underpants.'" [laughter]

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.430
So Mister Willaby is not
really the head librarian here.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.760
So that is the kind of zany place
that Mister Lemoncello's Library is

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.650
and it's just filled with
all sorts of whacky stuff.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.830
Yes sir? [inaudible
question] What's that?

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.470
[inaudible question] I read
some other of my books.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.180
Yeah. We're talking
about this one mostly

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.200
because this one has
been very popular.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.330
It's up in that New York Times
Best Seller, it's got a lot

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.720
of nice reviews everywhere,
and Amazon picked it as one

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.440
of their favorite books, and
it won an LA "A Notable."

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.240
But most importantly,
Nickelodeon might turn it

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.120
into a movie this year.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.960
I know, that's what I said too.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.260
[excited noise] Might happen.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.760
So it might happen this year.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.420
And it's been nominated
for 39 now --

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.980 position:56%
they said 36, but I think California

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.060
and New Jersey have been
added -- state book awards.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.690
And it's won 10 of them already.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.000
So this has been a
lot of fun for me.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.450
But oh -- let's see what was I
going to say -- oh, this is --

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:48.140
people always ask me like,
"How did you get an idea?

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.790
How do you get ideas for stories?"

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.110
So I got the whole idea for "Escape
from Mister Lemoncello's Library"

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.800
when I was visiting that
library right there.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.150
That's PS10 in Brooklyn, New York.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.860
Have you ever been to
Brooklyn, New York?

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.550
That's what all the schools in
Brooklyn, New York look like.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.850
They're like four stories tall,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.310
made out of red brick,
been there since 1932.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:05.610
Forget about it.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.910
That's what they look like.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.210
So I went up and I said,
"Hey, nothing out of the

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:09.510
out of the ordinary
here," because it --

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.270
as a writer, if you guys
want to write stories,

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.770
just look for something that's a
little bit out of the ordinary,

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:17.890
a little bit out of whack because
nobody likes to read nice stories

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.970
about nice people having a nice day

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.400
or ordinary people doing ordinary
things in an ordinary way.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.510
So I said, "It's another
ordinary school."

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.090
But then they said,
"Come on upstairs

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.940
and meet the kids in our library."

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.050
And this was the library
in that school.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.760
It had murals everywhere,
solid oak bookcases filled

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.060
with books, computers.

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.140
Does that library look like
it belongs in that building?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.440
&gt;&gt; No.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.740
&gt;&gt; Not to me it didn't.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.040
It looked a little too new.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.310
So I went up to the librarian,
Misses McKreena [phonetic] there

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.200
and I said, "How did you
guys get this really cool,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.500
brand new library?"

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.510
And she said, "A very generous
millionaire donated it to us."

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.900
So that day on the subway
ride home I wrote down,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.750
"What if a very generous,
and somewhat looney,

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.190
bazillionaire donated a library
to the town where he grew up?"

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.340
And that's how all
stories get started.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.680
You just have to -- can you guys
all stroke your chins like this?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.670
Look around and see something
a little bit under --

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.090
like, "Oh, what's that half
a fireplace over there?

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.720
What if that fireplace
was where the Library

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.970
of Congress kept Santa Clause
all stored up in the winter

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.050
and in the summer, except in
December when he had to --

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:22.870
but he had to live in that little
box over there and they rolled him

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.370
around to different rooms?"

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.670
And you start thinking like that.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.210
That's how you can start
making up some stories.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.890 position:56%
Oh, and it's been kind of fun -- oh,
and I got the idea for the kid in it

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.700
because you know what's
really kind of neat?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:37.290
Is you can take aspects of your own
life and turn them into stories.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.590
So this is me, right there.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.030 position:56%
That was me when I was a little kid.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.270
I got two big brothers
and two young brothers.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.950
My mother had five
boys in seven years.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.550
We think she was trying
to have a girl.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:51.800
And I had these two big brothers
who I could never beat at anything.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.830
But they -- like my brother, Jeff
[assumed spelling] over here,

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.050
he was like this genus kid and he
would go to school and taka test,

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.630
like one of those IQ brain tests,
and he'd get like a 99 on it.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.610
And I remember the teachers
and the principals came home

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.350
and said, "Oh, Jeff is a genius.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:06.220 position:56%
He should skip three or four grades.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.090
He should go right to high school."

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.720
And I would take the exact same
test the next year and get a 96

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.260
and they'd go, "Yeah, he's
smart, but he's no Jeff."

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.600
So I always had like these
big brothers I couldn't beat

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.460
at anything except when
we played board games.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.780
And since there was like five of
us we played a lot of board games.

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:25.230
[inaudible comments] You
guys ever play "Sorry?"

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.850
[inaudible replies] There is
no better feeling in the world

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.870
than landing your pawn
on the same space

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.930
as your big brother
and saying, "Sorry!"

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.050
and sending him all the
way back to the beginning.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.270
So I took that remembrance I
had, that memory I had that --

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.890
of how good it felt to beat my
brothers [laughing] at games

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.900 position:56%
and so the hero of my story, "Escape
from Mister Lemoncello's Library,"

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.860
is this kid named Kyle who more

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.990
than anything loves playing
games and loves to win.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:52.290
So I got that from there.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.100 position:56%
Oh, and this is the pictures I used
when I was designing my own library.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.660
And now I can say,
"I've been there."

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.960
There's the Library of Congress.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.260
There we go.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.100
And this is the bank that was in
the town I grew up in; Buffalo,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.440
New York, when I was a kid.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.720
So I said that he took
an old bank building

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.060
and he turned the --
it into a library.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.380
And this is a parking garage at
a library somewhere in Kansas

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.880
where they have -- the
outside looks like bookshelves.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.730
So I did all that and I
-- so that's another way.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.850
When you're writing you
just kind of look for things

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.540
and put them together
and use your imagination

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.550
and make up your own library.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.110
So now there's a new
book, the sequel --

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:25.240
I think you guys are all
getting a copy of this one,

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.360
which sounds pretty cool
-- that just came out.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.080
And -- oh -- this is a little
book trailer we did about that.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.380
Greetings.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.510
This is so much fun writing.

My name is Chris Grabenstein and I'm
an author and my new book is called,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.090
"Mister Lemoncello's
Library Olympics."

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.880
It's a sequel to "Escape from
Mister Lemoncello's Library."

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.470
And in this book Mister Lemoncello
is hosting the first ever

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.930
library Olympics.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.710
Whoever can win the most metals

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:06.340
in 12 games will be crowned the
True Champion of the Library.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.640
[music] Good story.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.710
I love challenging my mind
and giving it some exercise.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.250

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.650

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.690
And I also love puzzles.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:30.060
Does anybody know a seven
letter word for fun?

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.360
&gt;&gt; Reading!

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.360
And so I wrote "Mister
Lemoncello's Library Olympics"

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.480
as a puzzle mystery because
I can solve the riddle

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.370
of the book before the
characters inside the story do.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.750
And that makes reading
a lot more fun.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:46.500
As the games continue certain
books start disappearing

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.990
because certain people don't

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.750
like what's inside those
books; a real cliffhanger.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.860
I've always been a big
believer in the First Amendment;

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.060
everyone should be able to read
whatever books are available

00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.770
to them, of course with
parental supervision.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.690
And so in this book Mister
Lemoncello joins the cause.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.700
It's always good to train
my body and my brain

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.060
by reading [inaudible] Lemoncello

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.910 position:56%
to aspiring writers is the same
thing that most authors give, "Read,

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:18.160
read, read, write, write, write.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.750 position:56%
You get better the more you practice

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.510

to be true champions."

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.760
Ah, so that was easy.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.580
Yeah! It's fun to do
and I sweat a lot.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.800
I -- so I got the idea for the
sequel from a fifth grader,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.510
a guy like you, who read the first
book and he said, "I bet kids all

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:40.810
over the country are
going to complain

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.280
that they didn't get a chance
to compete in the first game

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.860
and they might want
to have a rematch."

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.000
And that's how the whole idea of
the library Olympics got started.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.090
The kids from all over America
will come and compete in 12 games.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.340
So now I thought we might play a
few reading Olympic games here.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.730

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.650
The what? [inaudible]
The Velveeta rabbit!

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.960
No, I mean "The Velveteen Rabbit."

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.260
It's a cheesy book.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.560
Anyhow, all right, here we go.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.860
Curious --

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.160
&gt;&gt; George!

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everybody knows that one.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.760
Is there one more?

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.060
Yes, there is.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.360
Cloudy with a --

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.660
&gt;&gt; Chance of meatballs!

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.960
&gt;&gt; Meatballs!

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.490
All right, okay now -- oh, I think
I need two of you to come up here.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.240
Oh, yeah let's see, we're
going to have a head

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.450
to head competition here.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.750
Yes mam, you come up here.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.300
And I need you.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.600
Come on up here.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.900
All right.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.770
I'm going to show you a little
what we call a REBUS puzzle,

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:46.170
where you take pictures
and the letters and things

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.690
and you see if you can work it out.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.650
Here's a pen for you and you got
a little piece of paper there.

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.950
You can work it out.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.250
You can look at each other's work.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.550
Okay, here comes the puzzle.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.850
You ready?

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.640
&gt;&gt; Lion plus bear plus
carry minus one minus car.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.460
Can you name this intellectual --

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.460
this fortress of intellectual
freedom.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.860
So write down all the letters
first would be my suggestion --

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.390
of lion, bear, and carry.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.520
You can do it too.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:19.450
LION. [laughs] Bear; BE -- don't
have to worry about the puzzle.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:23.370
BEAR and carry; CARRY.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:30.820
And now the puzzle
says, "Take away one."

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:34.580
So take out ONE.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.170
Cross out ONE.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:37.730
[affirmative noises]
O, there's an N,

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.190
and E. And also car, which is CAR.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:41.490
Take out a CAR.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.690
What letters do you have left?

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.180
[inaudible answer]
You got it already!

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.160
She figured it out down here.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.710
She wasn't even on the board.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:24:02.580
Library! Oh, let's give
everybody a round of applause.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.800
[applause] Good job you guys.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.340
[cheering] All right, you got it.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.320
Library, LIBRARY, library.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.620
That's good.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.100
The end is gone.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.400
There we go.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.700
She's got it.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.000
Excellent.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.300
Thank you guys.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.600
Sit on down.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.900
Is there another game up here?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.200
Oh, one more game.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.500
One more game here.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.270
Can you name this fictional
character?

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.480
Can you name this fictional
character here?

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.090
Yes? [inaudible question]
What's that?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.230
Can you get a hint?

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.330
Well, he looks like
he's got a lot of hair.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.600 position:56%
So I'd call him kind of a hairy guy.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.070
&gt;&gt; Big foot.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:43.550
&gt;&gt; And he looks like
he's making pottery.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.320
[inaudible answer] So he's a
hairy guy who makes pottery.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.460
&gt;&gt; Harry Potter!

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.760
&gt;&gt; Harry Potter!

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.060
You got it!

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.120
All right, it is Harry
Potter ladies and gentlemen.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.420
[laughing] That is a hairy potter.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.120
[inaudible] Well, you guys did very
good and it's a good thing you did

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.310
because when you read this
book you're going to find

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.820
out that you would be up against
some of the toughest competition

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:10.340 position:56%
in the entire country, including
there's this one girl named Marjorie

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.420 position:56%
Moldower [phonetic] who's very scary
smart and she knows her way around.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.280
But I think you guys would
compete just fine against it.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.410
Oh, here's a question I
get asked all the time.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.280
People say, "Why did you name
your character Mister Lemoncello?"

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.550
And first of all, I know it's a
beverage that many teachers enjoy,

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.480
but the real reason I wrote --

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.360
called it Mister Lemoncello is
because when I wrote the first

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.170
"Escape from Mister Lemoncello's
Library" book I made a list

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.700
of all the reasons we
might need public libraries

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.710
because everybody says you know,
"I just got an iPhone" or "an iPad.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.010
I can look up anything.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.310
I can read anything.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.290
Why do I still need a library?"

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.050
So when I wrote the book
I consciously set out

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.350
and made a list like, "Okay,

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.450
why do we still need public
libraries especially?"

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.430 position:56%
And at the top of my personal list
was that libraries are a great place

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.950
for immigrants, newly arrived in
this country, to keep in touch

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.390
with their old country and find
out about their new country

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.560
and that meant a lot to
me because my grandmother

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.640
and grandfather both escaped from
Greece like back in the 1920s.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.360
The Turks burnt down their village

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.090
and my grandmother was
a 17 year old girl --

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:13.890
so not too much older
than you guys here --

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.830
and she was put on a boat
with a bunch of refugees

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:19.560
to be taken somewhere safe,
but the boat that she was put

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.090
on had a cholera epidemic,
which can kill people.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.590
And so they said, "No
one is leaving this boat.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.450
You're going to all
go back to Greece.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.750
We're sorry."

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.540
And my grandmother said,
"I'm not going back."

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.090
So in the middle of the night
when the moon was blocked

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:36.500
by clouds she climbed down an
anchor rope, swam to shore,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.950
met up with all these
other refugees,

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.640
made her way across
Europe, got on another boat,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.300 position:56%
somehow got to Ellis Island, made it
into America, went to Canton, Ohio,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.440
and my mom was the first one
of her family born in America.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.730
And she said when she was a kid
she promised herself she would read

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.500
every single book in the
Canton, Ohio Public Library

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.260
because that would make
her more of an American.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.850
So that's a real long
way of telling you

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:00.790
that I actually named him
Mister Lemoncello in honor

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.580
of my Greek grandmother, whose last
name was Lemonopolis, [phonetic]

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.300
and because if she had not
climbed down an anchor rope

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.900
when she was 17 years
old I would not be

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.870
in New York City making
up silly stories today.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.600
Yes? [inaudible question]
That disease cholera, right?

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.960
Was on that boat and that
makes people really sick

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.260
and can even kill people.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.170
So the British sailors
said, "You cannot leave.

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.470
Yes?

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.770
&gt;&gt; We talked about that in class.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.650
&gt;&gt; Did you learn about
that cholera epidemic?

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.310
Yes, so it's like -- yeah, I
always have a soft spot when I read

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.140
about refugees in the
news and stuff.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.240 position:56%
I always remember that most every --

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.890
my grandparents were refugees
themselves at one point.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.780
Oh, knowledge not shared
remains unknown.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.040
That's Mister Lemoncello's
big motto.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.260
He runs his whole library on
that, that a library is a place

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.220
where everybody can
learn everything.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.090
It's free and open to everyone.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:56.660
And so in that spirit there is
a hidden puzzle in this book

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.400
that you guys are going to get and
there's going to be a prize given

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.140
to whoever -- if you answer
the hidden puzzle correctly

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.900
and send me an email about it

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.610
and if you get the correct answer
your name will be entered into --

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.120 position:56%
we'll put it in a big goldfish bowl
or something and we're going to pull

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.650
out one winner on January fifth,
2017 who will get two libraries

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.500
of books; two copies of every
book I've ever written for kids,

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.510
two copies of every book my
friends can grab at Random House.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.810
We did this with the first book.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.830 position:56%
There was another hidden one in that
and we gave away 80 pounds of books.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.780
So the idea is that you will
keep one library for yourself

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.690
and then donate another one to your
favorite school or public library.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.410
But since you guys were nice
enough to come here I'm going

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:37.030
to read you the clue -- the riddle.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.350
This is what's in the book.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.650
Are the games really over?

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:40.950
Of course not.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.410
Here's one final puzzle.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.100
20 things you've just read --

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:48.270
20 things Mister Lemoncello said
were once not allowed to be read

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.430
because of what other people said.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.730
Can you find them all?

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.760
If so, send an email with your list
to author@chrisgrabenstein.com.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760
But since you guys are
here today I'm going

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.450
to give you a bonus clue --

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.990
a bonus clue that might
send you on the right track.

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.290
All right, here we go.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.590
Where is it?

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.220
Here we go; Mister Lemoncello
has a wild imagination.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.830 position:56%
He drops some famous titles into his
conversation; like you heard him say

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.940
"Captain Underpants" in
that little thing he said.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.200
He does that a lot in this book.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.150
He did it 20 times while
speaking in this book.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.090
So why don't you go back
and take another look.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.740
Find what they have in
common if you want to win

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:32.710
and when you think you've got
it just send your answer in.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.660
So pay very close attention
to all the book titles he puts

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.880
into his conversation
when you read the book.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.320
All right, I thought
I would stop and see

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.490
if you guys had any questions
you want to ask me about reading,

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.880
writing, and life in general.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.680
Yes?

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:52.500
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.460
Sometimes.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.970
In my book, "The Island
of Dr. Libris" here?

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.090
That's that I took -- there's a
boy with a really big imagination

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.890
and any book he reads, the
characters from that book come

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.320
to life out on an island
in the middle of a lake.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.620
So that's about the only one

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.390
where I've taken characters
from other books.

I've got to be honest with you guys.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.620
I'm still a little bit of what
they call a reluctant reader

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:51.300
and if I pick up a book and it's
boring I'll put it right back down.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.950
That just means it's not
the right book for me.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.150
So what you've got to do is get
your teachers and your librarians

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.480
and everybody to help you find
books that are right for you

-- because I still get bored,

this guy named Steve Sheinkin

who writes nonfiction as
if it was an action movie

Whenever you are trying to

last night at a bookstore I was at,

like, "How'd you come up
with all these riddles?

How'd you come up with
all these games?"

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.480
It's because I knew what I
wanted the answer to be, right?

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.420
So I knew that I wanted the
answer to be "library" so I said,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.010
"Well, what can I put together?

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.320
What letters can I jumble together

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.450
and take some letters
away to equal library?"

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:39.810 position:56%
And that's how I ended up with that.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.010

to write puzzles
