00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:01.060
Let's

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.420
continue on with our study of
rotation of functions around

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.375
the x, and we'll soon
see the y-axis as well.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.040
So let's do a slightly harder
example than what we've been

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.360
doing, but I think it might be
obvious how to approach it.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.300
So there's my y-axis, there's
my x-axis, and in a couple of--

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.290
I think it was two problems
ago-- we figured out if we had

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.530
the function y is equal to
square root of x-- let me try

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.210
to draw it-- so this is y
equals square root of x-- if we

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.460
were rotate that around the
x-axis, what the volume would

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.410
be between two points, let's
say 0 and some other point.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.940
Now let's just pick an
arbitrary point 1.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.390
I think you know how to
do that at this point.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.320
Now let's make it a slightly
more difficult problem.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.785
Let's say I were to also
draw the function y is

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:52.760
equal to x squared.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.115
So that looks-- if this is 1,
they both meet at 1, right?

00:00:56.115 --> 00:01:00.900
Because square root of 1 is 1,
and 1 squared is 1, so that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.380
would look something like this.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.750
They should be actually
symetric around y

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.650
equals x, but anyway.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.010
So say y equals x squared
looks like that.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.940
So my question now is, what
is the volume if I were to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.490
take this figure and
rotate it around?

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.530
So what do I mean?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:33.940
So this area here, if I were to
rotate that about the x-axis,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.150
what would the volume be?

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.350
So now, what we did just with
the square root of x, we had

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.730
like a solid cup, right?

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.840
It would look
something like this.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.200
It would be like a cup, and it
was solid, we were just trying

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.500
to figure out the volume of it.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.730
Hopefully that made
sense to you.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.610
Now it's going to be kind of a
hollowed-out cup, because we

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.400
have this inside function, and
so the inside of the cup

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.940
is going to be empty.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.910
Hopefully that makes
a little sense.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.250
Remember you're just taking
this and then you're rotating

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.290
it around the x-axis.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.390
Well, the way to think about
it-- especially if you having

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.590
trouble visualizing--
actually, the solution might

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.040
help you visualize it.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.640
The volume of this figure,
which I'm having trouble

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.180
drawing, it will be the
volume formed by the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.885
outside rotation of this y
equals square root of x.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:20.980
We'll do that in the yellow.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.740
It'll be the volume formed when
that is rotated around, and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.770
then the whole solid volume
minus the volume when

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.950
minus this volume.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.420
So if we took the y equals x
squared, y equals x squared

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.060
would look something like that,
and then if you rotated it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.780
around the axis, it would
look something like that.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.870
I don't know if you've ever
been to Morocco, but they have

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.020
these tajin plates that the
tops look a lot like that.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.730
Well, you probably haven't.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.920
Well, anyway.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.230
It would look
something like that.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.200
So if we subtract out this
volume when it's rotated around

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.480
from the volume of y equals
square root of x, when that's

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.340
rotated, we'll get this figure
that we're trying to figure

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.230
out, this area when
it's rotated around.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.070
And that should be intuitive
for you, hopefully, because

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.260
when we just did area under a
curve, that's how we would

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.660
figure out the area
of this green area.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.140
We would figure out the area
under square root of x, and

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.900
we'd subtract out the area
under y equals x squared.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.690
This time, we're going to say
the volume of the revolution of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.950
y equals square root of x minus
the volume of the revolution

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.340
of y equals x squared.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.260
So let's do the problem.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:52.280
So the total volume-- let me do
a good color, that looks good--

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.250
total volume is going to be
equal to the volume formed when

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.810
we rotate y equals square
root of x around the x-axis.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.010
I said from 0 to 1, and
that's because I picked

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.440
where they meet.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.570
Sometimes in a book, or on an
exam, they'll just say, oh, you

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.350
know, the area between y equals
x squared and y equals square

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.980
of x, we're going to rotate
that around and you have

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.880
to figure out, well they
intersected at 1, and you can

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.270
just set the equations equal to
each other to figure that out.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.960
We're going from 0 to
1, because they also

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.550
intersect at 0.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.910
0 squared is the same thing
as square root of 0.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.150
We're going from 0 to
1, and so what's the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.280
volume of the larger?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.720
Or I guess the y equals square
root of x rotated around?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.800
I always forget the formula,
that's why I always redraw a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.660
disk, so if that's the radius
of my disk, the disk is going

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.700
to come around like that, so
we know that the radius is a

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.910
function of the disk, and
that's, of course, the dx

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.160
is the depth of the disk.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.290
So the radius is the function
which, for the outside one, is

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.360
square root of x, and we know
area of this disk is pi r

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.010
squared, so we square the
radius, take a pi outside, and

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.990
then we multiply that times the
width, so that's where we

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.750
get our dx, and of course we
sum them all up and that's

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.510
where we get the integral.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.520
I'm going to do it as
two separate integrals.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.870
Some people will put them both
within the same integral, but I

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.420
really want to hit the point
home that this is the volume of

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.410
the outside surface, formed by
the outside surface or the cup,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.800
minus the volume formed by
the the inside function.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.840
It's going to be minus pi--
still going to be from 0 to 1--

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.950
I drew fairly huge integral
signs, I don't know why-- and

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:46.655
what's the inside function?

00:05:46.655 --> 00:05:49.740
It's x squared, and that's
going to be the radius of its

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.030
own disks, if that's the
radius that's the disk, dx

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:01.520
is the width, so it'll be x
squared, squared, times dx.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.800
So let's see if we
can figure that out.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.940
So, volume equals--
let's take the pis out.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.290
I think you'll see that that
pi is applying to everything,

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.920
so we can take the pi out.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.310
And then, times the integral,
and now we can merge them

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.170
back, because integrals
are additive like that.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.600
You'll see what I'm
talking about.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.720
This integral is
the same thing.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.090
So what's square
root of x squared?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.800
Well that's just x.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.390
And what's x squared, squared?

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.780
That's x to the fourth, right?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.760
You multiply the exponents,
exponent rules.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.520
We have a minus sign here.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.070
Minus x to the fourth, all that
times dx, we've got that pi on

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.430
the outside, that equals--
let's keep our pi

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.040
on the outside.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.310
We're going to have to evaluate
the antiderivative at 1 and 0.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.360
So what's the
antiderivative of x?

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:07.230
Well, that's x squared over
2, minus-- what's the

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.730
antiderivative of
x to the fourth?

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.140
Well, it's x to
the fifth over 5.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.010
That's hopefully
second nature to you.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:18.640
x to the fifth over 5, and
we're going to evaluate

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.530
that at 1 and 0.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.122
1 and 0.

00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:23.100
We're going to subtract them.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.260
Fundamental theorem
of calculus.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.700
So that equals-- I'm going to
switch colors to avoid

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:34.520
monotony-- that equals pi
times, let's evaluate it at 1,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:42.960
so it's 1/2 minus 1/5 and when
you evaluate it at 0, it's 0

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.710
minus 0, so when you evaluate
0, you get nothing.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.940
And so what's 1/2 minus 1/5?

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:57.250
That's pi times 2, get a common
denominator of 10, 5/2 is 1/2

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:03.690
minus 2/10 is 1/5, so this
equals, this would be 3,

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:07.190
so we get 3pi over 10.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.710
That's the volume formed.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.660
So it's almost easier to
figure out the volume of

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.660
this figure than to draw it.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.670
Anyway, I think I'll leave you
there with this video, and in

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.610
the next video, we're
going to start rotating

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.510
around the y-axis.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.110
See you soon.
