NAT TURNER: At
Flatiron, our goal

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.650
is to organize the
world's oncology data

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.950
and make it useful to patients,
physicians, researchers, life

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:12.960
science companies.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.460
So we want to
aggregate as much data

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.340
as we can on cancer
treatment and make

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.730
that useful to
those who actually

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.660
treat cancer and research drugs.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.180
We met a physician.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.770
I'll always remember
we were all,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.478
oh, there's all this
genomic data and all

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.470
this very interesting
stuff with patients.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.956
But then he said,
well, just because you

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.424
know someone's biomarker,
or their genetic mutation,

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.090
doesn't mean you know
how to treat them.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.130
If they have diabetes,
that changes things.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.840
If their age is between this
range, that changes things.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.090
If the histology of the
disease is this way,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.320
it totally changes things.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.420
If they've had prior treatment,
that totally changes things.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.710
And I only see-- this
is him speaking--

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.830
10 patients like this a year.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.750
In the United States
there are 4,900 others.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.630
And so I don't have any idea
what happens in those patients.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.052
And so his big-- and our
big-- ah-ha moment was,

00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:02.260
I just want to see that data.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.150
Just bring it to me.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.150
And so that was when we
said, all right, there's

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
a big opportunity not to just
aggregate the genomic data,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.650
but all this clinical data
on who the patients are,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.760
what drugs they're
getting, are they working.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.200
And doing that at
scale, and then

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.590
bringing it back to the
physicians who actually care.
