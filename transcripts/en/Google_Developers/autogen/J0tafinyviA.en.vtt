streaming API and its ease of use is
 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.630
streaming API and its ease of use is
really poised to do that well great um

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640
really poised to do that well great um
 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.730

with you yeah I think one of one of the

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090
with you yeah I think one of one of the
 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.429
with you yeah I think one of one of the
biggest benefits is the fact that you

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
biggest benefits is the fact that you
 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.889
biggest benefits is the fact that you
only have to send one stream to YouTube

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899
only have to send one stream to YouTube
 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.719
only have to send one stream to YouTube
through the API and then the YouTube

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729
through the API and then the YouTube
 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.310
through the API and then the YouTube
takes care of all the transcoding for

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320
takes care of all the transcoding for
 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.840
takes care of all the transcoding for
multiple devices and multiple formats

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850
multiple devices and multiple formats
 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.639
multiple devices and multiple formats
most of the time when you see platforms

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649
most of the time when you see platforms
 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.840
most of the time when you see platforms
like this they said they ask you to send

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850
like this they said they ask you to send
 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.069
like this they said they ask you to send
multiple strings but YouTube this

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079
multiple strings but YouTube this
 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.929
multiple strings but YouTube this
requires the one all right yeah that's

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939
requires the one all right yeah that's
 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.289
requires the one all right yeah that's
true um anything that you'd request

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
true um anything that you'd request
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.169
true um anything that you'd request
