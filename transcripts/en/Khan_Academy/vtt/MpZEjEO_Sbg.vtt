00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.405
- The absolute pressure, P,
in a fluid of density, rho,

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:04.763
I know this looks like a lowercase p,

00:00:04.763 --> 00:00:06.179
but this is the Greek letter rho,

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:08.141
which we typically use for density,

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.742
at a given depth, h, can be found

00:00:10.742 --> 00:00:11.926
with the above equation,

00:00:11.926 --> 00:00:15.002
where capital P, with the
little subscript of this,

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.079
I guess P sub zero, or maybe instead O,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:18.926
but it looks like a zero,

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:21.283
P sub zero is atmospheric pressure

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:24.417
and g is gravitational acceleration.

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:26.460
Which of the following
is the correct expression

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.023
for the depth in terms
of the absolute pressure,

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:33.159
atmospheric pressure, fluid density,

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:35.724
and gravitational acceleration?

00:00:35.724 --> 00:00:37.083
So essentially, what we want to do

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.824
is we want to solve for depth.

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:42.736
We want to solve for h.

00:00:42.736 --> 00:00:44.582
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.438
So we have P is equal to P sub,

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:52.438
I'll call this P sub zero,
plus rho times g times h.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:58.084
Now to solve for h, I'd
at least want to isolate

00:00:58.084 --> 00:01:01.102
this term that contains
h on the right-hand side.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.120
So let me subtract P sub
zero from both sides.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.183
So subtract P sub zero,
subtract P sub zero.

00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:10.981
And then on the left-hand side,

00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.764
I have capital P minus
P, capital P sub zero

00:01:15.764 --> 00:01:18.817
is equal to, those are
going to cancel out.

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:23.716
You're going to have rho times g times h.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.597
And now to solve for h,

00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:28.476
I can divide both sides by rho times g.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.556
So let's do that.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:33.015
Let's divide this side by rho times g.

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:38.015
And let's divide this side
by rho times, rho times g.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.314
Rho times g divided by rho
times g is just going to be one.

00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:45.332
And we get h is equal to
this thing right over here.

00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:48.455
We're going to say h is
equal to capital P minus

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:53.455
capital P sub zero over rho times g.

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:58.795
And that is the first
choice right over there.
