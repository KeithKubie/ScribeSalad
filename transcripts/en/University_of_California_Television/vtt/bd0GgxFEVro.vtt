00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:15.305
- [Host] We're very happy to
kick off the morning session

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.582
with a talk on developing resilience,

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:21.302
how to be inspired when
you're just really tired.

00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:23.260
Matthew Verscheure,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.691
is the Director of
Training for Homebridge,

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:29.696
a non-profit agency
providing IHSS services

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.657
to over 13,000 clients in San Francisco,

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:36.588
and Dennis Gallegos is a Training
Specialist at Homebridge.

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.406
They're gonna tell us a little
bit more about their program

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:42.345
and some of the fantastic
things that they're doing.

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:45.685
So Matthew and Dennis, please come on up.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.341
- Good morning, everybody.

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.645
If you're visiting,
welcome to the Bay Area.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:52.181
I hope you're having a wonderful time

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:53.764
here in this great city,

00:00:53.764 --> 00:00:55.472
and it's not raining,

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:59.055
which it's been doing
for a long long time.

00:01:00.437 --> 00:01:02.870
They mentioned that Dennis
and I are from Homebridge

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.191
And Homebridge is an organization

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:07.466
based here in San Francisco.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:11.633
We provide what is called
"Contract Mode IHSS Services."

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.387
In California, every county has the option

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.183
to contract with a private agency

00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:21.191
to provide IHSS services to individuals

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.400
who, for whatever reason,
can't manage their own work,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.929
or don't have someone that they
want to be their caregiver,

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.510
or have chronic substance abuse,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.023
mental health issues, also
developmental disabilities.

00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:37.610
One of the cornerstones at Homebridge

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.306
is that we have always,

00:01:39.306 --> 00:01:43.155
since the organization began in 1994,

00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:44.934
provided training to our workers.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:46.626
We were committed, the board is committed,

00:01:46.626 --> 00:01:48.686
that the home care providers

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:52.279
should be trained in understanding

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:56.664
the needs of individuals
that require care.

00:01:56.664 --> 00:01:59.698
In 2010, the city and
county of San Francisco

00:01:59.698 --> 00:02:02.976
awarded Homebridge a contract
to expand our training,

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:06.854
which Dennis actually
developed at the onset,

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:08.443
to expand that training and offer it

00:02:08.443 --> 00:02:13.091
to all of the IHSS providers
in San Francisco County.

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.693
There are about 20,000 recipients of IHSS

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:19.180
in just the city and
county of San Francisco,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.751
and there are about 19,000
registered providers.

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.462
So our trainings are available

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:27.847
to all of those providers at no charge,

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:29.963
and over the course of any given year

00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:32.604
we offer training to about 1,000 people,

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:35.934
so we just kind of touch
on that surface of that.

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:37.738
As they mention, Homebridge alone,

00:02:37.738 --> 00:02:41.995
we serve 13,000 people, 12,000
in San Francisco County,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.730
and about 100 in San Mateo County.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.867
So those are the only two
counties in California

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.877
that currently have
Contract Mode Services.

00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:52.888
Another new business
that Homebridge is doing

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:54.800
is working with Sutter Health,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.394
and we provide transitional care services

00:02:57.394 --> 00:02:59.432
to individuals who would otherwise

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:02.857
present in the emergency
room and be admitted when

00:03:02.857 --> 00:03:05.900
they really could just use
some short term home care,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.837
and we contract out on a 24 hour,

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:11.582
seven days a week basis
to provide that service

00:03:11.582 --> 00:03:13.981
to Sutter Emergency Rooms in the city.

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:18.148
So that's kind of a little
synopsis of what we do.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.506
Dennis and I thought, "How do
we want to start this out?"

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:24.771
And one of the things that
Homebridge has been doing

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:28.385
is we created a video to recruit people

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:29.856
to be home care providers for us.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:32.638
We employ, we should, I should say,

00:03:32.638 --> 00:03:35.025
employ about 450 home care providers.

00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:38.141
We are struggling with a very good economy

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.124
and a minimum wage that's going up.

00:03:41.124 --> 00:03:43.979
So we are down about 100 workers,

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.759
so we are aggressively trying

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.969
to recruit qualified people to do this.

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.047
So we created a video about a year ago,

00:03:50.047 --> 00:03:53.047
and we thought we'd start with that.

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:56.809
Am I doing this right?

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:57.642
There we go.

00:03:57.642 --> 00:03:58.608
Oh, I should say,

00:03:58.608 --> 00:04:00.982
we don't have any disclosures,
with the exception of,

00:04:00.982 --> 00:04:05.120
I'm wearing new bifocals
because I turned 50 in November,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.787
and I'm a junior member of AARP.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.023
So that's my little
snippet for the morning.

00:04:11.023 --> 00:04:12.815
Anyway, we wanted to start with this video

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:16.959
because it's some of
our staff talking about

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.295
what motivates them to do
this very difficult work

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:21.417
that they're being asked to do,

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:24.584
so we'll start with that this morning.

00:04:30.243 --> 00:04:34.160
(video playing off-microphone)

00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:23.538
Alright.

00:07:25.997 --> 00:07:27.891
I keep forgetting about that part.

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.141
(clapping)

00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:33.181
I'm actually going to
turn it over to Dennis.

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:34.537
I wanted to make one other comment.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:36.717
One thing that we have done,

00:07:36.717 --> 00:07:38.634
because burnout is what we're going

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.448
to talk about a little bit next,

00:07:40.448 --> 00:07:43.079
our providers work
pretty much by themselves

00:07:43.079 --> 00:07:44.822
out in the community.

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:48.762
Last fall, with the help
of some financial support,

00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:53.350
we were able to mobilize
our workforce with iphones

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.076
and they now have an app that has

00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:58.713
everything they need
regarding their schedules,

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:00.105
their client's care plan,

00:08:00.105 --> 00:08:02.175
and direct communication
with their case worker

00:08:02.175 --> 00:08:04.458
for that individual while
they're out in the field,

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:05.815
so there's no delay.

00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:09.296
It's real time support to those workers.

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:12.323
Part of the problem is getting
some of our older workers

00:08:12.323 --> 00:08:16.224
to embrace the idea of
using a smart phone.

00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:17.744
And that's been some trickiness.

00:08:17.744 --> 00:08:20.608
But that has really changed

00:08:20.608 --> 00:08:22.079
the way they feel supported,

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:24.838
and to keep them inspired in
what they're doing out there,

00:08:24.838 --> 00:08:26.600
because if you're out
there with no support

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.811
and no one to talk to, you
can easily become uninspired.

00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.563
So, I'm gonna turn it over to
Dennis now for a few minutes.

00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:35.874
- Good morning, everybody.

00:08:35.874 --> 00:08:37.402
Nice to see your smiley faces.

00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:38.569
Are you happy?

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.129
Pharrell made you all happy, right?

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:42.506
I mean, that song gets you happy.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:44.431
I like that song for that reason.

00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:47.598
Alright, well, so we're talking about,

00:08:51.368 --> 00:08:52.974
there we go.

00:08:52.974 --> 00:08:54.996
Before we start talking about inspiration,

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:57.454
I wanted to talk about burnout.

00:08:57.454 --> 00:08:58.732
And this is my friend, Eric,

00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:00.525
and you can see in his
first picture there,

00:09:00.525 --> 00:09:04.688
he's a little stressed,
his hair is sticking up.

00:09:04.688 --> 00:09:07.819
He's fortunate enough to have hair.

00:09:07.819 --> 00:09:10.256
And then when we asked him
to pose for the picture,

00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:11.614
he said "Hey I'm just too burnt out,

00:09:11.614 --> 00:09:13.950
I can't even do this."

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.296
And I'm sure some of us
have had that experience,

00:09:16.296 --> 00:09:18.077
where we're just at the point where,

00:09:18.077 --> 00:09:19.918
you know what, I just can't do it.

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:21.001
I just can't.

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:25.838
So, before I talk about being inspired,

00:09:25.838 --> 00:09:27.381
I wanna talk about burnout,

00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:28.962
and most of us know what it is,

00:09:28.962 --> 00:09:31.437
and if you're experiencing burnout,

00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:34.607
you probably don't need
me to tell you what it is.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:38.358
But I'm gonna tell you about it anyway.

00:09:38.358 --> 00:09:39.617
So, what is burnout?

00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:41.633
Well, there was a great paper

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:44.945
that I read by Christina Maslach,

00:09:44.945 --> 00:09:46.242
I think that's how I pronounce her name,

00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:47.992
and Susan E. Jackson.

00:09:49.264 --> 00:09:52.347
And basically they define three very,

00:09:53.697 --> 00:09:57.782
three central constructs
of what is burnout.

00:09:57.782 --> 00:10:00.944
The first one is emotional exhaustion.

00:10:00.944 --> 00:10:04.858
You go home at night,
and you're just fatigued,

00:10:04.858 --> 00:10:07.379
you're tired, you just
drop down on the couch,

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:08.915
you pop open a cold one,

00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:11.415
and you just don't care what's on TV.

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:12.962
That's how you feel.

00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:15.667
And I'm sure some of
us had that experience.

00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:19.125
The other one is depersonalization.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:21.217
Negative or very detached feelings.

00:10:21.217 --> 00:10:25.006
You just, you stop caring, you know?

00:10:25.006 --> 00:10:28.676
That person becomes just a patient,

00:10:28.676 --> 00:10:31.319
they're not a person anymore.

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:33.046
We don't care, we really
just don't care about

00:10:33.046 --> 00:10:34.488
the outcome of what we're doing.

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:36.806
We're just putting in the time.

00:10:36.806 --> 00:10:40.389
And then, reduced
personal accomplishments.

00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:43.323
You just can't get any satisfaction.

00:10:43.323 --> 00:10:44.570
You heard in the video,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.626
the folks talking about how
they like go home at night

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:47.867
and have a smile on their face,

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:50.482
they feel good about helping someone.

00:10:50.482 --> 00:10:52.412
Well, when you're burnt
out, you don't get that.

00:10:52.412 --> 00:10:53.662
It's not there.

00:10:54.804 --> 00:10:57.637
So, the other thing about burnout,

00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:00.810
is some causes of it,

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.746
and when I did this research
for this presentation,

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:07.529
I've discovered that many
people have many reasons

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:08.755
of why they're burnt out.

00:11:08.755 --> 00:11:12.467
And I'm sure some of you have
your own personal reason,

00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:14.786
if you've experienced burnout,

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:18.213
or are feeling burnt out at this moment.

00:11:18.213 --> 00:11:21.335
But these ten appealed to me,

00:11:21.335 --> 00:11:22.953
and the first one is losing,

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:26.953
and I'm gonna actually
personalize this for you.

00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:32.404
Losing sight of one's
values and or priorities.

00:11:32.404 --> 00:11:36.409
So, I became a trainer at
Homebridge about 11 years ago,

00:11:36.409 --> 00:11:38.238
and it was because I was really,

00:11:38.238 --> 00:11:42.415
when I saw the job
advertisement for a Trainer,

00:11:42.415 --> 00:11:46.874
I was like "This is what I
love to do! I wanna do this!"

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.596
And over time I began to lose sight

00:11:49.596 --> 00:11:52.668
of that's what I really enjoyed doing.

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:55.276
Allowing others' expectations

00:11:55.276 --> 00:11:58.218
to determine how you spend your time.

00:11:58.218 --> 00:12:01.474
I got to a point where at Homebridge,

00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:05.027
I was being asked to do, just
multiple, multiple trainings,

00:12:05.027 --> 00:12:06.659
and I was just doing them.

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:08.279
I was just like a little robot.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:11.754
I never once said "Wait a
minute, I can't keep doing this,

00:12:11.754 --> 00:12:14.754
this isn't helpful to me right now."

00:12:15.988 --> 00:12:18.803
Allowing issues to become
bigger than they really are.

00:12:18.803 --> 00:12:21.990
So, I discovered that I
was paying more attention

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.914
to my students using their
cell phones in the classroom

00:12:25.914 --> 00:12:27.813
than I was trying to teach them

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:31.643
the lessons that they needed
to become home care workers.

00:12:31.643 --> 00:12:34.018
Overlooking the importance
of the three "R's,"

00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:36.693
rest, relaxation, and rejuvenation.

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:39.405
Just not doing anything for myself

00:12:39.405 --> 00:12:41.735
to reinvigorate myself.

00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:44.780
Not going to the gym, not going for walks,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.219
not spending time with my friends,

00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:51.781
not even sitting down and
having a glass of wine at night.

00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:53.519
Failing to care for yourself.

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:56.346
And, you know, this is
the number one problem

00:12:56.346 --> 00:12:58.333
with a lot of us who do care giving,

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:00.391
is that we don't take care of ourselves.

00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:03.033
We're good at taking
care of everybody else,

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.198
but when it comes to
taking care of ourselves,

00:13:05.198 --> 00:13:06.615
we drop the ball.

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.927
Adding to your to do
list without deleting.

00:13:10.927 --> 00:13:13.373
Yes, there's always
more to do, always more,

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:16.720
taking on more, and more, and more.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.280
Forgetting to express gratitude.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.522
You know, just realizing
"God, I got a great job,

00:13:22.522 --> 00:13:25.463
you know, I work in an amazing city,"

00:13:25.463 --> 00:13:28.569
you know, not being able to
even think about that type of,

00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:30.986
think those type of thoughts.

00:13:31.963 --> 00:13:35.022
Overlooking the importance of humor.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.117
What I noticed, was that when I,

00:13:37.117 --> 00:13:40.279
one of the things, techniques
I like to use in teaching

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.377
is telling jokes.

00:13:42.377 --> 00:13:44.821
And I noticed suddenly
that I would think about,

00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:46.697
"I should tell my students a joke today,

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:48.872
nah, I don't, I don't have it.

00:13:48.872 --> 00:13:50.772
I just don't wanna talk about it."

00:13:50.772 --> 00:13:54.022
So I lost my sense of humor, basically.

00:13:54.022 --> 00:13:55.387
Getting stuck in a rut.

00:13:55.387 --> 00:13:58.318
Just doing the same work
over and over and over again,

00:13:58.318 --> 00:14:01.443
you're just going in
and putting in the time.

00:14:01.443 --> 00:14:02.996
And then, the last one,

00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:05.784
forgetting to go back to the beginning.

00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:09.545
And that, I think is an important one,

00:14:09.545 --> 00:14:13.124
and that's an important cause of burnout,

00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:16.307
and that is something I'm gonna
talk about in a few minutes.

00:14:16.307 --> 00:14:18.016
But before I do that,

00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:21.608
I wanna talk about why burnout
is such a bad thing for us.

00:14:21.608 --> 00:14:25.775
Because one, it's got some
pretty negative effects.

00:14:26.913 --> 00:14:29.899
A Mayo Clinic study in 2012 found

00:14:29.899 --> 00:14:33.055
that 45.4 percent of physicians

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.888
experience one symptom of burnout.

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:40.073
And this one was very startling,

00:14:40.073 --> 00:14:42.833
Female physicians have
twice the suicide rate

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:45.916
of females in the general population.

00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:50.930
Overall job satisfaction for physicians

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.013
hovers around 50 percent.

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:57.128
One in five nurses plan
to leave their current job

00:14:57.128 --> 00:15:01.278
within the next year,
according to one study.

00:15:01.278 --> 00:15:03.109
And then, in the hospitals

00:15:03.109 --> 00:15:06.354
where you had higher
patient ratios to nurses,

00:15:06.354 --> 00:15:10.517
basically, you had a higher
sense of job dissatisfaction

00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:13.100
and higher patient mortalities.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.447
Some other thing about burnout

00:15:16.447 --> 00:15:19.530
is its extremely costly, very costly.

00:15:21.207 --> 00:15:24.107
You know, we're training people,

00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:27.000
everybody has to get trained
when they get into the job,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.160
and within a year, they're gone.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.107
And so a lot of money is spent

00:15:31.107 --> 00:15:35.926
just rehiring, recruiting, and
retraining those individuals

00:15:35.926 --> 00:15:38.660
only to see that they disappear

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.242
and are no longer part of your workforce.

00:15:42.242 --> 00:15:44.825
And then, related to home care,

00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:49.829
700 representatives from
700 homecare companies

00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:53.079
participated in a 2015 benchmark study,

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.313
which is published
annually by Homecare Plus,

00:15:58.313 --> 00:15:59.797
and basically what they found

00:15:59.797 --> 00:16:02.797
was that 61.6 percent turnover rate,

00:16:04.626 --> 00:16:06.106
and that was the highest recorded

00:16:06.106 --> 00:16:09.782
since they began the study in 2010.

00:16:09.782 --> 00:16:13.646
At Homebridge, this is a
real fight that we have,

00:16:13.646 --> 00:16:17.605
constantly having to
recruit home care providers,

00:16:17.605 --> 00:16:19.680
train them, and then we lose them.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.666
And there's a number of
factors, but one of the factors

00:16:22.666 --> 00:16:26.083
is caring for people is really hard work.

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.350
And so, the challenge is

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.475
how do we stay inspired when,

00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:35.892
often the odds are stacked up against us?

00:16:37.754 --> 00:16:40.321
So we have to look for inspiration!

00:16:40.321 --> 00:16:43.482
And where do we find that inspiration?

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:46.490
For some of us, we might take
it from one of these folks.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.369
We would consider these,
maybe, our spiritual leaders.

00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:51.202
You know?

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:55.337
And I'm sure you recognize all
those lovely faces up there,

00:16:55.337 --> 00:16:57.768
I don't need to tell you who they are.

00:16:57.768 --> 00:17:00.633
But for some of us, maybe we
don't relate to the spiritual.

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:04.851
Instead, we relate to
somebody like Stephen Curry,

00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:08.101
or Muhammad Ali, Picasso, Maya Angelou.

00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:14.189
And, you know, these
are the type of people

00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:17.441
that we can turn to when
we're looking for inspiration,

00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:18.947
and what's really interesting,

00:17:18.947 --> 00:17:22.251
we may just turn to someone
like our Special Olympian.

00:17:22.251 --> 00:17:24.564
She may inspire us.

00:17:24.564 --> 00:17:27.368
So it's important when we're looking for

00:17:27.368 --> 00:17:31.708
resilience in our work, where
can we find the inspiration?

00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:33.115
Sometimes it might just be in

00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:36.694
the person that we're caring for.

00:17:36.694 --> 00:17:39.279
When I was doing the
research I also asked Google,

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:43.143
"Google, who inspired Pablo Picasso?"

00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:44.991
And what Google told me,

00:17:44.991 --> 00:17:47.452
was it was his father who inspired him.

00:17:47.452 --> 00:17:51.741
His father was a painter
and a drawing teacher.

00:17:51.741 --> 00:17:55.237
Also, he got inspiration from two artists

00:17:55.237 --> 00:17:58.737
that were at the time, relatively unknown.

00:17:59.895 --> 00:18:03.003
So he found his inspiration in others.

00:18:03.003 --> 00:18:07.170
Mother Teresa says she found
her inspiration in a calling.

00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:11.278
A call within a call is where
she got her inspiration,

00:18:11.278 --> 00:18:12.594
and then she began her work,

00:18:12.594 --> 00:18:15.677
taking care of the sick and the poor.

00:18:17.353 --> 00:18:18.989
Muhammad Ali at the age of 12,

00:18:18.989 --> 00:18:21.542
had his bicycle stolen from him,

00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:23.949
and when he was talking
to the policeman about it,

00:18:23.949 --> 00:18:26.579
he said that he wanted
to go beat up the thief,

00:18:26.579 --> 00:18:28.105
and the policeman said to him,

00:18:28.105 --> 00:18:32.161
"Well, you need to learn how
to box if you want to do that."

00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:35.337
So, Muhammad Ali got
his inspiration to box

00:18:35.337 --> 00:18:38.018
from someone stealing his bicycle.

00:18:38.018 --> 00:18:38.851
I like to think,

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:40.238
"What would have happened to Muhammad Ali

00:18:40.238 --> 00:18:42.905
if nobody'd stolen his bicycle?"

00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:48.135
And Rosa Parks, she's one of my heroes.

00:18:48.135 --> 00:18:50.026
Rosa Parks, people have always said,

00:18:50.026 --> 00:18:54.193
"Well, Rosa Parks refused
to get up out of her seat,

00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:59.113
because she was tired
from a long day of work,"

00:18:59.113 --> 00:19:01.650
and really what she said is,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.233
"I wasn't tired physically, no,

00:19:05.702 --> 00:19:09.829
the only tired I was,
was tired of giving in."

00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:12.688
So she found her
inspiration within herself.

00:19:12.688 --> 00:19:16.855
She was just too tired of
taking crap from people.

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:21.291
So, we need our inspiration
to keep moving forward,

00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:24.248
to not be burnt out, right?

00:19:24.248 --> 00:19:26.212
So, where do we find it?

00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:29.045
Well, I ask you, think about this:

00:19:30.453 --> 00:19:32.705
Why did you come to the work?

00:19:32.705 --> 00:19:35.556
Why are you doing what you're doing?

00:19:35.556 --> 00:19:37.306
Now, lots of reasons.

00:19:38.171 --> 00:19:40.403
For some of us, it's to change lives.

00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:42.620
Often in the caregiving field,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.719
we wanna try and change somebody's life.

00:19:45.719 --> 00:19:47.100
We wanna provide hope

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.089
to someone who maybe is
feeling a little hopeless.

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:53.377
We definitely wanna make a difference.

00:19:53.377 --> 00:19:56.440
We all hope that our work
will make a difference.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.424
We want to make the world a better place,

00:19:59.424 --> 00:20:02.572
or improve the life of others.

00:20:02.572 --> 00:20:05.201
Maybe it's to provide a cure,

00:20:05.201 --> 00:20:07.284
or put a smile on a face.

00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:10.070
And others?

00:20:11.094 --> 00:20:13.723
Why did you come to this work?

00:20:13.723 --> 00:20:15.223
Ask yourself that.

00:20:18.174 --> 00:20:20.532
We want to go back to
the beginning, folks.

00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:23.148
We wanna ask ourselves
over and over again,

00:20:23.148 --> 00:20:25.404
when we're feeling those
feelings of burnout,

00:20:25.404 --> 00:20:29.571
"Why am I here? Why am I doing
this? What's my purpose?"

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.783
Because, how can we be inspired

00:20:34.783 --> 00:20:36.994
when we're tired?

00:20:36.994 --> 00:20:38.577
That's a tough one.

00:20:39.774 --> 00:20:41.180
But what I believe,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.036
and what I wanna teach you today,

00:20:43.036 --> 00:20:46.203
is that inspiration equals resilience.

00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:53.760
We become inspired,
resilience will develop.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.926
And I have actually proven that to myself,

00:20:56.926 --> 00:21:00.083
that's why I'm sharing this with you.

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:02.235
It's the inspiration

00:21:02.235 --> 00:21:05.985
that ignites what I call
the fire of purpose.

00:21:08.478 --> 00:21:10.601
But we have to go back to,

00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:14.018
"What's the reason we came to this work?"

00:21:15.874 --> 00:21:18.968
Because maybe what's happening to us

00:21:18.968 --> 00:21:21.789
when we're experiencing
those feelings of burnt out,

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:23.883
being tired, is we're forgetting

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:26.216
to go back to the beginning.

00:21:28.194 --> 00:21:32.361
We got inspired to start doing
the work that we're doing.

00:21:33.297 --> 00:21:35.297
Something inspired us to say,

00:21:35.297 --> 00:21:37.991
"Hey, I'm gonna be a nurse,
I'm gonna be a doctor,

00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:41.391
I'm gonna be a social worker,
I'm gonna do case management,

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:43.454
I'm gonna do the work that I'm doing

00:21:43.454 --> 00:21:46.204
with the people that I care for."

00:21:49.297 --> 00:21:52.130
This is what we did, and
this is what we were doing,

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.965
before the burnout showed up.

00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:56.548
So, where we began,

00:21:57.449 --> 00:22:00.949
is where we're gonna find the inspiration.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.719
So, just, you know,

00:22:03.719 --> 00:22:07.083
take a few minutes, right
now, to reflect on this.

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:10.028
Why did you come to the work?

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:12.121
What made you choose it?

00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:15.038
What were you trying to accomplish?

00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:20.360
And as you reflect upon that,

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:25.167
ask yourself "Where does
my inspiration come from?

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:28.834
What qualities do I
have to inspire myself?"

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:33.484
This is where we begin.

00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:40.390
So I'm gonna conclude my topic
just giving you my story,

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.723
and show you how this works.

00:22:44.936 --> 00:22:48.938
So for the past 11 years,
I've been teaching,

00:22:48.938 --> 00:22:51.347
I've been a trainer at Homebridge,

00:22:51.347 --> 00:22:53.983
training home care providers.

00:22:53.983 --> 00:22:58.150
Many of them come to us who
have been family caregivers,

00:22:59.058 --> 00:23:00.114
and that's it.

00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:01.746
They don't have a lot of experience.

00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:04.413
Some of them have no experience.

00:23:05.575 --> 00:23:08.636
And with the exception
of a few alterations,

00:23:08.636 --> 00:23:11.929
I have been teaching the same course

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:16.616
three weeks out of the year,
three weeks out of the month,

00:23:16.616 --> 00:23:19.745
12 months out of the year, for 11 years.

00:23:19.745 --> 00:23:22.995
Needless to say, I experienced burnout.

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.394
I got to the point where I was like,

00:23:25.394 --> 00:23:27.465
"I can't do this anymore."

00:23:27.465 --> 00:23:28.678
But I liked what I did.

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:29.991
But I can't do it anymore.

00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:31.103
But I like what I do.

00:23:31.103 --> 00:23:33.312
I can't do it anymore.

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.812
So I was experiencing burnout.

00:23:37.962 --> 00:23:41.266
In order to not have to
give up what I liked doing,

00:23:41.266 --> 00:23:44.035
I said "Well, what is it
that brought me to this work?

00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:47.868
Why did I want to do
this in the first place?"

00:23:49.179 --> 00:23:52.262
Because, at Home care, at Homebridge,

00:23:53.253 --> 00:23:56.043
we provide home care providers

00:23:56.043 --> 00:23:58.782
this training, because when I started,

00:23:58.782 --> 00:24:02.115
there was no training for these workers.

00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:05.815
And we were asking them to go out

00:24:05.815 --> 00:24:08.505
and care for some very
challenging individuals.

00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:11.097
One of the things about Homebridge

00:24:11.097 --> 00:24:12.906
is our clients that we care for

00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:15.662
are some of the most
challenging individuals

00:24:15.662 --> 00:24:18.995
in the city and county of San Francisco.

00:24:20.035 --> 00:24:21.732
And yet we were sending out workers

00:24:21.732 --> 00:24:26.253
to care for them with
very little experience.

00:24:26.253 --> 00:24:29.734
And the other side of it
that really got to me,

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:33.901
was that, we were having these
clients being taken care of

00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:40.213
by people who didn't know
what they were doing.

00:24:40.213 --> 00:24:43.046
That to me was really frightening.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.046
So, I said "Yes, I wanna train them,

00:24:47.046 --> 00:24:49.239
I have the expertise to do this.

00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:51.770
I have the passion to do this.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.639
I'm going to do this. I like doing this"

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:56.653
And I did for quite some time,

00:24:56.653 --> 00:25:00.153
and I did it very well, and
I still do it very well.

00:25:00.153 --> 00:25:02.447
But that's why I came to the work.

00:25:02.447 --> 00:25:06.075
I wanted to be able to teach
the home care providers

00:25:06.075 --> 00:25:08.438
how to care for people,

00:25:08.438 --> 00:25:11.811
how to care for them so they
could change their lives,

00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:13.040
so they could make them happy,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.959
so they could put a smile on their face.

00:25:16.959 --> 00:25:20.126
That's where my inspiration came from.

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:25.330
And so, returning to those
thoughts, and to those feelings,

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.580
I found myself, resilient, rejuvenated.

00:25:29.973 --> 00:25:32.946
The inspiration came back to me.

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:36.534
And I also did some practical things.

00:25:36.534 --> 00:25:39.164
I went to Matt, who was my boss,

00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:42.581
and I said, "Hey, I think I'm burnt out."

00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:46.013
And, we were able to develop a plan

00:25:46.013 --> 00:25:50.011
where I was able to reduce
my time in the classroom

00:25:50.011 --> 00:25:52.100
and I was given the opportunity

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.267
to start developing and
rewriting some of our curriculum,

00:25:57.435 --> 00:25:59.533
and developing curriculum for some of

00:25:59.533 --> 00:26:01.419
the other programs in Homebridge.

00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:03.564
And that's another passion of mine,

00:26:03.564 --> 00:26:06.845
something that inspires me, is writing.

00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:10.645
So suddenly, I could
feel myself rejuvenated,

00:26:10.645 --> 00:26:13.348
feeling more excited about going to work,

00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:16.514
and not experiencing the burnout.

00:26:16.514 --> 00:26:18.360
But where it started was

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.693
going back to where I began.

00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:24.598
Where did I find my inspiration?

00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:28.350
So that's my story, I'm gonna stick to it,

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.218
and I'm gonna turn it back over to Matt,

00:26:31.218 --> 00:26:32.656
and let him finish up.

00:26:32.656 --> 00:26:34.180
Thank you for listening.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.430
(clapping)

00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:42.342
- Okay, thanks Dennis.

00:26:45.045 --> 00:26:47.098
Are we on my slide? Thank you, Dennis.

00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:48.831
So, I thought I'd dovetail that

00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:51.502
and give a little bit of what inspires me,

00:26:51.502 --> 00:26:52.593
and I was thinking about this

00:26:52.593 --> 00:26:54.404
as we were talking about this

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:56.150
for the past three or four months,

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.441
I'm like "What inspires
me in what I'm doing?"

00:27:00.441 --> 00:27:02.394
I continually went back to

00:27:02.394 --> 00:27:04.624
when I was graduating from high school

00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:07.423
in a very small town in Illinois.

00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:09.768
Actually, we lived outside
of town, in the country,

00:27:09.768 --> 00:27:12.191
and my dad owned a junkyard,

00:27:12.191 --> 00:27:15.744
and being a gay man I had
no desire to work on cars

00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:18.715
or do anything that would get me dirty.

00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:21.764
So my dad said "Well,
you need to get a job,

00:27:21.764 --> 00:27:23.578
so go get a job at the county home,"

00:27:23.578 --> 00:27:25.828
the nursing home, which is
about two miles up the road.

00:27:25.828 --> 00:27:28.830
I'm like, "Oh, that can't be too hard."

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.913
So when I got there, the D.O.N. said,

00:27:33.105 --> 00:27:34.442
"You're going up on the unit for

00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:36.810
the retarded people and the mongoloids."

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:38.841
I'm like, "Oh, okay."

00:27:38.841 --> 00:27:41.001
I didn't even know much
about what that was.

00:27:41.001 --> 00:27:42.881
When I got up there, though,

00:27:42.881 --> 00:27:46.281
it was a unit of 20 people and me,

00:27:46.281 --> 00:27:49.178
and that was it, that was the ratio.

00:27:49.178 --> 00:27:51.716
But I found two brothers
in a room together

00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:54.812
that were the brothers of our neighbors

00:27:54.812 --> 00:27:57.972
that I knew for my entire life,

00:27:57.972 --> 00:27:59.736
and I never knew that

00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:03.236
she had two brothers who had disabilities.

00:28:04.176 --> 00:28:07.051
And I worked there for four years,

00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:09.057
and I kept thinking,

00:28:09.057 --> 00:28:11.453
"There's gotta be a better
way for these people."

00:28:11.453 --> 00:28:13.936
There must be a better
place for these people,

00:28:13.936 --> 00:28:15.353
they're not sick!

00:28:16.506 --> 00:28:18.182
So after I graduated from college,

00:28:18.182 --> 00:28:21.767
I ended up starting to work
at a local ark organization,

00:28:21.767 --> 00:28:24.098
and one of the things that I did

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:25.436
in those four years I was there,

00:28:25.436 --> 00:28:27.823
was Illinois was faced with a lawsuit

00:28:27.823 --> 00:28:30.975
to get people with disabilities
out of nursing homes,

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:34.659
and one of my proudest moments
was when those two brothers

00:28:34.659 --> 00:28:39.249
moved into an eight bedroom
home with roommates,

00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:41.553
and they still live there today,

00:28:41.553 --> 00:28:43.212
and they're not living in a nursing home,

00:28:43.212 --> 00:28:47.191
and the family brings them
home now for Christmas,

00:28:47.191 --> 00:28:49.331
they don't ignore them.

00:28:49.331 --> 00:28:50.772
So I've changed some lives there.

00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:53.982
That, always, is my inspiration

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.045
for everything that I've done.

00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:58.319
The next 20 years of
my career was dedicated

00:28:58.319 --> 00:29:00.861
to moving people out
of restrictive settings

00:29:00.861 --> 00:29:03.612
and into a setting that
they wanted to live in,

00:29:03.612 --> 00:29:06.862
and that's what I'm always inspired by.

00:29:09.565 --> 00:29:10.402
Thank you.

00:29:10.402 --> 00:29:12.652
(clapping)

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:16.315
So, inspiration, I think,

00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:18.847
what I wanted to talk about,

00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:20.970
what do I want to say
about how to be inspired?

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:24.988
Well, I guess I wanna
say don't overthink it.

00:29:24.988 --> 00:29:28.332
I found some interesting information

00:29:28.332 --> 00:29:31.012
on a website called lifehack.org,

00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:33.230
and there's basically
four points with 12 tips

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.865
on just easy things that you should do

00:29:35.865 --> 00:29:37.357
that's always going to help you

00:29:37.357 --> 00:29:39.611
to stay inspired and be productive.

00:29:39.611 --> 00:29:41.944
One area is to stay healthy.

00:29:43.512 --> 00:29:45.006
These are pretty simple things.

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:47.194
Drink a glass of water when
you wake up in the morning.

00:29:47.194 --> 00:29:51.809
I drink a glass of orange
juice, but water works too.

00:29:51.809 --> 00:29:55.976
Another suggestion is to
move and sweat, exercise.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.468
Obviously, that's, as Dennis mentioned,

00:29:59.468 --> 00:30:02.073
that's the hardest one to stick to.

00:30:02.073 --> 00:30:03.913
I'm notorious for signing up

00:30:03.913 --> 00:30:06.099
at every gym every year in January

00:30:06.099 --> 00:30:08.055
and I quit that gym in, like, March.

00:30:08.055 --> 00:30:10.135
But I'm glad that I can support

00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:13.649
their capital investment by
giving them lots of money

00:30:13.649 --> 00:30:16.867
to keep their equipment up to
date because I don't use it.

00:30:16.867 --> 00:30:18.543
Getting sleep.

00:30:18.543 --> 00:30:20.528
Making sure that you're rested.

00:30:20.528 --> 00:30:22.907
Last night, it was the hardest time.

00:30:22.907 --> 00:30:24.915
Our roommates are getting
married this morning

00:30:24.915 --> 00:30:26.453
and I will never hear the end of it

00:30:26.453 --> 00:30:28.129
that I'm not there at their wedding,

00:30:28.129 --> 00:30:29.078
at city hall,

00:30:29.078 --> 00:30:31.137
but I had to go to sleep last night

00:30:31.137 --> 00:30:32.894
while they were all hooting and hollering

00:30:32.894 --> 00:30:34.714
and getting excited about today.

00:30:34.714 --> 00:30:38.881
But it always makes you more
productive the next day.

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.670
Planning your day.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.273
You should try and think of three tasks

00:30:45.273 --> 00:30:47.985
that you want to achieve that day.

00:30:47.985 --> 00:30:49.646
They can be little ones,
they can be big ones,

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:50.676
doesn't matter.

00:30:50.676 --> 00:30:51.995
But the important thing there is

00:30:51.995 --> 00:30:53.808
to kind of mentally have in your mind

00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:57.135
that probably those things
won't all get achieved,

00:30:57.135 --> 00:30:59.224
if you're like me.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.562
So having a plan on, like,
what are you gonna do,

00:31:01.562 --> 00:31:05.716
what's the backup plan if
you don't achieve all those?

00:31:05.716 --> 00:31:07.920
There's a thing called the 50/10 rules,

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.957
so you should work on some project,

00:31:10.957 --> 00:31:12.775
whatever your work is
for about 50 minutes,

00:31:12.775 --> 00:31:14.649
but then take a ten
minute break from that,

00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:15.764
whether it's a true break,

00:31:15.764 --> 00:31:16.919
or just to go do something else,

00:31:16.919 --> 00:31:19.131
maybe check email, if you're like us,

00:31:19.131 --> 00:31:20.430
I have about 20 emails

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.270
that pop up every hour in my email box.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.614
So, don't do something
unhealthy like I used to do,

00:31:27.614 --> 00:31:30.110
and go out and have a
cigarette for ten minutes.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:33.017
That's not a healthy option.

00:31:33.017 --> 00:31:34.979
Another thing is to reflect on your day.

00:31:34.979 --> 00:31:36.422
So at the end of the day,

00:31:36.422 --> 00:31:39.505
reflecting on what you have achieved,

00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:43.541
or a self evaluation of yourself.

00:31:44.738 --> 00:31:47.702
I encourage you just
to take time to think.

00:31:47.702 --> 00:31:49.618
One of the things I do when I get home

00:31:49.618 --> 00:31:51.962
is I just kind of go into our den

00:31:51.962 --> 00:31:53.715
and just kind of think about the day,

00:31:53.715 --> 00:31:55.385
and there's no goal there, of like,

00:31:55.385 --> 00:31:56.936
to write down what I achieved.

00:31:56.936 --> 00:31:58.736
Just process it.

00:31:58.736 --> 00:32:02.903
If you devote some time to
that, it really does work.

00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:06.994
Another thing is to keep learning.

00:32:06.994 --> 00:32:09.257
Reading, whether that's an actual book,

00:32:09.257 --> 00:32:11.384
or on an iPad or whatever.

00:32:11.384 --> 00:32:14.126
Always increasing your knowledge.

00:32:14.126 --> 00:32:16.688
Browsing, staying in touch with tutorials,

00:32:16.688 --> 00:32:18.158
or conducting research,

00:32:18.158 --> 00:32:19.943
or attending conferences like this.

00:32:19.943 --> 00:32:23.288
These can be very rejuvenating for you.

00:32:23.288 --> 00:32:24.363
Brainstorm.

00:32:24.363 --> 00:32:27.974
Think about, just brainstorming
can be a creative goldmine,

00:32:27.974 --> 00:32:32.141
just a kind of data dump of
stuff that you wanna try and do.

00:32:33.546 --> 00:32:34.379
Okay.

00:32:35.677 --> 00:32:38.456
And focus on what makes you happy.

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:40.065
Express gratitude.

00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:42.577
Think about ten things every morning

00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:45.481
that you're grateful for.

00:32:45.481 --> 00:32:47.372
It's easier than you think.

00:32:47.372 --> 00:32:48.534
I came up with five

00:32:48.534 --> 00:32:51.192
that just associated with
being alive again today,

00:32:51.192 --> 00:32:52.690
waking up, not dead.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:55.690
So it's pretty easy to do that part.

00:32:56.807 --> 00:32:58.768
Clean your desk,

00:32:58.768 --> 00:33:01.503
at your work, or at your home in your den.

00:33:01.503 --> 00:33:02.586
Keep it tidy.

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:05.317
If you're obsessive like me,

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.044
that's an easy one.

00:33:07.044 --> 00:33:11.959
I always do that, it's kind of
up there with making my bed.

00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:15.134
And then also, indulging
in some favorite things.

00:33:15.134 --> 00:33:16.769
Setting time aside to relax

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:19.569
and enjoy things that you like to do,

00:33:19.569 --> 00:33:21.526
whether that's playing with your pet,

00:33:21.526 --> 00:33:22.825
or whatever.

00:33:22.825 --> 00:33:24.728
Here in the Bay Area,
we're very fortunate,

00:33:24.728 --> 00:33:26.318
there's lots and lots of parks

00:33:26.318 --> 00:33:28.667
and things to go on walks.

00:33:28.667 --> 00:33:31.975
But it's easy to forget
to try and do that.

00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:35.290
For me personally, and my partner,

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:39.021
we had been sucked into the daily drama

00:33:39.021 --> 00:33:42.368
of what our current president is doing

00:33:42.368 --> 00:33:43.786
and it's hard.

00:33:43.786 --> 00:33:45.937
So we have now limited ourselves

00:33:45.937 --> 00:33:48.354
to one hour of MSNBC a night,

00:33:50.435 --> 00:33:52.563
although last night was pushing two,

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:56.384
just because it was a
new chapter in craziness.

00:33:56.384 --> 00:33:58.561
Anyway, so those are just some things

00:33:58.561 --> 00:34:02.200
that I thought would be
helpful to share with you.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.952
As we talked about closing today,

00:34:04.952 --> 00:34:09.046
we wanted to close with something
that's also inspirational.

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:10.301
Before I came to Homebridge,

00:34:10.301 --> 00:34:11.600
I had the opportunity

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.141
to work for an organization
called Creativity Explored.

00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:17.098
It's based here in San Francisco.

00:34:17.098 --> 00:34:20.909
It is a program for adults with
developmental disabilities.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:24.784
It's a visual art studio and gallery.

00:34:24.784 --> 00:34:25.959
When I came there,

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:30.042
I had left the world of
residential back in 2007,

00:34:31.342 --> 00:34:34.276
and dipped my feet into adult day services

00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:35.573
and employment training,

00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.213
and landed at Creativity Explored,

00:34:37.213 --> 00:34:40.171
not knowing anything about art.

00:34:40.171 --> 00:34:42.426
But this, tied with my story

00:34:42.426 --> 00:34:45.884
from back when I graduated from college,

00:34:45.884 --> 00:34:47.189
keeps me inspired.

00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:48.923
And I go back to Creativity Explored

00:34:48.923 --> 00:34:51.308
when they have openings
for new exhibitions,

00:34:51.308 --> 00:34:55.285
but it's truly an inspiring thing to see

00:34:55.285 --> 00:34:56.672
what these people do.

00:34:56.672 --> 00:34:59.624
So, with the permission
of that organization,

00:34:59.624 --> 00:35:01.672
I'm gonna show you a video
that they used last year

00:35:01.672 --> 00:35:03.188
at their fundraising gala,

00:35:03.188 --> 00:35:05.694
so you can kind of ignore
the fact at the end,

00:35:05.694 --> 00:35:07.923
that it talks about supporting them.

00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:10.350
But I thought the video is a great way

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:15.164
to kinda close this morning
up, and we hope you enjoy it.

00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:18.331
(inspirational music)

00:35:22.511 --> 00:35:26.053
- [Angela] Does Corinne think
of herself as an artist?

00:35:26.053 --> 00:35:29.886
Corinne thinks of herself
as being the paint.

00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:36.083
- [Lollie] From day
one, Roland was hooked.

00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:37.452
He loves it.

00:35:37.452 --> 00:35:39.797
And when he can't go
to Creativity Explored,

00:35:39.797 --> 00:35:41.738
he is not a happy camper.

00:35:41.738 --> 00:35:43.155
And neither am I!

00:35:44.189 --> 00:35:45.525
- [Maron] This is special because

00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:49.692
it gives my brother the
opportunity to be something

00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:54.545
in his life that he never before was.

00:36:05.422 --> 00:36:07.674
- [Angela] We knew early on,

00:36:07.674 --> 00:36:11.209
that she was gonna need care 24 hours.

00:36:11.209 --> 00:36:14.536
So if she's living with us,
and we're working everyday,

00:36:14.536 --> 00:36:16.659
what's Corinne gonna do?

00:36:16.659 --> 00:36:21.390
We really didn't know what
her future was gonna be.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.888
- [Maron] In my country,

00:36:22.888 --> 00:36:25.691
it's not opportunity, zero opportunity,

00:36:25.691 --> 00:36:27.941
for people like my brother.

00:36:29.978 --> 00:36:32.043
- [Lollie] I'm so fortunate
to live in this city

00:36:32.043 --> 00:36:36.154
that has a lot of resources
for people like Roland.

00:36:36.154 --> 00:36:38.256
Without it, I don't know.

00:36:38.256 --> 00:36:40.956
- [Lisa] For anyone who is caregiving

00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:42.925
for someone with a
developmental disability,

00:36:42.925 --> 00:36:44.644
they want their family member

00:36:44.644 --> 00:36:46.853
to have a good life.

00:36:46.853 --> 00:36:49.299
And if you're able to be expressive,

00:36:49.299 --> 00:36:51.172
and be in a positive environment

00:36:51.172 --> 00:36:53.053
for the majority of your day,

00:36:53.053 --> 00:36:54.406
that's gonna happen.

00:36:54.406 --> 00:36:56.066
- [Paul] Yeah, Roland doesn't say a lot.

00:36:56.066 --> 00:36:58.235
It's more of the action,
and it's more like

00:36:58.235 --> 00:36:59.818
how he does things.

00:37:01.106 --> 00:37:02.227
- [Eric] He's got these really

00:37:02.227 --> 00:37:06.202
intensely detailed grid network of lines.

00:37:06.202 --> 00:37:08.412
- [Lollie] What it means
exactly, I'm not sure,

00:37:08.412 --> 00:37:11.668
except that, that's how
he expresses himself.

00:37:11.668 --> 00:37:13.397
- [Paul] So Corrine,
there's such a passion

00:37:13.397 --> 00:37:14.984
in the sketches and drawings,

00:37:14.984 --> 00:37:18.164
and this energy that she
creates on these pieces

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:19.934
that doesn't matter so much

00:37:19.934 --> 00:37:23.069
that she doesn't say
anything in these words.

00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:25.349
She speaks in other ways.

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:29.516
- [Angela] I feel that socially,
she's accepted, finally,

00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.766
in the environment that
creativity gives her.

00:37:34.766 --> 00:37:37.272
- [Paul] It's almost like a miracle,

00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:39.241
some of the things that their children

00:37:39.241 --> 00:37:41.681
or their siblings start doing here.

00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:44.281
- [Eric] So the disability thing

00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:45.878
really fades to the background,

00:37:45.878 --> 00:37:48.734
and what we try to enhance is
what people are able to do,

00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:50.485
what their abilities are.

00:37:50.485 --> 00:37:51.443
- [Lollie] I was so worried about

00:37:51.443 --> 00:37:53.614
what kind of life we were
gonna have when he was born,

00:37:53.614 --> 00:37:55.626
and now he's a collectible artist?

00:37:55.626 --> 00:37:57.033
Oh my god.

00:37:57.033 --> 00:37:58.450
That's fantastic.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.234
- [Maron] It gives him a little freedom

00:38:02.234 --> 00:38:04.312
because in his entire life,

00:38:04.312 --> 00:38:06.117
he never earned the kind of money

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:08.700
that he earned in this program.

00:38:10.768 --> 00:38:13.568
- [Angela] I don't know if she
understands the word Pride,

00:38:13.568 --> 00:38:17.131
I just know that as long
as she can be the paint

00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:19.464
and the brush, she is happy.

00:38:20.805 --> 00:38:23.638
(inspiring music)

00:38:50.432 --> 00:38:52.682
(clapping)

00:38:55.547 --> 00:38:57.964
- Does anybody need a tissue?

00:38:59.585 --> 00:39:01.392
So, again, thank you so much

00:39:01.392 --> 00:39:03.781
for getting up so early

00:39:03.781 --> 00:39:06.461
and coming and listening to us.

00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:09.294
We hope that we have inspired you,

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.075
that you now have some
resilience in your life.

00:39:14.075 --> 00:39:16.967
Because, you know, I think
just seeing the video,

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:20.800
you can see, this is
where the inspiration is.

00:39:23.307 --> 00:39:26.211
But we wanted to close with a quote,

00:39:26.211 --> 00:39:29.976
from the renowned
theologian and philosopher,

00:39:29.976 --> 00:39:31.938
Albert Schweitzer.

00:39:31.938 --> 00:39:33.021
He once said,

00:39:34.115 --> 00:39:37.956
and he was saying this actually to youth.

00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:41.326
He said "I don't know
what your destiny will be,

00:39:41.326 --> 00:39:43.716
but one thing I do know,

00:39:43.716 --> 00:39:45.633
the only ones among you

00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:48.598
who will be really happy,

00:39:50.137 --> 00:39:55.083
are those who have sought
and found how to serve."

00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:57.113
So thank you for serving.

00:39:57.113 --> 00:39:59.446
(clapping)
