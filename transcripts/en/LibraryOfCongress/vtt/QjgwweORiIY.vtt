&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.070
&gt;&gt; Jason Steinhauer: Well
good afternoon thank you.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.350
My name is Jason Steinhauer,
I'm a program specialist

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.320
at the John W Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.010
Today's lecture is presented
by the John W Kluge Center

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.310
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.600
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
scholar center on Capital Hill

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.000
that brings together scholars and
researchers from around the world.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.840 position:56%
To distill wisdom from the Library's
rich resources, to stimulate,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.440 position:56%
energize one another and to interact
with policy makers and the public.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.320
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.150
postdoctoral fellows and PhD
candidates to conduct research

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.330
in the Library of Congress
collections.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.310
We also offer free public
lectures, conferences,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.380
symposium and other programs.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.570
And we administer the Kluge Prize,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.130
which recognizes outstanding
achievement

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.420
in the study of humanity.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.530
For more information about
these and other events,

or visit our website
loc.gov slash Kluge.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.810
Today's lecture is titled Imagining
the Amazon, European Colonialism

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.640
and the Making of Modern
Day Amazonia.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.400
Our speaker is Anna Browne
Ribeiro, now completing her tenure

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120
as a Kluge fellow at
the John W Kluge Center.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.320
For the past decade Browne Ribeiro
has engaged in archeological

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.450
and ethnic graphic research
in the Brazilian Amazon.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.010
With a particular focus
on anthropogenic

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.420
or human made landscapes of
the deep and recent past.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.660
At the Kluge Center, she is working

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.710
on her book project entitled
Rethinking Empty Places,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.710 position:56%
An Archeology of Amazonian Dwelling.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.760
Which revises notions
of tropical forests

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.950
by combining archeological
evidence with critical rereadings

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.900
of early accounts of
European travels in Amazonia.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.250
Her talk today examines how in
spite of archeological evidence,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.400
that counters such narratives,
the language of colonialism,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.180
shaped and continues
to shape how the Amazon

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.280
and Amazonian peoples are
depicted, conceptualized

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.790
and most importantly managed.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.680
Anna Browne Ribeiro is Co-Director
of the Interdisciplinary Project,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.560
origins culture and environment
housed at NPEG in Brazil.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.520
In 2013 she was awarded funding
by the National Geographic Society

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.230
for her project history

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.190
of a crossroads an
Amazonian city in deep time.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.880
Her current work intro leaves
deep historiography of Amazonia

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.190
and tropical places with
data driven geoarcheological

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.860
and anthropological
research with a focus

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.500
on human environment interactions.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.110
Brown Ribeiro received her PhD
in anthropology at the University

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.900
of California Berkeley in 2011.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.350
Was a social and biological
sciences postdoctoral fellow

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.890
at the Ohio State University
from 2011 to 2013.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.640
And then moved to the NPEG

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.090
as a postdoctoral fellow
bridging the cultural anthropology

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.190
and archeology departments.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.750
She has published in the
Journal of Archeological Science,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.070 position:56%
Latin American Antiquity and
Archeological Review from Cambridge.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.480
And has contributed
chapters to edited volumes,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.800
dealing with travel writing.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.680
For the past seven months,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.700
she has been a Kluge
Fellow at the Kluge Center.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.510
So please join me in
welcoming Anna Browne Ribeiro.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:55.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.050
[ Silence ]

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.400
&gt;&gt; Anna Brown Ribeiro:
Can everyone hear me?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.700
Yes, okay.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.860 position:56%
So first of all I wanted to thank
Jason for that amazing introduction.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.600
And also the Kluge Center for
offering me the opportunity

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.890
to come here and sit down and
read and write and get a feel

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.800
for the history of ethical
part of the research

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.250 position:56%
which is something I don't normally
get to do, when I'm out in the field

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.300 position:56%
or teaching classes in Anthropology.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.780
Of course the Library of
Congress, anyone that works here,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.680 position:56%
the collections officers, the people
at the maps room who have helped me

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.370 position:56%
for the past few months, gather data

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.080
that I'm going to be
presenting today.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.030
As an archeologist of course
I love maps, so we're going

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.320
to be seeing a lot of maps today.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.500 position:56%
And the Kluge Fellows who've offered
an amazing environment for me.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.810
Both the ones that are here and
ones that were here last semester.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.620
They have really helped
me to open up the way

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.030
that I think about these histories.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.720
And of course thanks to all of you
for coming and being here today

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.630
to hear me talk about my research.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.110
Amazonia is a place
that is I will show you.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.700 position:56%
Has been profoundly misunderstood in
it's history and it's functionality.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.880
This has had grievous
consequences for the environment

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.270
and for the people who live there
and potentially for the world.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.480 position:56%
What I'm presenting here, I could
never have envisioned ten years ago,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.210
when I first went to the Amazon.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.430
In fact, it took me a year and
a half from my first return trip

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.230
to actually understand that I
wanted to go back and why it was

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.970
that I wanted to go back.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.550
It's oddly fitting that I should
be here presenting the research

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.410
from my first book on the Amazon.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.260
At the Kluge Center, a
place that was made possible

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.560
through the generosity
of John Kluge.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.770
Who as it happens also created
the fellowship program that got me

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.650
to the Amazon in the first place.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.690
How things circle back.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.490
So let's take a look at the Amazon.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.670
And I've purposely created this
blank slate for us to look at.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.630
Just to situate everyone, this
is northern South America,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.690
Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.950
Amazonia has historically
been portrayed.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.000
Hang on a second.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.700
As places excessively fragile and
primordial or a savage forest.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.110
This is made plain in debates over
how to conserve, preserve or talk

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.890
about responsibilities
for this place.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.950
However, the idea of preserving
or reputedly pristine landscape,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.440
though appealing to
some, must be revised.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.850
In light of evidence archeological
and ecological that shows us

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.560
that the Amazon has been
very very much modified

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.230
over the last 2,000 years through
human and natural processes

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.890
and usually the two
working in conjunction.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.020
The pristine forest that
was at times romanticized

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.960
and at a times demonized by
European writers, is a myth.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.240
I explore the roots of
these misconceptions.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.060
We're going to trace the emergents
of the pristine forest myth

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.140
through discovering
narratives, enlightenment thought

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.480
and later anthropological writing.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:20.080 position:56%
These institutions sedimented these
ideas in Western thought and I argue

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.180
and I think you'll probably
see, that they continue

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.900
to impact the way we think
about the Amazon today.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.070
During this sort of revisionist
work, understanding the things

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.290
that lie at the roots
of our misconceptions,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.130
help us to revise our
assumptions and think

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.080
about different possibilities
for Amazonia.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.110
Part of understanding
this is understanding

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.820 position:56%
of the landscapes constructed people

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.340
at the same time people
constructed landscapes.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.860
The European travelers
that took it all in,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.160
they understood certain kinds
of landscapes to be inhabitable

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.020
and other kinds of landscapes not.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.230
Their first reaction,
their first contact

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.440
with Amazonian landscapes I argue
is what eventually the shaped

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.740
that we see it today.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.620
These are what I call the
roots of these misconceptions.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:16.630
My work engages with a broader
anthropological approach to place.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.360
As well as with fundamental
methodological issues surrounding

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.570
narrative, model building
and representational troughs.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.270
I find place to be a useful concept

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.870
because it requires an embodied
understanding of human existence,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.270
that means we exist in our
bodies, our minds are not separate

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.870
from our bodies, we
experience the world

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.800
as material beings
in a material world.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.080 position:56%
In the words of Edward Relph, a
humanistic geographer who is writing

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.080
in the 70's, place is primal.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.320
It arises momentarily and
makes us as we make it.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.800
In other words, people,
places and times, events,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.110
actions are co-constitutive.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.240
This means that places are
also historically contingent,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.840
at every moment a place
isn't what it was before

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.490 position:56%
and it's never going to be the same.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.810
They're meaning latent,
someone has to perceive a place

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:07.940
to define this as what it is.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.540
We're continuously remaking
the world, re-signifying it

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.030
and we're always in place.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.070 position:56%
But since the 1970's anthropologists

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.970
and archeologists have become
increasingly interested

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.950
in the notion place, as the
meeting laden and contingent idea.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.440
Drawing upon social theory
and philosophies scholars

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.120
like Tim Ingold, Barbara
Bender, Margaret Rodman

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:34.200
and Charles Cobb have explored the
power of places and landscapes.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.270
Considering the material of
conditions of our encounters

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.290
with the world, it's critical
to understanding the past.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.540
It's critical to understanding as
populated, not as a place frozen

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.750
in them, devoid of human intention.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.890 position:56%
It's important to consider humans as
agents, people that were thinking,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.780
that were learning, that were
deciding whether to continue

00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.380
on a path or to change
their actions.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.980
And that they have
their own histories

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.490
and their own understandings.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:09.000
But most importantly, it helps us
to comprehend out own encounters

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.350
as scholars with the
locations that we visit.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:16.010
And so that we know or at
least have an awareness

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.000
that we might be seeing
things in a particular way.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.340
There's a figure missing.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.970
Okay well I was going to propose,
that what we're going to learn

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.780
about the Amazon is that
there's a different kind of order

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.570
to that place, an order that
wasn't was envisioned by Europeans.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.450
Europeans were use to
certain kinds of landscapes,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.660
they had come up in agrarian
societies and tempered places

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.250
and understanding the
ecology of a place

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.900
like the Amazon wasn't
something was going to be easy.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.750
And they were also coming to
the Amazon with particular ideas

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.930
about the what the tropics or the
tourism could or could not support.

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.950
And they generally thought
about that as uninhabitable.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.300
And the idea of uninhabitability
is really crucial

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.170
to understanding why the Amazon is
treated the way it's treated today.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.760
And why those ideas if
shifted, could change the way

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:16.390
that our future is
entangled with its future.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:22.610
The first half of my talk, is
going to deal with these encounters

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.670 position:56%
and I'm going to focus a lot on the
maps, the materials that I got here.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.730
They've added a lot to my
understanding of the Amazon.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.230
I wish I could show you all
of the maps that I've found.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.660
But I'm just going to, I'm
going to do a little snapshot

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.960 position:56%
and I'll be happy to talk about some

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.650
of the other findings
that I had afterwards.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:40.960 position:56%
And then the second half of my talk,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.570
I'm going to through a
quick archeological example,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.490
that comes from my PhD
dissertation research.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.650
Through which I construct
an embodied account

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.950
of life in the Amazon.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.250
And the way that I was able

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.960
to understand how a
landscape was transformed

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.030
through human action it was
completely and entirely contingent

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.660 position:56%
on thinking about people as sentient
beings that could perceive things,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.000 position:56%
could understand things and could
make decisions about how to proceed.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.950
Slight disclosure I think
Jason already told us a little

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.830
about this but, I come
from historiography

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.620
and I come from geoarcheology.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:24.170
And for those of you who don't
know what geoarcheology is,

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.380
it's the application of
earth science methods

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.320
to archeological work.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.480 position:56%
And I focused mostly on soil science
methods because as you will see,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.650
understanding the soils of
the Amazon was essential

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.720
to understanding why
certain choices were made,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.800 position:56%
both by Europeans and by Amazonians.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.520
In terms of a kinds of
resources they would use

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.760
and the how they would
inhabit or not this landscape.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.760
And so which Amazon?

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.470
The Amazon is a complicated thing,
because it's not just one thing.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.180
The Amazon is several things.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.990
In fact I usually the
term the Amazon,

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.680
to talk about this imagined place.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.300
Because it can be the Amazon River,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.290
the forests that are immediately
next to the Amazon Channel,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.400
it could be the drainage basin
of which is pictured here.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.750
But that's problematic because it
excludes the Orinoco River Basin

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.570
which is actually it shares
a watershed with the Amazon

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.050
as you'll see in the next image.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.200
It also excludes the Guianas
have very similar landscapes

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.950
but drain entirely to
the north and the east.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.370
This is an excellent example

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.160
of a different configuration
of the Amazon.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.200
It's a study done by NASA
scientists on the way

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.460
that trees green in dry periods.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:46.690 position:56%
So they're literally collecting
light information and creating a map

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:50.770
of the greenest portions of South
America during the dry season.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.170
And what we see looks like
a contiguous thing except

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.380
that the line at the
very top of the Amazon,

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.050
just above Colombia is
actually the Orinoco River.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.870
So we're including half of the
Orinoco River Basin in the Amazon

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.730
and the other half we're excluding
because of green patterns.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:13.000 position:56%
So Amazonia is really a shifting
landscape and the more that I travel

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.780
in Amazonia and the more that
I read, the more I realize

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.210
that it's not just forest.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.760
It's savanna's, it's swamps

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.250
and these things are
changing as climate changes.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.670
Which is something that we
have to become attuned to.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.260
And which is also why it's
important to think about the Amazon

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:32.480 position:56%
as inhabited because if you live in
a place, then you know what it does.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.980
And you're not likely to
treat it like any other place.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.330
Many times the solutions
that people apply

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.970
to using the Amazon today are
these Pan-Amazonian solutions

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.940
that really don't work
in most places

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:49.310
because at best they were
tested in one location.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.920
So we're really not
talking about one Amazon.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.160
We're talking about many
Amazon's that overlap,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.000
expand and contract over time.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.920
So let's talk about
the myth of the Amazon.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.920
As Neil White had pointed
out the very fact

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.660
that we call it the Amazon
should tell us something.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.580
And the very elusiveness
of Amazonia on the ground

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.430
as an entity that can't be bounded.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:23.000 position:56%
Or as I would put it, our insistence
that such an Amazon must exist.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.430
Makes it a place that
must be imagined.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.560
Let's look at how we've imagined
it in contemporary times.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:36.030
The largest rain forest
on Earth has been touted

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.540
as the lungs of the world.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.260
A global air conditioner and
as an essential carbon sink.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.940
Of those global ecosystems
services Amazonia has been said

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.800
to provide only the
last seems to be true.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.000
And apparently diminishing.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.230
The other two functions are myths.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.290
And apparently the need
for myths is great.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.430
As far as Amazonia is
concerned at least.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.610
Mythologies arise, circulate,
diminish and often come back

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:06.880
to haunt us and they will today.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.460
Regardless of whether these myths
are true, they serve a function.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:14.240
They tell us today why we should
care about a place that seems

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:19.490
so very very far away in
both space and in time.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.410 position:56%
Thanks to these myths we have an
awareness that Amazonia is important

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.840
to the future of the
Earth in some way.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.010
Whether it has to do with
environmental preservation,

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.550
climate change, conscious
consumerism

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.730
or on occasion indigenous
or human rights.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.440
These particular myths
also tell us something

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.000
about our ideas about Amazonia.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.300
That it's still possible to locate
the magnificent and the horrifying

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.360
in a place we have known
for nearly 500 years.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.080
Known but not understood.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.680
Occasionally I do a search on
the internet for the Amazon.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.580
And after I've filtered through all
the search results for the site,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.170
I usually come up with
images like these.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.740
People advertising it's nature or
people calling for it's salvation.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.300 position:56%
Rarely do we see pictures of people.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.320
But people made the Amazon.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.500
So we need to rethink this.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.300
And when I first traveled to
the Amazon, even though I knew

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.430 position:56%
that I was going to an archeological
dig and I knew that I was going

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.870
to be excavating things
that people did,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.940 position:56%
I still had these images in my head.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.010
And I think a lot of us
do or a lot of us hope to.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.850
And that's something to explore
and that's something that's kind

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.150
of beyond the scope of what I do.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.770
But I just want to
throw that out there.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.370
I remember thinking, on the
plane, I'm going to the Amazon.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.200
I'm going to the Amazon.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.930
How cool is that.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.490 position:56%
So I want to talk about that
Amazon, that mystical mythical place

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.620
that we learn about in school
and through film and even

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.370
through reputable news outlets.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.000
How did this place come to be?

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.720
Even on the map the Amazon
was discovered and labeled

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.870
as the sweet sea in 1500.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.710
It wasn't until February of 1541

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.050
that people understood
it as a river.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.710
It was in that month
that Gonzalo Pizarro,

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:23.500 position:56%
then governor of [inaudible] a
province located in modern day Peru,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.560
went in search of the fabled land
of cinnamon, [foreign language].

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.040
There he hoped to extract at
a fraction of a cost a spice

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.990
that could be valued on a par with
the coveted Sri Lankan cinnamon.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.660
And in the enthusiasm of the
day, Pizarro saw the new world

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.960
as the land of opportunity.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.400
And sought not only
the land of cinnamon

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:47.590
but also the fabled
city Manoa or El Dorado.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:53.980
El Dorado is one of the names
of the fabled city of gold.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.000
Also known simply as Dorado,
Manoa del Dorado, Parime, Patiti,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.310
the lake of gold, the castle of
gold and several other names.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:07.990
El Dorado features in discovery and
scientific narratives for centuries

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.820
as late as the 18th century.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:16.730
So what we're looking at here,
is an archeological object.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:21.860
That's attributed to the muisca
people and they were known

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:28.980 position:56%
in Colombia apparently legend has
it that the king would adorn himself

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.670
in gold annually as part
of a renewal ceremony

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.600
and then he would bath in a lake.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.700 position:56%
And many who will think that this is
the origin of the myth of El Dorado

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.510
but as you'll see El Dorado
gets located much further away,

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.000
not 50 years later.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.850
When I talk about El Dorado,
I'm also indexing other kinds

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.820
of narratives of treasure and I
know that I have green hell here,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.410
that should really say
green hell or paradise.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:03.090
Because depending on your
perspective it could be either.

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.120
So I'm talking about the
idea of an earthly paradise

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.460
which Europeans were also
seeking in the new world.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.750
I'm talking about our Garden
of Eden, a land of plenty

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.460
or opportunity or in the
words of Voltaire's Candide,

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.890
the best of all possible worlds.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:20.680
After ten months of
fruitless voyaging Pizarro

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.840 position:56%
and his crew found themselves
entering an unknown forested valley.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.230
Hungry and dangerously low on
supplies, the party stopped,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.030
sending captain Francisco de
Orellana down the Coca River.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.470
With a small crew in
search of salvation.

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.960
The small crew was completely
unprepared for the size and force

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.460
of the [inaudible] or so
they would later report.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.600
This along with their utter
ignorance of the terrain,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.800
a green hell by some accounts.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.660
Combined to make a
return journey impossible.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.220
Instead Orellana and his men
journeyed down river to the east.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.320 position:56%
Completing the first fully
recorded decent of the Amazon River.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.340
And I think it's crucial
here that Orellana

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.820
and his men were not planning
to do this and didn't know

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.290
where they were going to end up.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.650
Because the narrative that
we get from the journals,

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.470 position:56%
even though it falls in the genre of
survival literature, is free of some

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:21.230
of the ethnological thinking,
protoethnological thinking

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.260
that later structures
narratives of this place.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.970
It would be another 100
years before anybody was able

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.190
to complete the journey and it
was done in the opposite direction

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:34.980
and the narrative that we get
then isn't June 21st we stop

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.230
for food, people were friendly.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.350
It sounds more like, well
these are the people,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.690
these are their customs,
this is how they eat.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:49.180
And so instantly the Amazon, that
is a place the size of Europe,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.730
is reduced to a single
point in time.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:55.830
And all of the people that live
in it and all of the landscapes,

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.290
are equalized and this
is what sticks.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:05.090 position:56%
The term green hell by the way comes
from a narrative by a historian,

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.010
some say a very well,
I would say to sort

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.750
of dubious reliability
named Garcilaso de la Vega.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.550 position:56%
He was born just about the time that
the voyage was departing in 1540

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.000
and he was writing 60 years later.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.190
And he was gathering not
only accounts of this voyage

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.490
but of several other voyages

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.100
and he was writing a history
of the kingdom of Peru.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.720
And his work comes up later
because he was paying attention

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.430
to other things that
were being reported

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:36.450
and then he gets cited as well.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:38.840
So part of what I'm doing, even
though I'm looking at images

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.750
and I'm looking at maps, is I'm
tracing how these ideas flow

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:48.330
from one place to another.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:54.240
So, not long after that, we
get an early map of the Amazon,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.080
now this isn't the first one that
I found but it's interesting.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.800
Because it's the first
one that I found here

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.780
and this is here by the way.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.450
That has the earliest
one I should say,

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:09.360
that has not just a
representation of the river

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.620
and it's course more or less.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.100
But it also has images of people,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.210
right and actually this fantastic
snake like representation

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.240
of the river appears
over and over again.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.250
But I just want to call your
attention to what's happening right

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.340
in the middle of the scene, which
is the scene of cannibalism.

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.770
Even though the only story of
cannibalism that people had

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.240 position:56%
at the time was from the shorelines.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.850
They've located this in the Amazon.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.760
What's happening on the
shorelines is still maybe something

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.060
to be considered primitive,

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.430
we have hunting people
live in huts or tents.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.880
But the cannibals are
in that unknown place.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.030 position:56%
So now let's look,
systematically at some of these maps

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.730
and what I've done is
I've split them up,

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.450
we're just going to
look at two periods.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.870
Because they have different
patterns to them.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:00.200
So this is the earliest map that
is in the Library of Congress.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.680
And one of the things
I love about it,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.710
is that it's actually very
true to what people knew.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.050
We don't have the whole
outline of the continent,

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:10.740
we know the river is huge.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.520
We know that it goes from
Iquitos which is in the mountains

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.450
to the ocean and that's
all that we have.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.170
And the names of all the
tributaries or peoples.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.680
So, even though the outline
isn't great it's actually,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.250
one of the more accurate early maps
in terms of what it represents,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.400
what it presents to the world.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.670
And then we get at the
other end of the spectrum,

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:36.270
a map by Giacomo Gastaldi
and we think that it's his

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:41.270
and that it was made some
time between 1550 and 1556.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:45.340
None of his maps were signed
but it's been attributed to him.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.260
And he's done some interesting
things, the river flows north

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.440
to the south or rather
south to north.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.730
Iquitos is kind of right next to
the coast, so he wasn't working

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.440
with particularly good notes

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.510
but it's a very pretty map,
with lots of mountains.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.970
Most of which aren't
where he's put them.

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.540
The other thing that he's done
that I haven't seen in any

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.230
of the maps before 1590, is that
he's got the Castillo del Oro,

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.710
the castle of gold at
the very top of the map,

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.010
you'll see that in the closeup.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.920
And it's the only one
that I've found here

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.670
where that's actually
mapped some place.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.330
And the practice of mapping things,
even though people don't know

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:27.040
where they are was
actually quite prevalent.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.650
Which I suppose I should
have expected.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:35.230
And then as a sort of
middle of the road map,

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.220 position:56%
we get this very very busy map again

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.280
with an unknown author,
of unknown authorship.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.370
And there's no mention
of any gold castles,

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.030
we have I think slightly
better river courses

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:54.020
so he's got a little
bit more information.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.080
Probably some things coming
from the Portuguese at one end

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.290
and from the Peruvians on the other
or from Iquitos at the other end.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.010
But a lot of these early maps are
almost illegible because they're

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:07.090
so busy and they're so full
of wind roses and flags.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:09.270
But it's interesting to see
that that's what's important.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:13.450
What's important is that there are
cities and anytime someone mentions

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:18.930
of people, this author has drawn a
castle, which I think is amazing.

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.940 position:56%
Because that goes away very quickly.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.100
So initially it was just assumed
that these were all civilizations

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.030
that built castles, just
like they have in Europe

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.560
and so they have their flags and
they have the name of the king.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.610
So, that is very different
from what I expected to find.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:39.190
So then I asked myself
what happened?

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.490
Right, what changed?

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.350
Because when you get to the 1590's
and I actually think this map isn't

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.040
from 1590 which is what's
listed here I think it's from,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.260
it almost has to be from after 1595
and I'll tell you why in a second,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.080
I hate to mysterious
but no I love it.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.540
Is that we get the, the Parime lake
which I've tried to highlight here

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.960
and again a slightly
closer view of it.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.890
Which is the lake of gold.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:15.150
And it's in the Guianas, it
might also be referenced as Manao

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.550
but it's the first time that
it appears in this place.

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:24.840
And then it just appears in
all of the maps after that.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.640
Right up until 1750,
possibly beyond.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.460 position:56%
Right around then, around 1748
people start being a little bit more

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.820
cautious so, some of the authors

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.890
like Guillaume Sanson will
still represent the lake and try

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.010
to give it a size, the dimension
and put it amongst mountains

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.960 position:56%
as the description suggests and some
of them will just say well here's

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.290
where I would put the lake of gold
if I was sure that it was here.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.280
But it's interesting that they
don't, they don't just exclude it,

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.010
they say this is where some people
say the lake of gold exists.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.680
And that happens in
several languages,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.560
it happens in several editions.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.710
So it's a practice, it's
people beginning to think

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.000
about representing things
in maps in a different way.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.300
So what happens at the
end of the 16th century

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.860
that has changed the way that
these representations occur.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.860
Well apparently Sir
Walter Raleigh happened.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:26.930
He journeyed from England, he was
very desperate to gain the favors

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.570
of the crown, he was
desperate to find this place.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:37.710
And he writes this narrative of
going to northern South America

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.650
to the Guianas and searching for
this lake and talking to people

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:46.490
and what we actually think happened
is that he talked to a Spaniard,

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.460
some Spaniards who'd
been there longer

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.920
and gotten these narratives
from indigenous peoples.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.160
And they were telling him that
yes there is a lake of gold

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.150
and lies just beyond the mountains.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:59.640
And there's actually been some
interesting archeological done,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.260 position:56%
work done to think about why these
stories of gold were happening here.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.750
But it's also interesting to
note that people are talking

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:10.750
about gold coming from
this place called Manao all

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.720
over northern South America.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.830
And we do know that there
were extensive trade fruits

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.120
that crisscrossed northern
South America at that time,

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:24.690
the time that Europeans
came so, it's conceivable

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.720
that it was just the case of
someone saying oh it's just

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:31.290
over the mountain, things
actually being a lot further away.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:34.990
Needless to say no such lake exists
but there is a marshland there

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:39.390 position:56%
that when it's flooded,
semiannually might look a little bit

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:41.440
like Sir Walter Raleigh's
representation

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:46.180
of the map which I didn't put in.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.350
Sorry. So how, so Sir
Walter Raleigh happened

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:55.190
and what's so important about him?

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.570
The only thing that's
important about him is

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.460
that everybody was reading him.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.120
He was considered one of the
greatest sort of trappers,

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.900
he was given prominence
in his writing,

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.200
as someone who had been there.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.840
And at the time people that
have traveled were given credit

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.810 position:56%
for things and Richard Hakluyt
actually explicitly acknowledges Sir

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.360
Walter Raleigh as the person

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.160
from whom he received his
most reliable information.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.980
So Richard Hakluyt founded
the Hakluyt Society,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.480
he wrote the Principal Navigation's
and he was very highly regarding

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.480
and endorsing Sir Walter Raleigh.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.630
He basically backed things that he
said and that has to be the reason

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.300
that everybody puts the lake

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.020
where they do even though
no one ever sees it,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.840
for as long as they do.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.170
Some also suggest that people
were reading Garcilaso de la Vega

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.270
and particularly his accounts of
cannibalism, which is something

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:56.080
that we might come back to.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.380
Depending on the time.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.510
The other thing I wanted
to point out is that,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:06.070
at the time that these authors
were constructing these maps,

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.970
maps were full of monsters
and writing full

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.050
of monsters and that was normal.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.600
Right I mean we're talking
about 1550's up to 1650,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:20.650
we're in a premodern science
context, prescientific paradigm.

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:22.280
So it's not surprising that some

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.200
of these maps contain
these fantastical elements.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.440
What is surprising is
that even though we know

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.540
that fairytales don't exist today,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.150
that we still locate
them in the Amazon.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.180
And that they survived you
know a couple of centuries

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:43.350
of pretty rigorous scientific
thought, how did this happen?

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:46.170
So I draw upon the work of Linda
Tuhiwai Smith's specifically

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.540
for this but also of people
that study travel writing

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:57.370
like Mary Louise Pratt, her work
on how the intellectual movements

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.760
of the enlightenment
sort of solidified a lot

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.500
of these ideas as really important.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.240
But I also draw a lot upon Neil
Whitehead who was a historian,

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.190
a anthropologist and
historiographer of the Amazon.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:12.350
But this idea circulation
that I use substantially,

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.340
particularly in this article,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.300
comes from Linda Tuhiwai
Smith who is a Maori Scholar.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.920
And one of the things she says is
that distance is very important

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.800
in constructing these narratives.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:31.460
These two images of the Amazon,
the green hell and El Dorado

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.130
or if you want to call
them the optimistic

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.030
and pessimistic narrative,
they became the basis

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.660
for future understandings
of Amazonia.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.460
Which was one of these
really far away places

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.790
and I think it's really
important that there was a year

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.150
in between the first decent
of the Amazon and the second.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.790
Because that gave people a
lot of time to refigure some

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:52.170
of these early narratives and
write them into their ideas

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:58.520 position:56%
of what the place could and couldn't
support and eventually what it meant

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.690
to be savaged or I think the
cannibalistic narratives kind

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:05.590
of helped in that and what
it meant to be civilized.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:12.710
So it's interesting that Amazonia
and maybe a couple of other places

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.290
in the world still have
these mythical reputations,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:19.380
because a lot of places
were far away back then.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.310
And so we're going to come
back to this but the discourse

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:23.950
of the inhabitability
or the underlying notion

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:28.950
of uninhabitability is very
important to this as well.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.720
But let's just think about
how these ideas were created,

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.370
so a set of people
set off on a journey.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.530 position:56%
They collected data and wrote some
narratives which were then sent back

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.830
to Europe where they
were read by scholars,

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.610 position:56%
recirculated exchanged, resignified.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:48.490 position:56%
Particularly if you're talking about
from 1650 onward people are starting

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.430
to try to systematize the Earth,
Europeans are creating systems

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:57.470
of taxonomy, they're getting
better understandings of geography,

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.360
they're understanding longitude,
they're creating better maps.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.410 position:56%
And they're trying to create systems
of order or ordering the world.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:12.820
And so what happens is that these
archetypal images of people come

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:16.210
into being and they also, they
come into being not just along

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:19.740
with images of places but in
the context of images of places.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:23.300
I was really shocked at the
length of the discussion

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.410
that Charles Marie de La
Condamine who's pictured here,

00:34:26.410 --> 00:34:30.850
who was sent off to measure the
equator, he was a cartographer.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.980
The amount of time that he
spent talking about things

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.150
like the Amazons and El Dorado it
seems an inordinately long amount

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.850
of time but evidently this was
something that had to be grappled

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:43.600
with in terms of the order
that was being constructed

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:48.780
and it also functioned
in that order.

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:52.080
I argue that places like
the Amazon where the foil

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.840
against which civilization
was constructed.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.670
Oh, I always forget to say this.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:04.900
These ideas of El Dorado and
green hell they still circulate

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.670
and not just in the media.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:11.020
But also in anthropological
and archeological text.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.000
El Dorado was sited just in 2001.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:20.510
So.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.030
Places were co-constructed
with subjects.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.090
And this is the opposition
that we're left with.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:35.510
And one of the things
that I've noticed is

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.170
that those ideas still exist.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:42.600
Except today's green hell
isn't uncontacted tribes,

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.520 position:56%
although occasionally that becomes
part of the lost paradise narrative.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.660
It's deforestation.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:55.010
It's burning, it's the lose
of the atmospheric carbon sink

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:58.190
and on the other side of the
coin, we have this green jungle,

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.240
the optimism for life, the
exuberance people going to try

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:10.650 position:56%
to name species or discover curious
pharmacological research and as late

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:13.540
as earlier last century
there was a lot of sort

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.330
of mining going on in the area.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:19.070
So there was a lot of optimism,
there's a very old idea

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.900
that the tropics produce
everything in excess

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.090
and I think that's something that
continues to be carried through.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.560
The other thing that I get

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:33.870
from Linda Tuhiwai Smith is
this really important connection

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.190
that she makes and I think
other scholars make too,

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.100
with the idea of property.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:46.490 position:56%
And I think she's not pointing out
the property issue but she's looking

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:51.710
at Locke and he says that as
much land that man tills, plants,

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.720
improves or cultivates
and can use the products

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.500
of so much is his property.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.410
So essentially if you're an
agriculturist then you can claim

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.200
property and be civilized.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.640
And one of the problems
that Europeans have faced

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.100
over the centuries in the Amazon
is that they can't seem to tame it.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:20.090 position:56%
Many projects have tried and failed,
the Portuguese initially tried

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:26.100 position:56%
to setup what they considered to be
functional colonies, growing cotton,

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.410
the soils of the Amazon are
not appropriate for this,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.300
we're going to be looking
at that in a second.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.840
But at the same time there's this
idea that you have to be able

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.610
to master nature in
order to be civilized.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:46.730
And if Europeans insisted on seeing
the Amazonian jungle as pristine,

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:51.220
then of course they could never
have mastered that nature.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.170
And I think at the root of
this idea of this excessive

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:59.900
and exuberant nature that can't be
mastered and this is just an idea

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.010
because as the archeological
narrative shows it has been

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:06.190
and can be.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:12.870
This is the route of both the green
hell and the paradise narrative.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.150
And as soon as we take
down that notion,

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:17.650
then both of those images collapse.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.320
So if we go back to the
idea of an untouched jungle,

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.140
we know that no longer exists.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.120
And it's also not worth
preserving which is something

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.160
that we should think
about for the future.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.650
But it also means that there
have been different ways

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.590
of managing the landscape
that weren't agrarian.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:38.400
And that is what the
archeological narrative shows us.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.150
So I'm not going to get into
this idea about the plough

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:44.310
but there's a very clear connection
between agriculture and society.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:49.520
This comes from Hobbes's De Cive
on civility on civilization.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:55.060
And on the one side we have
imperium which is order

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.100
and there are people
farming and on the other side

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:03.750
of course we have the natives
they're based on American images,

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.370
right sort of native
American's or savaged peoples.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.270
And not only are they
brandishing bows and hunting

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.820
but they're also just off
to the side of the picture,

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.680
there's a cannibal, there's a
scene of cannibalism happening.

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.240
So there's a very clear
opposition between agriculture

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:28.170
and not an agriculture and
there's a closeup of that.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.790
So these oppositions that are setup

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.770 position:56%
in the merging scientific narratives
get picked up in other language

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.850
and anthropological thought.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.690
Particularly the narrative
about agriculture.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:44.310
One of the things that is
crucial to the development

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.310
of complex societies,
which is the archeological

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.710
or anthropological version
of the idea of civilization,

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:53.700
is that people must be able to
produce an agricultural surplus,

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.170
if it's impossible to produce
an agricultural surplus

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.440
or if those peoples haven't
engineered technologies

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.890
that could produce an
agricultural surplus,

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.040
then there is no wealth
to be amassed.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:12.340
And then there can be no inequality
and then there can be no dominion,

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.730
no kingship, no social hierarchy.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.890
So social complexity and
anthropology is based entirely

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:22.760
on the idea that a complex society
has multiple levels of hierarchy.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:28.020
Which is also a notion that's been
challenged and yet people continue

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:31.790
to do research in the Amazon and
in other places that aren't suited

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:37.200
to monocultures particularly
looking for the staple crop.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:42.310
Which is an idea that really only
makes sense in tempered climates.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.920
So again, the narrative persists.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.810
And I just wanted to point out,
I pulled this up yesterday.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:57.840
That sometimes the
image of the green hell

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.490
and the lost paradise coexists.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:05.300
And I think they particularly
coexist in these kinds of stories

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:11.470
that pull up images of so
called uncontacted tribes

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:12.770
that were discovered in the Amazon.

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:15.610
And I had a quote from the story,

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:23.010
but essentially National Geographic
sensationalizes this image

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:28.220
of what they call tribal warriors
looking up in alarm at a plane

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.150
that flew over their camp which
is something that isn't suppose

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.940
to happen with uncontacted tribes.

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.530
And just to clarify because
the stuff has come up.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.210
The unconcated tribe isn't a
tribe that hasn't been contacted,

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:44.470
it's a tribe that at least in
the Brazilian government speech,

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:47.120
that there has been an agreement

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.310
that people will be
limiting contact.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:58.270
So it's not that people don't
know that these independent,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:02.320
sovereign tribes exist,but
there has been an agreement

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.470
that there will not be commerce
of any kind social or otherwise

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.770
in between government
agents and the tribes.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:17.480
And so when you see a picture
like this it's not a savage coming

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.350
into contact with the modern
world, we're not looking

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.600
at something that's frozen in time.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:28.340
This is a breach of a
contract that's being filmed.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.580
So let's get the story straight.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.160
And I do like to talk about
the tyranny of the plough

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.630
because I think at least in
archeology we have become slaves

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:42.320
to the idea that we have to find
agricultural societies in order

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:47.990 position:56%
to find civilization, which is also
code for interesting places to work.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:56.800
And so if you don't have evidence
of metallurgy, big temples

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:02.670
or monumental architecture and mass
agriculture then people often think

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.120
that there's nothing to research.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:07.050
And what Amazonian
archeologists have been showing

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:11.010
for the last 30 years is
that they're very wrong.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.000
And so I'm going to talk quickly,
Jason how we doing on time?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.610
Okay. I'm going to talk
quickly about Terra Preta

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:25.720
which is sometimes translated to
English as indigenous black earth

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.020
and this is a term that's used

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.510
in Brazil very commonly
[foreign language] means

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:36.090
that it's a black soil
that was of the Indian,

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.870
right of the indigenous person
but also made by those people.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.220 position:56%
And I think that's really important
to point out and so when people talk

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.520
about indigenous black
earth I don't think

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.240
that really captures
the full meaning.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.560
What do we know about Terra Preta?

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.160
That is a carbon and
nutrient-rich soil.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.490 position:56%
That is always associated with
large amounts of occupational debris

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.390
so there's a lot of
ceramics and sometimes fawn

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.600
of remains or remains of bones.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:04.850
Occasionally human remains
as well and plant remains.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:08.700 position:56%
And usually very very very dense,
scatters of these things if you look

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.850
at the image on the right, with
the archeologists trowel laying

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.550
out on what looks like rocks,
those are all ceramic sherds

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:21.790
and that's a undisturbed piece
of land that we just walked on.

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.080
They're often situated on bluffs
that's not particularly interesting

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.890
I think anymore, but
what's really interesting is

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:30.400
that they're more stable and
less acidic than oxisols.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:33.870
And oxisols are the dominant soils
in the central Amazon where I work,

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:35.910
they're slightly different
classifications for a lot

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:40.290
of the soils, right near the Amazon
but most of them are very oxidized,

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.390
they're very old, they can
be up two million years old.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:46.540
And these sites often
have earthworks and some

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.610
of them are very large and
some of them are very small.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:49.910
And I'm going to talk a little bit

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:55.240
about what you might call medium
sized, house sized earthworks.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:59.780
Why do we care about Terra Preta?

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.920
Well if you look at the
dominant Amazonian soil,

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.410 position:56%
to the right the oxisol, there's
less than five centimeters of humus.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:10.020
And most of that if you
clear cut that land,

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.030
goes away within a year or two.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.800
And even if you don't
you're not going

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.130
to get very good return
for planting there.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.530
So farmers recognize when
they see at the Terra Preta

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.570
that they're going to get much
better returns from farming.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:26.140
Also the deep root
the Terra Preta is,

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.280
the longer people have
inhabited that space.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.160
There's no correlation in
terms of inches or centimeters,

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.380
depth and time but, something
that I think, that's about 50

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:40.970
or 60 centimeters deep is probably
a very long term occupation

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.930
and when we have hiatus's
we now understand

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.120
that there are different kinds
of soils that intervenes,

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.050
so that is a continuous occupation.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.230
And I'm going to show you the site
that I worked for my dissertation

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.260
and it only has about
20 centimeters of soil

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.460
and I think we're looking
at 800 years.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:58.000
So, this site and I think
is [foreign language].

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.240
We know we're looking at something
that started around 500 BC

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:06.580
and went right up until
just about contact.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.610
Stability is the other thing.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.180
So not only are these
soils more nutrient-rich

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:13.030
but the can be farmed
for longer periods.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:18.670
So even if you clear cut and do a
monoculture on a Terra Preta soil

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.790
which isn't recommended, you
can still farm that soil for up

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:23.940
to ten years, opposed
to two to three.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.380
Sometimes people stretch it to five

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.860
but they're really not
getting very much return

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.990
for their labor when they do that.

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:37.230
So, at the top, on the
right, is one of the densest,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.780
darkest Terra Preta
sites that I have worked

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:41.430
on in the central Amazon.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:46.750
It is I believe at least
30 hectares in size,

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.490
they're are very large mounds
some of which are funerary,

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.380
some of which we haven't
quite understood yet.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.000
And if you look at the bottom

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.540
that site [foreign language]
has been farmed in this way

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.630
with several monocultures
for over 25 years.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:06.320
I will say that we know that
the current owner does use soil

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.630
amendments but the advantage is

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:09.880
that they don't get
washed into the river.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:15.550
Which is what usually happens if
you use NPK or potash those sorts

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.170
of things on regular
Amazonian soils,

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:21.130
so another bonus for
the environment.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:26.240
So, why do we care about, what
do I care about Terra Preta,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.000
I think archaeologically
there's lots of reasons to care.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.530
They emerge all across the
Amazon, very quickly it seems

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.900
to be phenomenon that spreads from
one end of the Amazon to the other

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.260
in the space of a couple
hundred years.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:44.950
By about 1100 AD, there are massive
sites with palisades and earthworks

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.640
at several of the major
crossroads, so we have a technology

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.960
that has spread and yet
we have different kinds

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.860
of ceramic traditions
which indicates different,

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:59.430
at the very least different
stylistic ideas or creative trends

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:01.550
and potentially different
ethnicities if you look

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.870
at the distances on a map.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.660
It's not absurd to
think that we're talking

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.930
about different ethnicities
using the same sets of practices.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:13.280
So what it represents is the
tremendous change in the way

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.090
that humans are relating
to the environment.

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:17.680
And one of the key
questions that people have is,

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.290
well did they know
what they were doing?

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:23.930
And so it's something that I've
been researching and I think

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.030
that the best answer is
that initially they didn't

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.770
and at some point they
figured it out.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.600
Because there are some groups in
the Amazon today that make a sort

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.120
of Terra Preta to use as
gardens intentionally.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.880
Some of them are indigenous
and some of them are what we

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.130
in Brazil call traditional
farming groups

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:43.500
which is an officially recognized
government category of people

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:46.270 position:56%
that have been inhabiting the
Amazon for a certain number of years

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.040
and have a different way of
interacting with each other

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.800
and with Brazilian civil society.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.030
Then Brazilians would but they
aren't necessarily indigenous

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:00.680
because of shifting populations
and there's a lot going on there

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.750
but let's just say multiethnic
communities that live

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:07.760
in the forest using some
traditional practices and some

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.060
of which might have been learned

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:12.940
from indigenous populations
or a throop heredity.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:18.110
I'm interested in how
these things were formed

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.980
at the level the individual.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.600
Because I think that if we can
find out how people were able

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.030 position:56%
to make the soil then, it
shouldn't be that hard to replicate.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:30.580
It is hard to figure
out how they did it.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:35.530
And so what I did, was I
appealed to soil science.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:42.790
And I also started studying the
way that, that sites were made

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.770
in the present, so as
people inhabit a space,

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.640
what are the kinds of
things that happen?

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.340
What is the evidence of these
everyday repeated actions

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.320
which we call practices?

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.920
And one of the things that one
of my mentors pointed out is

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:01.000
that these earth ovens, in
this case it's a brick oven

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.660
but usually they're earth ovens.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.830
That people use create a
certain kind of charcoal,

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.540
that's a really important
ingredient in Terra Preta.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:13.010
And so that was the first thing
that I noticed that made me think

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.720
that maybe we should be
studying more than the soil

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.970
but also the things
that are in the soil.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:18.960
So normally a soil
science will take,

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.980
soil scientist will take a soil
sample and grind it up and put

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:24.880
into a machine and analyze it.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:28.040
And what I did with a host
of undergraduate students,

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.910
there were more than 20
people helping me in the lab,

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.400
was we didn't crush the
samples, we separated everything

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.720
and we analyzed all the little
bits of the things that were

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.910
in these soils to try to
understand what were the things

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:43.550 position:56%
that contributed to the formation of
Terra Preta and what are the things

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.850
that told us what people
were doing at any given time

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:49.540
on a particular piece of a site.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.170
And we're talking I was looking, I
was comparing areas about the size

00:50:54.170 --> 00:51:00.060
of this room, so medium to
large house areas to each other.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.740
And so in addition to looking
at tiny pieces of charcoal

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.440 position:56%
or charred plant remains we also
ended up looking at tiny tiny pieces

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:11.270
of ceramics or burnt clay which
might have come from ovens.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.880
They would've looked
different from this one but,

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:17.790
we've excavated some things that
look a little bit like earth ovens.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:21.320
Moving right along bio-char is
the most important ingredient

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:23.760
for Terra Preta because
it's very very stable.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.260
And it also holds onto
other kinds of nutrients.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.760
If you put bio-char together
with little pieces of bone,

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:33.720
appetite then you get
an extremely strong bond

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.350
that makes these soils
even more fertile,

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:38.770
so it's important not only
people were burning things

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:40.250
but they were cooking.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.000
Right or that they
were burning garbage

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.550
that contained animal remains,
probably cooking would've happened

00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:49.580
in the unintentional scenario
and the burning garbage

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.870
with animal remains in
the intentional scenario.

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.160
Right so initially people
would've figured it out

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:58.430
and then they would've started
doing the intentional burning.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:03.870
So I'm looking, this is from
my friend Morgan Schmidt's work

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.530
with the Kuikuru Indians
in upper Xingu,

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:11.090
they make middens intentionally,
they cultivate them in the sense

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.150
that they order the way
that they dispose of garbage

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:19.430 position:56%
and then they will use certain parts
of the middens as gardens depending

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:23.690
on how long they've
been sort of simmering.

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:27.460
And so here we have banana trees
and lemon trees and lime trees,

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:30.540
things that wouldn't be
growing on Amazonian soils,

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.370
growing right in peoples backyards.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:35.750
Very quickly this is the village,
the orange blobs are houses

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.960
and the things behind them are the
middens, the mounds of dark earth

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.830
that people use for gardens.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.440
So in the central Amazon,
there's lots of beautiful pottery.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:55.860
I did a study like this at a
site that consisted of 12 mounds

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:57.320
that we thought were houses.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.810
We excavated them and we found
out that did seem [inaudible]

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:05.840
to be constructed underneath the
platform which is the clay floor

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:08.050
that has the horizontal lines.

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:10.890
Is a very charcoal rich soil
which I initially thought would be

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:13.800
like a Terra Preta but
upon analysis realized

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.360
that that was a garden soil.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.110
Some of the houses had gardens
underneath them and some

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.380
of the houses had other
houses underneath them.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.130
Plotting this spatially.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:26.240 position:56%
I'm sorry to move so fast I get a
sequence of occupation so we started

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.970
with one house, that house
eventually sprouted other houses

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:33.040
and these houses were starting
to be built on platforms.

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.230
We're not exactly sure why yet.

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.290
But eventually the entire landscape

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:40.500
and this is a circumscribed
peninsula

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:43.350
that was entirely taken
up by houses.

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:45.150
Right up to the flood line.

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:48.450
And so what happens when you
circumscribe people on a piece

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:52.170 position:56%
of land and you're depositing all of
your garbage next to your houses is

00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:56.150
that you get very very
rich soils, very quickly.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:59.750
And so I recently published
an article that demonstrates

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.390
that this is how the soils
were transformed suddenly

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:06.380
through a combination of population
growth and circumscription.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.470
They overwhelmed the ecosystem

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:14.400
and transformed what would
have been a very sterile soil

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.750
into a very productive soil.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:20.300
This demonstrates that
people were instrumental

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:23.840 position:56%
in instigating ecological change but
that in this case they didn't seem

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.120
to be doing it on purpose.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:31.620
That they were there for several
hundred years, so I don't know

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.170 position:56%
if you caught the chronology but
we're going from about 300 to 500 AD

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:38.060
to 800 AD, so that's 500 years.

00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.700
And that they were investing
in constructing this landscape

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.290
in a particular way
in spite of the fact

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:44.880
that they were sacrificing
their farmland.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.810
And so evidently farmland
wasn't terribly important.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.880 position:56%
So if you think about the way
people occupied space then and think

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.000
about the way people occupy space
now, we might be able to come

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.090
up with better strategies
for managing the Amazon.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.550
Very quickly going back to
the picture of the village,

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:01.950
what I want to emphasize
is that as long

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.350
as someone is inhabiting this
space, they're going to be invested

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.680
in thinking about how
to make it better.

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.750
As long as were just using it
and extracting things from it,

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.070
for the purposes of
the outside world,

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:14.850
then we have no chance
of preserving it.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.690
So thinking about the Amazon
as a global carbon sink,

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:20.710
might help in the short run but
isn't really particularly helpful

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:23.210
in thinking about how
we inhabit the Amazon.

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:27.100
I don't know whether I should
tell everybody to go live there,

00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.740
probably not, but I think that
the solution is the project

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:35.510
that I'm running now or one
potential solution is to work

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:38.630
with communities independently

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.890
to see how they manage their
landscapes, see what we can offer

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:45.940 position:56%
in terms of archaeological
evidence, archaeological narratives,

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:51.110
tactics to try to help them
create a better management system

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:55.330
so that their growing
populations can be well articulated

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.850
with this very complex ecosystem.

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:00.600
That doesn't respond well
to [inaudible] cultural.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:06.410
So, all that being said,
thank you to all of the people

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:09.210
that made this possible
including all of you.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:12.050
And I'm through.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:13.850
Thank you.

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:21.600
[ Applause ]

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:23.590
Two minutes for questions?

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.000
Two minutes for questions.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:31.570
Yes?

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:32.870
&gt;&gt; What happen after 800?

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:39.110
You said this was going
from 300 to 800 AD?

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anna Brown Ribeiro: So we
actually think it went on until 1100

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:43.300
but we don't have a date for 1100.

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:44.990
But that's when most of the sites

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:48.920
in that area stopped being
inhabited or they changed hands.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.090
And so we actually think
happened is this case is

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:54.510
that a different group
moved in up river.

00:56:54.510 --> 00:57:04.060
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:07.360
Well I, so I think what
I'm trying to say is,

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:11.070
that in that particular case,
Terra Preta stopped being produced

00:57:11.070 --> 00:57:13.860
and we think it's because a
different group moved in from upper

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:17.550
and they didn't have those
practices that created the soils,

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:20.590
they actually, we actually that
they took some of these mounds

00:57:20.590 --> 00:57:22.390
and they took them
down and spread them

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:24.740
out to create larger
agricultural fields.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:27.040
So these are people that were
coming from the south and east

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:28.790
and they were moving through.

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.500
And we have some evidence for
warfare that suggests that.

00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:36.100
If you go to the Madeira River,
just down the river and then

00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.990
up a little bit, we actually
have Terra Preta that's being

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:42.010
manufactured up until 1700.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:47.700
Along with ceramics that are
continuous with this tradition.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:50.330
So in some parts of the
Amazon the practice continued.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:55.130
But so much, the population
were so destructuralized

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.190
after European encounter,
particularly because of disease,

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:01.180
that it's very hard to
pinpoint where that came from

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.540
and the group that's in the upper
Shengru we're fairly certain have

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:08.270
nothing to do with these groups
that were in the central Amazon.

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:11.710
And so, again I'm thinking about
this is a kind of technology

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:14.510
that spread and can
be utilized again.

00:58:14.510 --> 00:59:39.500
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.050
So I you said conference
or conflict?

00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:45.280
Either? Yeah I.

00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:52.030
I have not seen any
specific references in text

00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:53.940
and if you have I would
love to see them.

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.580
I do think it's very clear

00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.590
that in the Amazon the
[inaudible] were also trying

00:59:58.590 --> 01:00:03.580
to create little replicas of
good Spanish or Portuguese towns

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.640
with peasants that
had particular jobs

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:10.260
and they had these very rich
realized ways of instituting sort

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.100
of village status replace and
creating rectilinear streets.

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.720
They had these prescriptions
for establishing settlements

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.620
that envisioned a particular kind
of landscape that they wanted

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.050
to reproduce in the Amazon.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:26.220
And the idea that there
were this exuberant nature,

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:29.450
made it seem eminently possible.

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:31.930 position:56%
But the thing that they weren't able

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:35.100
to understand I think
was two things.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:39.580
First of all that there had been
no impetuous to agriculture before

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.580 position:56%
so a lot of the peoples that they
were trying to convince to come live

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.890
in these towns had no
interest in living in them.

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:46.910
They had no interest in
wages, they had no interested

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:50.980
in tilling the land and of
course it was a fruitless venture

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:52.580
in most places in the Amazon.

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.230
I mean we see it happening towards
the Vazia [assumed spelling],

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.320
which is actually sorry
towards the flood plane area,

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.580
let me speak English.

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.180
In the [inaudible] area, which
is again a different Amazon

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.250
but as we move up river it
becomes virtually impossible

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:11.890
and you constantly see
letters written to Europe

01:01:11.890 --> 01:01:15.590
of people complaining, oh I
can't keep the neophytes here,

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:19.440
they keep running away, I need more
labor, can we have different rules

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:24.130
for descending Indians, can we
go and try to find other people

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:26.110
and some of these are,
you know there's good

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:27.410
and the bad and the ugly.

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:31.480
But there's definitely this,
this idea that's being pushed

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.480
and they're running up
against all kinds of,

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.990
there's an incommensurability
between what they expect to see

01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:43.760
and what they envision as
good earth, good earth is one

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.370
of the things that they
site, oh this is good earth,

01:01:45.370 --> 01:01:46.690
this is bad earth as they go down,

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.260
this is good country,
this is bad country.

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:54.920
And what ideas that already
existed about what as a good way

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.540
to inhabit the landscape
and what was fruitful.
