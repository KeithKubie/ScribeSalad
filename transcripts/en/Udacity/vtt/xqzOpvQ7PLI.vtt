00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:03.998
Let's move on to another trait. Dwarfism. Dwarfism describes

00:00:03.998 --> 00:00:06.677
an individual of particularly short stature as a result

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:09.075
of slow or deficient bone growth. Now the most

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.085
common type of dwarfism occurs in roughly one out of

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.343
10,000 people. Let's take a look at a fictional

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:19.850
family with an African American background. This is Bobby. And

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.690
here's a pedigree of Bobby's family with regards to

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.350
the trait of dwarfism. Here you see that Bobby is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.500
unaffected by dwarfism. And neither his mom or

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.560
his dad or his sister, are affected by dwarfism,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.269
either. However, he has a paternal grandmother. A

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.141
paternal uncle. And two first cousins, male and female,

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:41.337
that are affected by the trait of dwarfism.

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:44.681
Before we explore the genetic reason behind this trait.

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:47.376
I want you to first tell me the inheritance

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:50.777
pattern that you see for dwarfism in this pedigree.

00:00:50.777 --> 00:00:54.160
Based on the pedigree you see here. And what you've already learned about

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.653
inheritance patterns and dominance. I want you to tell me first what you

00:00:57.653 --> 00:01:01.606
think the most likely inheritance pattern is for dwarfism. Is it autosomal, sex

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.610
linked, or maternal? And tell me the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.920
dominance, does it look dominant or recessive?
