ALICE: Please help me welcome
to the stage Andrew Cyr

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.868
and members of
Metropolis Ensemble.

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:12.682
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:13.890
ANDREW CYR: Thank you, Alice.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.240
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.870
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.980
I began Metropolis
Ensemble 10 years ago,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.140
in part with a
simple guiding notion

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.510
that the heart of the
classical music tradition

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.350
really embraces and celebrates
exploration and discovery

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.620
and really the search for
new forms of expression.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.810
You know, the great works
that make up today what

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.840
we call like the
repertoire, the canon

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910
are often the ones that
represent-- for the composers,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.870
they're kind of like
wildest experiments,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.070
or their most bold sort of
unusual works performed.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.440
But today we don't often
associate classical music with,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
for example, technology or
groundbreaking new things.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630
But the instruments that we now
kind of are very traditional,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.560
like the violin, or
the piano, or even

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.930
like the antiquated pipe organ--

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.700
at the time, these
instruments were

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.530
kind of really
newfangled inventions

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.420
and were kind of like the Google
of yesterday, so to speak.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.580
New forms of
tuning, for example,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.510
in Bach's time, and then later
advancements in chromaticism

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.340
with Wagner, for example--

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.690
these things that dazzled
musicians and listeners alike.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.320
And they presented really
endless forms of variations.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620
Metropolis's first experiments
in music technology

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.480
really started in
2008 when we did

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.990
a remix of "The Rite of Spring"
with Ricardo Romaneiro, Ryan,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.540
Francis and engineer Leo Leite,
and we never looked back.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.110
Today, I'm very
thrilled to present

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.910
another one of our
roster composers

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.740
and close collaborators,
Elliot Cole, whose explorations

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.410
in original software, I
guess I should call it,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.430
are interwoven with his
beautiful and evolving music

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.462
aesthetic.

00:02:00.462 --> 00:02:02.670
He will be joined by a
handful of Metropolis Ensemble

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.570
musicians--

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.140
Eric Umble on clarinet,
Jordan Dodson on guitar,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.980
Gabe or Gabriel
Cabezas on cello,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.110
and Andrea Lodge on piano later.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.599
So thank you so much,
and I hope you enjoy.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.350
ELLIOT COLE: HELLO, everybody.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.280
So we can switch now
to my screen here.

00:21:00.832 --> 00:21:04.824
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:21.790
Right.

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.332
I'm Elliot Cole, and
I wrote that music.

00:21:27.332 --> 00:21:28.790
And you're some of
the first people

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.010
to see behind the
scenes of how I started

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.140
thinking about those
patterns, how I started

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.730
working with that material.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.250
And I'm excited to be here.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.830
Usually I just present
the music and don't really

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.880
talk about programming.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.820
I think that people
want to believe

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.270
that the music comes straight
from your soul and this bolt

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.300
of inspiration.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.839
And I think that, I
don't know, people

00:21:51.839 --> 00:21:54.380
don't want to imagine that it
spun out of a computer program.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.200
So I'm excited that you
guys are listening now,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.600
because I think you're
interested in programming,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.851
right?

00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:01.350
Great.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.560
So you know that it's just as
much a world of inspiration

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:12.320
and discovery and expression
and as much as music or art.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.130
So I don't have to
have to convince you.

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.094
So I'm just a self-taught
amateur programmer.

00:22:19.094 --> 00:22:20.510
But I grew up with
a professional.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.790
My mom taught herself
to program and ended up

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:26.900
coding GIS software for the
state of Texas in the '80s.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.020
And I grew up--

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.150
she taught me HyperCard.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.233
Do you remember HyperCard?

00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:34.340
Did anybody-- yeah.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.250
So me and her were doing
HyperCard projects together

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.900
when I was like
really a little kid.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.554
And I chased music, but
I always kind of knew

00:22:43.554 --> 00:22:45.470
in the back of my mind
that this was the thing

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.950
that I could come back to
and figure out on my own

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.840
if I wanted to when I needed to.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.290
So I picked it up
about seven years ago

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.574
to start this project
that I have shown you now.

00:22:58.574 --> 00:22:59.990
So tell you a
little bit about it.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.430
It's called "Bloom."

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.920
And I started down the
rabbit hole of this music

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.570
because I for
inexplicable reasons

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.580
was fantasizing
listening to a music that

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.305
just sounded like this.

00:23:13.305 --> 00:23:27.674
[MUSIC - ELLIOT COLE, "BLOOM"]

00:23:27.674 --> 00:23:29.340
So I first started
trying to write music

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.770
like this at a piano.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:33.750
I would lock myself in
a practice room, piece

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.720
of paper, pencil,
and I thought that it

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.360
would be kind of easy,
because all I wanted to hear

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.250
was random notes.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.740
And you'd think it would be
easy to sit down and write

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.570
random notes.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.140
Turns out it's really hard
to try to not make choices.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.720
As soon as you're there
feeling every little thing,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.020
you start to care about this
pull and this push, and are

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.340
these two things attracted?

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.600
Are they too much attracted?

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.870
Do we have to thwart them
with exactly the right note

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.542
at exactly the right time?

00:24:01.542 --> 00:24:03.000
You can kind of
make yourself crazy

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.720
trying to make the perfect
thing when actually there's not

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.660
really a perfect thing to find?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.660
This is what I started
to suspect as I

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.750
was trying to do it this way.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:20.430
I like to think about art as
a dialogue between expression

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.810
and discovery.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.420
Expression pulls something
out of us that's inside of us.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.080
Discovery is something outside
of us that we bring in.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.110
And I think when I was
trying to write this at first

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.290
at the piano I was trying to
express something of myself

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:34.980
in it.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.800
I was trying to choose exactly
the right notes that only

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.850
I would choose.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:43.025
But I-- really this was
the wrong path for me,

00:24:43.025 --> 00:24:44.400
I think, because
it really needed

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.960
to be a music of discovery.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.530
I really wanted to be able to
go out and find these things

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.960
and then make choices,
then care about them,

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.970
then figure out
which ones I liked.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:25:00.000
So my mental image here is of
a garden, of a wild overgrown

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:00.720
garden.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.740
And each plant is a little
constellation of notes.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.260
And my job--

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.760
I was commuting on New Jersey
Transit like three hours a day

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.760
in this time in my life.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.440
And I dreamed of just
being able to sit

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.570
with my eyes closed and
my computer half-shut

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:20.550
and just listen to bloom
after bloom after bloom

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.340
from this garden,
explore it with my ears,

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.070
and pick things that
I like and shape them

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.600
and transplant them and
make them a little softer

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.132
and make them a little fuller,
spin them around, try them

00:25:31.132 --> 00:25:33.090
out different ways, and
make some kind of music

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:38.190
of subtle variations
of what I think

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.060
are kind of infinitely
beautiful, simple, random sets

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.940
of events.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.197
So I wanted to do--

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:50.530
I thought a computer would
be a good way to approach it.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.300
I thought of my mom.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.920
I thought my mom would
say, just write a program.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:53.800
You can do it.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.186
So I started learning this
programming language called

00:25:56.186 --> 00:25:57.810
SuperCollider, which
a lot of musicians

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.470
use because it's got
a synthesizer built in

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.620
and started trying to
represent my blooms.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.040
So you'll see that
it's a class that

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.630
is really just three lists.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.072
There's a list of notes,
a list of velocities--

00:26:13.072 --> 00:26:14.280
it's a little confusing here.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.185
Velocity here means
volume, basically.

00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:19.350
It's how fast you play the key--

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.460
and time intervals.

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.850
This is how much time
is in between each note.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.905
And then I wrote a
whole library of--

00:26:26.905 --> 00:26:28.530
that's probably not
the technical word.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.020
I wrote a whole bunch of
methods for this class

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.100
that you've seen
a bunch of already

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:37.020
for manipulating those
lists, basically.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:39.300
And then I started
figuring out ways

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.440
to write patterns that
would read out these lists,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.200
spinning infinitely
in every direction,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.779
like you've also heard some of.

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:49.320
Those are the
experiments that turned

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.210
into a couple of
these pieces that I'm

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:52.215
sharing with you today.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:58.010
So I just have a couple
of reflections of things

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.160
that I've learned about, and
then we'll hear some more music

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:03.320
on the piano.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.060
So I've learned
a lot about music

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.790
from listening to a lot of
these random sets of notes.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.490
And I think there are
three main things.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.352
One is that making sense--

00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:15.560
this feeling that we have
that something that we hear

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.469
makes sense--

00:27:16.469 --> 00:27:17.510
what does that even mean?

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.520
Like, it's something
that we know,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.350
but it's very hard to quantify.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.420
I think it's about
making simple shapes

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.090
and being able to
perceive simple shapes.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.100
So check it out each
of these blooms.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.537
[MUSIC - ELLIOT COLE, "BLOOM"]

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.540
I don't know.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.050
To me, they all kind of make
sense as musical gestures.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.400
They make sense because there's
actually one dimension of them

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.050
that is in a simple shape.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:52.430
So it's random notes,
random time intervals.

00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:56.660
I better show it
to you let's see.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.600
So random notes,
random velocities,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.970
random time intervals,
but the velocities

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.850
are sorted largest to smallest.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.370
So they start loud, and
then they get quieter.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.220
And just by applying
this one envelope,

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.450
this one shape, across whatever
random materials is in there,

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.550
creates a gesture
that makes sense.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.790
It feels like a single thing.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.845
It feels like a whole.

00:28:23.845 --> 00:28:26.220
So that's the first thing I
learned making sense in music

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.100
is about making simple
shapes in some dimension.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:36.000
Second thing is that not every
dimension needs to make sense.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.740
If you can make one dimension--

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.400
volume or pitch or
rhythm or timbre--

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.250
make a lot of sense, then
you get a lot of freedom

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.800
to let the other
things not make sense.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.920
So those are the two
things that, even when

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.190
I'm not making music
with the computer,

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.760
I'm thinking about as
I'm making music now.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:02.660
And then the last thing is
that memory is everything.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:06.020
Whether or not we've heard the
sound before or not is actually

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.320
maybe the most salient flavor
compared to the content

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.570
of what's actually in there.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.740
So let's do an experiment.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.960
I'm going to play the
same line three times,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.250
and I just want you to check
in with the experience of how

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.500
the first one feels
different from the third one.

[MUSIC - ELLIOT COLE, "BLOOM"]

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.520
A traditional musical
analysis would say, oh,

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.610
it's three identical
sets of pitches.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.490
But the experience of them
is so different, right?

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:51.910
The first one is baffling.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.600
And the third one is
like pretty satisfying--

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:56.760
to hear it exactly
the same way with all

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:59.770
of the subtle variation.

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:03.930
So I think that this is
why sitting at the piano

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.380
and trying to write this was
a little bit crazy-making.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.860
There's no right or
wrong note to choose.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.930
Notes don't matter
in themselves.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.810
They come to matter through
repetition and familiarity

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.930
and having a relationship
with your memory.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.590

I've learned doing this.

love to have a conversation,

more music that we could do,

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.620
so what do you think?

Hi.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:12.516
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:12.516 --> 00:37:15.490
So I know there are visual
tools for manipulating music.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:18.030
So how does this
programming language

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.990
help you above visual tools,
like Fruity Loops or whatever?

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.520
I'm not a musician,
so I don't know.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:29.340
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah, yeah,
most of the software that's

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.020
kind of commercially
available to make music

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.680
is to make music easier, right?

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:40.680
So it's like designed to be
recorded, played in, maybe

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.240
clicked in, and
kind of composed.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:50.940
But none of them let me
write an abstract pattern

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.950
irrespective of the
pitches that are

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:54.340
going to be in it, for example.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.548
That's something that I
really want to be able to do.

00:37:56.548 --> 00:37:59.670
I want to be able to
say, I want a series of--

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.490
I want this rhythmic pattern
to happen this many times.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:04.860
I don't care what
the notes are yet.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.230
And so being able to work
on that level of abstraction

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.760
is just not something that
Ableton or Fruity Loops

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.910
or Logic are designed to do.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:19.470
So I like thinking about
this as music the hard way.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.520

dumb to do it this way.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:24.300

a much simpler way.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.950
Yeah, but it shaped my
thinking much bigger than that,

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:47.107
I think, in a couple of
the ways that I described.

00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:47.940

00:38:53.486 --> 00:38:58.200
AUDIENCE: So when you want
to have a musician play this,

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.181
do you have to do some
tweaking for the instruments?

00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:02.430
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah, definitely.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:06.870
So not all things are
possible on all instruments,

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:11.940
and so I have to have a pretty
good idea of the end goal.

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.780
One, when I'm thinking about
the patterns in the first place,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.790
it's worth considering
what ultimately

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.700
is going to be playing this.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.210
But also, then,
there's a stage--

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:26.190
you know I can spin out
stuff all day, and some of it

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:27.430
I get really excited about.

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.350
And I record it all.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.260
But then there's the process
of turning it into a score.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.860
And in the process of
transcribing, turning it

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.180
into notes on a page--

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.210
a whole lot of
editorializing opportunity.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.197
It's hard not to make choices.

00:39:41.197 --> 00:39:43.530
And then I started cutting
stuff, making things perfect,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.540
fixing notes.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.430
So there's a lot
of composition that

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:51.930
happens after this
initial burst of stuff.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:55.160
And in that stage adapting
things to the instrument

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.784
is just something I do
on a note-but-note basis.

00:39:57.784 --> 00:39:59.450
AUDIENCE: So you do
that manually, then?

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:03.280
ELLIOT COLE:
Super-manually, yeah.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.032
It would be a fun project to
try to write the program that

00:40:08.032 --> 00:40:09.490
filters out the
notes that couldn't

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.160
be done at the same time
on the guitar or something.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.080
But honestly it would
take me three months,

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.131
and I might as well just do it.

00:40:17.131 --> 00:40:19.630

that was absolutely amazing.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.230
ELLIOT COLE: Oh, thank you.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.469
AUDIENCE: Thanks for that.

00:40:21.469 --> 00:40:23.635
And then, I'm interested
in the aspect of licensing.

00:40:23.635 --> 00:40:27.160
We know with software licenses,
we know with music licenses,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.510
I am not sure if
that bloom class is

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.670
music, is an instrument, but
have you considered licensing?

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.240
ELLIOT COLE: It's written
amateurishly enough

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:41.200
that I think it would be maybe
a little frustrating for anyone

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.440
other than me to learn to use.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:47.200
But it's written
in SuperCollider,

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.084
which is open source,
and so downstream it

00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:51.250
needs to be open source too.

00:40:51.250 --> 00:40:56.050
So I'm not in a position to
try to control what people

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.510
do with it or something,
if I'm thinking

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.680
of licensing the right way.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.140
But I'd be happy to share it.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.399
But it's a little quirky
and personal at the moment.

00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:07.690

the only one in the room who

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:08.260
wants to play with it.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:09.190
ELLIOT COLE: Oh, you
want to play with it.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.870
OK, that's--

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:10.490
AUDIENCE: Links to anywhere?

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.850
Do you have a GitHub repo
somewhere we can look at it?

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.130
ELLIOT COLE: No, I learned
how to do that once,

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.200
and then I didn't
do it ever again.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.010
So let me put my email
address right here.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:23.539

to share the code.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.050

be a good project

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:34.790
to kind of get it cleaned up and
write a little documentation.

00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.470

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:36.761
ELLIOT COLE: Thanks for asking.

00:41:40.916 --> 00:41:42.790
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you can describe

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.110
for this specific
piece, just for fun,

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.736
the nocturne-- can you describe
the process of how you composed

00:41:47.736 --> 00:41:48.235
it?

00:41:48.235 --> 00:41:49.690
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah
well, so that's

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:56.200
one where the idea came
from playing around in code,

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:01.230
but then the
composition happened

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.620
in a much more traditional way.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:04.680
So what I discovered
that I loved

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.520
is if you take a set of notes
that have different time

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.010
intervals between them
and different loudnesses

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:14.550
of each one, and then you just
double each entry, or triple

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:19.470
each entry, it's pretty magical
to hear three identical notes

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:23.370
with identical times in between
them, and then turn on a dime

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:27.300
to another set of four that are
really different, but also all

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.540
identical.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.840
And so that was what
I discovered I liked

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.110
by just manipulating lists.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:36.330
And then when it came to
writing this piece of music,

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:42.890
I kind of knew what I wanted
the motion in the melody to be

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:47.340
and then composed it at a piano,
feeling all the right notes

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.610
that I wanted to make, writing
this kind of linear bass

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.340
line moving.

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.850
So that's all kind of free
composed in the usual way.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.350
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.360
So this instrument opens
a lot of possibilities.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.450
I was wondering if compared
to more traditional

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.450
musical creation you
sometimes feel lost,

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.652
because you have
so many options?

00:43:11.652 --> 00:43:12.360
ELLIOT COLE: Yes.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.210
All the time.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:17.250
Yeah, I feel very
lost, especially

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:22.890
given that there aren't a
lot of points of intersection

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:25.560
with the rest of the world
where it sort of makes sense

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:26.580
to anybody else.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:32.230
So yeah, I mean I've
been challenging myself.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:36.870
I'm part of a tradition of
music education and values

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:42.720
that is about challenging
itself to be a little lost

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.920
and find your own personal
way to put notes together.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:59.220
And not having models
I guess let's me--

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.630
I don't know-- it's a loss that
makes me kind of confident,

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:06.990
because it's kind of just
between me and me, you know?

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.210
I don't know what
I need to do next.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:13.920
But I have a way to dig in and
find something that excites me.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.050
And I think that's
what it's for.

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.810
Yes.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:26.210
AUDIENCE: So here you've got
notes, velocities, and time

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:28.690
intervals to represent a sound.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.990
How easy or hard is that
to transcribe to something

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.020
with multiple instruments, like
the first piece that you did?

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:39.190
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah, that just
brings in my other skills

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.880
as a composer.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.600
So I may use this to generate
some big swath of material

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.970
and then say, oh, I hear this
line, which happened just

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.490
in a kind of random occurrence.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:53.440
I hear these couple
in notes be connected.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.780
I hear a melody happening there.

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.280
Maybe I'll extract
that and connect

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.750
those dots on a
single instrument,

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.730
or something like this.

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.470
There's not a kind
of computational way

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.110
that I think about that.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.570
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
tried applying these methods

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:11.530
to instruments that are
percussion or non-chromatic

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:12.220
percussion?

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:13.584
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah, definitely.

00:45:13.584 --> 00:45:15.000
I write a lot of
percussion music.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.420
Actually, I write
more percussion music

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:17.230
than other music.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:18.860
And it's a great way--

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.860
this also got me started
thinking about patterns

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.780
and cycles in the
abstract, which

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.220
is great for non-pitched music.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.850
So all I would need
to do is switch

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:31.000
the instrument in my
virtual instruments

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.190
here to a percussion
instrument, and I

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:36.340
would be exploring a totally
different kind of sonic space

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:37.480
with the same ideas.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.160
Are you a percussionist?

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that was one
of the first things I started,

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.140
and I've moved to other things.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.350
But I just thought
of the example--

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.532
we heard just the piano--

00:45:46.532 --> 00:45:49.820
you tried either
other keyboards,

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.020
and I thought, well, why
keyboards, maybe just

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.146
a non-chromatic percussion?

00:45:54.146 --> 00:45:55.564
ELLIOT COLE: It can be anything.

00:45:55.564 --> 00:45:56.730
This is just a little slice.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.688
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:45:57.688 --> 00:45:58.960
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah thanks.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.580
Question?

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:03.670
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about how the values that we

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.800
see in notes, velocity,
and time intervals

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.020
correspond to what we
would see in a more

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.436
traditional score, like how
you get from one to the other?

00:46:10.436 --> 00:46:11.860
ELLIOT COLE: Yes,
great question.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:16.390
I forget that this is
not a universal language.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:20.350
OK, so here, this
first bloom is 67.

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:22.360
The first note is 67.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.150
Note values are 0 to 127.

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:28.870
67 happens to be G4.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.940
Velocities are also
values 0 to 127.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:39.260
And so you know, 61 is
a very moderate volume.

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.380
And this is just in seconds--

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.840
0.9 seconds.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:51.640
So high-low numbers in notes
is high and low on a score.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.310
And velocities, you know,
we have forte to piano.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.530
We have these kind of
traditional markings.

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.860
And the hardest one to
represent is time intervals,

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:07.450
because this is
just in raw seconds.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.330
It's not on any sort
of rhythmic grid.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.410
It's not in any kind of meter.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:15.430
And so from a score music
notation point of view,

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:22.529
this is like outrageously
irresponsible and irrational

00:47:22.529 --> 00:47:24.070
to have all of these
numbers in here.

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:30.730
But the biggest
struggle has been

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:32.680
trying to represent
these rhythms on paper.

00:47:34.977 --> 00:47:37.310
AUDIENCE: You have a really
complicated line lower down.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.670
ELLIOT COLE: I remember.

00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.420
I practice that one.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:45.604
This one.

00:47:45.604 --> 00:47:46.500
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:47.746
ELLIOT COLE: This?

00:47:47.746 --> 00:47:48.602
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was wondering if you

00:47:48.602 --> 00:47:49.685
could explain [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:49.685 --> 00:47:52.219
ELLIOT COLE: Yeah, sure,
so this is a pattern

00:47:52.219 --> 00:47:54.010
that's reading through
one of those blooms,

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:57.980
so reading through each
note of the list in order.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:04.510
And so I is which item of
the list it is reading.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.570
Let's see.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:11.580
We'll go inside out.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.240
This is just a series
from zero to infinity.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.830
And it's going to
wrap around my loop.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:27.420
So this just represents going
through the list over and over

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:27.920
again.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:33.910
Again Pclump is a pattern that
is going to not just take one

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:38.050
at a time, but take clumps at
a time and play them as chords.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:41.890
And how many it takes at
a time is this argument.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.062
And Pwhite is white noise.

00:48:44.062 --> 00:48:45.520
It's just a random
number generator

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.690
between one and three.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.830
So I'm saying spin out this list
of all of my notes in a circle

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:55.460
forever and grab either one
or two or three at a time.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.950
And so it's a random mix
of chords and single notes.

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.950
Yeah, thanks.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:01.450
Thank you.

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:04.500
[APPLAUSE]
