00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.880
 
when I was in secondary school I was

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
when I was in secondary school I was
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.270
when I was in secondary school I was
actually interested very much in

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280
actually interested very much in
 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.820
actually interested very much in
literature but I was also very much

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
literature but I was also very much
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.709
literature but I was also very much
interested in mathematics and my teacher

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719
interested in mathematics and my teacher
 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.320
interested in mathematics and my teacher
mathematics I liked him very much

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330
mathematics I liked him very much
 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.060
mathematics I liked him very much
I think it's about the only one I liked

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
I think it's about the only one I liked
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.759
I think it's about the only one I liked
and I was at the secondary school but

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769
 
 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.839
 
and so I had a very good relation with

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
and so I had a very good relation with
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.830
and so I had a very good relation with
him and I was not a bad student so he

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840
him and I was not a bad student so he
 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.020
him and I was not a bad student so he
pushed me to enter Polytechnic school

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
pushed me to enter Polytechnic school
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.950
pushed me to enter Polytechnic school
for engineering well this was because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
for engineering well this was because
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.430
for engineering well this was because
also partly because engineering in

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440
also partly because engineering in
 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.069
also partly because engineering in
Belgium requires an entrance examination

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079
Belgium requires an entrance examination
 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.319
Belgium requires an entrance examination
which is very hard actually three places

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
which is very hard actually three places
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.540
which is very hard actually three places
if you wish the diploma of secondary

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
if you wish the diploma of secondary
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760
if you wish the diploma of secondary
school you don't have to do secondary

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
school you don't have to do secondary
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.830
school you don't have to do secondary
school if you succeed at exam so and so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
school if you succeed at exam so and so
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.030
school if you succeed at exam so and so
he prepared me for that exam that they

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040
he prepared me for that exam that they
 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280
he prepared me for that exam that they
did so I was an engineer now being an

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
did so I was an engineer now being an
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.620
did so I was an engineer now being an
engineer I realized that I don't want to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
engineer I realized that I don't want to
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.640
engineer I realized that I don't want to
be an engineer and but I was an engineer

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
be an engineer and but I was an engineer
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.070
be an engineer and but I was an engineer
so that gave me I realized by being a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
so that gave me I realized by being a
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.690
so that gave me I realized by being a
union that that what interests me is not

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
union that that what interests me is not
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.819
union that that what interests me is not
so much the application of things but

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
so much the application of things but
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.370
so much the application of things but
the way the function so that's why I got

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
the way the function so that's why I got
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230
the way the function so that's why I got
interested in physics in this version

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
interested in physics in this version
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.160
interested in physics in this version
from the manga physics so after having

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
from the manga physics so after having
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.539
from the manga physics so after having
engineer I got sufficient money because

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
engineer I got sufficient money because
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.600
engineer I got sufficient money because
I could I had a job at the University

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
I could I had a job at the University
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.910
I could I had a job at the University
and I studied physics afterwards and

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
and I studied physics afterwards and
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.389
and I studied physics afterwards and
then my PhD and then went to the United

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
then my PhD and then went to the United
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.600
then my PhD and then went to the United
States and met horbet part

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
 
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.780
 
and so that's in a short and this story
