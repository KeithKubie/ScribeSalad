00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:04.870
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.005
- [Moshe] Hey, this
is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.406
- [Natasha] And Natasha Laggero.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.208
- [Moshe] We just got
married six months ago.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.876 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Natash] Which we think
pretty much makes us

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:13.112
qualified to give love
advice to strangers.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.580
- [Moshe] So that's what we did.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.783
We packed up the car, hit the
road, and spread the love.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.721
- [Natasha &amp; Moshe] This
is The Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.562
- Okay, ma'am what's your name?

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.630 line:0%
- Megan.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.797 line:0%
- Megan, and?

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.032 line:0%
- Zach.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.602 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Megan and Zach,
the whitest possible.

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:36.802
(audience laughing)

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.071
Love it.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.239
- [Natasha] And are
you guys married?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.773
- We are, 16 years.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:41.708
- 16 years?

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.978 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We've only been
married for ten years.

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:48.481
- Oh, wow, she only got
it wrong by six years.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:51.751
- [Moshe] We got a couple of
video e-mails, or requests,

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:54.553
for people that needed love
advice to reach out to us.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:57.656 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This says "love
advice, drunk advise."

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:01.894 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And it's from someone
who's handle is SteelerGirl.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:02.795
I think that means like...

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:03.629
- Pittsburgh Steelers

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.463
(Natasha laughing)

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.765
- Pittsburgh Steelers.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.666
Already a bad sign.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.101
- That's not a good sign.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.069 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Any advise on how to
keep my husband from peeing

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.339
on everything when he's
drunk and sleepwalking?

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:16.175
He swears he's just
being a "good boy."

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.611
How? Like in what
world would that--

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.781
- I'm a good boy... oh like how
a dog is a good boy I guess?

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.615
- How 'bout I just
give her the URL to

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.684
Alcoholics Anonymous' website?

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:27.119
(Natasha laughing)

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.690
I'm literally gonna do
that. Can I do that?

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:32.592
www.AA.org

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:40.499
- Megan, do you have
any problem with Zach?

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.803
- Yeah, a pet peeve
of yours about Zach?

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.106
- Well, a recent
fight we just had

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.975
- Ooh, do tell

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.143
(audience cheering)

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:53.045
- "Thank you, good
night," says Zach.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:58.050
- He told me I had a little
surprise coming in the mail.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.619
- Okay...

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.287
- Hitachi Magic Wand.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.022
(audience laughing)

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:05.291 align:start size:81% position:19%
- He bought me
that fuckin' wand.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.159
- Wait, for real?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.963
(audience laughing)

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.664
That's... wow...

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.166
Oh you want to know what I
don't like about my husband?

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.501
I guess I would say he bought me

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.804
the best sex toy on the market.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.138
(audience laughing)

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:21.307
- Megan, why were you mad?

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:26.012
- That wasn't something
that I wanted as a gift.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.513
I wasn't happy about it.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:28.681
- It felt presumptuous, is
that what you're saying?

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.217 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It did, it did. I
was a little irritated.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.153 align:start position:0%
It's huge, it's like a monster,
I mean, I don't want it.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.022
- Oh you got the Moshe Kasher?

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:37.256
(audience laughing)

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:38.524
- Let's see if we
have another one.

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I like this person,
very exotic name, Noful.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:45.431
Noful: "Me and my girl are
definitely in need of love."

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.565
Not advice, just love.

00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.833
(Natasha laughing)

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.269
Noful, that's not your girl.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.172
"She lives in LA, and
I live in 29 Palms.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:54.873
I haven't seen her since March."

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:57.510
March, April, May,
June, that sucks.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.244
"Make my dream come true."

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.247 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Oh, he thinks we're
gonna write him a check.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.382
- Also, what kind of
check you need to write

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.552
to get someone from
La Habra to 29 Palms?

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.454
It's like a two hour drive.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.189
- He needs 35 dollars.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.260
- Make my dreams come true
of a quarter-tank of gas.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.461
- I was so pissed at him,

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.729 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't talk to
him for like a week.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.230
- Why?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.266 align:start position:0% line:0%
- [Audience Member] Because
she was too busy getting it on!

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.269 line:0%
(audience laughing)

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:31.578 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That is probably exactly...
Oh we are done here.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:35.414
No, I am pissed, I'll
talk to you later.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.649 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wait, Zach, I'm
curious, was that like

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:41.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
you were like, oh
this is something I
know she's gonna like?

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.955
Or, this is a sign?

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:45.724
Or this is a message
I want her to receive?

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
What was your instinct
with that present?

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.095
- I thought she might like it.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.131
It's the best sex
toy on the market.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.332
- He researched it.

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:56.335 align:start size:84% position:16%
He said it's like
the best vibrator for

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.672 align:start size:84% position:16%
ya know, women after
they have kids.

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.974
- Okay, I think I maybe...

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:03.910
I think I might have
found the problem.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.845
(audience laughing)

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.915
You might be bad at dirty talk.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.118
(audience laughing)

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:13.686
- What do you mean,

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:16.822
"make your...

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:17.657
dreams...

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:19.792
Come...

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:22.194
true?"

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:24.296
- Do you need some gas money?

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.799
And say "Lovingly, Motasha."

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:27.834
- Lovingly...

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.004
Mo-...

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:32.839
tasha.

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:35.974
- Here's what I think.

00:04:35.974 --> 00:04:39.679
You need to incorporate
the sex toy together.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:42.648
Cause I remember one time...

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.651 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well I don't want to
say this, it's personal.

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:46.319
- What is it?

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.486
Oh yeah, that's fucked up.

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.687
- It's too personal, yeah.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.623
- Okay, right, right,
we owe it to them.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.491
- Well, for example if
you're dating someone

00:04:52.491 --> 00:04:55.795
who watches a lot of
porn, you could like...

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.997
(audience laughing)

00:04:57.997 --> 00:05:01.033
- No, you're right,
it's too personal.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.569
- You could watch
the porn with them,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.505 align:start position:0%
and then incorporate, like turn
that into sex or something.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:09.509
- Right, Natasha didn't
even know what a BBW was.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.544
(audience laughing)

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.480
- But, you know, like, why
don't you not take it as like

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.183
oh, this is something I'm
supposed to do on my own,

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:20.186 align:start size:94% position:6%
and this is something
that you guys do together?

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:21.354
- Yeah...

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:23.823 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, so Megan
could be open to that.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.559
Could you do that
tonight, Megan?

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.664
(audience cheering)

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:34.233
- Should we wrap it up?

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.200
- Okay, let's give it
up for Megan and Zach!

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.203
- Give it up for Megan and Zach!

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:39.272 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I dated a guy once
that peed the bed

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.340
from being drunk,
and it was not fun.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.408
- I dated a girl once
when we would have sex,

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:45.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
she would start
screaming, and then

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.847
all of the sudden, like
she would pee a lot.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like every time she
would be like "Oh my god,

00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:55.254
oh my god, oh my god," and
then she would pee a lot.

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:58.557 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You mean she would
have a... she would come?

00:05:58.557 --> 00:06:00.860
- Oh is that what that was?
