00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
Every now and then the sun explodes

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:12.359
Without, warning blazing hot plasma spews into the solar, system with the force of about 20 million nuclear bombs

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.670
Depending on the direction of the explosion that plasma can, head straight for earth

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.549
These eruptions are called coronal, mass ejections or cmes and they happen when the sun's surface gets a little twisted

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.899
The sun is basically a giant ball of gas that's constantly dancing

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.380
When the sun gets a little too excited it twists its magnetic field too far which causes it to kink

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.360
Remember, when phones at cords and they get all tangled when you walk, and talk it's kind of like that

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.340
Eventually the tension builds and the kink snaps and the plasma explodes into a terrifying cloud of protons and electrons

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.410
Solar wind then takes the cloud of piping hot particles on a ride through the solar system

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.169
The plasma can travel at speeds up to seven million, miles per hour and if the cme

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.460
Is aimed at earth it could take as little as 12 hours to slam into our planets

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.159
lakes

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.629
Last time this happened, was in 1859 and the impact triggered a geomagnetic storm in our magnetosphere and

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.889
If that were to happen, today the storm could frier power grid

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.479
Leaving us all in the dark, so the next time the sun decides to explode

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.500
Let's just hope it's not aimed at us

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.220
You can catch new, episodes of spacecrafts every wednesday and you can watch a, more seeker here and learn about

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.769
Nasa's plan to launch a, solar probe that will travel

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.869
Closer to the sun than any spacecraft before it thanks for watching, make sure to subscribe
