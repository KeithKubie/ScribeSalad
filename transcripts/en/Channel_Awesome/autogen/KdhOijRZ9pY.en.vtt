00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
(Jingling Bells as Piano version of "We Wish You A Merry Christmas" plays)

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:20.680
Ho Ho Ho boys &amp; girls! I'm Santa Christ and MERRY Christmas to you all! Ho ho ho!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.680
It certainly is the most wonderful time of the year! Ho ho ho!

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.740
But did you know there was a Christmas that almost wasn't?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:42.060
Well this has nothing to do with that story! This is the story about a little boy named the "Nostalgia Critic" and how he was having a not so Jolly Christmas!

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.720
I'VE HAD IT! I'VE REALLY HAD IT! I MEAN IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME AND I'M NOT GIVEN ONE GOOD THING TO REVIEW!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.820
I MEAN WHAT IS THIS?! "A CHARLIE BROWN KWANZAA?!" FUCK THAT SHIT! NO! I'M DONE! I AM TOTALLY DONE WITH THIS GIG!

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.020
I AM NEVER DOING NOSTALGIA CRITIC AGAIN! FUCK THIS SHIT MAN! FUCK THIS SHIT!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.560
But Critic, you can't just leave!

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.180
Hey, I can do whatever I want!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.740
But who's gonna run the show?

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.980
Hey, I'll tell you what. You're so concerned, YOU run the show!

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.140
Okay!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:30.520
(Heavenly Music plays)

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.480
Hello Critic! I am your Guardian An... (THWACK)!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.000
(Thud)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.600
Had enough Jehovah's Witnesses today!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.460
Uh yes, I was wondering if I could make a listing in your want ads?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.440
Uh yes, I want it to read "Available: One cynical, pompous internet celebrity ready to criticize for a boatload of cash."

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.840
Oh yes, I'm sure that'll get plenty of responses!

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.240
Alright, thank you so much, Bye!

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.960
Excuse me perhaps you didn't hear me, I am your Guardian An... (CRUNCH)

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.420
Yeah, I was wondering if there were any responses yet on that want ad.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.940
No, Okay I'll try again later! Bye! (WRENCH) (Roger Yelps in pain and falls)

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.000
Hmm, Maybe I should wait a minute.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.880
Oh my, but you are a protective one! But in all seriousness though, I am your Guardian Angel!

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320
You still here? I gotta say guy, you got balls!

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.100
Well I used to! But this isn't about me! This is about making you realize how truly important you are to the world!

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.580
What're you talking about?

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.140
I come from on high to show you the love and affection that this world has to offer.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.460
And whether you realize it,  you played a big part in keeping that love going.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.460
Who did you say you were again?

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.500
My name is Roger and I am your Guardian Angel.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.620
Nostalgia Critic: My Guardian Angel?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.360
Roger: YES! HEARD ME THAT TIME!

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.160
Nostalgia Critic: Well If you're a Guardian Angel, Where's your wings?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.980
(Mockingly)"Well, if you're a Guardian Angel, where's your wings?"

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.160
Yes, never heard that one before. "What I don't have any wings?" I NEVER NOTICED! YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S THE FIRST QUESTION ANYBODY ASKS ME!

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.660
Sorry, sorry, I just get that question a lot.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.380
No, I'm an "Angel in Training" and once I prove myself worthy then I get my wings.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.580
Well okay. Why the hell are you with me then?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.200
To show you what this world would be like if there was no "Nostalgia Critic".

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.160
Aw C'mon, it wouldn't be that different.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.640
Oh, But you're wrong! You make a difference in so many people's lives!

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.600
If you just let me show you.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.200
Oh I can't. I'm coming down with something. (Coughs)

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.800
It's very contagious, you could die at any minute.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.940
Critic! I can show you just what an impact you make.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.900
(Sighs)

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.080
Alright, but this better be worth it!

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.320
Grab onto my robe!

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.060
(Heavenly music plays)

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.560
(POP)

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.900
(POP)

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.880
Where are we?

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.580
In a world where you never existed!

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.480
You mean I was never born?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.400
Yes.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.360
The world is a far different place.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.000
Take a look at your beloved Cinema Snob for example.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.080
(Electric Drilldriver Whirs)

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.920
He's a plumber?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.300
Well without you being there to inspire him, he never made the transition into Internet reviews.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.640
This is the life he leads.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.000
Oh, Gee I guess that is pretty tough-

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.260
Okay, we're ready for ya!

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.860
Alright, now you remember your lines?

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.960
"You're a plumber, You're going to fix a woman's sink".

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.740
Sir, Sir, I've done this a hundred times. I can do it blindfolded!

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.860
Alright, well here's the woman you'll be working with, Jillian.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.300
OH MY GOD! I can't believe I'm about to do a scene with the world's greatest porn star!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.420
You are an inspiration to me, sir!

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.040
THIS is the terrible life he leads?!

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.860
All you need is a penis the size of a lightsaber...

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.780
And the rest is done for you.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.720
I just orgasmed at the sound of your voice!

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.960
It's to be expected!

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.780
Well, okay maybe that wasn't a good example.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.340
Why don't I take you to another place?

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.680
Wait, wait, I want to see this!

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.320
ACTION!

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.980
(Zipper unzips)

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.900
(THUD!)

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.400
OH MY GOD THAT'S NOT HUMAN!

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.120
HOW DOES HE FIT THAT INTO HIS PANTS?!

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.920
Alright, Let's go! Let's go!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.740
(Various sounds)

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.240
(POP)

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.040
(POP)

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.240
Where are we now? Some kind of bar?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.860
Yes.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.500
And I believe one of your friends is sitting there in the shadows.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.920
LINKARA?!

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.500
Yes, Doesn't look too happy does he?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.340
Obviously he's hit on some hard times and has driven himself to drink his problems away.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.720
Aw sheesh, poor guy!

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.980
I just don't get it! I...Just...Don't...Get...It!

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.340
Oh Linkara, I'm so sorr...

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.960
WHO SAID THAT THEY COULD MAKE  "IRON MAN VS BATMAN 3" WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?!

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.220
DON'T THEY KNOW THAT I'M THE PRESIDENT OF BOTH MARVEL &amp; DC COMICS?!?

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.040
HE OWNS MARVEL AND DC COMICS?!?!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.080
Look, I had to drag myself into a bar because of the snowstorm outside AND this is the news you give me?!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.560
YOU TELL ROBERT DOWNEY JR. THAT HE HAS TO BE PATIENT!

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.360
UNTIL I GET A SCRIPT THAT I THINK IS A FAITHFUL REPRESENTATION,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.200
IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.800
Will there be anything else for you sir?

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.440
Nah, that should be everything. But here have an extra hundred for your troubles.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.120
Thank you sir. Gosh, there's a gaggle of hookers with your name on it!

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.500
By God he's doing a million times better than me. HE OWNS TWO COMIC COMPANIES!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.560
Now let's not jump to conclusions!

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.920
Hot damn, it's good owning two comic companies!

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.640
YOU SEE!?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.980
Alright, alright so two people are doing better if you were never around.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.100
But what about the Nostalgia Chick?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.500
Hey that's a good point! If I never existed there wouldn't have been a spin-off character!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.960
Yeah! Yeah! Let's see how the Nostalgia Chick is doing!

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.980
(POP)

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.360

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.860
(POP)

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:03.320
Ah-ha! Ah-ha! You hear that? You hear that? I bet The Nostalgia Chick is a single mother living in this crappy apartment. So that means she could never complete her dream of becoming a famous movie director!

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.140
(Rock-A-Bye Baby plays in the background)

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.640
Darling, thank you so much for looking after our little girl!

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.320
Hey, what are stay-at-home dads for?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.660
It's just a shame that you have to stay in this apartment building.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:21.720
Yeah it was a shame that the million dollar condos had to get the reservation wrong. But it was kind of you to buy the entire apartment complex!

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.160
Well, I just wanted to make sure you two were comfortable. Now It is time for me to complete my greatest challenge yet!

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.400
"Twilight: The Good Version."

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.560
I can't believe you entitled it that.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.200
Well If I'm directing it, that makes it true by default, doesn't it?

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.380
All of America knows that makes it true!

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.680
Hey Lindsay, so um, based on the watch I don't have uh, we've got to leave now if we're going to make it to the set on time.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.280
Oh Nella, You're the best producer ever!

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.120
Well, I wouldn't have been that way if it weren't for you.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.320
You know I'm just so glad we have this friendship based upon mutual respect and dignity.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.500
I Know! Let's go!

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.060
(Quietly): Go team!

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.540
NEXT!

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.420
(POP!)

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.020
(POP!)

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.880
Now where are we because lord knows those last three didn't blow me over!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.900
We are the residence of the one you call Angry Joe!

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.800
Angry Joe, Well good, that little pipsqueak wouldn't be anywhere if it wasn't for me!

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.900
No! No! Absolutely not! No! No!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:28.180
No I'm through dicking around here Canada! You get rid of that sloppy little province of Quebec or I'm gonna get rid of it for you! You understand?!

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.140
You see, the American people, they didn't elect me to be some kind of a Pushover!

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.540
HE'S THE FUCKING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?!!?!?

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.400
What's that?

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.140
Oh you think it would be manslaughter?

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.280
Well I think it'd be the greatest thing to happen to Canada...

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.440
SINCE I PUBLICLY EXECUTED TOM GREEN!

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.960
(Explosion)

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.760
(Maniacal laughter)

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:05.460
Yes, Press Secretary. Yes, let the good people of the world know that they no longer have to fear the tyrannical rule of the once evil empire of Canada!

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:17.120
(Canned Applause)

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.820
Vote For Joe! (Chuckles) Vote For Joe!

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.960
(POP)

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.000
(POP)

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.880
Well, this next one will show you...

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.980
NO! FORGET IT! I'M DONE! THIS TRIP HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE!

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.500
NOBODY IS BETTER WITH ME! THEY'RE ALL BETTER WITHOUT ME!

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.340
But surely you can see one more!

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.420
Forget It! THIS IS THE MOST UNINSPIRING ASS SHIT I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.980
You really, REALLY SUCK AT THIS!

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.500
Oh, Come on! Things can't possibly be as bad as Joe being the President Of The United States!

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.340
(Sighs)

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:47.960
Suppose you're right, I mean it can't get any worse!

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.600
(POP)

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.340
(POP)

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.300
Must've made a mistake. This is where I film everything!

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:02.700
Yeah, that's weird. We're supposed to see Spoony's life, I don't quite understa...

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.620
HELLO, I'm the Nostalgia Critic and I remember it so you don't have to!

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.080
(SCREAM)

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.560
Today we're gonna look at "Last Action Hero".

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.500
As we all know, Schwarzenegger can do no wrong!

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.900
YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.680
And I found this to be an absolutely delightful movie!

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:19.460
(Quietly): WHAT?!

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.020
It's a clever send-up to all those action clichés we all know and love!

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.100
THAT FILM WAS CLUMSY &amp; UNNECESSARY!

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.940
It's a wonderful thrill ride from beginning to end and I enjoyed every minute of it!

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.460
(Static)

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.040
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.960
AH HA! AH HA! Let's see him deal with one of those pesky internet trolls!

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.860
Oh hey Douchey! What are you up to?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.240
Oh nothing, I just wanted to say what a fantastic job you're doing. (Sniff)

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.040
You're an inspiration to the Internet and...

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.800
Gosh darn it! A treasure to us all!

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.820
Why thank you Douchey, I always look forward to your calls!

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.460
Oh by the way, are you still doing that crossover review with Phelous?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.740
I was going to but Canada seems to have disappeared off the map. So I'm gonna have to get back to you on that one!

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.180
Okay, no rush. Take care my friend!

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.920
So long Douchey! What a charming young lad!

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.620
(Sniffs)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.040
Beautiful man!

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.880
And you know, I didn't think "Junior" was that bad, I mean Schwarzenegger pregnant that was kind of funny!

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.900
(Laughing Uncontrollably)

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.700
I'll kill you! You JOB STEALING HORSE ANUS!

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:22.400
(Gunfire and insane laughter)

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.260
Can't hurt him Critic, he can't even see us!

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.080
GRRR! Just get me out of here!

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.040
(Insane Laughter)

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.620
(POP)

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.520
(POP)

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.980
My god! My God! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD! MY GOD!

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.720
You see Critic, You really were a rotten, dirty bastard!

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.560
And all the people you came in contact with, would've led a better life if you had never met them at all!

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.440
Is this the pep talk?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.160
'Cause let me tell you, it's not helping!

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.120
Pep talks are supposed to make you feel peppy!

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.680
NOT WANNA TAKE A SHOWER WITH A FUCKING TOASTER!

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.580
I..I'm sorry it's just-!

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.860
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE!

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.220
I mean somebody always misses the person whenever I do this!

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.640
I MEAN SOMEBODY!

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:09.220
STATISICALLY THIS DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE!

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.160
What about you?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.500
What?

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.560
Yeah, yeah what about you Roger? If I never existed maybe your life would've been totally screwed up!

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.940
You know I never thought of that!

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.160
Take a look at my life...

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.220
And see what it would've been without you!

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.800
It's not a bad idea!

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:29.020
Alright then!

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.540
Let's take a look and see what my life would've been like...

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.940
Without the Nostalgia Critic!

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.440
Yeah!

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.120
(POP)

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:36.380
(POP)

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.220
Yes God, According to my calculations we should have world peace in... About two weeks!

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.240
GOOD JOB ROGER! GOOD JOB!

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.820
I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD HAVE DONE ALL THIS WITHOUT YOU!

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.580
YOU ARE MY NUMBER ONE ANGEL!

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.980
Oh Come on God! I'm blushing!

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:58.140
NO, I AM SERIOUS! IF ANYTHING WAS TO EVER HAPPEN TO ME OR IF I WAS EVER TO RETIRE. YOU WOULD BE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE JOB!

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.500
Oh God, You know how to make an angel feel needed!

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.900
Send my best to your son!

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.120
I WILL! TAKE CARE BUDDY!

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.060
You too!

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.660
LATER!

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.220
Later!

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.600
(Chuckles) I LOVE THAT GUY! (Chuckles)

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:13.200
(POP)

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.600
(POP)

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:27.300
(Under his breath): I was his number one guy! No one has ever been his number one guy! But I was his number one guy! And he called me his buddy!

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.220
Hey!

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.880
You... got a good thing going on now don't you?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:44.160
I mean what with the white robe and the ponytail holder? (PHEW) Got it made!

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.680
What did you say you were sick with again?

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.960
Oh, something contagious I'm sure!

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.880
Life threatening, no doubt?

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.060
Oh uh no no, I'm actually feeling a lot better! I just seem to have this horrible sneeze!

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.640
HELP POLICE! HELP POLICE!

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.700
(Chuckling evilly)

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.720
If you go... ALL WILL BE AT PEACE!

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.540
Wait a minute!

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.660
What am I afraid of you for?

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.620
You're just a two bit angel without any wings!

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.880
What are you gonna do to me?

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.920
(Crunch!) (Yelp!)

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.260
(Kiaing)

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.720

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.540
(Multiple thwacks to the body!)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:40.920
Ugh!

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.300
Ugh!

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.060

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.180

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.420

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.700
Fair trade!

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.080
(Growls)

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.760
Alright Tae-Kwon-Dick! That's far enough!

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.620
Huh! What? You think you can kill an angel?

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.240
I heard from God himself!

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.420
NOBODY CAN KILL AN ANGEL!

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.380
Well, it's worth a shot!

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.940
Hmm, Go ahead!

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.440
Shoot Me!

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.000
(BANG)

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.800
Hmm, So God lied to me!

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.080
Well that seems like a dick move!

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.360
(Thud)

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:44.220
My God!

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.240
I never realized just how many lives I've made miserable!

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.620
But there is ONE life that I can safely say I made better...

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.780
MINE!

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:04.120
And that's why Mary Poppins had an abortion! And later she became a revolutionary!

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.900
WOW! That's really interesting, Giggles.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.220

HO! HO! HO! So as you see boys and girls the moral of the story is...

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:50.420
And that's why Mary Poppins had an abortion...
