00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.590
We'll start our specification
exercise in using English.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.250
I'd like you to provide
an English language description

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.240
of the expected behavior
of y equals the sort of x.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.230
Where x is an input sequence of integers
and y is an output sequence of integers.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.090
And assuming that you're
sorting in ascending order.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.410
So think how you would say
this in precise English.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.288
So, given a input vector x of integers,
we will return to y and

00:00:28.288 --> 00:00:33.930
output vector of integers in which for
each element that is an x,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.210
the element that comes after it
will be greater than that element.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.930
&gt;&gt; You mean and why, the outcome?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.850
&gt;&gt; And why, yes, yes.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.540
So, once it's sorted, each element and
why, of the element that comes

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.350
after it will be greater than it,
except for the last element.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.990
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, say the input had
some duplicates, is it greater than, or

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.750
greater than or equal?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.130
&gt;&gt; Okay so it could be greater than or
equal to if we have duplicates.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, and
what do we do about the last one?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.730
&gt;&gt; The last one will not have
a element to come after it.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.180
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So it will be the greatest element

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.750
and the, the output vector.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.000
&gt;&gt; Or
possibly equal to the one before it?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.555
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:15.055
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:01:15.055 --> 00:01:16.985
So there's a lot going on in,

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:20.520
in trying to express that
in a precise fashion.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.270
Let's see what we can,
what we can do about it.
