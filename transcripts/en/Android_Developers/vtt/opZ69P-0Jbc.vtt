00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.020
&gt;&gt; Android 2.0 provides new APIs and technologies
for developers. This platform release includes

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.059
new capabilities in Accounts Management, Contacts,
and Sync. There is now an Account Manager

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.169
API that enables a developer to store centrally
account credential info on the device. The

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:26.909
Contacts Application support syncing and aggregating
contacts data from multiple accounts. And

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:33.469
the Sync Adapters API provides full two-way
contact sync to any backend. Quick Contact

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.460
provides users a fast, easy way to communicate
with others. Selecting the picture frame shows

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.640
all communicating methods available. In selecting
an icon, here, Gmail, lets users start communicating

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.890
right away, but this feature is available
in not just contacts. Note how it’s here

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.839
in the messaging application. The Quick Contacts
API lets developers build this feature into

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.869
any App. Android 2.0 includes the Bluetooth
API that lets Apps turn on and devises Bluetooth

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.189
discover and connect to nearby devices and
send and receive data. Here is a demo game

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:18.159
that takes advantage of the API’s capabilities.
The Bluetooth API now enables Apps to integrate

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:24.380
easily features such as peer-to-peer communication
and proximity-based social interactions. The

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.130
platform began supporting devices with different
screen sizes starting with Android 1.6. In

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.360
this example, the place is Directory App renders
correctly on three different screens with

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.700
a single version of the application. Using
the Android UI toolkit, developers can easily

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.680
build a single binary to support devices with
various screen sizes and resolutions. To learn
