[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.190
REAZUL AHSAN: I am
Dr. Reazul Ahsan,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.740
a visiting scholar of MIT UTM
Malaysian sustainable city

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.680
program.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.320
I am presenting two stories
of development induced

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.040
displacement in Malaysia.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.250
One follows up with communities
affected by a hydroelectric dam

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.420
in East Malaysia.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.860
The other addresses an ongoing
housing development project

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.900
on the southern tip
of peninsula Malaysia.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.570
Malaysia is one of the world's
fastest developing nations.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.770
Under its own militia program,
the government [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.780
be a developed country by 2025.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.410
Accordingly, federal
and state governments

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.900
are intensively investing in
infrastructure development,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.650
especially in housing, energy,
and manufacturing sectors.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.450
However, many national
infrastructure development

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.080
programs fail to
consider indigenous

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.070
poor and marginalized
communities, who

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.900
have very limited voice in
planning these mega projects.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.340
From 1980 to 1990,
almost 10 million people

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.970
were displaced in South Asia
due to development projects,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.900
like hydroelectric dams.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.670
The process known as
development induced displacement

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.560
remains a global challenge
for socially sustainable

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020
development planning.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.870
Sarawak, one of two
Malaysian estates

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.530
on the island of Borneo,
is a real example

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.050
of development
induced displacement

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.060
due to hydroelectric dams.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.770
Sarawak is home to
2.37 million people,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.860
and its 27 indigenous
ethnic communities

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.700
speak 45 different languages.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.390
In Malaya, these indigenous
groups are known as Orang Asli.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.050
Beginning IN the year 1994,
the Sarawak's government

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.710
initiated the second largest
hydroelectric dam in Asia.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.620
In the name of region
wide economic development,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.230
the dam inundated
1,700 hectares of land

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.360
in the interior zone
of Bakun, and displaced

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.460
more than 10,000 Orang Asli
from their home and their land.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.030
To learn more about those
displaced communities,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.900
I journeyed to Bakun.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.220
These displaced
indigenous communities

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.010
have been relocated
next to the Bintulu City

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.180
on land allocated by the
government, which is now

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.470
known as Village [INAUDIBLE]
Before the resettlement,

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.480
indigenous communities
harvested their everyday needs

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.070
from river and forest in Bakun.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.050
But this new location
is far from their source

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.400
of livelihood.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.900
Every week many
displaced villagers

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.490
make a long journey
to Bakun to fish

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.850
and get their food
from the forest.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.960
Their government appointed
village leader, Mr. [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.140
said, that it was a
completely new life for them

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.670
after displacement.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.850
To him, the new home was a
jungle far away from the river

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.000
essential to their livelihood.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.870
SPEAKER: It's very
totally new to our people.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.370
It's totally new.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.530
Because they are used
to the way of life.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.820
They're used to the
way of-- how they

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.350
do living in the old place.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.880
So when we moved
to this new place,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.520
so can see that all the
area here is jungle.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.270
REAZUL AHSAN: As a
part of the relocation,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.010
they also claimed compensation
from the government.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.610
SPEAKER: There is Bakun
Development Committee, BDC.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.693
So we have a thick book that
we pass to the government

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:39.860
so that they can study about
our land, how much do they

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.020
compensate for
land, and how much

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.510
do they compensate for
the garden, rubber, paper,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.150
and so on.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.530
And what about our house?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.330
And how are you going
to compensate the house?

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.070
REAZUL AHSAN: However,
the compensation

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.500
wasn't enough to start fresh
in their resettlement location.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.960
SPEAKER: It's [INAUDIBLE]
for this, because they

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.870
are using the government rate.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.810
REAZUL AHSAN: I helped
team group discussions

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.950
with men and women in
the indigenous community

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.780
to understand the
challenges they

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.380
faced since their relocation.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.990
[INAUDIBLE] interviews
say the greatest challenge

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.649
at the relocation site
was, insufficient access

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.050
to land to sustain them.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.830
At least one member
of every family

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.210
travels back to the dam areas
for the daily intake needs,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.400
two hours there from
the new location.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.210
This travel is costly, and also
raises their daily living cost.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.250
To compensate, some have
started living semi-permanently

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.110
in the dam area, collecting
food under compromised living

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.270
condition, while their families
remain in the new settlement

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.270
areas.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.330
[INAUDIBLE] is one of
the indigenous people who

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.050
moved to the dam area to
minimize her family's living

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.630
costs, and harvest the
food from the rivers.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.550
SPEAKER: Half an hour
from here to their house.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.410
REAZUL AHSAN: Back in
the settlement area,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.810
some elders feel
isolated and have

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.940
no bond with the community
since becoming displaced.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.400
[INAUDIBLE] Is one of them.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:06:06.070
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.390
REAZUL AHSAN: After being
displaced for 16 years,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.710
the villagers now settle
into normal daily routines,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.350
but they're still struggling to
subsist only on the new lands,

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.170
and improve condition
for the next generations.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.910
On the southernmost tip
of peninsula Malaysia,

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.260
and ongoing story of
development induced displacement

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.760
is unfolding.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.880
Iskander Malaysia, it is an
old development authority

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.950
in the state of Johor, is aiming
to house three million people

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.960
by 2025.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.160
One of the region's
largest new housing

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.080
projects Country
Garden in Danga Bay

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.010
is being built in a variety
of [INAUDIBLE] coastal areas

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.820
between two rivers.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.880
Within an aim to accommodate
about 9000 new residents,

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.150
Country Garden is
an eviction threat

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.180
for the indigenous people
living in Danga Bay area

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.150
for hundreds of years.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.690
The project pushed them to
the edge of the developing

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.000
boundary, and left no
other options for them

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.720
but to displace.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.840
Mr. [INAUDIBLE], director
of Iskander Malaysia,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.630
knows about the indigenous
history of Danga Bay.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.260
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] is also
where we have the fisherman

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:18.165
relation and we have the
indigenous group, which call

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:19.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.730
The British used
call them sea gypsy.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.670
REAZUL AHSAN: In the
questions of land right,

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.400
[INAUDIBLE] says.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.669
SPEAKER: It's not enough to
get [INAUDIBLE] So whether they

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.460
like it or not, it's
just a matter of time.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.990
This will have to relocated
to [INAUDIBLE] the area.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.460
REAZUL AHSAN: I asked him what
alternatives are available.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.950
SPEAKER: The land there itself,
is belong to third parties.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.420
So we only got two choice,
is that [INAUDIBLE] the area,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.360
or we have to relocate
them to other area.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.390
Is not that easy for us to
[INAUDIBLE] It's a growing

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.090
community, and maybe
for start, 100 ,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.690
150 families is sufficient
for to say there.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.310
But not as the community
grow double or triple,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.320
we still have the [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.820
We also need to be realistic.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.320
We're not talking about
50 years ago, [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.320
ago, where we have abundant
of land on seafront.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.850
REAZUL AHSAN: Indigenous
community leader [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.620
also says land right
and displacement

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.750
are longstanding issues.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:40.864
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:40.864 --> 00:08:43.280
REAZUL AHSAN: To his community,
the Country Garden project

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.830
was unexpected.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:56.330
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLSIH]

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.950
REAZUL AHSAN: They protested,
and reported the land

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.600
occupation to the police.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:21.775
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:23.910
REAZUL AHSAN: Mr.
[INAUDIBLE] a leader

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.280
among local fishermen,
also suffered

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.250
due to the reclamation process.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:54.570
SPEAKER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.410
REAZUL AHSAN: According to Dr.
Colin G. Nicholas, director

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.070
of Center for Orang Asli
Concern, in Malaysia,

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.460
resettlement or
relocation can never

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.621
be a solution for displaced
indigenous communities.

00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:07.162
COLIN NICHOLAS: This
first thing that

00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:08.890
happens in the resettlement
scheme is you break down

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:09.850
the social structure.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.210
Indigenous peoples are
not interested in land,

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.370
they are interested in
their traditional land

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.894
and their culture.

00:10:17.894 --> 00:10:19.810
REAZUL AHSAN: Across the
river from Danga Bay,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.900
Iskander Development Authority
has produced an ecotourism

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.210
development plan for
Kompang [? Sona ?]

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.422
Melayu, a village for
traditional Malay people,

00:10:29.422 --> 00:10:31.270
known as Bumiputras.

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.780
However, the authority has no
corresponding development plan

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.600
for the indigenous
village in Danga Bay.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.864
Incorporating this community
into Kompang [? Sona ?] Melayu

00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:43.570
plan, could prevent
its displacement,

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.800
and protect its indigenous
culture and tradition.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.770
The village currently operates
a Cultural Heritage Center,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.920
which villagers believe could
be a launchpad for a similarly

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.170
ecotourism development strategy.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.630
Recognizing the inevitability
of development and displacement,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.370
communities often
have generated ideas

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.320
about how to mitigate
the social impacts.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.450
Engaging in
participatory planning

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.620
with the indigenous
community could

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.850
sustain the land,
livelihood, and culture

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:18.411
for them, and for the
following generations.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:18.910
Thank you.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.260
