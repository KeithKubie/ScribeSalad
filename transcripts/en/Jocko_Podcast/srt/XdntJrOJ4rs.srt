1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,720
This is Jocko podcast number
three with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,450
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,610
So last show we dug into the book
about face by Colonel David Hackworth

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,140
and today we're gonna dive into aid.

5
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:28,141
Another book on that was very influential
to me and it's called the last hundred

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,363
yards.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,170
Now this book is very different from
about face in many ways. Number one,

8
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:40,220
it's,
it was not a New York Times bestseller.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,080
It was probably never on any
kind of list of any kind.

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,380
It's a legit tactical guidebook
for people in the military.

11
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,510
That's what it is.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,280
And I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the author right now.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,820
Guy named Hj Poole who retired from
the Marine Corps in 1993 when he was on

14
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,450
active duty. He studied small
unit tactics for nine years,

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,150
six months at the basic
school in quantum of Quantico,

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,030
seven months as a platoon
commander in Vietnam,

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,180
three months as a rifle company commander
at Camp Pendleton in 1967 five months

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,570
as a regimental headquarters company
commander in Vietnam in 1968 eight months

19
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,340
as a rifle company commander in Vietnam,

20
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,460
1968 to 1969 five and a half years as
an instructor with advanced infantry

21
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:39,660
training
down at Camp Camp Lajune.

22
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,070
While he was at that advanced infantry
training company, he developed,

23
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:48,120
taught refined courses of instruction
on maneuver warfare, land navigation,

24
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:51,000
fire support coordination,
call for fire, adjust fire,

25
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:55,050
close air support two oh three grenade
launcher movement to contact daylight

26
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:58,890
attack, night attack,
infiltration, defense offense,

27
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:02,280
Iv military operations in urban terrain,

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,650
defensive military
operations in urban terrain,

29
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,170
NBC defense and leadership.

30
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,510
So the guy has some good background and
this book was very influential to me

31
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,660
when I was coming up.
And again,

32
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:26,460
as I just like with about face as I was
thinking about what I was going to say

33
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:31,461
about it and I wanted to talk about when
I got it and I couldn't remember when I

34
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,511
got about face.

35
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:38,100
It just Kinda came into my life at some
point and it's the same thing with the

36
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,700
last hundred yards and I don't really
know 100% when I got it or who told me to

37
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:42,534
get it.

38
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,690
It's one of those things that just
became so ingrained with me that now I,

39
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,080
I didn't want to even
remember when it happened. So

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,960
one of the,
one of the key kind of components or,

41
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:02,961
or the basis of the book that I kind
of have to introduce you to is it,

42
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,730
it talks about something called maneuver
warfare and maneuver warfare is a,

43
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,650
is a obviously a type of warfare.
It's a type of technique and it's,

44
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,870
it's counter to something
that's called attrition warfare.

45
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,110
Now you could probably guess
what attrition warfare is.

46
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,230
Attrition warfare is we're
going to go against the enemy,

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,110
we're going to go stand toe to toe and
we're going to punch each other in the

48
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:30,820
face until one of us goes down.

49
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,820
Now when you add bombs and
bullets into that scenario,

50
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:36,850
it means we're going to stand across
from each other, from the enemy,

51
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,110
and we're going to shoot each other and
bomb each other until one of us breaks.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And that's very American way of fighting
is to start this attrition warfare

53
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:52,090
because why? We've got massive
supplies, we've got awesome industry,

54
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,310
and we can get away with that.

55
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,160
Maneuver warfare is,
is very different,

56
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,210
and to go into the book a little bit
in talking about maneuver warfare,

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,390
this is what maneuver warfare is.
In maneuver warfare,

58
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,370
the emphasis is on maneuver.

59
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,900
Firepower is considered important
only to the extent that it facilitates

60
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,734
maneuver.

61
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,330
The overall offensive mission is to
win decisively by getting the enemy to

62
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,164
surrender.

63
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,330
So it's very different
you in in that definition,

64
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,280
they're not even looking to
kill the person, the enemy,

65
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,400
they're looking to make them surrender
because it's in some ways easier.

66
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,530
If the enemy surrenders, you
don't have to kill them all. Now

67
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,140
to go on the focus is outward
on the enemy. Again, this is,

68
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,010
this is maneuver warfare.
The focus is outward on the enemy

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,100
and a few mistakes like outdistancing
ones logistical support or shooting in a

70
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:03,430
friendly unit are
acceptable and unavoidable.

71
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,090
So that's kind of crazy,
right? That you actually,

72
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,330
you take these risks in maneuver warfare
where you might engage friendly forces.

73
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:17,200
You might get so separated that
you end up in a bad situation,

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,450
but it's because you're pushing the pace.

75
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,130
Control is decentralized and every sub
unit or individual is encouraged to

76
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,920
display the initiative needed to react
successfully to the local threat.

77
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,510
And this is the biggest

78
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
distinguisher between attrition warfare
and the way it's run and maneuver

79
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,720
warfare.
Decentralized Command.

80
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,190
And that is a chapter in the book
extreme ownership that Leif and I wrote.

81
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,030
It's,

82
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,030
that's one of the laws of combat that we
talk about is decentralized command is

83
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:58,010
that everybody that's
out on the battlefield,

84
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:02,150
every individual unit leader can make
decisions on their own and they can make

85
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:02,781
something happen.

86
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,840
They can react and they can execute
without having to run it up the chain of

87
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,920
command. That's maneuver warfare
very, very different. And,

88
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,070
and you know these days where we
see the big difference, you know,

89
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,170
you see a big bureaucratic company,

90
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,910
you know now that we're
working with businesses,

91
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,980
we see a big bureaucratic company,

92
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,450
they become very centralized in their
control and they fight attrition warfare

93
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,600
against other companies because they're
bigger and they have more resources.

94
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,150
Whereas you see the young startups,
what are they doing?

95
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,930
They're doing maneuver warfare there.
They've got decentralized command,

96
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:34,280
they've got people taking chances,

97
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:38,300
they're taking risks and they've got
different leaders out there on the

98
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,890
battlefield that are trying
to make things happen.

99
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,170
The emphasis is on training personnel
and this is back to the book.

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,790
The emphasis is on training personnel,

101
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:51,470
well enough ahead of time that they
can follow their commander's intent in

102
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:56,330
combat after only receiving
broad guidance. Of course,

103
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,740
sub unit must still keep their commanders
informed of any actions that might

104
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:05,660
affect adjacent units.
So you end up with a situation where

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,870
the commander is not telling
you exactly what to do.

106
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,810
They giving you broad
guidance, hey, this is the,

107
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,000
this is the end state of the mission
that I want to have accomplished.

108
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,640
And they're not telling you
exactly how to accomplish it.

109
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,100
They're just telling you what they
want done. So that's, uh, that's,

110
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,220
that's a difference between the two.
Now

111
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,910
there's a piece that's
very different as well,

112
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,630
or
maybe not different,

113
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:43,631
but another key element of maneuver
warfare and decentralized command versus

114
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:50,740
attrition warfare and centralized
command. So if you don't, if,

115
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,760
if you're listening and you haven't
been in the military before,

116
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,360
the military is separated
into two groups of people,

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,970
officers ended listed people.

118
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,800
The officers are sort of
the senior leaders who are,

119
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,810
you know, strategic planners and they're,
they're, they're the broader, higher up,

120
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,220
higher ranking leaders.
And then the enlisted are the tacticians,

121
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,310
the folks that are shooting the
machine guns, throwing their grenades,

122
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,770
making things happen. And
they do have, you know, the,

123
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,800
the enlisted service men also have
their noncommissioned officers,

124
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,750
which are the senior
ranking enlisted guys,

125
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:31,751
which are usually the expert
tacticians but it's interesting.

126
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,640
So this is going back to the book
now in in the average platoon,

127
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,260
the NCO pose provide most of the
collective experience. So again,

128
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:46,310
you see this sometimes in the movies
where they get the young officer and

129
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,440
they're green and they don't
really know what's going on.

130
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,750
And then you get the salty old,
you know,

131
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,440
bad ass that's played by a
salty old, you know, uh, uh,

132
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,470
Clint Eastwood and easily that
older guy with all the experience.

133
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,580
And that's what that saying this,

134
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,080
the ncls provide most of the
collective experience. For this reason,

135
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,780
they should participate in
most of the tactical decisions.

136
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,430
That absolutely makes sense.

137
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,570
This should have no way challenged
the authority of the officer's. Okay,

138
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,190
that's that sensible.

139
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,660
After all commissioned and
noncommissioned officers share the same

140
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,340
responsibilities in combat.
If the lieutenant, which
is the officer is wounded,

141
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,180
the platoon sergeant takes over
when they both, this is key.

142
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,810
When they both work together,
better decisions, result,

143
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,360
obviously you've got two
mines and instead of one,

144
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,570
this brain trust can be further
enhanced by including squad leaders.

145
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,940
So they're, they're saying,
let's bring in more minds,

146
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:48,060
more of these junior enlisted guys.
Let's find out what they think.

147
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,880
The enduring satisfaction that
comes from making the situation,

148
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,190
the correct decision,

149
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,400
and then having that decision
fully supported during
execution far outweighs the

150
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:06,641
temporary insecurity that may come
from soliciting the advice of support

151
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,300
minutes. I love that quote. I love
that because I'm going to say it again.

152
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,040
So it's saying that the decision and the
execution doing that well far outweighs

153
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,720
the temporary insecurity that may
come from soliciting the advice of

154
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,280
subordinates.
So,

155
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,730
and I used to see this with
these young junior officers,

156
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,580
if they're insecure with their leadership,

157
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,450
they don't want to take advice and they
definitely don't want to ask for advice

158
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:35,420
because they feel like that makes them
look weak or they don't know what they're

159
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,220
talking about. They don't know
what they're talking about. Oh,

160
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,910
they're going to lose respect.

161
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,400
That's all their ego talking
and is their insecurity talking.

162
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,900
Whereas you get a young officer
that's smart and that's confident.

163
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,960
He has no problem looking at the gunnery
sergeant or looking at the platoon

164
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:54,740
chief and saying, hey chief, how do
you think we should do this? Hey chief,

165
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,140
I've never even seen this
type of operation before.

166
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,950
Can you give me some help or can let,
can you take lead on this?

167
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,790
And that is the way a
real leader operates.

168
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,250
You don't always see that, unfortunately.
Same thing with the mistakes too, right?

169
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:12,710
When you say, Oh man, I made
that mistake. Oh, exactly.

170
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:15,260
It's hard to do that a lot of
the time because they think, oh,

171
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:16,340
this guy doesn't know what he's doing.

172
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,130
Obviously made a mistake even
admitted it kind of thing. Yeah,

173
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,000
and w w what the reality is, people don't
actually think that. They don't think,

174
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,410
oh, he just admitted his mistake. He
really doesn't know what he's doing. No,

175
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:27,560
they go, okay, well at least
he's aware of his mistake.

176
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,530
Unless everything they do as a mistake,
then that's different.

177
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,600
But on the other hand,

178
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,030
it is courting disaster to rely on one's
personal impressions to provide the

179
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:42,380
solution to complex scenario and then not
consider whether one subordinates have

180
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:44,150
the skills to execute that solution.

181
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,660
So don't sit there
stuck in your own brain,

182
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,200
afraid to ask anybody else
or you're going to lose.

183
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,420
Now
as we push through this,

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,600
we can get pretty deep,
um,

185
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,070
to you is going back to the book again,

186
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,940
t to a US infantry men actively
engaged in a losing effort.

187
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,860
This shortage of rest reference material
can be quite unsettling. And what this,

188
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,060
what this is talking about previously
to this sentence is saying that although

189
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,310
there's all kinds of books
and manuals in the military,

190
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,610
this detailed reference material of
exactly how to do the front line,

191
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:33,330
what is that point man do?
What does that machine gun or do?

192
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,830
How do they actually do it?

193
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,720
That information can get lost cause it's
more past word of mouth than anything

194
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,554
else.

195
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,723
Okay?

196
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,390
And it goes into a talking about,
believe it or not, Hackworth,

197
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,490
with a combat commission from Korea,

198
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,750
Lieutenant Colonel David Hackworth was
no stranger to war. When he called,

199
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,600
when he was called to serve
in Vietnam after two tours,

200
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,430
he pointed out that the u s knowledge
on Small Unit infantry tactics had not

201
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,600
been significantly enhanced by the longest
war in us history, meaning Vietnam.

202
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,090
And here's what,
here's what Hackworth said,

203
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:12,190
almost 15 years since the tragic
inevitable fall of Saigon.

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,700
And this is so he's saying this 15
years after the end, the Vietnam war,

205
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,020
almost 15 years since the end, since
the tragic inevitable fall of Saigon,

206
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,130
there's been no major,
honest, postmortem of the war.

207
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,160
There have been critiqued
dealing with the big picture,

208
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,960
but none has addressed the lessons
learned the hard way at the fighting level

209
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,310
where people died and
the war was in fact lost.

210
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,850
So all those lessons learned in all those,

211
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:46,851
no one ever made an honest critique and
dug down onto the battlefield to see

212
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:50,490
what these guys could do. And I know
I talked about this last time as well,

213
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,770
is that when I first
got in the seal teams,

214
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,060
there was guys from Vietnam
and when those guys spoke,

215
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,230
you absolutely listened because
you were hearing knowledge,

216
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,660
knowledge and

217
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,843
that

218
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,410
if I didn't experience that, if I didn't
meet those guys, I will no one, you know,

219
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,390
I wouldn't hurt it.
It wasn't written down anywhere.

220
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,250
And so you've got to always
remember when you do learn stuff,

221
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,060
you got to write it down. And you
know, Lafe and I talk about that,

222
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,110
the fact that when we got
back from Ramadi, you know,

223
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,200
I started teaching it trade at
what's called training detachment.

224
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,010
And he started teaching the, the
seals that were coming out of, uh,

225
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,690
the new guys that were coming out of the
seal training. And that's where we were,

226
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,920
had the opportunity to really capture a
lot of this information that we learned

227
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,410
in Ramadi and we were able to pass it on.

228
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,670
And ultimately those lessons
learned or what became the book.

229
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,503
Okay.

230
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,280
So that being said,
you start talking about doctrine.

231
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,550
And I can tell you that doctrine
is not everything. In fact,

232
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
and you'll hear me talk about people,

233
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,360
People's biggest strengths are
often their biggest weaknesses.

234
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:10,370
So if you have someone that's
super aggressive and they're,

235
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,620
they're aggressive in the business
world or making things happen,

236
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,820
and that's a real advantage for them,

237
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,550
but they can get over aggressive and
then they end up doing stupid things and

238
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:17,410
they fail.
Right?

239
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,990
That's one example of how your biggest
strength can be your biggest weaknesses

240
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,180
in the seal teams,
we really didn't have,

241
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,510
we had very limited doctrine and it was
a real big weakness for us because if

242
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:34,880
you had never run a certain
type of operation before,

243
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,870
you couldn't refer back to something
and say, okay, here's the method or the,

244
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,280
the written documentation of how
you're supposed to do it. So that's,

245
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,890
that's pretty weak. That's pretty
horrible. That's a big weakness.

246
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,630
But at the same time,

247
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:51,940
it was a strength because
as the battlefield changes,

248
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,210
we started getting tasked with missions
that we had never done before that no

249
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,380
one had ever done before.

250
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,820
We were very adaptable because we were
used to trying to figure things out so

251
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:04,010
it's a strength and weakness.
That being said,

252
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,640
and although we did capture
much of our lessons learned,

253
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,800
this is going back to the book here,

254
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,830
basic field manual talking about all
these manuals that capture the doctrine.

255
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,610
Knowledge is fine but it is
useless without common sense.

256
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,730
Common sense is of greater value than
all the words in the book and this is

257
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:31,820
another thing they will stereotypically
put in Hollywood movies about cops are

258
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:36,110
about soldiers. You know you've got some
guy that's buy the book, buy the book,

259
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:39,500
buy the book in and you can see
this is calling it out. This is,

260
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,260
this is colonel armor,

261
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:49,060
our sims or guy that was in the Marine
Corps on Guadalcanal and he said that

262
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:54,380
common sense was more important than
anything in the in the field manuals,

263
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,680
which is something I completely agree with

264
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,590
and to carry that point a
little bit further back to
the book and here's a quote

265
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,390
from major general fuller.

266
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:14,050
The central ideas of an army
is known as its doctrine,

267
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,460
which to be sound must be
based on principles of war
and which to be effective

268
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,850
must be elastic enough to admit of
mutation in accordance with change in

269
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:30,050
circumstance.
So again,

270
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,230
these all these people
that really understand war,

271
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,890
they know that this doctrine is
something that needs to be written.

272
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:37,820
It needs to exist,

273
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,970
but it needs to be adapted to and common
sense is is the superior rank over

274
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,770
doctrine. In another thing, and this is,

275
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:49,604
this is a

276
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,783
a

277
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,180
a comment on training because it becomes
very difficult when you think about

278
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,650
training people for
situations that are unknown.

279
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,370
It's easy to train something people for
something that they know is going to

280
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:07,204
happen,

281
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,140
but it's a lot more difficult to train
people for something that is unknown.

282
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,010
How do you do that?

283
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,630
As we get into the discussion
of training a little bit,

284
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,510
the small unit into the book here,

285
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:24,660
the small unit that to faithfully
follows the method in the book,

286
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,900
we'll eventually attempted under
the wrong conditions. Furthermore,

287
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,450
the unit may have a diff,
have difficulty,

288
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,290
surprising any enemy who has read
their book. That makes sense,

289
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,870
right? The enemy's going to
know your play. And by the way,

290
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,100
all these military manuals
can all be found online.

291
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,840
They're online,
they're on the Internet.

292
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,210
So the enemy definitely reads
what we have. On the other hand,

293
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,060
the unit that doesn't prepare
for any particular scenario,

294
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:58,100
we'll take too long to decide what to do
automatically sacrificing surprise and

295
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:02,810
momentum and then not have the teamwork
to execute what it does decide to do.

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,600
So there's two ends of the spectrum.
You know,

297
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:09,080
we talk about the dichotomy of leadership
and how you're constantly going

298
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,180
against opposing forces.
Well, here's, you know,

299
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:16,181
you can train so hard and so specifically
to what to doctrine that it eliminates

300
00:19:17,451 --> 00:19:18,290
your flexibility.

301
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,980
The other end of the spectrum is to not
train at all and then you can't execute

302
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:22,814
anything.

303
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,480
And Rommel,
Rommel said,

304
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,950
the ordinary soldier has a surprisingly
good nose for what is true and what is

305
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:38,330
false and an eye that's not just soldiers.
You know what?

306
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,570
I talked about that before,
that people know,

307
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
even if they don't know what the truth is,

308
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,070
they know you're not telling them that
he might not know what the actual truth

309
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,260
is.
And,

310
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,340
and then going back to
training in actuality at back
to training and back to the

311
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:58,341
book and actuality motes most small
scale combat is won or lost months before

312
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:00,330
the battle during training.

313
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,300
And that's something that people say
all the time about mixed martial arts as

314
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:06,570
well. You know, it's during
that training as you prepare,

315
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,240
that's what wins the battle. It's a fight
camp, right? It's the same thing with, uh,

316
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,400
with military maneuvers.

317
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,670
So as we continue on here,

318
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,430
as expected,
battlefield conditions change.

319
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,030
So too must learning
overreliance on books.

320
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:37,031
Solutions in itself constitute a short
fall in training because it minimizes the

321
00:20:37,431 --> 00:20:40,250
importance of the unique
aspects of each situation.

322
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,390
Blind faith in standard
operating procedures doesn't
even constitute being well

323
00:20:44,391 --> 00:20:47,680
trained. This is something
that when I was training,

324
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,580
we caused complete mayhem on the guys
that were going through training and

325
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,290
anybody that went through training when
I was running it right now as a smile on

326
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:04,291
their face because they know that
they were put into scenarios that were

327
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,590
completely confusing,
distracting,

328
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,280
disturbing, mayhem, chaos.

329
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,500
It was just crazy.

330
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:19,480
And the reason we did that is because
we wanted to test their minds,

331
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,780
not their standard operating procedures,
not uh,

332
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,120
their shooting capabilities. We wanted
to test the minds of the leaders.

333
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:33,160
Could the leaders be in that chaos,
stepped back from that chaos,

334
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,450
either physically or mentally or both
get an assessment of everything that was

335
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:39,610
happening and then say,
okay,

336
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,680
this is what we need to do to get out of
the situation or improve the situation

337
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:45,610
or when the situation,

338
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,140
what the other thing that it requires,

339
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,830
not only is that the leaders step
back and have the ability to set back,

340
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
but the NCO is again,

341
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:03,121
these noncommissioned officers must love
initiative and must hold what ground

342
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:06,520
they have to the utmost.

343
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:11,650
It often happens that a sergeant or even
a corporal corporal made aside a battle

344
00:22:11,651 --> 00:22:15,730
by boldness with which he sees
as a bit of ground and holds it.

345
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,020
So we tried to inspire the younger guys,
the new guys,

346
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,590
a guy that had no experience in the seal
teams, but we wanted that guy to go,

347
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,690
you know what, I'm going to get in this
room or I'm going to take this building,

348
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:27,820
I'm going to get to this rooftop,
I'm going to get this good position.

349
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,710
And not to do it

350
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,850
as a rogue element,

351
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,130
but within the confines of what the
strategy was and what the plan was.

352
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,840
And that's where you end up with an,

353
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,290
with a unit that works together very well.

354
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,990
And uh,
you know,

355
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:50,500
one of the things that I remember of
where people get locked into these,

356
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,120
you can see it sometimes in MMA fights.
You'll see a fighter that's got a good,

357
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,240
you know,
ground game or he's,

358
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,810
and all he's trying to do is take the
person down and take the person down using

359
00:23:01,811 --> 00:23:03,850
all their energy.
Just keeps trying to clench,

360
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:06,730
keep keeps shooting shots and
they're getting their shots stuff,

361
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:08,110
but they can't adapt.

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,250
They don't have the skills or they
don't have the mindset to adapt.

363
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,070
I remember one scenario where

364
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,460
we had what's called a bunkered machine
gun position. This isn't a training,

365
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,810
a training event. So there's a long
hallway. This is in an urban environment.

366
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,660
There's a big giant building.
This is all fake by the way,

367
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,290
but there's a big giant building and in
the end of the hallway we've got a bad

368
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:37,630
guy who's in a bunkered position.

369
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:42,631
So he's in behind tables and drawers and
concrete and he's got a fully automatic

370
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:48,781
paintball gun and the seals are trying
to go down the hallway to get them and

371
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,480
they're shooting at him.
But this guy isn't a bunkered position.

372
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,730
They can't hit him.
He's hidden.

373
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,120
And so every time they come out in the
hallway to try and move towards him,

374
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:02,840
he just mowed them down. And first
is one guy, then it's another guy,

375
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,070
then three guys,

376
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,300
then it's six guys that it's eight guys
are laying in the hallway, you know,

377
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:09,770
cause every time they
get shot with paint ball,

378
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,010
if they get shot a few times we're
putting them down like, okay, you're dead.

379
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:16,930
Just lay down, stay there, you're dead.
Stay there, you're dead. Okay you're you,

380
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,160
you're dead to, they can't move.
They just got to lay there.

381
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
So I go to the guy that's running it
and it was a platoon chief and I walked

382
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:31,070
over and I said, hey chief, you know,
how's this going to work out? And he said,

383
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,640
we just got to, I've got to get these
guys moving down this hallway. And I said,

384
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,530
do you think there might be another way?

385
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,080
And he kind of looked at me
and he realized that, yeah,

386
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,290
there's another way. He sent a
couple guys back out of the building.

387
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,240
They walked the down the outside of the
building to the window where the guy was

388
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,500
bunkered in through a couple of grenades
in there, jumped in, killed the guy.

389
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,240
But the mindset wasn't there to
have the flexibility to do that.

390
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,710
And that's what we are training.

391
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:04,190
Cause I never wanted to see guys
get locked in to a situation.

392
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,780
That's why training all training
needs to expand your brain.

393
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,820
They need to expand your mind
needs to it shouldn't constraint,

394
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,000
shouldn't constrain your ideas.
Yeah.

395
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:17,810
It almost seems like that would
be a different type of training.

396
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:21,830
Even almost like you could like phone with
fourth of the double leg or something.

397
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,600
They're forcing, they're not
getting it. They're not getting it.

398
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:26,060
He should have been trained
in other take downs.

399
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,820
If in fact taking the guy
down was the strategy.

400
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,600
You should be trained in other stuff.
They'll be some judo stuff. No,

401
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:34,160
no doubt about it.
And this is one,

402
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,050
one thing that's interesting and I th
I think that's the e the evolution is

403
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:41,090
you're hearing,
you know about Conor McGregor right now,

404
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:42,890
and I hate to jump on the bandwagon,

405
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:47,630
but you know you see him doing
like this movement type drills,

406
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,820
which is really good because what does
that doing that's training you for these

407
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:56,300
weird situations? You know?
And that's another issue.

408
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,880
Like with training
Jujitsu with Jeff Glover.

409
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,180
He puts himself in these weird positions
and does these crazy things that when

410
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,750
it happens to him,

411
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,010
he just has better reaction because
he's used to being in these strange

412
00:26:10,011 --> 00:26:14,810
positions. And when we
work with corporations, um,

413
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,730
and work with companies,
we'll,

414
00:26:16,731 --> 00:26:21,731
we'll do role playing with these CEOs
are mid level managers and we'll,

415
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,020
we'll play, you know, Lafe and
I will play the unruly old,

416
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,400
you know,
uh,

417
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:33,550
job site foreman that knows more than
you do and how are you going to deal with

418
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:34,160
them?

419
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:39,160
And we put them in these
hostile situations and do
things and say things and

420
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,470
that, that throw them for a loop
that make them uncomfortable, that,

421
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,040
that they don't know
the solution to and they

422
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,420
have to think on their feet. And
that's, that's one of the, you know,

423
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:52,260
one of the pieces of training
that I always like to go
back to you is how can we,

424
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,660
how can we do things that surprise
people in training so that,

425
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:02,280
so that we exercise their brain,
not now what they know. We don't,

426
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,580
we got to get what you know,
you gotta train, which you know,

427
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,640
you got to practice what, you know,
how do we train what you don't know,

428
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,710
which you don't expect.
Yeah. It's like a deeper,

429
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:14,940
it's like almost like a
level deeper in the training.

430
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,250
Like it's like,
it's real beneficial I think.

431
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,340
I think Henry guys talk
about this training. Jujitsu,

432
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,640
a good way to train for self defense is
trained with a real athletic guy who's a

433
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:29,670
white belt so he won't do
predictable things that you've
been training every day.

434
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:33,660
He'll do unpredictable things
where you won't be super easy.

435
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,370
Um,

436
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,000
and at the same time it won't be something
that you have full knowledge of and

437
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:40,410
full experience of it.

438
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,650
If you get the 280 pound powerhouse
that shows up to the gym that's never

439
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:49,710
trained before,
the first time you train with them,

440
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,190
it's going to be harder
to catch him then it will

441
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,870
three months later. Now, maybe, maybe
three months, it'll be about the same.

442
00:27:57,871 --> 00:28:01,560
But like a month into it where he kind of
knows what he's supposed to try and do.

443
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,100
Right. But you know exactly what he's
going to do, then it's easy to catch him.

444
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,370
It's easier. So you're, you're
right, it definitely is a,

445
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,280
is a transitional time and it is good to
train with people that you have no idea

446
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:15,090
what they're going to do. Yeah. And it's
not even to say that, that, and it does,

447
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:18,270
it gives you experience with
these unorthodox things for sure.

448
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,210
But that's not what you're talking
about as far as what's being trained,

449
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:25,590
what's being trained is not
to be so dogmatic in your
actions and your, you know,

450
00:28:25,591 --> 00:28:29,820
your, your plan is to this,
this sounds really cliche.

451
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,260
It's to expect the unexpected. Right.
But it trains you to think that way.

452
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,370
Well, it's true. And I don't
know if this is cliche or not.

453
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,540
I'm pretty sure it is,

454
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,000
but I say this and people kind of freak
out when I say it because I'm like, uh,

455
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,390
a structured, disciplined person. But
I say it all the time. Free your mind.

456
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,320
You know, you got to free your mind.
That's why when I talk about this stuff,

457
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,560
I hate when I find myself in a situation
where my mind is not free to see what's

458
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:02,670
going on and I can't detach
from what's known. Yeah. And,

459
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,250
and go and enter the unknown and,
and, and deal with the unknown. Yeah.

460
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,361
You know,

461
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:14,361
another thing that can affect this is

462
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,340
our ego and how our ego can prevent
us from learning or listening to other

463
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:29,310
people or other schools or other
martial arts or other gyms or other

464
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:33,630
perspectives. So it, in this book,

465
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,510
the last hundred yards,
he talks about that,

466
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,220
uh,
even giving

467
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,260
a sister organization
with the same manuals,

468
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,510
credit for knowing
anything can be difficult.

469
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,960
Pride in one's unit can
help to build cohesion,

470
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,350
but it can also stand
in the way of learning.

471
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,960
Learning must always take
priority over pride. How readily,

472
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,090
how readily a military organization
can assimilate new information,

473
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:05,980
establishes how easily it's component
elements can acquire new knowledge.

474
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,600
The Germans of World War One are
generally credited with developing the

475
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:15,220
application parameters that
define modern infantry tactics.

476
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,570
Here's how they did it.

477
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,460
The German army of 1914 was the
most decentralized in Europe,

478
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,830
free from all book,

479
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:28,831
the most general supervision and relieved
by a promotion system that based based

480
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:33,550
strictly on seniority of the need
to constantly please superiors.

481
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,170
The German battalion or company commander
was free to train his troops according

482
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,520
to his own lights.

483
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,410
So they way they advanced people is just
how it wasn't based on how well you did

484
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:47,080
on this particular thing. So they
weren't kissing ass the whole time.

485
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,420
It was just oh you and rank you,
now you get promoted.

486
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,660
So they were free to kind of operate and
do the best they could and that had a

487
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:54,190
big,
big impact

488
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,870
for,
for example,

489
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:06,790
by 1918 the Germans had line infantry
squads that could penetrate ally defense

490
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:11,560
lines almost at will as opposed to,

491
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,730
you know,
the,

492
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,260
the allies who would always try and
coordinate these big giant massive attacks

493
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:17,981
at the same time.

494
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:21,940
And you have to get everyone aligned
and you have to execute perfectly with

495
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:26,620
thousands of people. That's obviously
very challenging. Rather than just saying,

496
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:29,860
okay, our goal is to break through
the lines, go and figure it out.

497
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,600
Think of all the different creative ways
that go to figure that out. And it's,

498
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,670
it's crazy and that's why it was so
successful. Now the Germans lost,

499
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,000
they obviously made some
mistakes on those strategic level

500
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,920
and as a matter of national policy,
they made some pretty big mistakes too.

501
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:51,640
But that's kind of a, that's kind of
a whole nother, a whole nother story.

502
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,710
Most military leaders agree that doing
nothing to prepare an infantry squad for

503
00:31:56,711 --> 00:32:00,550
combat also does little to
enhance its chances for success.

504
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,750
Most can also agree that providing
guidance that is too restrictive may cause

505
00:32:04,751 --> 00:32:08,080
the squad to disregard
unforeseen circumstances.

506
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,630
The answer to that must
lie somewhere in between.

507
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,360
That's what we've been talking about.

508
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,320
And you see this with fighters as well,

509
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,770
and you see fighters that prepare
for a specific attack from somebody,

510
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,671
but then that other,

511
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:27,660
somebody decides to mix it up and
comes out and does something that's,

512
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,370
it's happen to me when I was cornering
fighters before where I've gone out and

513
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:34,390
said, oh, I didn't expect that. Here
we go. This guy just took, you know,

514
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,010
Jon bones just took down a DC,
you know, like, where'd that come?

515
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,010
Why did he do

516
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,560
that? So we see that kind of, that,

517
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,150
that mentality that throws things off and
it puts people in a, in a predicament.

518
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah. And you mentioned
John Jones. He, um,

519
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,720
he actually even admitted that some
of the stuff that he does, he just,

520
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:57,560
he's never trained for, he just did it.
Yeah. But it's, man, it's that different,

521
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,340
that separate element of your
mind or that are training,

522
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:03,470
I don't know if you had training doing
that are just a creative person or

523
00:33:03,471 --> 00:33:06,770
whatever. Um, just that separate element.

524
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,560
It's a whole different part of this
strategy, you know? Yeah. On other asset.

525
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,030
Yeah. And also you can see that
he's encouraged by Greg Jackson.

526
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:21,820
He's encouraged and he does things, you
know, he, he has an open mind, right?

527
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,010
It's got a free mind and that
goes a long way for your mind.

528
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,090
That is kind of a cliche by the way.
There's a,

529
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:31,850
like a song isn't free of mine in the
rest of the flight hollow or something

530
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:36,380
else will fall out. In other words, I'm
not familiar with that. Let's not say.

531
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,110
Uh, so finally to talk about
decentralized command and,

532
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:47,290
and what I would see happen
with decentralized command
as I tell some junior

533
00:33:47,361 --> 00:33:49,010
leader, okay, you know, you
need to decentralize command,

534
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,840
you'll need to let your guys go
out and do what they need to do.

535
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,100
And they go out on the
battlefield and this is, you know,

536
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:57,110
getting in training where
there no one's going to die.

537
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,620
They'd go out and all the little leaders
would get their own ID and they'd go

538
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,080
and try and make all the stuff that
happened and the commander would lose

539
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:06,520
control and everyone would get crushed in,

540
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,420
shot up with paint ball
and the whole nine yards.

541
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,960
And they come back and still utilize a
deduce which was community does work and

542
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,423
I would say no,

543
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,940
you did decentralized command but you
missed the key part of decentralized

544
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:27,170
command, which is guidance, parameters,

545
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:31,190
understanding of the mission,
Commander's intent,

546
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,430
standard operating procedures,
limits of advance,

547
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:39,431
all these nice little restrictions
that you put on the guys.

548
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,500
Now they're, they're wide restrictions.
I shouldn't have said little.

549
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,820
They're wide restrictions.

550
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:48,140
They give them a lot of mobility but
they understand what the objective is,

551
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:52,550
what the end state is, what their
parameters are, how far they can maneuver,

552
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,490
like they can know they can, hey,
if you can't go past this building,

553
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,780
you can't go past this road.

554
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,820
You can't go wherever you draw those
lines so that they can operate freely

555
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:04,340
within those lines and
that's how they're made.

556
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,550
That's how you maintain control
with decentralized command.

557
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,300
Would you call them like guidelines or,

558
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,920
cause when you say operate
within those lines,

559
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,500
is it pretty encouraged to stay within
those lines with their creativity or does

560
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,380
the creativity, is that allowed to
kind of overflow? Like if you say,

561
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,350
you know how far you can engage there,

562
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,600
are you saying that there are no
exceptions, no subjective, you know,

563
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,300
if I call you up and say Echo,

564
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:34,130
I'm a building 14 right now we see enemy
moving to building 27 I want to push

565
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:37,470
down this road. Are we good to
do that? And you say, all right,

566
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,130
let me check the map.

567
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,100
Let me check where I'm other forces
are at. Yep. Where you're good to go.

568
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,880
You can move.

569
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,510
So there are times where I have to check
back with you to make sure we're good

570
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,730
to go and make sure that you understand.
But I'm,

571
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm going beyond what parameters were
set and that's why I have to communicate

572
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,160
to you.
But I went all the way up to that point.

573
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,020
I maneuvered on the battlefield for,
you know, three, four, five, six hours.

574
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,800
Maybe it was a day, maybe it was
two days without having to say Echo,

575
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,280
I need some guidance here. Echo, I'm going
to push beyond what you told me. Yeah.

576
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,450
So these guidelines are kind of,

577
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:11,250
you go in with the knowledge that
there are exceptions as long as they're

578
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:12,600
responsible.
Yes.

579
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,930
As long as what you do that you'd be
responsible about making those exceptions

580
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:18,720
and communicating.
I know that's when bad things happen.

581
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:20,370
When bad things happened
is when you go outside the,

582
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,340
the limitations that you're supposed
to be in and you don't tell anybody,

583
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:28,260
you know, that's a very,
very problematic now, um,

584
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,460
when we,

585
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,410
when we talk about why it's so why
you have to maintain that flexibility.

586
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:40,650
The reason is because combat is
infinitely complex and it's one of those

587
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,700
dichotomies because it's infinitely
simple, but it's infinitely complex.

588
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:48,710
And believe me,
the complexity of it got me,

589
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:53,960
got the best of me on many occasions
where I was, where I lost it. I did not,

590
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,830
could not fall the complexity situation.
I had two bad things happen.

591
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,630
I had to regroup.
I had to try and figure them out,

592
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,980
had to assemble these thoughts
in my head as all this thing.

593
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:07,730
All of these things are happening.
Go into the book as it relates to combat.

594
00:37:07,731 --> 00:37:10,850
The term situation
encompasses many variables.

595
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,340
Mission, enemy, terrain,
weather troops and fire support,

596
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:23,070
time, space, logistics. Each
category has many facets.

597
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:28,430
Disregarding a seemingly inconsequential
sort put circumstance can invalidate an

598
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,870
otherwise logical solution.

599
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,490
One must continually
study the possibilities,

600
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,950
continually study the possibilities.

601
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,970
And I've seen that where one little
problem can escalate into all kinds of

602
00:37:49,431 --> 00:37:54,020
problems. And that's something that
whether it's a unit that we dealt,

603
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,330
we did just what we just talked
about, which is, you know,

604
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,820
you get a unit that goes
where they weren't supposed
to be and they didn't tell

605
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:02,090
anybody. That can become very
problematic as you can imagine,

606
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,470
because all of a sudden,
you know,

607
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:06,230
you've got people shooting from a building
where there's not supposed to be any

608
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,870
friendlies. Well guess what? You're
going to shoot back at him, right?

609
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,180
So that's a horrible situation.

610
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Things with communication where you know
some radio frequencies go down or for

611
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,750
whatever reason you lose communications
with people and all of a sudden you're

612
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,910
in a black hole and you
don't know what's happening.

613
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,090
That's another situation where one little
tiny piece can really throw massive

614
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:30,560
complexities into the situation.

615
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,960
Going back to Rommel and back to training.

616
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,463
Okay.

617
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,110
The best form of welfare for the
troops is first class training.

618
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,070
This saves unnecessary casualties.

619
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,940
And I think I did talk about this before,
but taking care of your people,

620
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,250
you know and how taking care
of your people, it can mean a,

621
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,250
that means we're were to cut them loose
early because that means you're taking

622
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:02,730
care of them.

623
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:06,630
But the reality is the way you take care
of them is to train them art that'd be

624
00:39:06,631 --> 00:39:10,380
disciplined. So I'll, I'll, we'll
never lose sight of that one.

625
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,880
This is a skipping around a little bit,

626
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:17,340
but I wanted to throw
this in there because

627
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,500
because of the fight we had in Ramadi,

628
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,780
and it's just talking about how the
fighting and the urban environment is so

629
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,770
challenging and it says in
the book built up areas,

630
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,720
meaning cities should be bypassed
wherever possible. In urban terrain,

631
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:41,870
the attacker may need as much as
a 10 to one manpower advantage

632
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,490
and Sun Zoo who wrote the art of war,

633
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,000
the worst policy is to attack cities.

634
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:58,240
And if troops or attacking cities,
their strength will be exhausted.

635
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,600
That's just a for time immortal.

636
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,550
Trying to fight in cities is
absolutely the most challenging of all

637
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:10,660
environments. Why? Cause they're,
they're dug in and their, you know,

638
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:13,860
their little strategy kind of
is established. They're dug in.

639
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,850
They,

640
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:20,050
they are 360 degrees around you.

641
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,400
Oh yeah. They are above
you. They are to the left,

642
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,760
to the right in front of you. They're
behind you and they're beneath you.

643
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:30,820
They're in the sewage systems,
they're in the basements.

644
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,680
So you're in this 360 degree fire zone.

645
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,320
And on top of that,

646
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,310
just about every building is a
hardened fighting position. Yeah.

647
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,080
So, so all you have to do is enter a
building and you've got a pill box,

648
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,240
you've got a, you've got a bunker. And
so therefore it's very, very challenging.

649
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,360
And I just talked about having a enemy
machine gunner and a bunkered fighting

650
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,130
position.
That's a nightmare.

651
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,480
It's a little less of a nightmare when
you have tanks to come in and blast them.

652
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,650
Sure. So God blessed the
tankers. I love those guys.

653
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,020
We uh, worked side by
side with those guys. One,

654
00:41:11,021 --> 00:41:12,010
one a d

655
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,030
guys crushed it for us
and we appreciated it.

656
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,330
Respect for one and one's enemy is
crucial to success on the battlefield.

657
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:28,830
He is not a coward, he is not stupid
and he probably has comparable weaponry.

658
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,730
That's from the book how to focus on
the enemy and make sure that you are,

659
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,610
you are respecting the enemy.

660
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,590
Flexibility to a changing situation.
Again in the book,

661
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,280
having the ability to detect and then
react to a changing situation can have

662
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:50,810
great value in war. What manuals contain
is mostly technique, not doctrine.

663
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,760
This technique is merely a framework
around which to build common sense

664
00:41:55,761 --> 00:42:00,761
solutions and what that translates
to is discipline equals freedom.

665
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:06,020
You have these standard
operating procedures, you
work them, you refine them,

666
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,280
you practice them, you get good at
them but you don't get stuck with them.

667
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:16,390
You free your mind by having discipline
and it means that you can adapt these

668
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,130
strict standard operating procedures.

669
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,730
You can adapt them instantaneously and
do something else with them because

670
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,700
you're a maestro and you
can make that happen.

671
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,390
Now we get into this,
and this is going a little bit deep,

672
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,690
but we start talking about something
called mission type orders.

673
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:44,530
And that is different from let's say
what would be called a directive,

674
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,000
where I say, Echo, you're
going to move down this street.

675
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,040
You're going to take this building
number 27 you're going to set security in

676
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:57,590
there and you're going
to hold that position.

677
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,380
That's different because now I've told
you exactly what to do. I've said, okay,

678
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,970
echo,
you're gonna move down this street.

679
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:07,400
So I'm telling you which
way you're going to go.

680
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,530
I'm going to tell you exactly which
building you're gonna take down.

681
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,390
And I'm telling you just
to set security in there.

682
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,460
Now what I really want to say is that
that means you have to do what I just told

683
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:19,790
you because you have no choice. I mean,
I didn't give you any other options.

684
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:24,170
I told you exactly what to do.
Now what if I were to say Echo,

685
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,750
we think the enemies over in this area,

686
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,120
we want to be able to hold security
on them from an elevated position.

687
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,410
Find a building down there
and make that happen.

688
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,260
So now you've got all kinds of freedom.

689
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,190
You might pick 27 cause maybe it was
the best building, but maybe 36 wasn't,

690
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:47,090
maybe 32 was maybe 27 was hardened.
Maybe it wasn't tall enough.

691
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,950
But you have this organic flexibility
in your mind because you've been given a

692
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:56,660
goal of why you're doing the mission,
not just what to do.

693
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,850
So it's very important when
you're dealing with people,

694
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,780
you know in any walk of life that you
tell them not just what they're trying to

695
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:09,620
do, what to do, but what they're trying
to accomplish, what the mission is,

696
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:13,370
why they are doing it.
And that is incredibly important.

697
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,710
Just like aggressiveness is important.

698
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,660
And going back to the
book from General Howland,

699
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:28,340
Mad Smith,
since I joined the marines,

700
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:33,370
I have advocated aggressiveness in the
field and constant offensive action hit

701
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:38,580
quickly, hit hard and keep right
on hitting. Give the enemy no rest,

702
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,850
no opportunity to consolidate
as forces and hit back at you.

703
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,280
This is the shortest road to victory.

704
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,310
Do I need to even expand on that?

705
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:53,663
I mean,

706
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,990
I think how [inaudible] Mad Smith
just hit the nail on the head.

707
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,360
Next point,

708
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,330
controlling subordinates only to the
extent that surprised momentum are not

709
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,164
sacrificed.

710
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,430
Personnel should become so familiar with
their leader's intent that they can be

711
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:17,100
trusted to act on their own initiative.

712
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,690
They should never be required to ask
permission to respond to crisis situation.

713
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,330
Seconds count and close combat.

714
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,160
Subordinates must be trusted to act
appropriately and Rick only required to

715
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,430
inform the leaders of decisions
that might affect others. That's it.

716
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,900
That's decentralized command.

717
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:39,270
Now you're going to think at first
that this is a little bit of a stretch,

718
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,310
but it's not so controlling subordinates
only to the extent that surprise and

719
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:48,090
momentum are not sacrificed.
I'm going to relate that to Jujitsu.

720
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,860
Believe it or not,
in Jujitsu and in any sport,

721
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:59,280
you have to train your standard operating
procedures so that your body can

722
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:03,300
execute them without directives,
right?

723
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,440
If you have an instinct
to defend the arm lock,

724
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:08,790
you will escape the arm lock.

725
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,210
If you do not have that instinct
because you haven't trained it enough,

726
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,710
you will get caught in the arm lock.
If you have to think about the move,

727
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:21,840
it is too late. And that's exactly
what decentralized command is.

728
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:27,140
If echoes out on the battlefield and he
gets flanked and he has to ask me what

729
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:29,970
to do,
he's going to get killed.

730
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,190
If Echo's on the mat
with me and I slap a Kim,

731
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,700
you're on him and he has to think
about the defense. It's too late.

732
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,720
He's already tapping.

733
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,810
Whereas if I go for the Camaro and his
instinct moves him out of that position,

734
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,210
then you survive.

735
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,000
The, uh, one more thing that I,

736
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:59,100
when I think about that type of training
is something we used to do was called

737
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:00,600
blender drills.

738
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,750
When you take your seal squad or your
seal platoon and you start making calls on

739
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:10,320
them, plank left and you know, push
right strong, right center pool.

740
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:14,190
You just do the most random
calls. So that meeting calls, uh,

741
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,450
like you're making tactical
calls, you got, you got 16 guys,

742
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,240
they're called immediate action drills.
And for instance,

743
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:26,160
if you are patrolling through the desert
and you can start getting shot at from

744
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:30,580
the front, then you do a
what's called a contact drill.

745
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,220
You're going to react to that contact.
The contact is the enemy.

746
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:38,380
You're going to do a maneuver as a group
and they're all kind of choreographed

747
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:41,830
maneuvers where squad one goes over here,
a squad to goes over here.

748
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,500
We lay down a base of fire. You
start to move, cover and move out,

749
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:49,420
but what we would do is we would mix
up those calls in the middle of one

750
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,450
maneuver, we'd call for another
for it. In the middle of that one,

751
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,180
we'd call for another one in the middle
of that one we'd call for another one

752
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,450
and what it did was it trained the mind.

753
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:02,830
It trained the minds of the leaders and
if the guys to expect the unexpected,

754
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,780
as you said earlier in that cliched way,

755
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,820
but something that's completely necessary,

756
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:12,030
trained them to be reactive
and open minded to things
that were going to happen.

757
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,180
Now
when we talk about learning,

758
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,330
and this is a it,
the title of this chapter in,

759
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:30,400
in the book, the last hundred yards, it's
called old habits may get in the way.

760
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,480
Then I think it's pretty obvious what
that means. Adults learn. Here it is.

761
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:37,750
Adults learn within the context
of what they already know.

762
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,400
Ideas that are too far removed from their
personal frames of reference are hard

763
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:47,350
for them to accept. How often do
we see that? We see it in life.

764
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,910
We see it in the business world. We see
it in combat. We see it in training.

765
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,120
Ideas that are too far removed from
people's personal frame of reference are

766
00:48:58,121 --> 00:49:02,650
hard for them to accept.
Unfortunately,

767
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:06,610
when one gets dropped into a hot
landing zone on his first day in combat,

768
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,970
it's often too late for him to
learn anymore. For this reason,

769
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:14,971
infantry must continually reassess
and expand their frames of reference.

770
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,960
Boom. Hello life. For this reason,

771
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:25,020
infantry men and everybody else in the
world must continually reassess and

772
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:27,370
expand their frames of reference.

773
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,780
Everybody when one survival's at stake
the other way can hold as much appeal as

774
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:35,260
the established way.

775
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,860
So clearly we see people in the business
world stuck in that Rut all the time.

776
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,460
We see people in their personal lives,
they get stuck in a Rut all the time.

777
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,540
So everybody has got to
continually reassess and expand,

778
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,600
expand their frame of reference.
Going back to the boat,

779
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:57,430
what adults know comes
primarily from two sources,

780
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,600
what they have been told and what they
have experienced personally. Okay.

781
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:04,510
That's pretty clear, right? I
think that's pretty obvious,

782
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,890
but this is when it gets pretty cool.

783
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,660
They sometimes have difficulty keeping
the 2 cents of ideas separated,

784
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,980
becoming convinced that what they have
been told is true even though they have

785
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:16,930
never personally experienced it.

786
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:22,480
And that is something that
you see in the military,

787
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,620
you see in the military
where guys kind of,

788
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,730
they hear something,

789
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:32,150
they make it into something that
they think that they've experienced.

790
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:36,380
I know it sounds crazy,
but they do it and

791
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:41,780
it's dangerous. It's
dangerous. And I never,

792
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,640
when I realized that that happened,
when I realized that that was going on,

793
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,980
I was very

794
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:55,670
suspect of everything that got said. Uh,
you know, I was very suspect and said,

795
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:56,600
well let's,

796
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,350
let's make sure that we confirm these
ideas before we just run out and do them.

797
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,880
Cause that kind of like
those, those martial arts
demonstrations. Right? Exactly,

798
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,511
exactly.

799
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:09,410
And you can imagine that before the
UFC and before you actually putting to

800
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,940
humans in a cage to brawl, it
was all theoretical. Right?

801
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,930
And if someone said, you know what, if
you strike the person here in the neck,

802
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,230
they will fall down. And, and this is the,

803
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:24,860
people legitimately believed that,
hey, if you hit the person in the neck,

804
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:28,130
there's a brachial nerve and it'll go
down to just go and stuff a are wrong and

805
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:31,130
they will immediately fall
down. And people believe
that. But they never tried it,

806
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:31,970
but they believed it.

807
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,260
And there was a lot of the times those
stories were mixed in with someone that

808
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,800
had been told that they'd seen it one
time or they experienced it or whatever.

809
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,750
And so that's a good
point. [inaudible] um,

810
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,910
and this is when you get into people
that are not telling the whole story.

811
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,640
And this is something I'm very careful
of is when I know something like no,

812
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,660
I never claim to know anything 100% and
now I will always caveat everything with

813
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:02,960
you know,

814
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,960
like a 99.9% but there's sometimes where
I'm giving information and I'm saying,

815
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:12,440
look, this is not 100% I
don't know this for sure,

816
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,500
but this is what I've seen and this is
what I've experienced. Sometimes I'm like,

817
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:16,334
hey listen,

818
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,550
I know this and I have experienced
it and this is what will work.

819
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,990
And I definitely,
when I was instructing in the seal teams,

820
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:29,960
I was very clear when I was saying,
Hey,

821
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:34,370
I have not done that type
of mission before or I have
not done this in combat or

822
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:36,260
I have not seen how
this would really work.

823
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,310
But here's what I think cause that's a
lot different than this is what you need

824
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:41,840
to do.
Because I have seen it,

825
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,960
I have done it and I do know confidently
that barring the common sense,

826
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:52,100
this is how you should execute this.
So sources back to the book,

827
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,600
sources have many reasons for not
disclosing every facet of an issue.

828
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,320
One is to propound more
convincingly their perspective.

829
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:05,750
Infantry men can't afford to harbor
points of view that aren't well founded.

830
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,160
They need continually to reassess their
viewpoint and expand their frames of

831
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:14,060
reference to encompass infantry knowledge
from around the world and across

832
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:17,660
centuries.
Awesome.

833
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:21,350
Free your mind does that kind of like,

834
00:53:21,351 --> 00:53:24,620
I'm looking something up on
Google or on the Internet

835
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,160
and then the difference between just going
with that first answer and going with

836
00:53:32,711 --> 00:53:36,450
the, you know, a bunch of,
a bunch of results. Bunch of
websites. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

837
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,620
And,

838
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:42,570
and people that see something on the
Internet and then talk about it as if they

839
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:44,040
know it firsthand.
Right.

840
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:46,080
When they read it on there for
that first result they got,

841
00:53:46,081 --> 00:53:48,870
they clicked on and boom, there's your
answer. Yeah. Those people out there,

842
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:52,560
we don't like you.
You're clouding the truth.

843
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,300
Okay.

844
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,300
Getting into some leadership and really
life choices that you can apply these to

845
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:03,150
life. You can play as a business. Um,

846
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,880
here are some choices
that humans have to make.

847
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Protect the status quo or take risks
necessary to win decisively that that's,

848
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:14,850
that speaks on its own.

849
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:19,650
Protecting the status quo can be easier
than changing it to take action. One,

850
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:20,910
risks making mistake.

851
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,050
So that's a choice and it's
not a black and white choice.

852
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:28,320
There's a lot of shades of gray in there.
And how can you modulate that choice?

853
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,660
But it is a choice that
you have to be aware of.

854
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:36,960
Focus inwards to prevent mistakes or on
the enemy to keep pace with a changing

855
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:39,900
situation.
This is an interesting professional.

856
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:44,040
Professionals of all types try to
minimize errors. Unfortunately,

857
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:45,090
trying to do,

858
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:50,070
trying too hard to do so in the military
profession has some serious tradeoffs

859
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,120
initiative,

860
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,920
ability to surprise one adversary
perspective on the overall picture and

861
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,420
learning just the name of true.

862
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:02,010
And I would say that those are the exact
same in any profession. That when you,

863
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,370
when you are only focused
on not making mistakes,

864
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,760
how are you going to make any risks

865
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,300
Jujitsu the minute that you're just like,
Hey,

866
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:14,910
I'm going to go with what I
know and I am so guilty of this.

867
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,500
I am the guiltiest of
all in that I'm very,

868
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,810
um, set in my ways in, in the
moves that I do. You know,

869
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:29,220
I do for submissions maybe even to,
you know,

870
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,660
uh, but you know, they're,
they're like what I'm good at.

871
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:38,430
So I do them a lot and I go through phases
and I shouldn't even say it's phases.

872
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,820
I go through days where I take a
lot of risks and I learned more.

873
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,710
And then I go through days where I'm just
there because I have to train and I'm

874
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:49,200
going to do what I do and I'm gonna
what I'm gonna do, what I do well.

875
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,120
But that's not what I learned.
That's not what I get better.

876
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,670
I get better when I'm
trying something new.

877
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:57,900
And that applies to everything in life.

878
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,290
Key to an infantry man's ability to
react to whatever confronts him is his

879
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:06,840
authority.
To exercise some initiative,

880
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,430
you got to give your people the
freedom to maneuver. You have to,

881
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,110
in combat,

882
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,530
the leader must personally supervise
only those actions that jeopardize the

883
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:23,890
overall mission and then
allow subordinates to
exercise initiative and make a

884
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:25,600
few mistakes on everything else.

885
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:31,050
Those subordinates must be
able to identify mistakes
as they happen without fear

886
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,450
of punishment or the same
mistakes will happen again.

887
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,350
This is making mistakes
without fear of punishment.

888
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,280
You know a dean are,
you know buddy dean lister,

889
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:47,580
he does these drills that
he calls consequence free
drills where he just says,

890
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,480
okay,
you're going to start.

891
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,000
You know that someone's going to be on
your back and you're going to try to

892
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:56,320
escape, but doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter what happens if they submit you.

893
00:56:56,321 --> 00:56:59,650
It doesn't matter to just doesn't matter.
Consequence free drills.

894
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:03,070
It's just to take chances
because all of us, you know,

895
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,750
we all hate getting tapped out.
We all hate giving up position,

896
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,120
so you do these consequences. Regionals.
You Go, okay, I look at the guy in,

897
00:57:11,121 --> 00:57:13,960
I'm like, okay, you're going to tap me
out. It's no big deal. You know, so do,

898
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:16,900
I'm going to try crazy stuff.
And that's what they're saying here.

899
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:19,420
You've got to give people
the chances to make mistakes

900
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,130
and that's an accident, an
important one because, um,

901
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,910
how that applies to life,
that applies to life.

902
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,600
Mm.

903
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,360
Right when you're born, when you're,
when you're a bit like if you,

904
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,830
let's say your parenting style,

905
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,850
if you have that parenting style
where I can make some mistake,

906
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:39,310
he spills his milky or
he's trying something new,

907
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:43,930
he makes a mistake and he gets punished
for it and that's how he's raised.

908
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,910
When he grows up,

909
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,940
he's going to be very reluctant
to try new things in life and, or,

910
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,540
or explore a certain, you know,
aspects of, of creativity,

911
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,390
namely like starting his own business.

912
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,940
That's why most people don't start their
own business because they've lived that

913
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:01,151
kind of,

914
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:04,300
I think most of us have lived that kind
of life where if you make a mistake when

915
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:07,510
you're a kid, you get punished
for it. Even in school,

916
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,660
when you make a mistake on your test,
you get that red x on the thing.

917
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:14,350
You got five wrong out of 10
you've got a 50% you've got an f,

918
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,580
there's your punishment, your f, oh
wait, I don't know these five things.

919
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:21,670
Can I learn to all take the test
again and show you that, oh no, no,

920
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:25,810
you got an APP. There is your
punishment. Repeat the grade.

921
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,640
[inaudible] sucks.
There's your problem.

922
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,000
So you didn't even want to
make any mistakes. You don't
want to try anything new.

923
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,610
You don't want to.
And you just have that mindset.

924
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,080
And that's what most people are like that.

925
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:39,130
There is however, a point
where people, you know,

926
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,200
you could be raised in a way where you're
not responsible for your own actions

927
00:58:42,201 --> 00:58:44,210
because there's no
consequences to what you do.

928
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,810
So if you don't study and you get the
Red Xs all over your test and you don't

929
00:58:47,811 --> 00:58:49,370
receive any punishment for it,

930
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,140
then you will never learn because
only only he who suffers remembers.

931
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:59,260
Right?
But there the difference in you this,

932
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:03,230
I know it always comes back to that
dichotomy that you talk about where it's,

933
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,490
it's really in the middle area.
So

934
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:13,290
I think that it has to be leaning
towards that what you were saying.

935
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:16,020
Let them give them freedom to operate.
If you make a mistake,

936
00:59:16,021 --> 00:59:20,010
but they're putting effort into it,
that should be commended. Don't,

937
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,010
if you get one wrong,
too wrong,

938
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,030
don't give them this trophy that says,
Hey, congratulations. You've failed.

939
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:31,460
A failure should, should be. I mean, the
goal right, is to make successful people.

940
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,620
I will, I will. Despite what I said or in,

941
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:39,530
in conjunction with what I said about
there needing to be consequences,

942
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,740
I agree that the correct answer or the
correct reaction would not be you failed

943
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:50,240
your horrible, but you failed.
What did you learn? Yeah.

944
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:53,330
How can we improve? Yes,
exactly. Exactly right.

945
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:58,490
So you notice that was exactly, exactly
double. Exactly. Exactly right. Yes,

946
00:59:58,491 --> 00:59:59,780
for sure.
So yeah,

947
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:03,530
they kind of get the best of both
worlds where they get get that,

948
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,130
that the fact that they failed,
they understand that. And of course,

949
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:10,220
no one's just like,
no one's goal is to fail.

950
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:13,220
So they know that they failed.
They understand that they failed,

951
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,210
but encouraged to improve
and encouraged to understand.

952
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,430
But I think in a lot of ways people
don't get that. Yeah. You definitely,

953
01:00:22,431 --> 01:00:26,990
you definitely don't see it when in
businesses you definitely don't see it in

954
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:31,430
the military. Um, and so yeah, you're
right. You've got to encourage that. Yeah.

955
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,590
And it,
and I think it could get,

956
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,200
and this is just me speaking
from zero experience,

957
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:39,380
but I would imagine that it would get
really rigid in the military because the

958
01:00:39,381 --> 01:00:43,760
stakes are a lot higher. Well, that's
why this is talking about training. Yeah.

959
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:46,490
You don't want to let people make
those kinds of mistakes in combat.

960
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:50,360
You won't give them that much rope where
they can get somebody killed in combat.

961
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,870
Yeah. When, yeah. In a
training in, in, in life,

962
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,620
in a learning situation
or a developing phase,

963
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,510
which in life really is your whole life.
But so always learning, always learning.

964
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:07,580
So I think to stick to
that, I don't know, format,

965
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:08,480
whatever you want to call it,

966
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:12,950
to stick to that where understanding
your mistakes don't like a mistake,

967
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:14,330
a legitimate mistake.

968
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,800
The punishment should not be the
significant part of that experience.

969
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,250
The learning, the learning should
be, and hey look, I understand this.

970
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:23,900
Different philosophies.
You know, there's gotta be,

971
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,480
there's gotta be some consequence.
Some people don't learn without consorts.

972
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:31,220
You see that for these days with these,
some of the new generation,

973
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,100
which your, you might even be a
part of a, but the new, you know,

974
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,120
the new generation that grows up,

975
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:39,560
consequence for use and they don't take
any responsibility for their actions.

976
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:42,980
They don't take ownership of anything
that goes wrong because they've been

977
01:01:42,981 --> 01:01:47,150
raised in a way where failure doesn't
matter and there's no consequences to

978
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:50,240
their actions. Yeah.
So absolutely true. Um,

979
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,020
not to beat a dead horse on this subject.

980
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,200
I had some notes in here around this from
the book trying too hard to follow the

981
01:01:59,961 --> 01:02:04,370
book while solving battlefield situations
makes one fairly predictable even to

982
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:05,870
enemies who haven't read the book.

983
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,030
These don't you have to make some
changes and back to the book,

984
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,030
these don't have to be drastically
different from what's in the book.

985
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,220
Often it's enough just
to very amount of speed,

986
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:20,430
stealth or deception with which
the standard method is executed.

987
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,920
Standardizing what subordinates
practice in peace time may make those

988
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:27,780
subordinates easier to control,

989
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:32,820
but does not help them learn
the alternative alternative
techniques needed to

990
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:36,900
develop momentum and battle. So that
actually supports your last statement.

991
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,970
Is it standardizing?

992
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:42,000
Standardizing what subordinates
practice in peace time may make those

993
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:44,220
subordinates easier to control.

994
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,060
So if you're trying to control someone
by beating them down and saying,

995
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:48,451
you failed,

996
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:50,910
you need to do it this way and this is
the only way you're going to get more

997
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:51,690
control over them,

998
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,740
but you're going to not allow them to
operate in the real world where they have

999
01:02:55,741 --> 01:03:00,060
to think of new ideas and take out. I
think you'd have to free their mind. Yeah,

1000
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:04,170
and in a way you might,
I would hypothesize,

1001
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:07,880
you might not even get the best out of
them really. I believe you are correct.

1002
01:03:07,881 --> 01:03:12,720
We could get that, that rigid standard
of, of output. And that's Kinda it. And,

1003
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,780
and going to a quote from
the book supporting your
hypothesis from Colonel Merit

1004
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,090
a Edson,

1005
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:26,660
he goes on about how you need to fight
the Japanese and he closes with encourage

1006
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,210
your individuals and bring them out,

1007
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,300
which is just a beautiful statement.

1008
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:40,580
Now this is, this is kind of to
close out this section here. Um,

1009
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:45,560
we are talking about,
and this,

1010
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:47,240
this definitely applies to life.

1011
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:53,320
Human beings are always
trying to structure the chaos
of battle and that may be

1012
01:03:55,601 --> 01:03:56,950
the root of the problem.

1013
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,933
Okay.

1014
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,520
Human Beings,
human beings want to have structure.

1015
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:09,150
They want things to be orderly and
combat is not orderly nor his life,

1016
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:14,750
nor our relationships, nor
our business deals. Yup.

1017
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:17,500
Nor is the chain of command,

1018
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:22,650
nor our personalities and
Egos and everything that we
try and do to control this

1019
01:04:23,921 --> 01:04:24,754
chaos.

1020
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:30,870
The idea that we can control it is false.

1021
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:36,550
Yeah. What you have to do is
you have to deal with it, right?

1022
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:39,730
You have to let that thing
squirm underneath you.

1023
01:04:39,731 --> 01:04:43,540
You have to let it move and see where
its weaknesses are and grab hold of what

1024
01:04:43,541 --> 01:04:47,500
you can and let go of what you can't. Kind
of like. Um, you know the physio balls?

1025
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,290
Yeah. They're kind of,
they're not rigid or nothing.

1026
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:53,140
Why are we talking about when I'm training
with someone that's bigger than me?

1027
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,960
You know, you get on top of,
you can't hold them down.

1028
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,240
You have to let them move
underneath you. Yeah. Yeah.

1029
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,340
And that's what this reminds me of.
Yeah.

1030
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,070
I'll add this to your list of
things that aren't controllable.

1031
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:08,110
Um,
all of the existence this way,

1032
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:10,750
like you think of a
leaf or a U. Dot. K Con.

1033
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:15,460
Consider something that's control.
That's why we invent rulers.

1034
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:18,010
That's why we invent thermometers.
You

1035
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,510
know, temperature is so
dynamic. I can walk right five
feet away. The temperature,

1036
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:25,540
when you really come down
to the temperature's going
to be different. There's no

1037
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:30,690
set controlled anything.
Everything is so ambiguous and slippery.

1038
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:34,250
And we were saying everything,
everything, all of existence does. But,

1039
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,380
but like how you said people
try to control. That's kind.

1040
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,580
I think that's in our nature though.

1041
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:43,730
That's what you smell with rulers and
mile markers and it is and it can drive

1042
01:05:43,951 --> 01:05:46,740
you crazy. If you try and
control the chaos of combat,

1043
01:05:46,741 --> 01:05:48,180
you're going to get destroyed.

1044
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:50,730
And if you try and control
everything in your life,

1045
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:53,300
things that are not controllable
than you're going to destroy it.

1046
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:57,720
If you try and control the relationship
and aspects of relationship that are not

1047
01:05:57,721 --> 01:05:59,640
controllable, you know
what? You control them.

1048
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:03,540
The relationship you control you yourself
in a real ambiguous way, by the way,

1049
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:06,980
because you're always adapting.
Ideally from an ideal standpoint,

1050
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:09,820
you're always adapting as well.
So yes, like this kind of Lens,

1051
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:13,610
you know what control you try and control
the relationship by controlling the

1052
01:06:13,611 --> 01:06:15,350
other person when reality,

1053
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:19,820
you need to control yourself
because most people don't do that.

1054
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:24,860
[inaudible] most people don't exercise
the beauty of mind control that they can

1055
01:06:24,951 --> 01:06:28,160
control your mind.
You can think what you want to think.

1056
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,790
You can put those thoughts into your head.
You can eliminate the bad ones.

1057
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:36,080
You can bring forth the good
ones with mind control. Yeah.

1058
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,590
And I almost want to close on that because
that's such a good thing to remember,

1059
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:47,210
but I will follow it up with this.

1060
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:52,211
It says complex instructions are at
best premature during what is usually an

1061
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:54,950
inaccurate assessment of the situation.

1062
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,820
So when you're looking at something and
you're going, okay, here's the plan,

1063
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:03,110
here's what we're going to do at
best that's premature and inaccurate,

1064
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:04,430
what your plan is.

1065
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:07,910
So when you're trying to figure out what
you're gonna do with that business deal

1066
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,900
and you're trying to create this very
detailed plan around it, at best,

1067
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:12,950
it's premature and inaccurate.

1068
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,800
At best. It's premature and
accurate. So don't get locked around.

1069
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:22,630
You're gonna make these
plans are going to be rigid.

1070
01:07:22,631 --> 01:07:26,020
And here's the way we're going to do
it. At best, it's premature to accurate.

1071
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,810
So think about what you can
control and what you can't

1072
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:35,030
and move forward from there.
A good example of recognizing,

1073
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:40,260
or a good way to recognize if you're not
practicing these types of thoughts are,

1074
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,633
you know,

1075
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:48,910
ways of looking at things is when you
make a plan and the plan and it doesn't go

1076
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:52,160
according to plan.
And you get mad about it,

1077
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:56,760
your [inaudible] and your red
flag, red flag right there.
That is a red flag. Yeah.

1078
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:01,400
And, and when your relationship isn't
going the way you want it to be,

1079
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,990
it's because you should be a newsflash
that you can't control this other human

1080
01:08:05,991 --> 01:08:08,960
being. Yeah. You can only
control you. So don't,

1081
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:12,680
and this goes back to what we talked about
on the last show when we talked about,

1082
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:16,520
you know, your family, your close friends

1083
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:19,850
and you know,
we kinda got to the point where

1084
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,610
I think I was saying, hey,
you can't worry about them.

1085
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,960
Then you said the same thing.

1086
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:30,460
And I think this is a little bit more
clarity on that point is you cannot

1087
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,970
control them, right. So you
need to grab what you can,

1088
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:38,360
you know, keep it in, keep it
as under control as you can,

1089
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:41,570
but you're not going to get the
solid control that you went.

1090
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,030
Thank you that you desire.
Yeah.

1091
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,130
It's kind of like if you have this big
like trashcan lid and then you have this

1092
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:50,390
blob of mercury,

1093
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,920
you're trying to keep it in the center
but don't try to like squeeze it with

1094
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:57,920
your hand if something cause it's going
to come out of your fingers, you know?

1095
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,903
Yeah.
And,

1096
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:04,090
and that what if your co host of a show
comes up with examples like a trashcan

1097
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:09,710
lid and mercury. You can't control
that. All you can do is listen,

1098
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,250
nod your head and say good point.

1099
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,650
It's more of a is an analogy, you
know, it's like this comparison of,

1100
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,870
you know, using metaphors
check. So moving on,

1101
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:28,100
moving on to some questions that
we've got from Twitter, from Facebook,

1102
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,030
got some really good questions.
And as a matter of fact,

1103
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:35,750
these are a continuation of questions
I didn't even ask this time because we

1104
01:09:35,751 --> 01:09:39,530
didn't get through many of them from
the last time I asked for input.

1105
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,520
So these are a continuation,
which means I apologize once again,

1106
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:48,440
I don't have the names collected of
who gave these questions. So my fault,

1107
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:51,830
I apologize if you,
if we answer your question,

1108
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:55,910
we appreciate you giving us the
question so that we could answer it.

1109
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,090
First one,
let's get down to it.

1110
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,080
So in regards to Jujitsu,

1111
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:09,140
this is kind of a common question,
but your input, GI or no GI,

1112
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:13,520
do you train both?
It's that job.

1113
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:19,010
The answer is ghee and Nogi.
I definitely train both.

1114
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,360
I like to train both.

1115
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,390
I don't care which one they're both fond
of me and just as we've been talking

1116
01:10:26,841 --> 01:10:30,320
about a lot tonight through the book,

1117
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,210
the last hundred yards,

1118
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,320
I want my training to be
different and surprising and

1119
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:39,620
be uncontrollable.

1120
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:44,770
And when you change it definitely affects
you when you change from g and then

1121
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:47,690
all of a sudden you take off your game
and you're sliding all over the place,

1122
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,030
you have to be a better grappler
to be able to deal with that.

1123
01:10:50,031 --> 01:10:53,090
So I want to be a better grappler.
So I do that. And you know there's,

1124
01:10:53,091 --> 01:10:55,970
there's something else that's in between
gay Nogi and that's when you put MMA

1125
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:56,690
gloves on,

1126
01:10:56,690 --> 01:11:01,310
you put MMA gloves on and it is somewhere
in between g and Nogi because you can

1127
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:02,990
get legitimate risk control.

1128
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:06,770
It's hard to sneak in a choke on
somebody when they're wearing gloves.

1129
01:11:06,771 --> 01:11:10,160
So there's, there's benefits to
them all. And I try and do them all.

1130
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:12,710
Yeah.
What

1131
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:19,050
do you find any benefit to doing
one and or the other? You know,

1132
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:22,350
like if you treat it in the g there's
certain benefits and training with a G.

1133
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,260
I think if,
if he trained with a g you,

1134
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:28,680
your defense has to be better
because there's more friction.

1135
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:33,390
And so if you're going to
escape an arm lock with the on,

1136
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,370
you have to do it very well.

1137
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,940
If you're going to escape
a knee lock with the g on,

1138
01:11:39,941 --> 01:11:42,120
there's a lot of friction.
It's a lot harder to get out to.

1139
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:44,670
Your defense has to be better with Nogi,

1140
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:48,390
your office has to be better because
there are no handles to grab.

1141
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:52,960
It's slippery that people can slide out
of the exact opposite reasons. So you,

1142
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:56,610
you, I think you improve your
offense more. And I will say this,

1143
01:11:56,611 --> 01:12:01,611
my game is compatible with both where I
don't do a lot of crazy lapel weaving in

1144
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:09,780
between your legs then up over your back
and then back over your right arm pit

1145
01:12:09,781 --> 01:12:12,900
and around your neck. I don't do a
lot of that. I don't disagree with it.

1146
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,130
I think it's fine.
But I like to most of the moves that I do,

1147
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:22,680
um, are compatible with both or there's
very small differences between the way I

1148
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:27,540
have the games set up. Yeah. At the end,

1149
01:12:27,541 --> 01:12:32,130
Dean originally told me that same
thing where when you train in the Gi,

1150
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:37,700
your defense starts to develop a little
bit more cause you got to like arm lock,

1151
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,020
you're in the arm lock, you can't just
spaz out of an arm lock. It's easy.

1152
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:47,250
And even more important actually is not
the just the submission but across side

1153
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,820
or amounts.
What's as a cross side on you with a Gian,

1154
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:53,760
they've got those candles and it's
very difficult to control risk control,

1155
01:12:53,761 --> 01:12:56,370
all that stuff. And it's
easier to hold them down. Yeah.

1156
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,270
So if you train Nogi and you're
trying to hold some down Nogi,

1157
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,710
it actually takes more technique to hold
somebody down with no GI than it does

1158
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:08,760
with Ge. Even though sometimes I hear
people say that g is more technical rep,

1159
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:09,840
I don't actually agree with that.

1160
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,310
I think they're both technical
in their own aspect. Yeah. So,

1161
01:13:12,311 --> 01:13:16,350
and even in holding someone down, that's
more of an offensive move. Yes. Right.

1162
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:19,470
So if you're being held
down with the ghee,

1163
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:24,240
you got to understand that concept in
those techniques to get out or whether it

1164
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:26,190
be being held down or
submission or whatever.

1165
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:28,560
You have to understand those concepts
and when you understand the concepts,

1166
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:32,880
then you can be successful as
opposed to like a Nogi situation.

1167
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:36,570
You don't necessary, I mean, you
should understand the concept for sure,

1168
01:13:36,571 --> 01:13:39,810
but you don't necessarily certainly have
to because you could just spazz out of

1169
01:13:39,811 --> 01:13:42,150
it or like an arm lock.
You can, if you're sweaty,

1170
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,270
you get spazz out of an arm
lock. We little technique,
you know, if you're strong,

1171
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,260
um, with the gets going to be
way harder to do that. So you'll,

1172
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:51,330
you'll kind of in a way learn more and
flip flop when you go on offense to

1173
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:54,780
defense. The same kind of thing
with the Nogi offensive stuff.

1174
01:13:54,781 --> 01:13:58,530
You got to understand where you
got to control his shoulder,

1175
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,060
otherwise he's gonna, you know,
have enough room to slide it up.

1176
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,980
So you have to have that perfect control
to execute a good submission if the

1177
01:14:04,981 --> 01:14:09,960
guy's good. So, um, and I
think, you know, with life,

1178
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,190
what I do in life is I try and
put myself in tough situations.

1179
01:14:15,191 --> 01:14:18,490
So I'm practicing them to him, he used
to them and you know, that's what,

1180
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,970
that's what the physical
aspect of life is to do.

1181
01:14:23,971 --> 01:14:25,030
In order to improve,

1182
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,330
you gotta challenge yourself and put
yourself in the worst scenarios and go and

1183
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,710
try and get through them.
You know,

1184
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:33,850
whether that's a weight room with a
squat rack or whether that's a run or

1185
01:14:33,851 --> 01:14:38,530
whether that's a swim or whatever
that physical challenges you want to,

1186
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:43,740
you want to make it as difficult as
possible or putting yourself out there or

1187
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:44,950
putting yourself out there.

1188
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:49,780
As I have challenged myself to be
outside my comfort zone into the world of

1189
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:53,380
humans. Multimedia. Yes.

1190
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:55,163
They say,

1191
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:00,380
well I've heard that public speaking
is the number one fear of people.

1192
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:06,690
I have heard that as well. Yeah. And,
and I, it's hard for me to relate to.

1193
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:10,050
I have no, I do, I'm not afraid of
getting up and talking in front of people.

1194
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,220
Like he, like he doesn't,
I don't understand that.

1195
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:17,580
I don't understand what that
must feel like. You know?

1196
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:20,910
So you understand why though I,
it's really hard for me to understand.

1197
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:25,410
It's hard for you to relate,
right. Well, cause man, it's,

1198
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,250
do you get nervous talking in front
of people? Yeah, yeah. To a degree.

1199
01:15:29,251 --> 01:15:34,050
I mean obviously it depends
on the mood, depends on the
people, right. But yeah. Uh,

1200
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,390
yeah I think I'm really no different than,

1201
01:15:36,391 --> 01:15:40,770
than most people in that regard for sure.
But yeah, there's a reason for that.

1202
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,770
I think it's because it's,

1203
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,580
it's almost like this subconscious feeling
that everyone's judging every little

1204
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:51,990
thing that comes out of your mouth, every
little thing that you do movement wise,

1205
01:15:51,991 --> 01:15:52,201
you know,

1206
01:15:52,201 --> 01:15:57,201
so your whole being is being judged by
all kinds of different people with all

1207
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,070
the different standards.
Yeah.

1208
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,510
And when you care about that or when
you've paid the price for that baby,

1209
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:06,960
I think, cause we, you know, when you get
raised, I think he paid a price for that.

1210
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:09,570
If you say the wrong thing, if
you do the wrong thing. Yeah.

1211
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,310
And I think that in a way ridiculed or
you know, whatever, whatever you put,

1212
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:16,720
however that looks for you,
you've paid the price for um,

1213
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,120
growing up or [inaudible]
on a large scale. Yeah.

1214
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:23,420
And that's exactly what you got.
You're in a,

1215
01:16:23,421 --> 01:16:25,380
in a situation where
that's all kind of coming.

1216
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,520
You're coming into your brain where you,

1217
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,960
you fear that price that
you're going to pay.

1218
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:34,320
And it's times a thousand because
there's a thousand people there.

1219
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,250
And I think it's kind of subconscious
all you're left with consciously is this

1220
01:16:38,251 --> 01:16:39,600
just anxiety.

1221
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:46,160
That's how we feel for
your mind. Deco. No,

1222
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:50,390
you've got to put yourself in those bad
situations. Yes to, you know, put your,

1223
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:55,610
if you're gonna public speak or if you're
afraid of public speaking book a small

1224
01:16:55,831 --> 01:16:59,280
thing or I don't know, do do something
like put yourself in that situation.

1225
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:04,050
And if you don't want
to go from zero to 10,

1226
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,410
do a small one, you know, do something
like with low consequences, know,

1227
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:10,310
are less impactful

1228
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,790
consequences and just
start small and go up.

1229
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,380
That's probably what you did.

1230
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:23,340
So next question.
Next question.

1231
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:29,700
Um, so okay. Micromanagers how
do you deal with micro managers?

1232
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,733
Okay.

1233
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,260
So you worked for me and you were super
squared away then I was a great boss and

1234
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:37,494
totally left you alone.

1235
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:41,880
If you worked for me and
you are not squared away,

1236
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,860
I was a complete micromanager.
So that's a little indicator.

1237
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:50,790
Now I have worked from
micromanagers before. Everyone does.

1238
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:54,510
You run into them in the world.
And the way,

1239
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,370
the best way I've figured to
get out from under the, the,

1240
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:00,293
the,

1241
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:06,050
the draconian thumb of the micromanager
is to try and gain their trust.

1242
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:11,850
And what you want to do is
you want to be ahead of them.

1243
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,580
You want to,
and actually this is something that I,

1244
01:18:14,910 --> 01:18:16,080
when I was on the Tim Ferriss program,

1245
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:20,520
I talked about how when I told my dad I
was joining the military and I was just

1246
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:22,950
rebellious kind of crazy kid and he said,
oh,

1247
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:25,830
you're going to hate it because you
hate authority. And I did it anyways.

1248
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:31,020
And when I got in I was like,
Damn,

1249
01:18:31,021 --> 01:18:33,720
my dad was right. I do hate authority.
I don't like listening to people.

1250
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,280
And now I have to listen
to them all the time.

1251
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,270
And then I realized very quickly when
I was doing my first seal platoon,

1252
01:18:39,271 --> 01:18:41,490
I didn't want anyone
to tell me what to do.

1253
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:47,370
And I was in charge of the radio as
I was a radioman. And what I did,

1254
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,370
what I did was, you know, if
the radios had to be ready,

1255
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,470
I knew they had to be ready.
I just got them ready.

1256
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:53,490
I got them ready ahead of a time.

1257
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:56,040
I did everything before
anyone could tell me to do it.

1258
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,650
I would come into work to be ready
before anyone could tell me what to do.

1259
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:03,740
So I basically was completely
psychotically proactive
and just was ahead of the

1260
01:19:05,131 --> 01:19:08,880
power curve on every little thing that
I could be ahead of the power curve on.

1261
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,840
And eventually it didn't take long.
The people that micromanaged me,

1262
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,940
all of a sudden we're like, Hey, I'm not
going to bother with this guy anymore.

1263
01:19:14,941 --> 01:19:16,830
He's already done it. Cause every
time they say, Hey, do you have,

1264
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,300
it's already done. Mm. Hey,

1265
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:19,920
did you start preparing their
already did them this morning.

1266
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:23,010
And eventually they say, okay,
this guy knows what he's doing.

1267
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,730
And what you're trying to do is build
up the trust. Cause that's what it is.

1268
01:19:26,731 --> 01:19:27,870
It's a little,
it's a little,

1269
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:31,950
a lack of trust that people have that
things are going to go the way and they've

1270
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:34,050
probably learned that somewhere.
So don't hold it against him,

1271
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:39,320
but it's your job to create a relationship
with them of trust where they stop

1272
01:19:43,201 --> 01:19:48,201
micromanaging you and move on to somebody
else that needs to be micromanaged

1273
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,253
next.

1274
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:58,860
Okay. So what about family and uh,
and people who are close to you,

1275
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:02,670
are they all the same? And if
not, how do you deal with it?

1276
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:05,820
So this is the,

1277
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:12,560
the trials and tribulations of the Alpha
personality and you're always trying to

1278
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,790
go hard and go fast
and make things happen.

1279
01:20:17,791 --> 01:20:21,420
And how do you deal with this as someone
that asking this and whoever you are,

1280
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:22,590
thank you for asking this question.

1281
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:23,943
Okay.

1282
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,390
People are people like me. Are they same?
And if not, how do I deal with it? Well,

1283
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:35,010
first of all, no, there's
not too many people like me.
And, and as a matter of fact,

1284
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:37,710
there's not too many people like you
echo and people that are listening this,

1285
01:20:37,711 --> 01:20:39,540
there's not too many
people like you either.

1286
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:44,690
People are unique and I'm not trying to
make people like me or make them do the

1287
01:20:47,731 --> 01:20:52,530
things that I do. I'm, I'm
over that phase. You know,
I've talked about this before.

1288
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:57,531
Like there was a time where I would try
and convince people about things and I

1289
01:20:57,781 --> 01:21:01,800
don't try and do any more, I'll discuss
them, but I'm not here to win an argument.

1290
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:04,470
Um,
I'm not that concerned about you.

1291
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,750
I'm not that concerned about
what you think. I'll again, if,

1292
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:11,700
if you're someone that I'm friends with
and I'm trying to help Ya, I'm concerned,

1293
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:15,450
but I'm not trying to
change people's minds. Um,

1294
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,620
but it's interesting because what I'm
really trying to do is I'm trying to

1295
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:21,030
appreciate people's perspectives.

1296
01:21:21,060 --> 01:21:25,230
I'm trying to learn from other people.

1297
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:27,390
And I thought this was
actually speaking of Twitter.

1298
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:32,790
I'm on Twitter the other day.
I posted a,

1299
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:38,850
a little paragraph and it's by
a gay guy named Mark Rippetoe,

1300
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:42,690
who's a coach. He's written, you
know, probably one of the best,

1301
01:21:44,060 --> 01:21:47,130
one of the best books about
weightlifting that you can get.

1302
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:51,840
It's called starting strength, basic
barbell training, mark Rippetoe.

1303
01:21:52,380 --> 01:21:57,380
But the opening of it is freaking awesome
and I brought it with me so I could

1304
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:02,670
read it to you. Uh, so
here's, here's this,

1305
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,300
this opening to this
book about weightlifting.

1306
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:13,460
Physical strength is the
most important thing in life.

1307
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:17,420
This is true whether we
want it to be or not.

1308
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,450
As humanity has developed
throughout history,

1309
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:24,080
physical strength has become less
critical to our daily existence,

1310
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,690
but no less important to our lives.

1311
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:32,560
Our strength more than any other thing
we possess still determines the quality

1312
01:22:32,871 --> 01:22:35,900
and the quantity of our
time here in these bodies.

1313
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:40,760
Whereas previously our physical strength
determined how much food we ate and how

1314
01:22:40,761 --> 01:22:42,470
warm and dry we stayed.

1315
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:46,640
It now merely determines how well we
function in these new surroundings.

1316
01:22:46,641 --> 01:22:50,600
We have crafted for ourselves
as our culture has accumulated,

1317
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,690
but we are still animals.

1318
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:57,740
Our physical existence
is in the final analysis,

1319
01:22:57,800 --> 01:23:00,470
the only one that actually matters.

1320
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:05,920
A weak man is not as happy as the
same man would be if you were strong.

1321
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:11,410
This reality is offensive to some people
who would like the intellectual or

1322
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:13,540
spiritual to take precedence.

1323
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:19,260
It is instructive to see what happens
to these very people as their squat

1324
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:20,860
strength goes up.

1325
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:26,170
Now that's freaking epic,
right?

1326
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:31,260
That is an epic call out to the
passion that coach Rupp until has.

1327
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:37,270
Right? That's just awesome. So I put that
on Twitter. I was fired up, you know,

1328
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:41,080
and cause somebody mentioned starting
strength and I said, yeah, of course,

1329
01:23:41,081 --> 01:23:44,560
you know,
this is a classic and a,

1330
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:49,390
some somebody on Twitter,
um,

1331
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:54,040
wrote back and it said,

1332
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:58,390
I disagree.
I will avoid reading things like this.

1333
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,560
And I wrote back in again, I'm not
trying to argue with anybody. Um,

1334
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:10,300
I just wrote back, hey, when I don't
agree with people on a subject,

1335
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:15,040
I don't avoid it. I just try
and learn from it. And, and
the fact of the matter is,

1336
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,510
even though I think what coach road is
awesome, I actually don't agree with it.

1337
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:22,450
I don't think that strength is
the most important thing in life.

1338
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:24,370
I think knowledge is more powerful.

1339
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:29,371
I think respect and loyalty and
honor and treating people well.

1340
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,810
I think all those things are
more important than strength.

1341
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:37,650
And there's been people
that were incredibly weak
in the world that have done

1342
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:43,030
amazing things and we're powerful leaders
and we're incredible human beings.

1343
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,340
So I don't actually,
you know,

1344
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,880
believe that strength is literally
the most important thing.

1345
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:50,630
Yeah.

1346
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:54,440
Now, that being said,
um, if you are smart,

1347
01:24:54,441 --> 01:24:58,040
if you are an intellectual than you
realize that you should use that knowledge

1348
01:24:58,041 --> 01:25:01,460
to be strong so you can not be physically
bullied so you can be healthy so you

1349
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:03,260
can protect yourself.
So you can be self reliant.

1350
01:25:03,261 --> 01:25:07,970
I mean there's no doubt that strength is
a, is a powerful force. But like I said,

1351
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,730
there's many other things that I
think are more important now. But,

1352
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:17,740
but what I like about it is that
hearing this opinion broadens my mind.

1353
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:19,820
It makes me smarter.

1354
01:25:19,821 --> 01:25:24,380
It makes me understand how important
strength is to some people.

1355
01:25:24,381 --> 01:25:27,320
And maybe that it should be more
important in my head. Because honestly,

1356
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,810
when I read that for the first time
years ago, I was like, Oh, you know what?

1357
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:30,673
That's awesome.

1358
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,390
And I should always keep somewhere in my
mind that being strong is important and

1359
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:38,090
being strong is good.
And you know,

1360
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:42,920
in this day and age people actually, I
think, believe that being strong is bad.

1361
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:48,230
As crazy as that might sound, there's
nothing wrong with being strong. You know,

1362
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:52,160
being strong is good. Nevermind nothing
wrong. It's a good thing to be strong.

1363
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,510
I wish I was stronger.

1364
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,330
I try and get stronger and I'm
not a naturally strong person.

1365
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,410
I'm just kind of an average
person that works out a lot.

1366
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:06,470
So
my point there is a number number one,

1367
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,020
when you get people that are
different than you don't try.

1368
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:11,660
I don't try and change them.
I try and keep an open mind.

1369
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,980
I try and learn from them.

1370
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:14,760
Okay,

1371
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,710
I'm trying,
and I talked about this earlier tonight,

1372
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:20,790
people have strengths and people have
weaknesses and if people have strengths,

1373
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:24,060
I'm going to try and learn from
their strengths and some people are,

1374
01:26:24,061 --> 01:26:27,330
I have more weaknesses and I
try and learn from them as well.

1375
01:26:27,331 --> 01:26:28,980
You get someone that's an addict,

1376
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:34,820
you get someone that's of a social
path or you get someone that's a,

1377
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,450
you know, a, a real giver
or someone that helps them.

1378
01:26:39,451 --> 01:26:44,010
There's people that one thing that I
don't feel like I help people enough.

1379
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:49,440
Um, and so I always look at people
that are very helpful and I say, okay,

1380
01:26:49,441 --> 01:26:52,620
what can I do? What can I take away
from their perspective? But you know,

1381
01:26:52,621 --> 01:26:55,440
if I meet someone that's an addict,
I learned from them.

1382
01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:00,260
They teach me very important lessons,
people that are winners,

1383
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:02,480
people that are losers.
I'm going to learn from both of them.

1384
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:07,810
Now back to the original question
of how do you deal with it,

1385
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:11,090
eight, because I'm, I'm,

1386
01:27:11,210 --> 01:27:16,210
I'm inferring from the question that
this person that asked it gets frustrated

1387
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:22,340
that others are not living up
to their expectations. Now,

1388
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:26,450
this is going to sound bad
when I say this initially

1389
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:29,463
is that

1390
01:27:30,260 --> 01:27:34,280
I actually have relatively,
or I shouldn't say I have,

1391
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:39,370
I keep relatively low
expectations of humans.

1392
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,750
Meaning when I meet someone,
I don't expect to get a lot out of them.

1393
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:50,810
I expect to be let down. I expect
people, as I talked about the other day,

1394
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:54,950
people are crazy and,
and I expect that.

1395
01:27:54,951 --> 01:27:57,440
I expect people to do irrational things.

1396
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:00,650
So that's kind of my baseline.

1397
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:06,680
And then what's beautiful about
it is I'm surprised and happy and

1398
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:08,373
in

1399
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:14,190
sh t pleasantly surprised
when people are supportive,

1400
01:28:14,191 --> 01:28:17,160
when people are reliable, when people
are good people, when they make sense,

1401
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,120
when they're not crazy.

1402
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:24,120
And so I think setting the right level
of expectations is important to keep

1403
01:28:24,121 --> 01:28:27,600
yourself from going crazy,

1404
01:28:27,601 --> 01:28:32,250
trying to change people.
The other thing I like about this attitude

1405
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:34,203
is

1406
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,890
I'm not sitting there blaming
on other people around me.

1407
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,860
I'm not blaming whether it's my family,
whether it's my team,

1408
01:28:40,861 --> 01:28:42,480
whether it's my people I work with.

1409
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,610
I'm not blaming them for being unmotivated
or blaming them for not trying hard

1410
01:28:47,611 --> 01:28:49,530
or blaming them for whatever.

1411
01:28:49,531 --> 01:28:54,030
I'm just taking responsibility for
what's happening in my, for me,

1412
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,950
I'm taking responsibility.
If they're not motivated,

1413
01:28:55,951 --> 01:28:57,490
I need to try and motivate
me if I care about them,

1414
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:02,190
if they're dragging

1415
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:05,340
me down, whose fault is
that? That's not their fault.

1416
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:06,570
I'm letting them drag me down.

1417
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:10,740
So I'm taking responsibility
of my interactions with
people to make sure I move

1418
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:13,260
it in the right direction.
And as a leader,

1419
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,590
it's my job to get the most out of people.
I mean,

1420
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:18,300
I always talked about
that you're going to have,

1421
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,310
your whole team is not going to be studs.

1422
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,570
You're going to have people on your team
that are weak and it's your job to get

1423
01:29:24,571 --> 01:29:25,740
what you can out of that person.

1424
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:29,460
Take advantage of whatever
strengths they might have,

1425
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,740
cover for the weaknesses where you can,

1426
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,810
that's what you're doing as
a leader and you're leading,

1427
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:41,880
whether that's leading in business or
your team or your group of friends or

1428
01:29:41,881 --> 01:29:42,714
whatever.

1429
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,780
You're taking a leadership position
and you're getting what you can out of

1430
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:50,160
people.
And that's how I deal with

1431
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,810
people that are close to me
that are not the same as me.

1432
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:58,800
Don't want to hang around with a bunch
Booyah I don't mind hanging around people

1433
01:29:58,801 --> 01:30:01,920
that are like me.
Seal teams is pretty,

1434
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:05,550
the seal teams has a lot of
people with the similar, you know,

1435
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:09,270
they're like got some similar
personalities in there,

1436
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:13,630
which is always fun
too. Yeah, for sure. Um,

1437
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:18,750
are there, so you say you
have, um, low expectations.

1438
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:22,950
Is there, isn't that sound
bad? I apologize to people
of the world right now. Yeah.

1439
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:26,460
That when I look at you, I
have low expectations and
don't think of it that way.

1440
01:30:26,461 --> 01:30:28,710
Yeah.
I'm seeing in my own mind,

1441
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:33,990
I'm just setting low expectations because
don't expect a lot, you know? Yes.

1442
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:37,620
That's,
I expect shittiness you expect,

1443
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:42,690
you just don't expect, I just thought,
yes. Yeah. So if someone's making this,

1444
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:43,950
you know,
tall claim,

1445
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:49,410
you don't expect that claim
to be fulfilled 100% or you
know, or whatever I sent,

1446
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:53,540
I set low expectations and I look to be
pleasantly surprised by those people in

1447
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:57,360
the world. The people that are listening
to this podcast, you all out there,

1448
01:30:57,361 --> 01:31:02,330
you're going to, you know, fire
me up, you know? Um, but, but,

1449
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:06,900
but really that's, you know, most
people that you meet you can't rely on.

1450
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,530
Right.

1451
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:11,640
And that's why it's important to find
people that are likeminded and link arms

1452
01:31:11,641 --> 01:31:13,710
with them and go forward into the fray.
Yeah.

1453
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:18,090
And it's not like people
are unreliable specifically.

1454
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:22,470
It's just that if you set your own
specific expectations on people because

1455
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:24,930
everyone's different, you're
different. Like are you saying,

1456
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:29,490
so if you set your specific expectations,

1457
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:32,250
which I think most of us do
that in one way or another,

1458
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:36,240
we expect certain things all the way down
to the language. We use. Some people,

1459
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:40,740
you know, some people don't like if they
are called boss, you know, you're like,

1460
01:31:40,741 --> 01:31:43,680
hey boss, it's a bus
someday. I'm gonna be honest.

1461
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,120
I don't really like that when
someone calls me boss, you know,

1462
01:31:46,121 --> 01:31:48,240
if you don't know your name, you
know, hey bro, same thing boss.

1463
01:31:48,630 --> 01:31:51,870
But they meant it in a good way,
you know? But I expect, yeah,

1464
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:56,120
I expect you never to use that word when
you address me kind of thing. Got It.

1465
01:31:56,130 --> 01:32:00,650
It's not that serious. But
anyway, that's just a small guy.

1466
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,070
So if you start setting
your own expectations,

1467
01:32:05,071 --> 01:32:09,370
your specific own
expectations, consciously and
subconsciously, yeah, you, you,

1468
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:12,520
you'll probably get let down. Guess what,
whose fault is that? It's your fault.

1469
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:15,730
And you know, it's a good,
good time to this is,

1470
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:20,820
and I run in this with business leaders
where they know they're super over

1471
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:24,400
achievers and they expect that level
of performance out of everyone.

1472
01:32:24,401 --> 01:32:26,770
And they're not going to get it. And the
way I explain it to them, I say, listen,

1473
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:31,900
I understand what you want to have happen.
But just because as a leader,

1474
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:36,190
the lead, the platoon commander is
able to carry a hundred pound rucksack,

1475
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:37,930
10 kilometers into the target,

1476
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:41,380
hit the target and walk back
out another 10 kilometers.

1477
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,320
Doesn't mean that everybody
else in the platoon can do it.

1478
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:47,080
And therefore he cannot plan that mission.
Right.

1479
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:51,330
And I would usually get Fruto him on that
because they do realize that there are

1480
01:32:51,331 --> 01:32:54,610
high performers and that they're over
achievers and that they're not going to

1481
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:58,180
get. So how are you going to set
the expectations so that you're,

1482
01:32:58,510 --> 01:33:01,960
you've got people that can act actually
achieve the expectations you've set for

1483
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:05,500
them. So that's right on point, boss.

1484
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:12,760
Sorry. Yes, I did get men and set
those look kind of low expectations.

1485
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:15,890
I know that sounds about them, be them,
but let them be there. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1486
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,120
And that way when you get less,
if you get let down,

1487
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,730
actually you probably have a
less chance of getting let down.

1488
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:29,650
So it's essentially you're minimizing
the downside, maximizing the upside.

1489
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:32,650
That's a pause. Your relationship,
very positive way of putting it. Yes,

1490
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,513
you are correct.

1491
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:37,810
Thank you for making me give him a
positive spin to my negative attitude.

1492
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:41,260
Yeah, I think I understand
what you mean. I think so

1493
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,650
part of it is denial by the way,

1494
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:50,460
because I don't want in every admit or
think that you had low expectations of me

1495
01:33:51,431 --> 01:33:52,540
and my functionality.

1496
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:57,313
MMM.

1497
01:33:57,620 --> 01:34:02,420
Okay. We'll go next question.
Uh, okay. What are the top three,

1498
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:05,870
the top three to 10 business
problems you're asked to solve?

1499
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,353
Good question.

1500
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:13,450
Interesting question because why would
you say top three to 10 who wrote that?

1501
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,810
That's crazy. You know, you'd say
three or four or three to five maybe,

1502
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,930
but three to 10 on, no, this is
actually should be top three. We'll,

1503
01:34:20,931 --> 01:34:24,050
we'll go for it. That being
said, here's the problem.

1504
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:28,100
Here's the problem that we come up against
in life and I deal with on a regular

1505
01:34:28,101 --> 01:34:33,101
basis is we get called in due to either
a lack of execution or desire to improve

1506
01:34:35,481 --> 01:34:37,670
execution.
And this is the same thing we dealt with,

1507
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:39,290
with working with leadership
in the seal teams.

1508
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:43,910
You get teams that are not
executing correctly. That's,

1509
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,980
that's the problem that
we come in to solve.

1510
01:34:46,130 --> 01:34:49,640
Now that execution could be production,
that execution could be sales,

1511
01:34:49,641 --> 01:34:51,800
that execution could be manufacturing,

1512
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:55,070
it could be anything that execution.

1513
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:57,523
So

1514
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:02,420
that's what we always get asked to solve.
That being said,

1515
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,130
why is there a problem and
execution and the problems,

1516
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:09,680
these are where you get like the,
okay,

1517
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,460
five to seven kind of common problems
that we deal with. We address,

1518
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,310
we address most of, most
of them, uh, own fact,

1519
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:20,120
we address all the major ones in the book.
There's a few nuanced ones,

1520
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:23,990
but uh, you know, the, generally
the issues are like, oh,

1521
01:35:23,991 --> 01:35:25,340
you can't get people to buy in.

1522
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:29,730
We always hear that our folks aren't
buying in buying into the plan,

1523
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:33,450
the philosophy, your
strategy, whatever. Uh, do,

1524
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,290
people don't understand what's happening.
They don't,

1525
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,720
they don't understand the vision.
And we'd go back and we say, okay,

1526
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:42,770
do they understand the why or are they,
is, how was the vision being communicated?

1527
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,800
How is the vision being translated
up and down the chain of command?

1528
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,800
Because you go down from the CEO who has
a vision and the way he would speak to

1529
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:56,171
that vision is a lot different
than the way a front line,

1530
01:35:56,330 --> 01:36:00,260
you know, equipment operator is going
to want to understand that vision.

1531
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:06,580
So is the strategy simple
and understandable through
the chain of command that

1532
01:36:07,071 --> 01:36:09,740
can cause a lack of execution?
Are there silos?

1533
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:13,370
Are there different elements within the
company that are not helping each other

1534
01:36:13,371 --> 01:36:16,370
and supporting each other
with a good cover and move?

1535
01:36:17,930 --> 01:36:20,360
Is there micromanagement going on?
We were talking about micromanagement.

1536
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:23,600
Micromanagement can cause
legitimate problems of execution.

1537
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:27,830
Is there unclear guidance
that can cause problems?

1538
01:36:27,831 --> 01:36:31,910
Is there ego interfering that can cause
problem is their ego driving process

1539
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:36,770
instead of
the best methodology driving process.

1540
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:38,390
Sometimes it's ego driving process.

1541
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:43,450
So it's all these and there's just these
problems and there we've seen them all.

1542
01:36:44,870 --> 01:36:49,040
I don't think I've seen a new problem yet
in quite some time where I've said, oh,

1543
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:51,650
I've never seen this before and we,
we,

1544
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:54,410
and there are always these
problems of execution.

1545
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,910
Are leadership problems and we've seen
the same thing in some way in the seal

1546
01:36:58,911 --> 01:37:01,700
teams. So I think that's
why we've been successful.

1547
01:37:01,701 --> 01:37:06,701
It's a company going in and getting people
to execute better because we've seen

1548
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:12,770
it, we know how to fix it, and that's
what we do when. All right. Um,

1549
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:14,150
next question is

1550
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:21,440
how do you handle a buff that doesn't
know as much as you and they don't

1551
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:24,320
understand what you do,
but they're bossy

1552
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:31,280
but they bossy. Okay, so this
is actually a normal situation.

1553
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:32,930
This is not abnormal.

1554
01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:38,260
Bosses often don't know as
much as the frontline troops.

1555
01:37:38,391 --> 01:37:39,290
I can tell you right now,

1556
01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:44,740
I was the boss of 35 or 40 seals when
I was a task and you commander and I

1557
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:51,290
didn't know as much as
they knew about their jobs.

1558
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:53,450
I didn't know what the
snipers knew about sniping.

1559
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:56,820
I didn't know everything that the
radio about knew about the radios.

1560
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,810
I didn't know like Lafe Lafe was
working with the Iraqis every,

1561
01:38:00,811 --> 01:38:03,840
I didn't know about his Iraqi
soldiers and what they were like.

1562
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:06,570
I couldn't pretend to know that stuff,

1563
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:12,330
but I was actually secure in that fact.
I was okay with that.

1564
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,730
And that's what I recognized,

1565
01:38:14,731 --> 01:38:18,150
that that wasn't my job
and I was okay with it.

1566
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:22,650
So the question is how do you
deal with someone like that? Well,

1567
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:27,680
let's first recognize the fact that
they are insecure in their job.

1568
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:33,330
So the reason I was able to like let my
guys run stuff just cause I was secure

1569
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:35,880
with myself as a leader.
And then my position,

1570
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,020
when you're dealing with
someone that's still bossy,

1571
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:45,360
they're trying to impose
upon you how to do things.

1572
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:51,350
And that is because the
root of that is likely,

1573
01:38:52,081 --> 01:38:54,120
I don't want to call it
out as a hundred percent,

1574
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:57,190
but the root of that
is likely in security.

1575
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:01,080
He's insecure about his authority,
insecurity about his leadership,

1576
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:04,140
insecure about his position.

1577
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:09,510
So when you want to deal with it,
how do you deal with it?

1578
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:15,770
Your job becomes in this situation to
make your boss feel secure in their

1579
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:22,290
position. That's what your goal
becomes. That means an end. Yes.

1580
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,860
You know what that means? It
means nodding your head. And,

1581
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:28,410
and giving them credit where
they might not deserve it

1582
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:33,660
and inflating their ego,
or not inflating,

1583
01:39:33,661 --> 01:39:37,740
but massaging their ego a little bit.
And you know what that means?

1584
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,380
The hardest part of that isn't massage.
And there you go.

1585
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,450
The hardest part of is
checking your own ego.

1586
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,520
The hardest part of that is saying is,

1587
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:49,350
is you want to prove to them
that you know more than they do,

1588
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:53,640
and that just bubbles up and over and it
will ruin your relationship and it will

1589
01:39:53,641 --> 01:39:54,520
ruin the,

1590
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:57,240
the job that you're trying to do of make
them feel secure because you're like,

1591
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,840
hey boss, actually you're wrong.
It's this. Well, your ego feels good,

1592
01:40:00,841 --> 01:40:04,010
but guess what? You just hurt his
ego. Now is what they're going to do.

1593
01:40:04,090 --> 01:40:06,450
They're going to try and
pose more will upon you.

1594
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:11,040
So you've actually gone backwards.
You win the battle, you lose the war.

1595
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:15,930
So what you need to do is
make that boss feel secure,

1596
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:20,610
massage their ego.
Don't try and prove that you know more.

1597
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,670
Try and prove that you're
there to support and help.

1598
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:29,660
And in the long run that will be
the beneficial way to improve that

1599
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:34,410
relationship. Let them recognize or
let them feel secure with what they at,

1600
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,740
where they're at and
then they won't impose,

1601
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:42,741
try and impose their will on you as
the boss man yet that I'm going to add,

1602
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:47,640
uh, let you kind of what you were
saying I think last time. Um,

1603
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,390
it's a small, tiny side note but I think
it's really important when you try,

1604
01:40:51,450 --> 01:40:54,040
when you're doing that,
when you're or, or making

1605
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,740
them feel more secure as a boss.
Um,

1606
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,580
be sure to come off
genuine and consistent.

1607
01:41:00,850 --> 01:41:03,460
Remember how we were talking about that?
Because a lot of people they'll be like,

1608
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:04,300
okay,
that's what I'm going to do.

1609
01:41:04,301 --> 01:41:07,030
And then they overtly want to show
that that's what they're doing,

1610
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,420
whether it be to other people because
you know, maybe they got scolded or,

1611
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:13,870
or whatever in front of other people
and then so they overtly do it and it

1612
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:15,910
doesn't come off as genuine
than it's counterproductive.

1613
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,000
Yes. This is called, well, this is
what I used to call in the seal teams,

1614
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:23,740
classic over correction and
classical over correction. You know,

1615
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:26,320
we'd see guys go too far in one direction
because we're always talking about the

1616
01:41:26,321 --> 01:41:30,840
dichotomy of leadership. And I'd
say to a guy, oh, you're doing, uh,

1617
01:41:30,970 --> 01:41:35,110
you're doing too much. You're not
doing enough decentralized command.

1618
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:38,140
And they do classic overcorrection and
they would lose control of everything.

1619
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:39,220
Or they,

1620
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,980
if we told them everyone was too wild
and they didn't have control of anything,

1621
01:41:41,981 --> 01:41:45,280
they'd go into level nine micromanagement,
you know,

1622
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:47,590
and just lock everyone down.
So yeah,

1623
01:41:47,591 --> 01:41:49,690
you don't want to do a classic
overcorrection. You want to,

1624
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,400
you want to moderate and modulate your
efforts to make the person feel secure,

1625
01:41:54,460 --> 01:41:57,460
no doubt about it.
Can you apply

1626
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:02,930
extreme ownership at mid level
management versus the C suite level?

1627
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:08,050
Well, this is, this is
absolutely true. Um,

1628
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:11,470
can you apply extreme ownership or the,
the,

1629
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,620
the leadership principles that we
talk about in extreme ownership,

1630
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:19,621
can you apply them at mid level management
versus the executive level of the C

1631
01:42:20,221 --> 01:42:23,680
suite folks? And the answer's
absolutely yes. And not only that,

1632
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:26,410
but extreme ownership applies
through the entire chain of command.

1633
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,800
The principles are meant for everyone
inside the chain of command because as we

1634
01:42:32,021 --> 01:42:36,790
talk about all the time, the leadership
just doesn't mean the actual,

1635
01:42:37,390 --> 01:42:39,430
um,
designated leaders.

1636
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,670
Every person on a team
needs to be a leader.

1637
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,350
And while that may sound Cliche,
it is actually true.

1638
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:52,040
So
he,

1639
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:55,620
not only that, but the, the
senior executives at a company,

1640
01:42:55,650 --> 01:43:00,060
the CEO that they work for, somebody,
they, whether they work for a board,

1641
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:03,300
uh, whether it's, you know,
Steve jobs in charge of apple,

1642
01:43:03,301 --> 01:43:07,290
guess what he's reporting to shareholders.
So everyone has some kind of boss.

1643
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:11,340
Everyone's working for
somebody and everybody needs
to use these principles all

1644
01:43:11,341 --> 01:43:12,690
the way up and down the chain of command.

1645
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:17,720
The principles of leadership don't change
no matter where you are in the chain

1646
01:43:17,881 --> 01:43:21,870
of command or what situation you're in.
And that's why, you know, we're getting,

1647
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:26,080
we get called in to help every level of
the chain of command from the frontline

1648
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:30,030
troops, from literally from the frontline
troops, the the equipment operators,

1649
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:34,320
the operators in the field,
the salespeople on the front lines.

1650
01:43:34,321 --> 01:43:37,920
We work with them all the way
up to the CSUITE and above.

1651
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:39,610
Yeah.

1652
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:43,270
Just like how you're thinking applies
to everybody and in every situation it's

1653
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:45,820
up. It's absolutely true. Like in life,

1654
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:51,450
in a relationship with your husband
or wife and in the relationship

1655
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,290
with your kids. Same exact thing. Yeah.

1656
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:58,990
Like if you're taking responsibility
for everything you did wrong and right.

1657
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,390
Right. I would imagine you
take responsibility for
the right things he did,

1658
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:04,040
but if you're taking responsibility,

1659
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:07,730
I think that's when you can
eventually function the way that,

1660
01:44:07,731 --> 01:44:10,460
that you hope that you'll be able
to function. You are correct.

1661
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:11,450
Just to be clear though,

1662
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:14,480
when you do do something right and
you are in a leadership position,

1663
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,660
you actually don't take
responsibility for it. You push that,

1664
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:23,060
you push that praise of
accomplishment to the team. Aw,

1665
01:44:23,061 --> 01:44:28,010
yeah, yeah, yeah. You never want to
absorb that. That's advanced, Bro.

1666
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:30,170
That's actually white belt material.

1667
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:37,940
Last question I think. Um,
how do you deal with setbacks,

1668
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:40,130
failures,
delays,

1669
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:43,340
defeat or other disasters?

1670
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,490
How do I deal with
setbacks, failures, delays,

1671
01:44:49,491 --> 01:44:54,260
defeat or other disasters?
I actually have a

1672
01:44:56,930 --> 01:45:01,930
fairly simple way of dealing with these
situations and is actually one word to

1673
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:09,890
deal with all those situations.
And that is good.

1674
01:45:12,190 --> 01:45:16,700
And this is actually something
that one of my direct subordinates,

1675
01:45:16,701 --> 01:45:20,060
one of my guys that worked for me
pointed out to me and he would,

1676
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,630
he would call me up or pull me
aside with some major problems,

1677
01:45:23,631 --> 01:45:26,360
some issue that was going on and he'd say,

1678
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:29,420
possibly got this and that and the other
thing. And I look at him and I'd say,

1679
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:30,643
good.

1680
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:35,510
And finally one day he was telling me
about some issue that he was having some

1681
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:40,460
problem and he said, I already know
what you're going to say. And I said,

1682
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:45,440
well, what am I going to say? You said
you're going to say good. He said,

1683
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:49,550
that's what you always say when
something is wrong in going bad.

1684
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:54,560
You always just look at me and
say, good. And I said, well yeah,

1685
01:45:55,070 --> 01:45:55,490
and,

1686
01:45:55,490 --> 01:46:00,490
and I mean it and that is how I
feel when things are going bad,

1687
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:07,790
there's going to be some good
that's going to come from it and oh,

1688
01:46:07,791 --> 01:46:12,470
mission got canceled. Good. We can
focus, focus on another one. Um,

1689
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,180
didn't get the new high speed gear. We
wanted. Good. We can keep it simple.

1690
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:23,780
Didn't get promoted good.
More time to get better.

1691
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:29,960
Didn't get funded good.
We own more of the company.

1692
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:33,080
Didn't get the job you wanted.
Good.

1693
01:46:34,250 --> 01:46:37,800
You can get more experience and
build a better resume. Got Injured.

1694
01:46:37,801 --> 01:46:41,480
I got injured. Sprained my ankle. Good.

1695
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:47,420
I needed a break from training.
Got tapped out.

1696
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:51,300
Good. It's better to tap and training
than a tap out on the street.

1697
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:56,310
Got Beat. Good. You learned

1698
01:46:58,410 --> 01:47:01,050
unexpected problems.
Good.

1699
01:47:02,070 --> 01:47:05,430
We have the opportunity
to figure out a solution.

1700
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:11,310
That's it. That's it.
When things are going bad,

1701
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,760
don't get all bummed out. Don't get
startled. Don't get frustrated. No,

1702
01:47:18,810 --> 01:47:21,420
you just look at the
issue and you say good.

1703
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:29,240
And I don't mean to say something that's
all cliche and I don't mean to sound

1704
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:33,380
like Mr. Positive. Find a positive,
but do that. Focus on the good.

1705
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:40,030
Take that issue, take that problem
and make it something good.

1706
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:44,890
It'll bring that attitude to
your team too. You go forward.

1707
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,130
And lastly,
like to close this out,

1708
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:56,580
if you can say the word good,

1709
01:47:58,050 --> 01:48:01,440
guess what it means you're still alive.

1710
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:05,460
It means you're still breathing.
And if you're still breathing,

1711
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:11,370
well the now you still got
some fight left in you.

1712
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:17,190
So get up, dust off, reload,

1713
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:22,050
recalibrate,
reengage,

1714
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,380
and go out on the attack.

1715
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,490
And that right there is
about as good as it gets.

1716
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:41,340
That's all I got for today.
So everyone that's been listening,

1717
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,860
thank you for your patience.
Thanks for listening.

1718
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:49,550
Thanks for spreading the word and most
of all to everyone listening to the Jocko

1719
01:48:50,311 --> 01:48:54,500
podcast.
Thank you for getting after it.
