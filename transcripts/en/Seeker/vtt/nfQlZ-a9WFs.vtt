00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.920
So, here’s me with a 65cm tube down my nose
draining my stomach fluids.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.920
Not awesome.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.940
Long story short, I got in a car crash, had
stomach surgery, and now scar tissue in my

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.240
abdomen means I have to pay attention to my
bowels a lot more than the average person.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.900
But, a lifetime of having doctors inspecting
my digestive tract has taught me just how

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.270
important it is to take half a second and
check the toilet after you poo.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.270
You should do it.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.250
It’s weird, but trust me, it’s fascinating.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.730
On average, good stool from a healthy body
should come once a day and be brown, smelly,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.730
and smooth.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.950
But you might not be average, so important
to know what YOUR normal is!

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.430
And you can’t know what that is without
taking a peep at your poop.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.050
This is a real chart doctor’s developed
the classify stool.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.879
You want to be somewhere in this range, an
indication you’re eating enough fiber and

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.670
you’re properly hydrated.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.030
Getting on this end of the spectrum, you’re
likely constipated, and on this end, you might

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.410
be eating more fat than your liver and gallbladder
can process.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.930
Basically, you want your stool to mimic the
shape of a healthy intestine.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.179
Beyond shape, what your poo does in the toilet
is also important.

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.500
You generally want sinkers, not floaters.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.500
*pause*

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.329
Floaters might be a sign you’re eating too
much fat or that there’s a lot of gas in

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.329
your gut.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.319
Poop tends to have high fat content because
your body isn’t absorbing nutrients properly,

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.969
or it could mean that you have a lot of gas
building up in your gut and need to eat differently.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.539
Colour is important, too.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.439
Poo is brown because of bile, a product of
the liver that’s vital for digestion, but

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.369
it can be other colours.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.249
Green might mean you have a fast digestive
system and eat a lot of leafy vegetables,

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:37.020
and red *could* mean you had beets not too
long ago, but could also be an indicator of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.119
blood from a tear in the colon.

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.299
If it’s red and you haven’t eaten a bit
of nature’s candy -- talk to your doctor.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.259
Stool can also come in black; if you’re
seeing a lot of that, it’s also time to

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.459
go to the doctor.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.819
Same with light poos; it could be symptomatic
of a block in bile flow or liver disease.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.530
But again, know your normal, because an irregular
poo from time to time is fine.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.399
It’s really the long-term changes you need
to worry about.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.469
There’s a super simple test you can do to
figure out your own system.

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.139
Add corn to any meal and log the time you
eat it.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.989
Then all you have to do is wait.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.540
Your body can’t digest the fibrous outer
shell of the corn kernels, so you’ll see

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.540
them!

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.680
Don’t freak out, just make a note of the
time!

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.680
That’s how long it takes your body to digest
and make waste!

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.030
Doing two or three rounds of this mini-experiment
would get you an average time it takes for

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.780
your body to digest a meal.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.920
At that point you’ll be able to match any
irregular stool to the food that maybe doesn’t

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
totally agree with you.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
Because don’t we all just want to feel great
in our bodies all the time?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.189
So after all this, talking about stool is
still kinda taboo, so if you’re looking

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.020
for a more palatable dinner topic, check out
this video about the family tree astronomers

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.849
have made for the stars in our galaxy.

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.849
So.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.849
Honesty time.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.170
Do you pay attention to your digestion?

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.439
