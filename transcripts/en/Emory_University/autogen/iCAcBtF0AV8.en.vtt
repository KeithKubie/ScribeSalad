00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.160
one thing that is coming up through the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170
one thing that is coming up through the
 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.350
one thing that is coming up through the
office of university and community

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360
office of university and community
 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.869
office of university and community
partnerships is that office is

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879
partnerships is that office is
 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.170
partnerships is that office is
developing a matching database site so

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180
developing a matching database site so
 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.210
developing a matching database site so
if we know that there is a community

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220
if we know that there is a community
 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.220
if we know that there is a community
partner that has a project that needs to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230
partner that has a project that needs to
 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.500
partner that has a project that needs to
be done or if their faculty members or

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510
be done or if their faculty members or
 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.120
be done or if their faculty members or
graduate students that are working on

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130
graduate students that are working on
 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.400
graduate students that are working on
projects we want to get all of them in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410
projects we want to get all of them in
 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.499
projects we want to get all of them in
the database so for example if you have

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509
the database so for example if you have
 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.299
the database so for example if you have
a project you can look in the database

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
a project you can look in the database
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.250
a project you can look in the database
and find out who else is working on it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260
and find out who else is working on it
 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740
and find out who else is working on it
for example we know that diabetes is a

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750
for example we know that diabetes is a
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.770
for example we know that diabetes is a
big issue and so we know that working on

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780
big issue and so we know that working on
 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.709
big issue and so we know that working on
food issues is important delivery

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
food issues is important delivery
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.720
food issues is important delivery
systems people having the money to be
