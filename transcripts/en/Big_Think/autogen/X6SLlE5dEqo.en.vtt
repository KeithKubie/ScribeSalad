00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.420
When you are in a position of leadership in
a kitchen or even if you are not being patient

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.380
it’s something that is very important.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.950
If you are a beginner in the kitchen and you
have to learn craftsmanship you have to be

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.960
patient, because you’re not born with knife
skills.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.270
You’re not born knowing how to roast a chicken
or cook carrots.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.760
It’s something that you want to learn, and
it’s going to be very repetitive, and you

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.590
cannot get frustrated.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.079
You have to be very patient.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.719
If you are in a position of leadership in
a kitchen you have to be very patient as well,

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.500
because you are basically teaching the team
to accomplish your vision.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.090
And if you are not patient they are going
to be potentially scared of you and therefore

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.880
someone who’s shaking like that will not
be doing a better job than someone who’s

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.940
confident.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.100
Then maybe if you may create frustration in
them you may create many negative thoughts

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.100
in your team.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.570
So patience in the kitchen it’s something
that is very important of course.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:33.020
When I was young my mother remarried and my
stepfather Hugo – in the book his name is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.960
Hugo because his real name is something else.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:48.270
But Hugo is very mean to me as a young kid
and he bullies me when my mother is not around.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:58.270
The way he does it it’s obviously very vicious
and when I come back home from my day in school

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.620
he’s testing me and he’s trying to make
me angry and to make me fight with him.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.690
And, of course, he’s an adult and he’s
much stronger than I am.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.690
And then I was trying to keep my cool and
I was trying to not ignore him but to rationalize

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.760
a little bit.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760
Maybe he was jealous.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.840
Maybe something was wrong.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.620
And suddenly I would explode and I would scream
at him or I would break things that he likes

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.120
or we would fight.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.760
And as soon as I would do that I was the loser
and he was the winner because that’s what

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.760
he wanted.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.590
He wanted to basically destabilize the young
kid that I was.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:58.349
Many times I had the pleasure to win the fights
but fighting is already losing so what I learned

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:07.790
about responding to people who try to bully
is that soon as you respond they got you.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.120
They got what they wanted.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.380
You’re the bad person.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:21.629
I believe that violence will attract violence
and a compassionate approach will have more

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.250
chances to get in return some compassionate
answer.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.459
And if you are talking about world leaders—although
I believe the world is very complicated and

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:46.260
it’s not my expertise, I’m a chef—But
I think that using wisdom will definitely

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.830
be much better than enticing violence.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:04:04.170
By responding with armies and worse to terrorist
attacks creates a system of no end in violence.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.379
So I am a strong believer of nonviolence,
and I think it’s good that I am in a kitchen

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.150
and not at the White House.
