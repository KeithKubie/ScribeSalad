1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,770
You know what I should do? Listen to
what do you think? I listened to you.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,790
Jealous of the classic jazz and classical
of course. Of course. Yeah. We'll,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,480
you're so interesting.
I was,

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:13,320
I was a concert level violinist until
I was until I was like 17 years old

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,460
practice. Yeah. I mean,

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,580
the only expensive object that I own
other than my house is his violin.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,260
Oh really? Yeah. Is it a of area? It
is not. It is. It is a up. It's not,

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,420
that's all I know. That's a, yeah,

9
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:27,770
they're the two that people may know
or strat and, and like ordinary. Um,

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,850
but those, those ones are like
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

11
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,270
This is in the tens of
thousands of dollars to various
is hundreds of thousands

12
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:36,790
of [inaudible]. The Guy who we knew, my
family knew hit $1 million Stradivarius.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,410
Oh yeah. Now it was so big about
it was the big deal. Well, I mean,

14
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:43,110
aside from the historic
value of the thing, they're
not making any more of them.

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,440
Um, it does play very
differently, very differently.

16
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,620
Like I had a crappy violin for most of
my are like really until the last two

17
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:49,861
years.

18
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,980
I had a violin that was handed down
from my grandfather that was worth maybe

19
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:56,910
1300 bucks and it was a piece of crap.
I mean, it was not a good violin.

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,043
If you're good enough,

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,700
then you can tell the difference between
a really great violin to play and one

22
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:06,720
that is a piece of garbage. And I was
good enough to do that. So that's, yeah,

23
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,150
I mean I was, I was a
classical guy. I played,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,050
I played violin for years and
my dad was, uh, growing up,

25
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:15,510
my dad was a pianist looking
at what Jamie just pulled up

26
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,540
the most expensive violin.

27
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:22,541
The world sold for an
estimated $16 million.

28
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,050
Yep.
For Australia.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
I never lose value. I mean,
really they don't. And this is,

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,330
this is a good investment. The person,
I know this guy who was offered a,

31
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,290
he's offered a strategy, I think
it was $250,000 maybe 10 years ago.

32
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:38,320
And he's like, no, that it's
worth like $3 million today. God,

33
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,610
no.
What is the deal?

34
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:43,600
Like what if you had to explain what's
the difference between the sound that

35
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,434
this makes sense?

36
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,180
I mean, it has to do with the
acoustics of the instrument.

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,510
Any of the wood quality.
There's,

38
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,980
there's slight variations
in the construction of the
instrument is certain parts

39
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:55,160
of that are thicker or
thinner. Um, and it is also,

40
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,180
it's easier to play a better violin,
so it almost covers for your mistakes.

41
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:02,480
When you play a, a bad violin, it
tends to scratch and screech more.

42
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,240
That's why when you get in the
upper register with a violin,

43
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:06,080
you hit very high notes.

44
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:08,960
It can either be very screechy or it
can be very beautiful. Some of that,

45
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,750
a lot of, most of that's the
player. Some of that's the violin,

46
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,600
like Yasha Heifetz who is widely
considered the greatest violinist to,

47
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,390
to ever live.
He had a Strad and

48
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,950
lady blunt Stradivarius caught
15 point $9 million these

49
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,810
and then they lend them out on, on loan
to, you know, world's great violinist. So,

50
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,590
but there's a, but in the end it really
is the, uh, the quality of the player.

51
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:34,430
There's a famous Yasha Heifetz story
where he was playing at Carnegie Hall and

52
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:37,880
some lady came up to him afterward and
she said, you know your violin and just,

53
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,250
it sounds so beautiful. And he picks
up the violin, puts it to his ear,

54
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,690
and he says, funny, I
don't hear it right now.

55
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,560
So do you listen to any other kind of
music? Yeah, I mean, I just, I like,

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,870
I like some classic rock. I
mean, see, rocking out. Yeah.

57
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,140
I went to a Doobie brothers
concert with my parents. No,
you did. Yeah. Really? Yeah.

58
00:02:56,141 --> 00:03:00,140
Yeah. That's, that's a band that was
main named after a joint. That is true.

59
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,810
That's how it went. Is accurate.
I know. Did you feel like,
uh, like a sinner? I was,

60
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,700
I was a rebel that day.

61
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,660
That was really gone to the Doobie
brothers concert with the other boomers.

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,390
So the.
