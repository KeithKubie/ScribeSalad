Speaker 2:          00:07          can you cheat your way into ketosis? The answer's yes and no. I've been asked a lot recently about different ketone supplements, exotic genus, ketones. All right. These are externally synthesize ketones that you can consume often in liquid form. Good way to remember exact genus XL like exoskeleton outside endogenous that would be ketones produced in the body. For instance, if you fast and then eat one meal per day for two or three days, like a salad with a little bit of steak in a bunch of oil and you walk a lot during that period of time, drinking water, chances are in two or three days, especially if you're a male, typically to drop in faster, you'll probably get 2.7 or higher millimolars of Beta hydroxybutyrate BHB as measured using a device called the precision xtra x Tra by Abbott Labs, which is what I use and I recommend people use something like that with blood as opposed to urinalysis with the Quito sticks, which as you get better at processing ketones in your body will give you a false negative.

Speaker 2:          01:11          It will say you're not in Contoso, but let's come back to the exhaust ketones. A lot of my friends have said, hey, have you seen this? Have you seen that? It seems like I could just consume this to get the benefits of Ketosis and while I'm consuming my normal diet and a, there is some evidence to suggest that you can derive certain benefits, say, uh, related to anti-inflammation or otherwise by consuming exaggerates ketones even in the presence of carbohydrates. However, and I'm not a doctor, don't play one on the Internet, but I suspect at least the more research should be done related to the longer term, say for a few weeks, consumption of exogenous ketones while you're eating a normal carbohydrate dependent diet when you're using still glucose as your primary fuel. The only place in nature as it relates to human physiology that I'm aware of where you observe both elevated glucose levels and elevated ketone levels is in a state called Quito acidosis, which is a dangerous state, uh, observed.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Typically I believe in type one diabetics. So if then we are mimicking that by consuming exaggerate as ketones on a regular basis. It's hard for me to see how that is beneficial and strikes me as somewhat epistemologically arrogant as [inaudible] might say. For us to believe with the limited data that we have that that is a good idea. I would prefer to be conservative and I am a conservative personally in that respect. It's often just ketones can be a fantastic tool for greasing the skids and helping with the transition from say a semi fasted or fasting state. Perhaps you're using intermittent fasting like I mentioned, to consume one or two small meals a day that are key to genic diet meals on root ticket ptosis. You can use the exoticness ketones to give you some fire power and actual cognitive ability in that normally very gray zone until you click in and get to say 0.7 1.2 1.5 millimoles, at which point you'll be off to the races. But otherwise I've decided for myself that I generally steer away from it. That doesn't mean that, for instance, if you have depressed glucose levels and you've just come off of a nice big sleep and you had an early dinner the night before, perhaps in those circumstances, if you're about to do exercise, say aerobic exercise, you could use ketones to enhance performance. But caveat emptor, I would say be careful, and as far as I'm concerned, it'd be conservative.
