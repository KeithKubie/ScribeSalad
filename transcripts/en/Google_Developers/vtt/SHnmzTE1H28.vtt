00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.390
So hello, everybody.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.630
I'm really excited to be
here and excited to see

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.770
so many people here.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.707
As a big tech policy
nerd, sometimes it's

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:10.040
difficult to find other people
who are really into this.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.430
And so I'm really excited
to meet all of you all

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.660
and hear more of what
you're interested in.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.300
So, as mentioned, my
name is Tim Hwang.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm part of the public
policy team here at Google.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.970
And in addition to kind of
sort of introducing what we do

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.680
and how we can help
you, this session's

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.650
going to be sort of a
whirlwind tour of sorts.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.310
We want to basically take you
through some of the issues

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.790
that we're thinking
about at Google

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.880
and what are the
issues in this 12 to 24

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.380
month period that
we think are going

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.961
to have the biggest impact
on developers going forward.

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.960
So specifically, we're
going to highlight issues

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.870
where it's going to have a
big impact on app development

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.580
and also on privacy
and security.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.530
And most importantly,
I talk to a lot

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.970
of devs who say, well, you
know, this is really exciting.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.970
But how do I get involved?

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.720
And so that's the
second part of the talk.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.740
We'll be kind of talking about
open opportunities, where

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.046
you can make a difference
on some of these issues.

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:01.420
So I think the
plan is that we're

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.045
going to keep it
pretty conversational.

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:04.540
So it'll be about
20, 30 minutes.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.307
We'll kind of go to Q&amp;A. And
I'm fully cognizant of the fact

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:09.140
that this is actually
the happy hour period.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.265
So I think we're going to
keep it relatively short,

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:14.150
and we may just all
host drinks afterwards,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.110
which I'm getting an OK
from that guy up there.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.554
So I think it's a good thing.

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:20.720
So let me go into first a
little bit of introduction

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.920
about myself.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.640
So I'm a developer by training,
but I've always kind of

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.710
been interested in the
intersection between technology

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.610
and the internet and
culture and society.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.604
So I'm the founder of a
conference called ROFLCon,

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:35.020
which I started a few years
back, which the whole idea was

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.670
to bring together people
who were momentarily famous

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.590
on the internet to talk
about the past, present,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.780
and future of internet culture.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.360
So past guests included Success
Kid, like the actual kid;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.670
the guy who designed Comic
Sans, who apologized;

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.600
and the dude from 4chan,
who did not apologize.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.630
And around 2010, I
got really interested

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.636
in the idea of automating
law and lawyers.

00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:01.760
I had a lot of friends who
were going to law school

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.715
at the time, and they were
getting out and telling me

00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:03.381
about their job.

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.560
And I was like, man, it be
so easy to write software

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.810
to try to automate that stuff.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.009
And so I had this dream
about doing this law firm

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.520
called Robot, Robot,
&amp; Hwang, which

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.240
would be a law firm that
was partially run by robots.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.600
I ended up being
diverged in that process

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.720
and started getting really
interested in the ways in which

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.455
law shapes technology,
how the rules get

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:26.830
made that shape the kind of
day-to-day of what developers

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.800
do, and what people experience
in their technology.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.269
So that kind of sent me
down this other path.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.810
So I ended up doing research at
this place called the Berkman

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.284
Center for Internet Society,
interning at this place called

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:39.450
the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, that many of you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.650
may be familiar with, if
you're here in this room,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.275
and working for
Creative Commons, which

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:47.080
is this experiment
around copyright.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.950
Nowadays I lead public policy
at Google on two major emerging

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:51.450
topics.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.158
So the first one is
machine intelligence.

00:02:53.158 --> 00:02:55.090
So that's very much
tied to the products

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.380
that we've been
working on around AI.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.380
So TensorFlow, which you
may be familiar with,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.410
is kind of our product around
open sourcing machine learning

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.500
tools.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.000
As well as the bigger
questions around AI--

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.240
what do we think that AI will
do to the future of work,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.040
or how do we guarantee that
AIs will be safe in the future

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.690
as we put more and more
things in their hands?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.210
Secondly, I also work on VR.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.910
That has a product
component as well.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.134
So I work on things
related to Cardboard,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.050
but I also think about
the bigger issue, which

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.383
is what does it mean that
society is going to experience

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:28.400
more and more media
through the venue of what

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.160
is virtual reality?

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.200
And so these are a set of
emerging fronts of activity.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.060
And so we're going
to focus today

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.760
on things that are going to
have more immediate impact.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.260
But to the extent that
you want to nerd out

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.720
about these issues, that you're
excited about these issues,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.303
definitely catch me
at the happy hour.

00:03:42.303 --> 00:03:44.146
I'm always happy to
talk about this stuff.

00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:45.270
So let's just jump into it.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.210
What is tech policy anyways?

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.890
Like I had this
conversation with my mom

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.960
the other day, where she
was like, oh, honey, you're

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.876
working at Google now.

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.250
You actually have a real job.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.700
And then she was like, so
what do you do exactly?

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.450
And I'm like, oh, I
work at public policy.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.204
And she was like, what does
that actually even mean?

00:04:01.204 --> 00:04:03.620
And we meet actually a lot of
developers who are like, OK,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.539
public policy, like I
have like the vaguest

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.580
sense of what that means.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.330
So just to set a little
bit of background,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.940
I would talk about what
we do and then how we

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.190
fit into this overall picture.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.040
And it's useful
because it also gives

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.399
some context to talking about
how we can help all of you.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.399
So when you say
public policy, it

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.000
can sound really
abstract, right?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.460
Sort of like a bunch of guys
sitting in a room with wigs

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.010
writing a bill.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.820
And it's for sure that these
guys haven't heard of left-pad.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.320
They haven't heard of GitHub,
mostly because it's 1776.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.590
But generally, that's one
image of what people have

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.447
when they think
about public policy.

00:04:36.447 --> 00:04:38.280
Another one is they
might kind of conjure up

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.830
visions of the "West Wing"
or "House of Cards," right?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.530
And I have to assure you that
my life is definitely not that.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.155
Like I was joking to Wilson the
other day that a lot of my work

00:04:47.155 --> 00:04:49.440
is just kind of shuffling
emails around, which

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.410
is not as sexy as all that.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.320
So in any case, I
think most people

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.760
think about public policy as
something kind of existing,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.160
particularly if you're a
dev, something really kind

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.130
of outside of the
world of technology.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.870
And that actually turns
out to be a big assumption.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.000
As someone who formerly
worked at a startup,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.909
I think the usual idea
is that you push code,

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.200
and then stuff just kind of
happens in a vacuum, right?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.820
Either the system
is on or off, right?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.720
That's one bit.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.220
And the other one is are more
users adopting the technology

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.860
that you built?

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.640
And those are the
only two factors

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.082
that you're really
worried about.

00:05:21.082 --> 00:05:22.790
And you don't really
think about the fact

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.280
that what you're
building is going

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.840
to get influenced by much larger
forces that are out there.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.220
So technology really doesn't
really think about policy

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.950
all that much.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.760
But the scary thing
in our world is

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.690
that certainly people in policy
are thinking about technology

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.220
all the time.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.340
So some of you might be
familiar with SOPA PIPA which

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.680
happened a few years back--
so the Stop Online Piracy

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.900
Act or the Protect IP Act,
which in a particular great kind

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.210
of DCism, Protect IP, the
"PROTECT" is also an acronym.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.610
So it's kind of this
fractal acronym.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.160
We deal with a lot of
that in our line of work.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.960
And that was so
important because it

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.480
would have fundamentally
shaped how content is allowed

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.590
to move around the web and
have a big impact on speech--

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.440
the kinds of content that
can make it out there.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.022
Or you might
remember the battles

00:06:08.022 --> 00:06:10.230
around net neutrality that
happened a few years back.

00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:14.640
And that's a particularly
important issue

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.710
because it actually
influences how people

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.930
can access content and
the kind of services

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:19.989
they have access to.

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:21.530
So what I'm trying
to say is actually

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.363
I think these public
policy discussions have

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.810
an impact on pretty much
every level of technology.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.960
If you're a developer,
it's the question

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.790
of what you can
build and launch.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.510
If you're a startup, it's a
question of what kind of users

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.060
you can access and
how you access them.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.190
And as a user, as a
consumer of technology,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.190
as someone who uses
phones and is really

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.220
excited about technology,
it's the question

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.960
of what you can and can't
do on those platforms.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.690
So that's the work
of public policy.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.170
There are rules, laws,
regulations popping up

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.750
all the time and ideas for those
things popping up all the time.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.280
And there's good
ideas, bad ideas,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.210
and pretty much
everything in between.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.460
And so our team
basically plays the role

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.840
of monitoring those
developments and figuring out

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.990
the bigger implications for
the ecosystem, of which Google

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.490
is a part.

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.490
Because, in many cases,
these decisions not only

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.980
impact the company, but
technology as a whole

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.947
or the internet
network as a whole.

00:07:12.947 --> 00:07:15.530
And then once we've done that,
we actually spend a lot of time

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.740
telling people about it.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.030
So that sometimes
involves lawmakers

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.100
who get in touch, saying,
so how does AI work?

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.480
And we go through the process
of explaining what that is.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.660
And that's not only
just with our products

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.266
but also new trends
as well-- what's

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:30.890
out there, what's happening, and
should I be concerned about it

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.930
or excited about it?

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.842
It also involves speaking to
particular groups as well.

00:07:35.842 --> 00:07:37.300
So one of the things
that I lead up

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.292
is specifically the
outreach to developers.

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.750
And we think that actually ends
up being really, really key

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.960
because they're, A, a critical
part of the ecosystem.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.620
Most of the exciting things
are happening in engineering,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.744
in startups, even outside
of the big companies.

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.410
Secondly, they're
super influential when

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:53.826
they do speak on these issues
because these are people who

00:07:53.826 --> 00:07:55.887
are directly with
the technology,

00:07:55.887 --> 00:07:58.470
understanding the problems that
you face on a day-to-day basis

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.771
and really have a sense of
what to be concerned about.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:02.270
And then finally,
there are actually

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.925
people that we want feedback
on some of the issues.

00:08:04.925 --> 00:08:06.300
In many cases,
Google is actually

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.920
trying to figure out what its
position should be itself.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.860
And so we've actually started
to do much more in terms

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.170
of trying to reach out to people
and say, what's your feedback?

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:13.640
What do you think?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.200
And what do you
think our positions

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.670
should be on the issues?

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.670
So it's a particularly
interesting constituency,

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.770
though, because
developers are this kind

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.970
of great influential
voice, but simultaneously,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.570
again, if you've done a startup
or you're a part of a company,

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:28.030
you actually have little
time to pay attention

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:28.780
to all this stuff.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.320
You're just busy trying to
make sure that things stay up

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.230
and operational.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.400
And so one of the overall sort
of strategies in this space

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.440
that we're thinking about is how
do we lower the costs to people

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.304
participating?

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:41.220
How do we lower the cost
to people finding out

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.590
what's going on,
because you can't always

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.600
be paying attention to the
latest bill in Congress.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.891
And often, it's in dense
legalese that doesn't actually

00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:49.100
make sense and get
connected to what you're

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.547
doing on a day-to-day basis.

00:08:51.547 --> 00:08:52.380
So what's that mean?

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.870
So I've kind of
rambled on at length

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.290
about this in a kind
of abstract way.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.560
So there's three things that
we're doing on this front

00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.880
that I'll shout out, right?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.670
So one of them is
sessions like these.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.090
We're going all
around the world.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.670
We did a session in Colombia.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.140
We have done a
session in London,

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.265
and we're doing a
session here at I/O,

00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:07.980
where we kind of
meet with developers

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.545
and talk about what we're
seeing both internationally

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:10.975
and in people's home country.

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:12.350
So that's the
first thing, right?

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.340
If you are traveling
from out of town

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.870
or you have particular issues
that you're interested in

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:18.644
and you would want
an expert from Google

00:09:18.644 --> 00:09:20.060
to come and talk
about this stuff,

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.530
this is something that we
can definitely help and do.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.571
The second one is actually
we're working to share

00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:25.880
our resources more widely.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.030
If you're in a country or you
have a question about an issue,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.760
it turns out there's
probably someone

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.690
within the company that's
actually looking and watching

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.960
at this stuff really closely.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.870
So we're hoping to be an open
resource for developers that

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.770
are out there to have
questions answered,

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:41.228
or actually get in touch with
people who are sort of policy

00:09:41.228 --> 00:09:42.730
experts on these issues.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:45.620
And then finally, we're kind
of experimenting or supporting

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.410
platforms for people to find
out more about public policy

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.360
and technology.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.547
So, as I mentioned at
the very beginning,

00:09:51.547 --> 00:09:53.880
as someone who's really excited
about this intersection,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.116
it's almost a kind
of nerdery that

00:09:56.116 --> 00:09:57.741
exists in the broader
world of nerdery,

00:09:57.741 --> 00:09:58.750
so it's sometimes
really difficult

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.190
to find people to hang out
and talk about these issues.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.720
And so one of things we've
been experimenting is with this

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.910
thing called /Policy.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.876
It's basically a Slack
instance-- really casual.

00:10:07.876 --> 00:10:10.000
A bunch of developers from
all around the world who

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.160
are interested in this stuff,
talking about this stuff.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.201
And we're kind of using
it as a way, potentially,

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:18.400
to get more information out in a
really casual, lightweight sort

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.510
of way.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.386
So let's jump to it.

00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:23.260
So I've talked a little
bit about what we do,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.420
how we're doing it, and
how we can help you all.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.340
So let's jump into
the actual issues.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.800
What is coming down the pipe for
the next like 12 to 24 months?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.530
And the world is really big.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.390
So I could talk to
you about the coming

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.880
battles around net
neutrality in Latin America.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.310
I could talk to you
about age-rating and app

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.270
politics in Korea.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.320
But there's two
that are top of mind

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.170
for us right now that
we think are going

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.910
to have the biggest impact.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.510
And specifically,
they're ones where

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.280
we think developers can make
a really big difference.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.840
So I think that's one of the
reasons we're presenting them

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.710
today.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.530
So the first one I'll
talk a little about

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.537
is the Internet of
Things, and what

00:10:57.537 --> 00:10:59.620
we're seeing in the evolving
world around security

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.090
and privacy.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.370
The second one is around
fragmentation on Android

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.926
and how fragmentation
on the platform

00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:07.300
is actually starting
to intersect

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.460
with laws and regulations.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:10.470
So we'll go into it.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.094
So the first one is
we've been thinking

00:11:12.094 --> 00:11:13.590
a lot about the
Internet of Things,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.540
and particularly
where things are

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.620
going to end up as this
technology becomes more

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.425
mature and evolved over time.

00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:20.050
And it's a particularly
important space

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.966
because we think that
developers have a chance

00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:24.670
to set norms for how people
think about these technologies

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.790
in a big way.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.800
So context setting first, right?

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.410
Let's face it.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.280
Internet of Things-- it's
a total buzzword, right?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.870
But really, all it
refers to is the idea

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.920
that everything big
and small is starting

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.050
to incorporate computers,
that everything

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.112
is becoming a computational
object in some kind.

00:11:42.112 --> 00:11:43.820
And so we actually
don't think the future

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.955
is going to be some
kind of weird universe

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:47.580
that is "Minority
Report" style and has

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.290
screens flying everywhere.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.850
This is an image that we
commissioned internally

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:53.557
to envision what the
Internet of Things

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:54.890
actually looks like in practice.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.764
And one of the immediate
things you'll notice

00:11:56.764 --> 00:11:58.120
is actually there's no screens.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.840
That we think that
actually in practice,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.060
devices will sort of be
seamlessly integrated

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.860
into everyday life,
in patterns and shapes

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.520
that we know and
are familiar with.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.400
So that buzzword,
Internet of Things,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.540
actually doesn't mean
a whole lot by itself.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.120
But what it refers
to is this ubiquity

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.412
of computation-- ubiquity of
devices all over the place.

00:12:18.412 --> 00:12:20.620
And so it raises all sorts
of really interesting kind

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.807
of new concerns.

00:12:23.807 --> 00:12:25.640
How should devices be
secured against people

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.790
with malicious intent, right?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:27.956
So I was traveling recently.

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.834
I saw a number of people
were like, oh, it's

00:12:29.834 --> 00:12:31.875
a bike lock that you open
with your phone, right?

00:12:31.875 --> 00:12:34.570
It feels like if the security
there isn't quite right,

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.630
that could be a real issue.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.970
How should devices be made
to protect user privacy?

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.180
Insofar as you have devices
that are collecting information,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.590
how do we give users the power
to control the information

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.140
that they are giving?

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.569
And then finally, how should
devices a signal that things

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:48.860
are going right or going wrong?

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.443
If the paradigm we
think in the future

00:12:50.443 --> 00:12:52.980
is not going to be screens,
then the really big question

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.824
is, what are the indicators,
user interfaces, all

00:12:55.824 --> 00:12:57.740
those practices that we
need to build in order

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.570
to keep people secure
and also people

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.195
assured about the
products that they're

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:03.750
building and interacting with?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.200
So with all this, I think
there is actually one approach,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:06.700
right?

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.520
And that approach is
pretty old-fashioned,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.936
which is to say,
let's use the law

00:13:09.936 --> 00:13:12.130
to shape the behavior
of people who make

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.920
and code these objects--
that is to say,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.529
many of the people in this room.

00:13:15.529 --> 00:13:17.320
And indeed, actually,
a lot of policymakers

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.130
are thinking about
questions in this space,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.760
and specifically how rules
should look like in this space.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.160
So if you're going to
launch an IoT product,

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.554
it has to incorporate
these A, B, C, D things.

00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:28.970
But this picture
actually, it just

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.892
isn't just about
lawmakers, right?

00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:32.850
One of the big things is
it's a situation where

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.410
people designing
these technologies

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:37.930
will have a really
big role to play.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.990
And the reason for that--
the intuition for that,

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.200
comes from this
guy, Larry Lessig,

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.290
that you might be familiar with.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.289
So you might remember him
from Creative Commons.

00:13:44.289 --> 00:13:47.070
If you've seen the CC logo
online, it comes from this guy.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.420
More recently, he made a
bid to run for president.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.500
But he's most known in
the technology policy

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.060
world for thinking about
the different forces that

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.820
can shape behavior.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.740
And what he says is,
OK, there's four forces

00:13:58.740 --> 00:13:59.948
you could think about, right?

00:13:59.948 --> 00:14:03.040
There's the force of law, like
what's written on the books.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.820
There's the force of norms,
what people agree to do

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.170
or what's general
practice in a space.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.910
There's the force
of markets, which

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.750
is like the incentives of
people building these products

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.660
and putting them
out into the world.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.910
And then finally, there's code.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:19.062
And in certain situations,
certain of these levers

00:14:19.062 --> 00:14:20.770
are going to be more
powerful than others

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.370
in shaping the
space, and we think

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.870
in the Internet
of Things, code's

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.740
going to be
particularly powerful.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.698
And the reason is because
the space is actually

00:14:27.698 --> 00:14:30.550
moving so fast and the standards
are being developed so quickly,

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:33.230
that what developers and
conventions and standards

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.920
developers land on will have
a really big role in shaping

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.490
the norms and laws
that eventually

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.280
emerge around the technology.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.125
So the way we think
about it, and the way

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:43.750
that we're starting
to kind of shape up

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.350
our positioning internally,
is that if ubiquity

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.200
is the challenge of
the Internet of Things,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.074
then trust is sort
of the solution.

00:14:50.074 --> 00:14:51.990
If we are interacting
in a space where there's

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.529
lots of devices that
look like the devices

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:57.070
we're familiar with, but don't
interact or behave in the ways

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.740
that we expect,
then a big thing is

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.120
how do we ensure that users
have trust in this space.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.560
And so if you think
about three principles

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.350
that should guide
what's happening.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.890
So one is interoperability,
the second one

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.910
is security and privacy,
and the final one

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.124
is the need for new interfaces.

00:15:13.124 --> 00:15:15.290
And there's kind of a product
dimension to all this,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.000
but there's also kind
of a policy dimension

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:17.680
to all of them as well.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.390
So on the product side,
you may have picked up

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.820
some of this going
around I/O, right?

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.540
Certainly around
interoperability last year

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.956
at I/O, we launched
a thing called

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:27.120
Weave, which is an open source
standard around communication

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.060
protocols for the
Internet of Things.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.724
The second one is
security and privacy.

00:15:30.724 --> 00:15:32.640
We've been porting a lot
of the best practices

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.325
that we have in doing stuff
like Gmail into the Internet

00:15:37.325 --> 00:15:38.470
of Things space.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.330
And then finally, the
new interfaces stuff,

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.788
like a lot of the work that
we're doing on voice interfaces

00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:45.070
is exactly tied
into this question.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.337
So this is something
that is still emerging,

00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:48.920
and it's actually
something that we're

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.322
looking for a lot of
developer feedback on.

00:15:51.322 --> 00:15:53.780
No one has all the answers,
particularly because this field

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.870
is still emerging.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.170
But people who are
closest to the technology

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.260
are going to have the most
practical experience to offer.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.580
And so we're hoping to
develop these practices

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.062
into some kind of document
or some kind of convention,

00:16:05.062 --> 00:16:06.770
certainly something
that we can take back

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:09.440
and say, well, OK, within
the field, the emerging

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.830
field of Internet
of Things, here

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.850
are the protocols
and standards that we

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.440
see emerging in the community
and throughout the community.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.962
So for what happens
next, I think,

00:16:17.962 --> 00:16:19.420
if you're interested
in this stuff,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.075
we're interested in hearing
from you about what you're

00:16:22.075 --> 00:16:23.450
encountering, the
troubles you're

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:25.033
encountering, and
the solutions you're

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:26.420
finding to get around them.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.190
Because when we get questions
from policymakers saying, hey,

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.440
well, we really want to maybe
think about a regulation

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.227
or rule in this
space, we ideally

00:16:33.227 --> 00:16:35.560
want to represent sort of the
interests of the community

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.710
as a whole, as an
ecosystem, as we push ahead.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.010
So that's the first one.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.801
And you may not work
on Internet of Things.

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.280
So that may be
somewhat relevant.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.030
This one I think is a
really big one and I think

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.571
will probably concern
a lot of people

00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:50.900
in the room, which is
about fragmentation.

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.650
Android and fragmentation
and specifically increasingly

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.310
how that's starting to intersect
with law and regulators

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.425
and policymakers.

00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:00.300
I want to talk a little
bit how this actually

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.560
impacts developers in a
really key way and then what

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.880
developers can do around it.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.109
So for this story,
it's worth going back

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.319
to Andy Rubin and the
early days of Android

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:14.869
and the ancient days of the
late 2000s space-- 2008.

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.710
At the time, the
idea was, how do you

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.530
design an open source
operating system that works

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:21.869
for everybody in the space?

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.069
If we're going to launch
an operating system,

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.369
how do we generate adoption?

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:25.785
How do we get
something that works

00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:28.790
for OEMs, people
designing the phones, app

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.700
developers, and then the
users themselves, right?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.810
And the idea was to
kind of create and focus

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.642
on open source as a solution.

00:17:36.642 --> 00:17:38.850
If you have an operating
system with common protocols

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.150
that anyone can pick up and
use, but also is flexible enough

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:44.870
for people to adapt
for their own purposes,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.164
it seems to be the best
way to generate adoption,

00:17:47.164 --> 00:17:49.080
because you can sort of
customize for whatever

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.080
particular purpose
that you want.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.420
And so to quote the
immortal words of Pokemon,

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.339
this was super effective.

00:17:58.339 --> 00:18:00.380
At last count, we have
some kind of amazing stats

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.379
about the state of the
Android ecosystem, right?

00:18:02.379 --> 00:18:05.120
There's more than 400 different
manufacturers, more than 1.4

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.570
billion Android
devices worldwide,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.420
and then more than
$14 billion paid out

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.620
to developers, app
developers, over time.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.890
And so this is really great.

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.890
So it turns out that the
solution of open source

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.590
was an amazing way
to gain and generate

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.200
adoption in the marketplace.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.550
So this is great.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.880
Problem solved, right?

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.270
Well, this is the
problem, right?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.900
As the ecosystem has
gotten bigger and bigger--

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.816
and I actually don't
need to tell anyone this,

00:18:27.816 --> 00:18:30.240
who develops for Android
in the space, right?

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.890
The ecosystem is also kind
of increasingly fragmented

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:33.530
over time.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.370
So this is a visualization from
a company called Open Signal.

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.730
And it shows basically all
the device fragmentation

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:39.300
in the space.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.070
And, again, like
Protect IP, it's

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.900
almost a fractal level
of fragmentation.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.250
Like you could zoom in, and
there would be fragmentation

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.170
in the fragmentation.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.000
That's how fragmented it is.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.520
So in short, openness
was the big strength

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.600
and the big success for
the Android platform.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.740
But simultaneously, it
generated a ton of fragmentation

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.979
in more and more contexts.

00:18:57.979 --> 00:18:59.770
And so that's a little
bit abstract, right?

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.720
So let's actually
translate the terms

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.449
that if you're designing
or developing for a phone,

00:19:04.449 --> 00:19:05.490
you'll understand, right?

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.620
So there's one
big cost, which is

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.345
the cost of ensuring
performance and compliance

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:13.340
and ensuring performance across
many, many different devices.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.550
So animoca had this image that
got passed around quite a lot

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.690
through the web, showing
all the devices they

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.620
had on hand to ensure that would
the apps that they're building

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.274
actually function properly.

00:19:24.274 --> 00:19:25.690
And what thing
we've been starting

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.430
to tell more people about--
I think I can say this now.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.490
One thing we've been
telling more people about

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.100
is that it actually
impacts Google as well.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.060
So famously, when we were
designing Google Maps,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.050
we too also had a
cabinet of devices

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.890
to ensure sufficient kind
of performance compatibility

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.700
across lots and lots of devices.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.130
So that's one issue, right?

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.510
It kind of raises the
cost of development.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.300
I think if you're
interested in security,

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.360
this ends up being
another huge issue, right?

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.660
Android, let's face it, has
been faced with security issues,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.140
prominently in the last year.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.370
And it's actually arguably an
additional unfortunate outcome

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.180
of fragmentation.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.530
It's hard to push updates.

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.480
It's doubly hard to ensure that
all the devices incorporate

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.070
the latest patches quickly.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.160
And this creates a number
of risks for the user.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:11.160
Of course, their
data becomes at risk.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.270
But it also impacts the
ecosystem more deeply,

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.885
we think, for developers.

00:20:14.885 --> 00:20:17.570
They have to spend more
time to ensure security.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.044
And then failures actually can
harm their reputation not only

00:20:21.044 --> 00:20:22.668
the reputation of
the operating system.

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.210
So this is the interesting
design challenge

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.630
that we're in right
now and something

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.046
that we're thinking
really, really

00:20:30.046 --> 00:20:32.430
deeply about, which
is, on one hand,

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:35.117
as someone who's a Free
Software Foundation donor

00:20:35.117 --> 00:20:37.700
and someone who's really excited
about this stuff, open source

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.990
is like the incredibly
powerful design feature that

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.990
allowed the platform to
percolate and gain adoption.

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:46.450
Simultaneously, interoperability
becomes a bigger issue

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.390
as you have more and
more fragmentation.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.850
So that has this big impact
on sort of developers

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.874
on the day-to-day basis.

00:20:52.874 --> 00:20:55.290
And we have a couple of levers
for dealing with it, right?

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.697
So one way you can read
or think about Nexus

00:20:57.697 --> 00:21:00.030
is that it's an attempt to
give Android a platform where

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.840
the OS can be uniform.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.060
But obviously, Nexus phones
are not the most popular phone

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:05.560
out there.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.930
So, by far, the
strongest lever we have

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:09.800
is actually a
relationship with people

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.120
who manufacture phones, right?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.850
They have an impact.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:14.486
They are impacted
by fragmentation.

00:21:14.486 --> 00:21:16.610
And they have an interest
in the ecosystem as well.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.050
So we make agreements
to basically ensure

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:24.080
anti-fragmentation in the space
to protect interoperability.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.979
Now, the worry is
that without access

00:21:25.979 --> 00:21:27.520
to this anti-fragmentation
agreement,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.170
the Android ecosystem might get
even more fragmented over time.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:33.590
And eventually you could
imagine, particularly devices,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.260
diverging so much that
when you launch an app,

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.968
it's actually even
unclear whether or not

00:21:36.968 --> 00:21:40.780
the app will run at all across
the ecosystem in any big way.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.090
We also think the impact may be
particularly big on small devs,

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.300
because they don't have the
resources to develop and ensure

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.270
compliance and performance
across all these devices.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.200
So this is a number
of big issues, right?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.550
And if you've been
reading the news lately,

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:57.341
you might know that
regulators are actually

00:21:57.341 --> 00:21:59.939
interested in this
specific kind of agreement,

00:21:59.939 --> 00:22:02.230
because they have a huge
impact on the mobile ecosystem

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.420
and the app economy.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.460
And at issue is the question of
whether or not these agreements

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.270
should be allowed.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.990
And if they are allowed,
what shape they should take.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.150
And these inquiries, I
think, give us a good sense

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.800
to understand what
regulators are interested in

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.470
and also a chance to talk
about how open source business

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.112
models work.

00:22:17.112 --> 00:22:19.320
But it turns out, actually,
what's really interesting

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.528
that what we're seeing is
that actually it's not just

00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:23.554
about Google, but
developers are not,

00:22:23.554 --> 00:22:25.220
surprisingly, a big
part of the picture.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.030
So we increasingly hear from
regulators that are like,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.860
can you put us in
touch with developers

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.360
who are interested in
talking about this stuff?

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.200
Because they're the ones who
stand to gain or lose as much

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.640
from this particular issue.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.244
And so it turns out
they're actually

00:22:38.244 --> 00:22:40.160
really interested in
hearing from you as well.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.390
So I think the overarching
question of balancing openness

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.710
and interoperability is not
an easy one, by any measure.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.320
And it's been actually a problem
with every single open source

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.720
project.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.940
If you look at the history
of successful open source,

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.399
this actually ends up being
kind of a consistent challenge.

00:22:54.399 --> 00:22:56.773
But we basically think it's
important for people's voices

00:22:56.773 --> 00:22:57.470
to be heard.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.390
And so if you're interested
in learning more about how

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.370
to be in touch and how
to talk to these folks,

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:02.850
I would say just drop a line.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.900
