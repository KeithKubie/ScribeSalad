00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:02.895
This episode was sponcered by Google Science Fair.

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:05.675
A near perfect sphere of hot plasma

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:09.275
with a core that's more than 15 million degrees Celsius,

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.635
the Sun is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.105
But what if it suddenly disappeared for

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.135
one month? We were actually inspired to

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:22.235
think about this question by the Google Science Fair, which is an online global competition

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:24.795
for sharing your best ideas using Science, Technology,

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:26.095
Engineering or Math.

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:29.625
I mean, without the sun, we'd be required some

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.215
pretty extreme innovations to survive.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:35.395
If you're between the ages of 13 through 18, and have an idea

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.485
of you think can shape our world no matter how big,

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:40.705
or small, unique, or improving

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.785
on an existing idea,  you could win an educational scholarship,

00:00:43.785 --> 00:00:46.680
travel experiences, or tons of other prizes.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.915
So stick around at the end of the video for more details.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.935
Now after the sun disappears, for the first

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.435
 

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:58.465
 

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:01.455
 

00:01:01.455 --> 00:01:04.455

00:01:18.285 --> 00:01:21.055
 

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.855
 

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:26.665
