MALE SPEAKER: Becky Herbert from
Herbert Farms, and Joe Morris,

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.920
from Morris Beef, and Lisa
Knutson, who provides chickens.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.395
They work with Eating
with the Seasons,

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.365
who are here to talk about the
community-supported agriculture

00:00:18.365 --> 00:00:20.840
that they help
provide to Googlers.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.542
And they'll talk a little
bit about maybe their farming

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:28.265
methods or history, and
we can open up the Q&amp;A

00:00:28.265 --> 00:00:30.245
after they all talk.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:31.235
So, thank you.

00:00:31.235 --> 00:00:33.487
Welcome, Becky.

00:00:33.487 --> 00:00:35.195
BECKY HERBERT: I have
a basket of berries

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:40.145
that I'd like to pass around,
if you guys want snacks.

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.125
The first of the
blueberries this year.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.170
So, thanks, Mark, for having us.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.050
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.230
We have a nice little
community developed at Google

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.480
and have been there for years.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.160
So, it's always exciting to
come and meet the members

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.970
and interact with them.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.470
So, as Mark said,
I'm Becky Herbert.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.470
I'm the owner of Eating
with the Seasons.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.810
We're a family-owned
business that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.480
is based in
Hollister, California.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.012
How many of you are
familiar with the CSA model?

00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:21.970
So, quite a few of you.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.190
So, you know that
the traditional CSA

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.710
is one where you
subscribe to farm

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.387
in exchange for a
weekly box of produce.

00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:31.345
And what I've done with
Eating with the Seasons

00:01:31.345 --> 00:01:33.380
is I've taken the
model and evolved it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.430
to where we're actually
a multi-farm CSA,

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.900
and we let people choose what
goes into their box each week.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.986
So, you never get
what you don't like.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.810
So, our mission
with the CSA is just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.710
to supply healthy,
nutrient-dense produce

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.030
to our customers and
just connect busy people

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.760
with their food and the
people to produce it.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.840
These days everyone so busy
it's really hard to really pay

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.680
attention, but my goal is to
make it simple and convenient

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.699
and fun to know your farmers.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.060
So my dad started
the CSA in 2000.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.240
His name is Pat Herbert.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.750
He's a fourth generation
farmer in Hollister.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.280
And his CAS was the
traditional model.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.510
We had 50 members in Hollister
who just got his box of food

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.590
each week.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.560
And a couple years into his
venture, I was in publishing,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.290
and I got kind of bored with
doing the publishing business.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.140
I didn't think it was going
to be as boring as I found it,

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.950
so I ended up joining
him at the farm.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.870
And it was supposed to
be a temporary venture

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.540
to help him market his produce.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.522
And, as it turns out, I
found a lot of my colleagues

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.230
at Chronicle Books,
where I used to work,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.750
and Sierra Club,
where my husband was,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.590
interested in the CSA, so I
just started delivering to them.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.736
And it was a lot of people that
were my age, you know, mid-20s.

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:01.110
They didn't really
cook, but they

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.720
liked fruits and vegetables.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.220
So they were kind
of picky or didn't

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.250
know about kohlrabi or a
lot of the winter squashes.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.190
So, I ended up just
creating a system where

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.850
I sent a list to
them and they told me

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.740
what they wanted in their box.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.709
And it became so popular
that the colleagues

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.250
that I was working
with, they started

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.490
spreading the word to a lot of
different companies in downtown

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.600
San Francisco.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.115
And we just started a delivery
route in San Francisco,

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:29.300
and it really has become
the pace of Eating

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.057
with the Seasons-- the model.

00:03:31.057 --> 00:03:32.640
And we've just
expanded over the years

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.390
to different companies
and community drop sites

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.190
all over the Bay Area.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.940
So we've been going strong
for 12 years doing that.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.220
The basis of my dad's farm
is to build the soil, make

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.190
a nutrient-dense layer, to where
his fruits and vegetables have

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.740
a higher nutrient content.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.140
And he uses a
compost method that

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.160
was developed by the
Lubki family from Austria.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.080
They basically took
the biodynamic farming

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.560
and expanded on that.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.930
It's a very complex,
scientific recipe.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.019
I'm not a scientist, but
he uses clay as the base

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.560
and a lot of recycled
materials from the area,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.260
like dairy waste and things
like that that stick together

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.940
in the clay.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.910
And then he puts
it into the soil.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.150
And that actually creates a very
hydrated systems in the fields,

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.240
to where he doesn't have to
use a lot of water, which

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.300
with the drought now is really
helping him be able to grow

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.830
a lot of food when some people
can't if they don't have water.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.930
So, that's been the
basis of the farm.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.570
And he ended up having
some health problems

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.140
a couple years into helping,
so he had to cut back his farm.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.640
He couldn't grow the 50 fruits
and vegetables for the CSA

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.920
anymore, so I just took that
as an opportunity to reach out

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.980
to our other farmers
in that area who also

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.810
use the same composting
method and just

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.140
have the same values of
nutrient-dense, high quality

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.190
food.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.630
And so Phil Foster was our
natural first approach,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.780
because he grows over 250
different items every year,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.130
which is amazing.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.195
He was all for the CSA, so
he's kind of our main vegetable

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:24.050
supplier now.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.990
And we have a lot of
growers that are small.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.079
They do one or two
commodities a year.

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.995
Those strawberries and
blueberries I have here

00:05:30.995 --> 00:05:32.830
are from Francisco
Serrano, who's

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.300
a main grower for Alba
Organics, which you're probably

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.010
familiar with.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.210
But we buy directly from
him, whatever he has.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.786
He also has very
high-quality food.

00:05:45.786 --> 00:05:47.160
So, as the years
have progressed,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.530
I've just really expanded what
Eating with the Seasons offers.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.700
Any kind of food that is
local, organic produced,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.110
that we like the taste of
and we think our customers

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.960
will be excited about, we
just start partnerships.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.860
So for example, we just
discovered Suncoast Organic

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.940
Farm, and they're literally
15 minutes from where we are.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.790
They have wonderful olive oil.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.420
I think it's the best I've had.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.746
And there's a lot of
olive oil produced.

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:17.100
It's kind of like a
new trend to grow.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.570
But theirs has a grassy
element, but it's

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.680
very user-friendly
to cooking, as well.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.310
So, we started offering
that, and what's

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.000
great about them is
they're not into the profit

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.810
so much as getting healthy
olive oil out to people,

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.860
so the price is lower than what
you would traditionally see.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.250
Some of the higher ends sell for
like $22 for 500 milliliters,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.704
and we sell for $15.

00:06:41.704 --> 00:06:45.460
So, big difference.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.105
So, that's the gist of how
Eating with the Seasons

00:06:49.105 --> 00:06:50.260
has evolved to where it is.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.900
We have a lot of plans to just
keep evolving over the years.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.520
We want to also add a
kitchen to our business

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.230
to where we have pre-made meals
that our members could have.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.910
Just after talking
to people, they're

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.490
so busy that a
lot of people just

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.910
don't have time to cook
as much as they want.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.300
So, we really would just like
to find all the different ways

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.832
to produce food that
people will just

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:16.040
have nutrient-dense food
instead of going to In-N-Out

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.510
Burger on their way home,
they can give their family

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.350
like a jar of soup.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.540
So, that's kind of the
direction we're going.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.380
So, for now I guess I'll just go
over the basics of our program

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.245
and how it's
structured, and then I

00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.230
will introduce my
two wonderful farmers

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.910
that have joined me today.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.140
So, we have four different
membership sizes.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.110
It was developed to appeal to
the single person, all the way

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.050
the family, or someone
who juices a lot

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.480
and just requires a lot of food.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.920
We have an extra
small, for example,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.640
that's six fruits and
vegetables for $19,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.450
and it goes all the way
up to 16 items for $49.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.954
And the more you pay in advance,
the more you get a discount.

00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:06.370
So, we have some members who
subscribe for the whole year,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.850
so you get 4% off
your membership.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.580
And then you can also add--
we have an extra strawberry

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.080
option.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.689
Because they're so
popular, we like

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:17.480
to offer that during
the peak season, where

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.880
you get three clam-shells of
berries for $8.25 in addition

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.210
to your order.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.710
And you can also add
weekly or biweekly eggs.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.560
So, we work with a couple
of different farms,

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.900
and Lisa from
Pasture Chick is here

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.100
to talk about her practices.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.220
But first, I'd like to
bring Joe Morris up and talk

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.885
about his grass-fed beef
and land stewardship.

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:50.940
JOE MORRIS: Well, thank you
Becky, and thank you, Google,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.220
for showing up and taking
some time of your lunch time

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.060
to be with us and talk about
the wonderful world of food,

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.060
at least as Becky and I know it.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.000
And Lisa.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.970
And Jack-- my son
Jack is also here.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:07.790
So, I thought I'd kind of
start out with an introduction,

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:09.910
and then tell you a
little bit about how

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.780
Morris Grass-fed works
relative to our customers,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.810
and then talk a little
bit about the purpose,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:18.890
overarching purpose.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.000
Because food touches
us at the dinner table,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.250
but it also can touch a
vast experience of life,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.850
starting at the kitchen
table and moving up

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.100
to the carbon cycle
itself in the biosphere.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:38.230
So, my name is Joe Morris.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.920
Morris Grass-fed Beef is the
product of TO Cattle Company,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.330
and TO Cattle Company's been
our family's ranching enterprise

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.050
for five generations.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.010
And I actually grew
up in San Francisco,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:58.050
but I always loved the life
and the work of a cowboy.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.770
So I always sort of
tended toward that.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.910
Every vacation I had I
would head to the ranch.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:09.110
And when I got out of college,
I was told again and again

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.942
that you just can't make money
in the livestock business,

00:10:11.942 --> 00:10:12.900
in the cattle business.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.510
So go do something
else, and have

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.410
some cows on the side
or something like that.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.350
And I thought, well, I either
have to do things differently

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.890
than the best people I
know who are doing it,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.270
or I have to give up my dreams.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.804
And that wasn't
acceptable to me,

00:10:26.804 --> 00:10:28.595
so I decided I would
do things differently.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.920
And so we did.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.180
We've learned about management
of land and animals and people.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.390
And then we had
this beautiful beef

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.810
that we were producing,
beautiful animals.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.790
In the conventional
way of ranching,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.110
those beautiful animals would
stop doing their wonderful work

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.500
on the land and be sent
to a feedlot, where

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.320
they were sort of helpless
to do any good at all.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.000
And you create
all these problems

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.740
when you divorce
the relationship

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.730
between the animals
and the land.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.150
And they become feedlot beef.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.800
And we didn't really
want to do that.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.640
We saw some problems with
the industrial food system,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.070
and we wanted to kind
of shake the foundations

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.400
in our little tiny
way, and involve

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.060
all the people that we knew.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.030
My wife Julie and I both
grew up in San Francisco,

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.820
and we wanted to
become sort of liaisons

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.690
between the land and
the processes there,

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.000
and the people we grew up
with and associated with,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.630
and friends, and so forth.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.510
And so we started
Morris Grass-fed Beef.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:37.730
We started direct marketing
our beef to families and people

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.660
like you.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.090
A couple years ago-- our model
has expanded over the years--

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:50.310
and a couple years ago, we were
buying Herbert Family Farms'

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.090
CSA.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.620
And we met Becky, and we
decided to kind of put our heads

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:59.560
together and see if we do
what we do well on the ranch

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.060
and be supported by
and support what Becky

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.750
has done so well to get
beautiful food to customers

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.860
like yourselves
around the Bay Area.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.490
And so we've been
working with Eating

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:20.280
with the Seasons for several
years now, and it works well.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:25.290
Some of your coworkers
are our customers.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.340
And basically what
is this is, we

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.990
provide what we call
a split half, which

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.690
is a quarter of a beef--
one side of a beef divided

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:39.090
into two equal parts
that contains steaks,

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.540
from filet to New York
to rib-eyes to roasts,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:48.030
from o-bone roast to chuck
roasts, short ribs, shanks,

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.750
and ground beef.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.730
So you have a diversity of beef.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.930
All of it is wonderful.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.890
But it comes with a
caveat that it requires--

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.050
I was talking with Mark a
little bit-- it requires

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.260
a little bit of
energy, forethought.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.324
The good thing-- it's
your energy, which

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.990
comes from the sun
and the food you eat.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.900
And so it's an
interesting experience,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:14.650
besides being nutrient-dense
and a wonderful support

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.210
of other values that are
embedded in that meat.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:24.390
And so our purpose is to
bring all of those values

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.060
to our neighbors.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.590
And those values are from food
to clean air and clean water.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.350
And all of us know that
we can go our entire lives

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.669
without super high quality food.

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:37.210
Human beings have
adapted to do that.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:41.650
And that's not a goal,
but it is a reality.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.020
But we can only go a few days
without really high quality

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.520
water.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.929
And water is one of those
problems around the world where

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:51.970
there's not enough of it.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.080
It's not diversity.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.510
It's not decentralized.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.230
People are trying to control it.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.550
People fight over it.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:59.840
So, water's vital.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.570
You can only live
last a few days.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.540
And oxygen, of course, we can
only last few minutes without.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.390
And so our management of the
land and animal relationship

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.180
touches all three
of those things.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.510
We can produce beautiful food.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.940
If we manage our land
and animals well,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:23.063
we can manage that enormous
force called photosynthesis.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.110
And by doing that,
we can do what

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.620
Becky's dad is trying to do and
move carbon from the atmosphere

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.130
into our soils, which does all
the good things that moving

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.790
carbon out of the
atmosphere would do.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:46.290
It can be done by people
such as me, very low tech--

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.300
although we do use Google Earth
to help us kind of visualize

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.030
and monitor our management.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.210
But it can be done on range
lands around the world.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.040
And range lands constitute
45% of the land mass.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.670
So, there's a huge potential for
management of that carbon cycle

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.320
that can do only good
things for all of us.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.950
Puts carbon in soil,
builds the soils capacity

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.950
to receive and hold water, which
decentralizes the water system,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.620
produces wonderful food and more
products from ranches and farms

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.740
like Becky's dad
is trying to do,

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.690
and keeps people on
the land, because they

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.700
are producing more.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.810
Our system, after the
animals leave the land,

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.550
is to work with artisan
butchers, small-scale family

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:41.380
operations, who take very
good care of both the animal

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.150
while it's in their
care for a short period,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.650
and the food itself.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.570
They know how to cut it.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.680
They're great
partners, because we

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.420
don't know everything
there is to know.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.380
Two heads are better than one.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.075
And a good butcher's
head with ours

00:15:57.075 --> 00:16:01.575
and Becky's makes a great
experience for the community.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.840
We'll be around for
questions, but I

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.580
think I'll stop there and
let Becky and Lisa take over.

00:16:19.282 --> 00:16:19.990
LISA KNUTSON: Hi.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:22.740
This is really fun.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.570
My name is Lisa Knutson.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:29.460
And I'm not five generations
like my friends here,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.530
but I grew up in a home where
my dad was a law enforcement

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.980
officer in the days when
their income was very little,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.410
and we were a family of six.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.330
So my life started
with growing animals,

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.660
planting gardens,
raking the horse manure

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.570
and thinking it was
a really good time.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.430
My dad had that ability
to create that for us.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.940
We packed the manure,
we'd put it our ground,

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.260
and we'd leave it to get
rained on all winter long.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.360
The spring would come.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.660
We hand-spade it-- or he would.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.540
We'd have to pull the weeds.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.940
We'd produce a garden.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:05.675
We'd grow beef.

00:17:05.675 --> 00:17:06.619
We'd grow lamb.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.529
We'd grow chickens.

00:17:07.529 --> 00:17:08.455
We grew turkeys.

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:09.660
We grew rabbits.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.359
We did all of this.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.560
And somewhere along
the 18 years old,

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.119
I decided that, I am
so fed up with this.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.310
I'm leaving.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:22.819
So I went to beauty school,
and I became a hairdresser.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:25.069
And I had a salon
for 12 years that

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:28.319
was voted the best
in our community,

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.667
and we really
popular in the '80s.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:31.750
Yeah, we had all the hair.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.390
And it was just embarrassing
when you look at it now.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.540
But about 10 years into
that, I started getting ill.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:43.510
And It got to the point
where I stepped back,

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.180
and I let my staff
pick up my client base.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.680
And it changed our
world financially,

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.060
but I realized that the
environment that I was in

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.350
was really probably
starting to kill me.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.640
And so I left.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.580
And I was hiding and alone
for about five years.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.130
And we had a
godmother at the time

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:08.550
who had land that had been in
their family for generations.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:12.080
And it'd been leased out by the
same family for generations,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.570
but they were now aging.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.830
And my husband said, you know,
Glory, when that comes up,

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.780
we'd like to have it.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.810
So we waited 10 years for
our first piece of land.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.710
And I had left the salon,
and I had done odd jobs.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:28.560
I recreated myself,
I think, maybe

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.890
five times in three years.

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.660
And had many
different positions.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:34.680
I did a lot of marketing work.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.300
And then we got the land.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.320
And so we had known Joe,
and my dad had grown cattle.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.830
And so I purchased my
first 20 red heifers.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:49.440
And we started producing
a grass-fed natural beef.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.730
We didn't go direct
sales like what Joe did.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.150
We just produced it
on a commercial level.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.390
And then we started
looking at the land

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.770
that we had and realized
the type of income

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.700
that we needed to develop
on the 200 acres that we had

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.310
wasn't sustainable.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.900
The land had been
dry-farmed for hay,

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.775
which means they sucked
everything out of it.

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:12.420
It grew a beautiful
crop of star thistle.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.590
I mean, my poor horse.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.140
I'd go to move
cattle, and his legs

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.330
would be just bleeding
from poke marks,

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.020
because the star thistle
had become so dense.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.470
And so the other downfall that
we had was our little ranch

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.480
was about here, and there was
all these other bigger ranches

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:29.987
around us.

00:19:29.987 --> 00:19:32.070
And I don't know if you've
ever been around a bull

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.580
when he wants to go
where he wants to go.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.340
He just goes.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.290
And mine included.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.450
So we always had this
problem of animals

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.680
where they didn't belong,
limited amount of income.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.960
And so one day, I just told
my husband, I said, you know,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.910
I think there's got to
be a better use for what

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.980
land we have that can
change our income.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.820
And so we sold our cows.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.850
And I had bought
maybe a few Merino

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.969
sheep and some cashmere
goats, because I

00:20:02.969 --> 00:20:04.510
thought spinning
would be really fun.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.590
You know, making yarn.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.870
I said, I think that
we can impact the land

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.930
and do a better job
economically for us as a family

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.350
if I go to a smaller animal.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.650
And so he was agreeable.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.510
So we made this big change.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.490
And over the next
couple years, I just

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:27.050
grew the flock to
200 mothers, and I

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:28.920
was able to impact
the land really well.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.560
We partitioned it off.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:31.630
We rotate and graze.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.302
But we just kept having trouble
with some parasite issues

00:20:35.302 --> 00:20:36.510
with our sheep and our goats.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.580
And I thought, you
know, I think we

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.350
need another species in here.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.930
And I told my husband, I say,
I think I want to grow chicken.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.344
And right along the
same time with that

00:20:46.344 --> 00:20:48.260
was not just what I
thought the chickens could

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.950
do for the grass,
but at that point,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.480
I'm buying chicken
and going, we could

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.890
be eating tofu for the
flavor that this chicken has.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.240
I remember chicken as a kid
what real chicken tasted like.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.495
When you talk to French
people or European people,

00:21:03.495 --> 00:21:04.870
they're just like,
you guys don't

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:07.230
know what chicken's
supposed to taste like.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.130
So, I told my husband, I said,
I want to grow some chicken.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.855
And the eyes rolled up in
his head and it was like,

00:21:13.855 --> 00:21:17.590
you know, you've really gone
off the end on this one, girl.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.984
So I started growing
chicken for us.

00:21:19.984 --> 00:21:21.650
I wanted to put a few
out on the pasture

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.440
to see what it would do
to the grass dynamics.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.490
And I never thought
that we would

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.130
be doing what we are doing
today, which is we rotate out

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.410
300 meat chickens
every other week.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:38.190
We've got 1,700 hens
that are laying eggs.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.860
Our grass is amazing.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.770
The star thistle-- I feel super
bad, because the bees don't

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.290
do very well out there anymore.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.720
They have to go
further for food,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.060
because what used to be
200 acres of star thistle,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.780
we now have perennial
grass coming back.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:56.560
And it's been amazing to see
what a multi-species grazing

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.870
program can do on the land.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.070
So, now we have this
product-- so I'm

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.800
trying to give you the
whole ranch picture.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.169
So Becky is our local girl.

00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:08.460
I heard about her a couple
of years ago, and I thought,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.990
I'd really like
to meet this girl.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.640
And over time we got introduced.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.700
And she has really been key
in helping small farmers.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.120
Because we're small.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.720
We have approximately 300 acres.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.230
And we're producing
chicken, eggs,

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.400
and then pasture-raised
organic lamb and goat meat.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.200
In the fall it's harvested.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.460
But how do you keep up, and
how do you find you guys?

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.520
I can't be running
around doing all of that.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.240
So we have people
like Becky, who

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.820
she's become my friend
and my business partner.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.010
And our goal is to just
continue to not become

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.352
this big huge entity--
like my farm is never

00:22:46.352 --> 00:22:47.310
going to be a big farm.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.380
Joe's farm is never going
to be this oversized farm.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.370
Small family farms
that can take the time

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.760
to grow you really
good food, Becky's

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.980
the vehicle that we
can use as a team

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.000
to see that our
produce and our meat

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.980
get to the people who really
need it, and don't have

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.180
the same opportunity
that we have to grow it

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.900
and to produce it.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.760
So, that's kind of just the
brief nutshell of what I do,

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.400
and how it came about doing it.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.410
And I think like Joe said,
I think I can stop there.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.485
And then if you guys
have questions, I mean,

00:23:24.485 --> 00:23:27.450
I'm really OK with
anything you might

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.910
want to know about what we're
doing or why we're doing it

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.165
or what's involved.

00:23:32.165 --> 00:23:33.598
Is that good, mom?

00:23:33.598 --> 00:23:35.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.098
BECKY HERBERT: Thank you.

00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:41.414
Does anybody have
any questions for me?

00:23:41.414 --> 00:23:41.914
Yes.

00:23:41.914 --> 00:23:43.345
AUDIENCE: So, I have a few.

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:46.100
I was wondering if each of
you could talk a little bit

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.300
about-- like, how do you
tell that the soil is getting

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.280
better?

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.076
Are there scientific
tests you run

00:23:52.076 --> 00:23:55.383
that show you that there's
more organic matter in the soil

00:23:55.383 --> 00:23:57.466
and things like that, or
you just kind of look how

00:23:57.466 --> 00:24:00.080
much better the grass is this
year, or look how much better

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.020
the produce is, or the
animals, things like that?

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:04.540
BECKY HERBERT: No,
there are tests.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.149
My dad does them every
two to four years.

00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:11.001
It kind of depends on where
he's at with his compost.

00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.486
And if he has
potential customers,

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:15.971
he'll run the tests
again, if there's

00:24:15.971 --> 00:24:17.586
like a new-- he
sells compost too.

00:24:17.586 --> 00:24:20.444
I don't know if
I mentioned that.

00:24:20.444 --> 00:24:22.700
So, he always has an
idea of how much--

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.985
at this point, since the
early '90s, every few years,

00:24:25.985 --> 00:24:27.949
it goes up 1%.

00:24:27.949 --> 00:24:31.032
And I can't remember
what the UC system says

00:24:31.032 --> 00:24:33.759
is the highest organic matter
you can have in your soil.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:35.090
It might be 3%.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.222
And the last time he
tested it, it was at 5.6.

00:24:38.222 --> 00:24:39.680
So, it's almost
like the UC systems

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.263
are at a point where
they're like, how

00:24:41.263 --> 00:24:42.548
is that even possible?

00:24:42.548 --> 00:24:45.382
But he's really just
started doing it every year.

00:24:45.382 --> 00:24:49.530
Since 1989, he's been
putting the compost in.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.458
It's kind of become
a religion for him.

00:24:52.458 --> 00:24:54.898
So, yes, there are tests.

00:24:54.898 --> 00:24:58.320
There's different
tests you can run

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.860
to get what different elements
are in there, and how much.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.553
If you go to his website,
there is information on it.

00:25:07.553 --> 00:25:10.349
If you actually want to
study his whole process,

00:25:10.349 --> 00:25:13.842
it's
herbertfamilyorganicfarm.com.

00:25:13.842 --> 00:25:16.085
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.085 --> 00:25:17.584
LISA KNUTSON: I
would say, for me, I

00:25:17.584 --> 00:25:19.331
don't have a
scientific test I do,

00:25:19.331 --> 00:25:31.307
but you can look at plant
placement-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:31.307 --> 00:25:33.303
And we're just
like, it's not true.

00:25:33.303 --> 00:25:34.301
The goats love it.

00:25:34.301 --> 00:25:37.295
They-- I watched them
one day as we put them

00:25:37.295 --> 00:25:39.039
into a fresh
pasture. [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.788
And they go straight
for the star thistle.

00:25:40.788 --> 00:25:43.782
And they eat up the stem,
they turn it around,

00:25:43.782 --> 00:25:48.273
and they eat backwards so that
the little pricklies fall off.

00:25:48.273 --> 00:25:50.269
So, now that we've
poisoned that star thistle,

00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:54.760
we have grass that's a
little bit more beneficial.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.255
And the placement of
the plants is closed,

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:59.001
versus we have
perennial grasses that

00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:01.584
never could start until the star
thistle had been cleared off.

00:26:01.584 --> 00:26:03.243
Because if it
stays-- I don't know

00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:05.571
if it's that way
everywhere-- but just looking

00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:08.732
at my place and the garbage,
when there was star thistle,

00:26:08.732 --> 00:26:11.227
the little perennial
grass was so covered over

00:26:11.227 --> 00:26:13.223
it couldn't come out.

00:26:13.223 --> 00:26:15.718
Now that we have that cleared
away, I'm having more range

00:26:15.718 --> 00:26:19.211
grasses start to
come up. [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:19.211 --> 00:26:23.868
And that's how I judge that it's
doing better, because there's

00:26:23.868 --> 00:26:27.694
just a lot more feed available
that's across-the-board better.

00:26:27.694 --> 00:26:30.189
The sheep aren't as big
on star thistle as goats.

00:26:30.189 --> 00:26:32.647
Goats are totally into it, but
sheep are more-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:38.545
JOE MORRIS: Well, I don't
know if it's better,

00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:42.660
but I think it's an
absolutely a great idea.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.660
And this is where [INAUDIBLE]
and I get together

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.903
on this thing, because
measuring soil carbon has

00:26:47.903 --> 00:26:52.145
been a challenge, because the
soil is extremely diverse.

00:26:52.145 --> 00:26:57.135
And one carbon sample from
here, the soil's organic matter

00:26:57.135 --> 00:27:00.129
sample is not-- this
little square meter

00:27:00.129 --> 00:27:02.624
can be very different
from this square meter.

00:27:02.624 --> 00:27:05.618
And so there've
been a lot of tests

00:27:05.618 --> 00:27:10.608
that kind think of how do we
monitor soil carbon to know

00:27:10.608 --> 00:27:13.602
whether our [INAUDIBLE] are
increasing it or decreasing it,

00:27:13.602 --> 00:27:15.012
and what does that mean?

00:27:15.012 --> 00:27:17.095
And so there's a lot of
different things happening

00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:18.093
in that regard.

00:27:18.093 --> 00:27:25.079
And I'm part of a group
called Soil Carbon Challenge.

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:27.823
It's a friend of
mine who decided

00:27:27.823 --> 00:27:31.067
that, you know, how do
we know these things?

00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:35.059
How do we know how
to run a fast race?

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:36.057
You run the race.

00:27:36.057 --> 00:27:39.051
You don't do all these
extraneous things.

00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:41.546
You just get people out
there and run a race.

00:27:41.546 --> 00:27:43.542
And he started this
whole carbon challenge.

00:27:43.542 --> 00:27:45.538
And it got around
the world, really,

00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:48.033
but mostly in the United States.

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:52.524
Measuring, taking readable
measurements of soil carbon,

00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:55.518
and getting measurements of
carbon from around the world.

00:27:55.518 --> 00:27:59.011
[INAUDIBLE] Great guy.

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:02.005
Soil Carbon
Challenge. [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:02.005 --> 00:28:06.745
The other thing is that where
Google comes into play--

00:28:06.745 --> 00:28:09.989
and he should be here, because
he's way smarter than I am.

00:28:09.989 --> 00:28:11.985
He's really a brilliant guy.

00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:13.856
But one of the
things that Randy can

00:28:13.856 --> 00:28:18.472
do to know whether their
soil is improving or not,

00:28:18.472 --> 00:28:25.458
is a simple test of
measurements of productivity.

00:28:25.458 --> 00:28:29.949
In other words, you have
one ranch next to another,

00:28:29.949 --> 00:28:32.943
and they're basically the
same sort of productivity

00:28:32.943 --> 00:28:37.434
to begin with, you can measure
the animal days per acre

00:28:37.434 --> 00:28:39.762
produced on this ranch,
versus the animal

00:28:39.762 --> 00:28:42.923
days per acre on this ranch.

00:28:42.923 --> 00:28:46.249
OK, so it's the amount
of grass-- or amount

00:28:46.249 --> 00:28:49.909
of animals that can
feed for one day

00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:53.402
on an acre, which is about
the size of a football field.

00:28:53.402 --> 00:28:57.893
So, if you can get 10 from
this acre and 30 for this acre,

00:28:57.893 --> 00:28:59.390
it's a huge difference.

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.885
And that can be
measured fairly easily.

00:29:04.879 --> 00:29:07.873
My friend Peter
Donovan is really

00:29:07.873 --> 00:29:10.368
interested in remote sensing.

00:29:10.368 --> 00:29:13.611
Because what we're really
doing by testing those animal

00:29:13.611 --> 00:29:16.855
days, days per acre, is
looking at the productivity

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:17.853
of the land.

00:29:17.853 --> 00:29:21.845
When the productivity
of the land increases,

00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:24.839
the hypothesis is, that
the way that happens

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:29.330
is because the soil is
increasing in organic matter.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.823
When you have increased organic
matter, you will water more,

00:29:32.823 --> 00:29:35.318
and you create more
food and opportunities

00:29:35.318 --> 00:29:37.813
for life in that soil.

00:29:37.813 --> 00:29:40.807
And most of the species
[INAUDIBLE] on Earth,

00:29:40.807 --> 00:29:42.803
are beneath the
soil, not above it.

00:29:42.803 --> 00:29:45.298
And so if we can get
more life in our soil,

00:29:45.298 --> 00:29:50.288
we get more and better
food from our soil.

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:53.652
If you know anybody who's
interested in those ideas

00:29:53.652 --> 00:29:55.777
and would like to have more
in-depth conversations,

00:29:55.777 --> 00:29:58.771
let me know.

00:29:58.771 --> 00:30:00.767
AUDIENCE: You were saying
it's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:10.747 --> 00:30:13.737
JOE MORRIS: Well, in
ranching, it happens.

00:30:13.737 --> 00:30:15.737
You have a certain number
of animals on a ranch.

00:30:15.737 --> 00:30:17.234
Say it's 85, 100, 1,000.

00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:19.729
And you have 100 acres.

00:30:19.729 --> 00:30:22.224
And you know that
those hundred cows

00:30:22.224 --> 00:30:28.711
can eat on those hundred
acres for 30 days.

00:30:28.711 --> 00:30:31.994
AUDIENCE: And are you
dividing that land up?

00:30:31.994 --> 00:30:33.202
JOE MORRIS: Well, it depends.

00:30:33.202 --> 00:30:34.699
That's a management option.

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:39.190
So, if you have 30
days-- or each animal

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:44.679
on each day for-- 30
times 100 is 3,000.

00:30:44.679 --> 00:30:48.671
And you can have that 100
cows for 30 days there.

00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:51.166
If you're introducing
new management practices

00:30:51.166 --> 00:30:56.156
on another 100 acres, you can
increase that 3,000 to 4,000.

00:30:56.156 --> 00:31:00.148
You can increase
it by [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:00.148 --> 00:31:03.641
Now, we can look from
satellite, and we

00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:07.633
can measure the productivity
by measuring greenness

00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:11.625
over time on large areas.

00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:15.033
Then, we have good feedback
on management techniques

00:31:15.033 --> 00:31:16.116
and practices [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.007 --> 00:31:30.840
AUDIENCE: Oh, great.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.648
Oh, thanks.

00:31:31.648 --> 00:31:32.148
Thank you.

00:31:32.148 --> 00:31:33.130
I really have enjoyed this.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.505
This has been
really interesting.

00:31:34.505 --> 00:31:37.223
I actually just signed up for
a membership about a month ago,

00:31:37.223 --> 00:31:38.696
so I'm really enjoying it.

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:41.660
I'm actually on the food
team here at Google,

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.728
and I understand that
when this was set up,

00:31:43.728 --> 00:31:45.600
it was totally independent
of the food team.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.433
And I was just curious
if you or anyone else

00:31:47.433 --> 00:31:50.090
could speak more about
how this CSA got set up,

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.070
and how many Googlers
are involved with it,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.050
and how much it's
grown each year.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.525
That would be really
interesting to hear.

00:31:56.525 --> 00:31:59.069
MALE SPEAKER: So, I
might be the best person

00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:00.485
to try and answer
those questions.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.415
My name is [INAUDIBLE],
and I am a person who

00:32:07.415 --> 00:32:10.385
coordinates with Bruce, one
of two people [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:10.385 --> 00:32:12.860
set up and maintain [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:20.240
I inherited the role
from Cynthia Young,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.192
who I believe set it up.

00:32:23.192 --> 00:32:27.620
I don't know how
she got started.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:31.556
I don't know what
drove her to do it.

00:32:31.556 --> 00:32:36.990
Basically, it was kind of
fully formed and [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:41.244
These days, we
have-- I think we're

00:32:41.244 --> 00:32:44.702
going to be 40 or 50 active
members receiving [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:44.702 --> 00:32:45.690
on a weekly basis.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:52.358
The number fluctuates,
but that seems

00:32:52.358 --> 00:32:55.838
to be a constant, a
steady-staying number.

00:32:55.838 --> 00:32:57.546
Was there anything
else that you asked--?

00:32:57.546 --> 00:32:59.212
AUDIENCE: Well, which
of the memberships

00:32:59.212 --> 00:33:01.862
is the most popular,
or is it pretty wide?

00:33:01.862 --> 00:33:03.070
MALE SPEAKER: I couldn't say.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.110
So, one of the things
about the way we work

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:08.080
is that we only
provide the space.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.040
Any local members keep up their
own relationships [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.030
seasons.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.319
So, Becky, I suppose, might
be in a better position

00:33:16.319 --> 00:33:17.485
to answer that than I would.

00:33:17.485 --> 00:33:18.970
BECKY HERBERT: Sure, yeah.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:23.425
Most people probably do
the extra-small six item.

00:33:23.425 --> 00:33:25.651
What I find that--
you know, we deliver

00:33:25.651 --> 00:33:28.065
to a lot of different
companies in the Bay Area,

00:33:28.065 --> 00:33:31.937
and I always use Google as an
example, because the customer

00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:36.847
base are the people that
take advantage of purchasing

00:33:36.847 --> 00:33:39.540
an array, not just produce.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.694
They subscribe to Joe's
quarterly Morris Grass-fed Beef

00:33:42.694 --> 00:33:48.932
deliveries, they
add eggs every week.

00:33:48.932 --> 00:33:49.555
I don't know.

00:33:49.555 --> 00:33:53.922
I always was curious to know--
is it an educational thing?

00:33:53.922 --> 00:33:56.770
I never knew how you
guys promote it here,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.340
except like Cynthia used
to send out-- every season

00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:02.645
she would send out emails to
get more people to sign up.

00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:05.700
And I don't know if
that's still happening.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.702
MALE SPEAKER: I personally
haven't done anything

00:34:07.702 --> 00:34:08.024
like that.

00:34:08.024 --> 00:34:09.773
I should probably
investigate and find out

00:34:09.773 --> 00:34:11.359
what I'm permitted to do.

00:34:11.359 --> 00:34:12.734
One thing we have
here is we have

00:34:12.734 --> 00:34:14.962
a lot of different
interest groups.

00:34:14.962 --> 00:34:16.845
And so there's a
bit of consideration

00:34:16.845 --> 00:34:20.750
as to spamming the
entire pile of Googlers,

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.272
particularly those
who don't really care.

00:34:23.272 --> 00:34:24.896
I'll take it as an
action to figure out

00:34:24.896 --> 00:34:28.766
what the right promotion
is, but right now, it's

00:34:28.766 --> 00:34:32.238
either word-of-mouth, or
there's an internal site listing

00:34:32.238 --> 00:34:35.710
the various perks and
services that people who look

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.198
might happen upon.

00:34:37.198 --> 00:34:40.670
So, it's all because of chance.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.646
Speaking of which, I don't
know if it's been mentioned,

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:47.283
but for anyone here who's
interested and hasn't already

00:34:47.283 --> 00:34:50.094
signed up, we have a
site that's go/csa/mb.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.550
And that's go/csa/mb.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:59.518
And right now, [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:59.518 --> 00:35:03.982
It's got all the information so
far as signing up, logistics.

00:35:03.982 --> 00:35:06.462
For instance, we probably
just had delivery happen.

00:35:06.462 --> 00:35:09.186
If it's not just
happened, then one

00:35:09.186 --> 00:35:11.400
that's probably in
progress right now.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:16.614
And go and have a look
and take it from them.

00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:18.780
BECKY HERBERT: I also have
postcards with my website

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.748
where you can sign up.

00:35:20.748 --> 00:35:22.125
If you want to take a postcard.

00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.750
MALE SPEAKER: Pretty
much you'd sign up

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:29.180
on their site, [INAUDIBLE] to
have either here or [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:39.180
BECKY HERBERT: I can also speak
to-- when we started, Cynthia

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.680
approached me, and
she was looking

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.680
at a few different CSAs,
and she ended doing a poll.

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.180
And that's how we
picked up the slot.

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:54.180
She did a poll of like,
what would you prefer?

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.680
Which farms?

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.680
People just recommended us.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:07.180
AUDIENCE: So, [INAUDIBLE]
So, obviously you guys

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.180
are [INAUDIBLE] Could
you just describe

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:19.680
some examples of trying to
get other people [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.180
out to the community to
encourage better practices,

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.180
but then, at the
same time, maybe it's

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.680
just we're supposed to let
other people [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.680
based on our dollars
and spending.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.180
You have any other
recommendations or advice

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.180
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.680
putting the practices into
larger population [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.180
JOE MORRIS: Our business
started 22 years ago,

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:05.680
and it had two families-- our
friends that I was constantly

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:13.266
[INAUDIBLE] Today, we
have over 900 families.

00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:17.757
So, I don't know the best
way to get these practices,

00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:21.250
because practices
are tricky things.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.869
When we're working
in biology, we're

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:26.240
working in an incredible
number of variables.

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:30.232
And what's sort of best
practice on one place

00:37:30.232 --> 00:37:34.723
may not necessarily be
sustained in another place.

00:37:34.723 --> 00:37:41.709
There's some principles, but
[INAUDIBLE] A friend of mine

00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:45.950
says the best practice is
monitoring, at least when

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:49.859
you're dealing with
biology, because then you

00:37:49.859 --> 00:37:53.186
get that feedback, then
you know in this place,

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:55.681
doing this will
yield such-and-such.

00:37:55.681 --> 00:38:03.166
But, as far as getting the
attractiveness of this food,

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:07.158
I think there's a big thing
that consumers-- you know,

00:38:07.158 --> 00:38:08.655
our customers-- can do.

00:38:08.655 --> 00:38:12.148
And that is [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:12.148 --> 00:38:13.645
Feed it to your friends.

00:38:13.645 --> 00:38:15.641
Talk about it.

00:38:15.641 --> 00:38:17.138
And talk about why.

00:38:17.138 --> 00:38:19.134
The values of buying
in really good food

00:38:19.134 --> 00:38:21.130
go far beyond just good meat.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.625
And that's a very
sort of selfish kind

00:38:23.625 --> 00:38:26.619
of way of thinking about food.

00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:29.613
And then going towards
this land [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:37.098 --> 00:38:39.094
So, word-of-mouth.

00:38:39.094 --> 00:38:43.585
Word-of-mouth is absolutely
the best way of doing it.

00:38:43.585 --> 00:38:45.581
And I don't know--
others [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:54.563 --> 00:39:04.792
LISA KNUTSON:
[INAUDIBLE] But, we've

00:39:04.792 --> 00:39:11.030
taken the time [INAUDIBLE]
We have a little book.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:14.061
This was taken literally about
two weeks before it rained.

00:39:14.061 --> 00:39:16.519
This was the [INAUDIBLE], this
was the chickens right after

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:20.511
[INAUDIBLE] These
are meat chickens,

00:39:20.511 --> 00:39:24.503
and people come up to
me, because we had a--

00:39:24.503 --> 00:39:25.501
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:32.487 --> 00:39:33.984
LISA KNUTSON: [INAUDIBLE] OK.

00:39:33.984 --> 00:39:36.479
I mean, I've [INAUDIBLE]
and I watched

00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:37.976
that, it broke my heart.

00:39:37.976 --> 00:39:40.471
I mean, it broke my heart.

00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:47.457
Because [INAUDIBLE]
I've been in livestock,

00:39:47.457 --> 00:39:49.952
I've been in produce,
but I had no idea.

00:39:49.952 --> 00:39:50.950
I had no idea.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.163
And it's people that
are in [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:55.163 --> 00:39:57.662
Honestly, I tell my husband,
how did we live without Google?

00:39:57.662 --> 00:39:59.159
Because I can't think of it.

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:01.575
If I can't figure it out, I
go to you first, and I'm like,

00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:02.652
what happens when?

00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:08.640
[INAUDIBLE] And I know how
to take care of livestock.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.091
And so you come to me
at farmer's market,

00:40:11.091 --> 00:40:12.632
and I get this
question all the time.

00:40:12.632 --> 00:40:15.127
And I had a lady last
week walk up to me

00:40:15.127 --> 00:40:17.123
that is, well, why is
your chicken better?

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:18.620
Why is your chicken
better for me?

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.115
And first I told her, I said,
I don't know that it is.

00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:22.113
I don't know that.

00:40:22.113 --> 00:40:24.275
But if you're looking
for a chicken that

00:40:24.275 --> 00:40:26.604
has a life that's
different than this--

00:40:26.604 --> 00:40:29.099
this is the new standard
for cage-free eggs.

00:40:29.099 --> 00:40:33.091
I belong to the
California Farm Bureau.

00:40:33.091 --> 00:40:34.128
They posted this.

00:40:34.128 --> 00:40:35.586
And I covered up
the farmer's name,

00:40:35.586 --> 00:40:38.081
because he's really
excited, because those

00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:41.574
used to be battery cages, which
these poor little hens were

00:40:41.574 --> 00:40:44.069
stuffed in there, and
they just eat and lay.

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:46.065
But this is the new cage-free.

00:40:46.065 --> 00:40:48.560
So when you see eggs
that say cage-free,

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.556
that's what you're thinking of.

00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:53.051
But then you see-- what did
I do with the other one?--

00:40:53.051 --> 00:40:55.047
then you see pasture-raised.

00:40:55.047 --> 00:40:59.039
So, you talking-- I think you
guys are what's moving it,

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.035
faster than what
Joe and I are doing.

00:41:01.035 --> 00:41:06.025
Joe and I just happen to--
we had a teacher in common.

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:09.518
There's a man-- and his TED Talk
was really good. [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:09.518 --> 00:41:13.510
And he talks about the mistakes
he made, but then Africa.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.961
And what happened to the
biodiversity of the land,

00:41:15.961 --> 00:41:17.502
and what happened
to the river basin,

00:41:17.502 --> 00:41:20.496
and what happened to the people,
what happened to the animals.

00:41:20.496 --> 00:41:24.488
When I heard him 30
years ago, he really

00:41:24.488 --> 00:41:25.985
jerked my heartstring.

00:41:25.985 --> 00:41:29.478
Because if you're a gardener,
if you plant something,

00:41:29.478 --> 00:41:30.476
you take care of it.

00:41:30.476 --> 00:41:36.963
So his thought to me was, the
grass is what's important.

00:41:36.963 --> 00:41:40.456
If you don't have grass,
you can't do this.

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:44.448
If you don't have grass,
you can't do what Joe does.

00:41:44.448 --> 00:41:46.444
And Joe does rotate
his pastures,

00:41:46.444 --> 00:41:48.939
and I rotate my pastures.

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:51.434
And you watch your
garden-- like if you're

00:41:51.434 --> 00:41:54.428
doing-- what's the
grass that you juice,

00:41:54.428 --> 00:41:55.925
that everybody likes to juice?

00:41:55.925 --> 00:41:56.424
AUDIENCE: Wheatgrass.

00:41:56.424 --> 00:41:56.923
LISA KNUTSON: Wheatgrass.

00:41:56.923 --> 00:41:57.423
OK.

00:41:57.423 --> 00:42:00.915
If you cut it too short the
first time, you're done, right?

00:42:00.915 --> 00:42:03.596
You just lost the $10 or
whatever investment for your

00:42:03.596 --> 00:42:04.096
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:06.424
If you cut it the
first time, and you

00:42:06.424 --> 00:42:09.086
leave life in that
grass, it's common sense.

00:42:09.086 --> 00:42:10.583
Don't wipe it all out at first.

00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:16.072
Take a little bit, juice it,
take care of it, watch it grow,

00:42:16.072 --> 00:42:17.569
take some more.

00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:19.565
So, what we do
with our animals--

00:42:19.565 --> 00:42:21.561
this last year was tricky.

00:42:21.561 --> 00:42:25.054
We went from 100 mother
sheep and 100 mother goats

00:42:25.054 --> 00:42:28.547
to 40 a year ago February.

00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:32.539
Again, I just [INAUDIBLE]
watching plants,

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:34.240
but we had so little rain.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.531
And what do you know, we
didn't get that follow-up rain

00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:38.028
that we needed so bad.

00:42:38.028 --> 00:42:40.024
So, I watched those plants.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:43.018
They went to about this high.

00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:45.110
I didn't graze it all off.

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:47.347
If you watch-- well,
Joe was talking

00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:52.244
about sections of ground,
and here's one piece,

00:42:52.244 --> 00:42:53.535
and this piece looks different.

00:42:53.535 --> 00:42:55.020
We call it [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.000
If you look at our
ground, and you look

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.970
at our neighbour's,
it's totally different.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:01.455
We have grass.

00:43:01.455 --> 00:43:04.380
And then when we're
getting into the fall,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:07.374
I will take the grass
down about like that.

00:43:07.374 --> 00:43:09.869
Just do not mulch little plants.

00:43:09.869 --> 00:43:12.863
Do not protect those,
so when the rain comes,

00:43:12.863 --> 00:43:14.859
there's some cover
there so they can

00:43:14.859 --> 00:43:17.853
get established
and take off again.

00:43:17.853 --> 00:43:19.350
That's our practices.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.344
But, it's people like
you that go, oh, look.

00:43:22.344 --> 00:43:23.342
I just met this guy.

00:43:23.342 --> 00:43:24.839
I can't believe what he's doing.

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.336
And you talk about it.

00:43:26.336 --> 00:43:30.827
Because now, in a little more
central market-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:34.819
Yes.

00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:37.314
These people, they care.

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:40.308
People that care about animals,
people that care about us.

00:43:40.308 --> 00:43:42.304
This is our livelihood.

00:43:42.304 --> 00:43:45.797
People that care about what's
going to happen to the ground.

00:43:45.797 --> 00:43:46.795
They talk.

00:43:46.795 --> 00:43:51.286
And so, from the first $100
that we get in six months,

00:43:51.286 --> 00:43:54.779
they talk to enough
people, and now it's $500.

00:43:54.779 --> 00:43:57.773
And I'm equating it in
dollars, but dollars

00:43:57.773 --> 00:44:00.767
represents the
word being spread.

00:44:00.767 --> 00:44:02.264
I have people come
up to me now--

00:44:02.264 --> 00:44:05.258
we've been in Mountainview
at the farmer's market

00:44:05.258 --> 00:44:10.248
just since the Sunday
before Christmas.

00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:11.745
I had to get rid
of my cowboy boots

00:44:11.745 --> 00:44:14.905
and go to Converse, because my
feet hurt so bad, because it

00:44:14.905 --> 00:44:16.735
is on the full time.

00:44:16.735 --> 00:44:18.232
So, what are you doing?

00:44:18.232 --> 00:44:19.729
So why are you doing this?

00:44:19.729 --> 00:44:22.224
How do you know how much
GMO is in your feed?

00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:23.721
Where are you sourcing this?

00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:25.218
And then they go and tell.

00:44:25.218 --> 00:44:26.919
I come the next
week-- oh my God.

00:44:26.919 --> 00:44:29.210
My friend was just telling
me blah blah blah blah blah.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.705
We have to have your chicken.

00:44:31.705 --> 00:44:33.575
Not just because
it tastes amazing.

00:44:33.575 --> 00:44:34.200
It's different.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:38.192
The eggs that come in
that box-- don't try them

00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:40.188
unless you want an addiction.

00:44:40.188 --> 00:44:44.180
It's not like anything
else you've ever had.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.178
It's different.

00:44:45.178 --> 00:44:48.338
And I'm convinced-- the
more the farmer hears

00:44:48.338 --> 00:44:52.164
about the animals--
it's a pastured chick

00:44:52.164 --> 00:44:54.160
ranch, because
it's a girl, right?

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.113
It's a girl's farm.

00:44:56.113 --> 00:44:57.154
And I love on everything.

00:44:57.154 --> 00:45:01.019
It is important how these
animals are handled.

00:45:01.019 --> 00:45:02.144
I was taking their picture.

00:45:02.144 --> 00:45:03.142
Hello!

00:45:03.142 --> 00:45:04.639
Are they cute or what?

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:07.633
They [INAUDIBLE] like that.

00:45:07.633 --> 00:45:10.627
But when you watch
the fence line,

00:45:10.627 --> 00:45:12.872
if you move the cattle--
I can guarantee you,

00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:14.868
when Joe's ready
to move pastures,

00:45:14.868 --> 00:45:16.615
those cows are waiting for him.

00:45:16.615 --> 00:45:20.607
Because they know
[INAUDIBLE] It's that way.

00:45:20.607 --> 00:45:23.102
And what we do--we're
telling you, now,

00:45:23.102 --> 00:45:25.098
you go talk to some more people.

00:45:25.098 --> 00:45:27.094
Then, you're going
to help support us,

00:45:27.094 --> 00:45:29.589
and then our peers--
who are typically

00:45:29.589 --> 00:45:32.416
governed by only the dollar--
think, well, maybe there's

00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:33.581
something to that.

00:45:33.581 --> 00:45:35.078
Phil Foster.

00:45:35.078 --> 00:45:36.575
He's my big brother.

00:45:36.575 --> 00:45:40.816
He has been-- there aren't
even words for how good

00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:42.563
he's been to me.

00:45:42.563 --> 00:45:48.551
His wife and he started with
20 acres at most, years ago.

00:45:48.551 --> 00:45:51.046
[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:51.046 --> 00:45:52.044
He's so special.

00:45:52.044 --> 00:45:54.539
My emotions were
in the way, sorry.

00:45:54.539 --> 00:45:57.533
But he started with 20 acres.

00:45:57.533 --> 00:46:01.026
He's now almost 300
acres in two ranches.

00:46:01.026 --> 00:46:03.022
We share a ranch in
Santa Ana valley.

00:46:03.022 --> 00:46:06.016
The man that comes and
inspects his fields,

00:46:06.016 --> 00:46:08.511
he's a professor at [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:08.511 --> 00:46:10.507
He brings his class out
and makes field trips

00:46:10.507 --> 00:46:12.004
at the farm, and stuff.

00:46:12.004 --> 00:46:14.665
And he told me-- he was
out checking the plants

00:46:14.665 --> 00:46:16.744
and he goes, I need
you to know how

00:46:16.744 --> 00:46:18.990
you've changed Phil's farming.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.734
And I'm immediately going,
oh, God, what did my dogs

00:46:21.734 --> 00:46:23.980
do, or did the goats
get out, you know?

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.473
He goes, the pests are
down, the noxious weeds

00:46:27.473 --> 00:46:32.962
have come to a halt, the
ground squirrels are managed.

00:46:32.962 --> 00:46:37.453
In this book, they did
a story about my farm,

00:46:37.453 --> 00:46:40.279
and we use these huge dogs.

00:46:40.279 --> 00:46:41.445
And you guys can have these.

00:46:41.445 --> 00:46:42.942
I brought them for you.

00:46:42.942 --> 00:46:44.938
I don't know if you
can see that very well,

00:46:44.938 --> 00:46:47.100
but if you pass
that around and you

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.030
look in with the
sheep and goats,

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.740
there's dogs of equal size.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.690
So, I've told the coyotes,
you can't eat here.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:47:00.479
But, I do have something
to recreate what they do.

00:47:00.479 --> 00:47:01.145
What do they do?

00:47:01.145 --> 00:47:03.125
They hunt the ground
squirrels everywhere.

00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:04.610
We don't have an overpopulation.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:06.590
We haven't killed them off.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.570
They're still there,
but they're managed.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.550
Just like how the
coyotes would be.

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:12.530
Same thing with the rabbits.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.015
And that's what Doug told me.

00:47:14.015 --> 00:47:18.222
They're losing less
produce, because I've

00:47:18.222 --> 00:47:21.686
replicated a natural environment
with my sheep-- it's not

00:47:21.686 --> 00:47:26.390
going to eat my
sheep, but [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:30.350
But, it comes back to you guys
talking about people like us.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.825
Someone like Becky,
who's willing to be

00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:35.795
the face of all of us farmers.

00:47:35.795 --> 00:47:37.280
It's huge what she's doing.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.414
And my gosh, you should have
her coffee and the honey.

00:47:40.414 --> 00:47:41.410
Oh my goodness.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.900
And that olive oil
really is the best.

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.892
Did you tell them about
what else she's doing?

00:47:45.892 --> 00:47:47.672
BECKY HERBERT: No, I haven't.

00:47:47.672 --> 00:47:48.880
LISA KNUTSON: Is it a secret?

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.862
BECKY HERBERT: No. [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:50.862 --> 00:47:53.362
LISA KNUTSON: OK, well I'm going
to tell you the rest of it.

00:47:53.362 --> 00:47:57.844
So this girl-- the [INAUDIBLE]
-- I show up at Mountainview.

00:47:57.844 --> 00:48:00.334
And I go walking, because it's
a long ways to the restroom.

00:48:00.334 --> 00:48:02.824
And I'm looking at all
this, and I see, what?

00:48:02.824 --> 00:48:03.820
The South Side Road?

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.812
She's 10 minutes from my house.

00:48:05.812 --> 00:48:08.302
We didn't know
each other existed.

00:48:08.302 --> 00:48:10.792
So, she has taken
this olive orchard,

00:48:10.792 --> 00:48:14.278
and she's put in
those brick ovens.

00:48:14.278 --> 00:48:16.768
She's baking bread
that she grinds

00:48:16.768 --> 00:48:18.760
the organic grain herself.

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.752
She uses her olive oil.

00:48:20.752 --> 00:48:22.863
She makes bread that
you can't believe.

00:48:22.863 --> 00:48:24.238
And she was right
in my backyard,

00:48:24.238 --> 00:48:26.728
and I had to come clear
over there to find her.

00:48:26.728 --> 00:48:28.720
And so she's going
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:32.206 --> 00:48:36.688
But she's [INAUDIBLE] going
to help Joe and I stay.

00:48:36.688 --> 00:48:41.668
Because the practices that
we do, they're a lot of work.

00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:45.652
It's a lot of work, and to
have someone that is out here,

00:48:45.652 --> 00:48:50.134
attracting the view to what
she's got going for us.

00:48:50.134 --> 00:48:53.620
Because it takes a lot
of us to get this going.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.106
If you talk about
what you heard today,

00:48:57.106 --> 00:49:02.335
it's going to drive the
people that are only

00:49:02.335 --> 00:49:06.070
looking at money to start
looking at doing things better.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:08.062
The pride is worth
more, and people

00:49:08.062 --> 00:49:10.801
do pay more, because they
know how much time it

00:49:10.801 --> 00:49:13.870
takes for us to produce that.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:14.536
That make sense?

00:49:14.536 --> 00:49:15.532
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:49:15.532 --> 00:49:20.498
So, if I may interrupt,
we are starting

00:49:20.498 --> 00:49:25.325
to run out of time in
the hour. [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:25.325 --> 00:49:28.542
But, for those of
us like me, who

00:49:28.542 --> 00:49:31.265
have official things that
we have to do at noon,

00:49:31.265 --> 00:49:34.235
I just wanted to bring things
to a close, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:34.235 --> 00:49:38.410
But I want to thank
Lisa, Joe, Jack, Becky,

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.060
Mark, for setting all of this
up, you guys for coming down.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.860
Thank you so much for coming by.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:48.577
It's been amazing to
hear you guys talk.

00:49:48.577 --> 00:49:50.160
Please join me in a
round of applause.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.710
[APPLAUSE]
