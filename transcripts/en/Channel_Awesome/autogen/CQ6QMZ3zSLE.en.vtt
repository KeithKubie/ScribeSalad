this guy does not have self-control
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.290
this guy does not have self-control
that's one of the reasons he became this

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300
that's one of the reasons he became this
 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.399

has fire coming at him and Aang it's not
powerful enough so he has to use his wit

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789
powerful enough so he has to use his wit
 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.300
powerful enough so he has to use his wit
and he remembers what he said that he

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310
and he remembers what he said that he
 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.700
and he remembers what he said that he
was a student and he did not have

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710
was a student and he did not have
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.939
was a student and he did not have
self-control so I like that he used his

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949
self-control so I like that he used his
 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.309
self-control so I like that he used his
knowledge of his own self-control and

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319
knowledge of his own self-control and
 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.189
knowledge of his own self-control and
his own anger in his own frustration to

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199
his own anger in his own frustration to
 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.279
his own anger in his own frustration to

taunting him saying how bad his powers
 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.909
taunting him saying how bad his powers

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:07.230
he's not even feeling it and make him

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240
matter matter because we get more and
 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.879
matter matter because we get more and
more angry get more and more stupid and

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889
more angry get more and more stupid and

he burns the ships and they have no way

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729
he burns the ships and they have no way
 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.269

to get back so that that was nicely good

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279
to get back so that that was nicely good
 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.860
to get back so that that was nicely good
I like how that all tied together

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870
I like how that all tied together
 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.300
I like how that all tied together
I wish there could have been a little

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
I wish there could have been a little
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.610
I wish there could have been a little
bit more time if they if they took out

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620
bit more time if they if they took out
 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.529
bit more time if they if they took out
the carnival they probably could had a

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539
the carnival they probably could had a
 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.320
the carnival they probably could had a
little bit more time to dedicate to that

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330
little bit more time to dedicate to that
 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.490
little bit more time to dedicate to that
and some of these things would have

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500
and some of these things would have
 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.719
and some of these things would have
connected a little better but they

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729
connected a little better but they
 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:31.499
connected a little better but they
connected okay um so it is a good

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509
connected okay um so it is a good
 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.680
connected okay um so it is a good
episode and it goes a little bit

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690
episode and it goes a little bit
 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.060
episode and it goes a little bit
the filler because I think it gives a

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070
the filler because I think it gives a
 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.980
the filler because I think it gives a
little background just into the nature

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990
little background just into the nature
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.040
little background just into the nature
of the fire nation without necessarily

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050
of the fire nation without necessarily
 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.710
of the fire nation without necessarily
having to spell it out for you I think

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720
having to spell it out for you I think
 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.170
having to spell it out for you I think
this episode even if you don't explain

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180
this episode even if you don't explain
 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.790
this episode even if you don't explain
too much else I'm sure they will go into

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800
too much else I'm sure they will go into
 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.050
too much else I'm sure they will go into
more detail but even if you don't

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060
more detail but even if you don't
 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.960
more detail but even if you don't
explain too much else you understand how

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:50.970
explain too much else you understand how
 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.990
explain too much else you understand how
the Fire Nation took over just by the

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000
the Fire Nation took over just by the
 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.490
the Fire Nation took over just by the
nature of fire and what they are I don't

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500
nature of fire and what they are I don't
 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.020
nature of fire and what they are I don't
know if it's born with or whatever but

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030
know if it's born with or whatever but
 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.450
know if it's born with or whatever but
what they're growing up with so that's I

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460
what they're growing up with so that's I
 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.010
what they're growing up with so that's I
found that very fascinating if they do

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020
found that very fascinating if they do
 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.830
found that very fascinating if they do
give more detail great but they have it

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840
give more detail great but they have it
 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.230
give more detail great but they have it
set and I thought just by these little

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240
set and I thought just by these little
 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.420
set and I thought just by these little
hints and not even saying this is why

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:11.430
hints and not even saying this is why
 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.890
hints and not even saying this is why
the Fire Nation is like this just saying

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900
the Fire Nation is like this just saying
 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.410
the Fire Nation is like this just saying
this is what fire is like I thought that

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420
this is what fire is like I thought that
 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.540
this is what fire is like I thought that
was a very clever way of actually

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550
was a very clever way of actually
 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.840
was a very clever way of actually
showing a lot of human nature in a sense

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850
showing a lot of human nature in a sense
 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.150
showing a lot of human nature in a sense
if you were growing up with this power

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160
if you were growing up with this power
 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.980
if you were growing up with this power
you probably be a little bit of a bully

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990
you probably be a little bit of a bully
 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.320
you probably be a little bit of a bully
