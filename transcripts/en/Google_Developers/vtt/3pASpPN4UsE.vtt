DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there, I'm
Daniel Sieberg, as we continue

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.140
with day two of I/O Live.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.410
We find ourselves in the
Google Maps sandbox.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.860
And I am joined right now
by Mike from Envista.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.530
How are you, Mike?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.510
Good to see you.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.470
So talk to me a little bit about
how you tapped into the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.420
Google Maps API.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.280
Your overlaying a lot of really
civic information with

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.950
regards to, say, city planning,
or construction.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.530
Give me an overview of
what Envista's all

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.350
about first of all.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.690
MIKE WALSH: Sure.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.990
Envista is about putting
business data for both our

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.720
municipalities and utilities
onto a geolocated map.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.230
In this case, we've use Maps
Engine underneath to take some

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.090
of their static data,
including pipeline

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.110
information, and things like
that, and overlay dynamic

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.040
information.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.740
As you can see, our project we
actually highlighted brings up

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.730
both the project information and
the contractors that are

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.290
working on it.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.420
So the unified collection of
business data and geolocated

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.220
data allows us to share
it between utilities,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.920
municipalities, different
departments, different

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.610
audiences, including the
public, eventually.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: And what
is this hoping

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.120
to solve, in a sense?

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.290
I mean, previous to this, or if
a city planner didn't have

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.060
access to this information,
what might happen?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.670
Confusion between different
groups?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.180
MIKE WALSH: Yeah, the biggest
thing we find is that data's

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.680
spread out across different
organizations

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.730
and different systems.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.450
This platform, the combination
of Maps Engine and our own

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.500
tool set allows us to provide
the services to bring that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.920
information together.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.330
We talk about collaboration
around geolocated assets.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.700
But it really comes down to
being able to share the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.500
information between the people
who need it, and in the end,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.660
try and solve some problems,
like who's working on which

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.590
project where?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.500
When's it going on?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.650
And what's it going to impact?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.500
DANIEL SIEBERG: Can you give
us a little bit of a closer

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.470
view of what we're looking
at on the screen here?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.690
MIKE WALSH: Sure.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.380
If we look at here, we have the
straight, solid lines here

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.450
represents different projects,
by a particular gas

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.580
company in this case.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.610
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK,
right in here?

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.960
MIKE WALSH: Over here?

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.080
The big area here is actually
transmission lines.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.380
And that buffer zone is places
where they have to be aware

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.295
that if there's a facility, like
a hospital or a school,

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:52.730
that needs to be evacuated, they
need to have coordination

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.960
with the first responders in
a plan to get people out of

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.350
there during an evacuation.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.740
So that information together
allows them to do some

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.810
planning when they
have a project.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.280
You know, what are we
going to impact when

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.660
we go into the ground?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.870
So that type of information
is what's on the map.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.300
But they also have a lot of
information in this case.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.120
Project information coming
from the work management

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.770
system is represented
down here, as well

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.810
as the contact list.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750
As I said, which subcontractors
are actually

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.240
working on this, and who needs
access to see the information

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720
for this particular project.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Walk me through
what the development

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.190
process was like for you guys.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130
Any learnings you had along the
way, something you want to

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.180
share with other developers?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.780
Yeah, I think the big thing is
we saw Maps Engine back this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.800
time last year at I/O, and
discovered that because it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.110
does such a good job of getting
the base map and our

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.370
custom data represented in
the map and with great

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.780
performance, regardless of
scale, it was a great starting

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.305
point for us.

00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:44.410
So we started there.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.570
And then on the browser side, we
actually used the Maps API

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.770
to do some-- as I said, the
dynamic drawing on top gets us

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.470
access to the information
to do the coordination.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.180
So when we click on a feature
here, for instance, we can get

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.320
to the same information
on the business side.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.630
So the ability to use both the
backend server services by

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.380
Maps Engine, and on the client
side and the browser allows us

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.540
to put together some pretty
powerful tools for our

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.280
application.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.195
DANIEL SIEBERG: Where has
been adopted so far?

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.700
I know you've got some use cases
listed on your website.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.200
But--

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.090
MIKE WALSH: Yeah,
we just started.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.530
We have a handful of utilities
that have agreed to start

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.080
working with the platform
for us.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.960
We also have a number
of cities that

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.900
started working it.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.020
And because it's relatively
new, we've had a lot of

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.080
encouraging feedback about the
ability to bring different

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.700
parts together.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.410
So we expect to have a lot of
good success in the second

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.010
half of it.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.600
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.420
Thank you so much for giving
insight to this, Mike.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.720
Really appreciate it.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.510
All the best.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.210
MIKE WALSH: Thank you.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.900
DANIEL SIEBERG: We continue our
tour in the Google Maps

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.180
sandbox with Ben from this
little known school, Harvard,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.560
I think you called it.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.320
Harvard University.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.135
And a fascinating project that
you've been working on called

00:03:45.135 --> 00:03:47.460
the Harvard WorldMap.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.990
Tell me a little bit about
it from some a high level

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.990
overview, first of all.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.840
Explain to people what
it's all about.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.350
BEN LEWIS: Sure.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.640
So the vision behind WorldMap
is, what if everybody in the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.740
world could upload big,
geospatial data to the cloud,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.790
analyze it, overlay it.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.410
control access to it, and
collaborate around it, such

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.620
that we can generate
new knowledge?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.899
So why would Harvard want to
open something like this up to

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.220
the entire world to
upload data to?

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.210
Well, it turns out that most of
the best data in the world

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.760
isn't actually at Harvard.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.050
So build a great platform, and
people come and use it.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.450
And everybody will win, is sort
of basically the idea.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, fantastic.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.460
Well, let's just
see an example.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.200
This is the actual WorldMap
site, first of all.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.540
So people can actually upload
their own mapping data, if

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.720
they'd like, to their
geospatial data?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.110
BEN LEWIS: Right.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.990
So anybody can come in here,
create a map, and be brought

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.890
into a blank template, start
adding data layers in about

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.260
five different ways, uploading
data from the hard drive,

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.980
creating layers and digitizing
online, uploading scanned

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.270
maps, and georeferencing them
online using Map Warper.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.940
This was developed by a company
called Entropy Free.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.240
It's an open source online
georeferencing platform.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.220
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then you've
got an example, if you

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.770
can pull up the Africa map.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.490
This is a researcher at Harvard
who worked on this

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.300
particular project?

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.930
BEN LEWIS: Yes.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.170
So this was developed by a
Professor named Suzanne Blier.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.520
And she uses this to gather
together in one place all of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.290
the valuable map data
sets on Africa.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.440
He's got hundreds of data layers
here, from ethnicity to

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.220
social conflict, health,
historic mapping,

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.670
transatlantic slave trade.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.990
This is ethnographic mapping
for the continent.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Using
Google Maps API.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.000
BEN LEWIS: Google Maps API
is behind all of this.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.270
So down at the bottom here,
you'll see one has a choice of

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.030
lots of different Google
Map bases.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you can pick
and choose which filters

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.060
you'd like two render
on the map.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.820
You can zoom in to different
regions.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.350
BEN LEWIS: Right.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.830
So all of these can be styled.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.600
There's a sophisticated styling
interface here.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640
You can overlay one
with another.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.580
So this is ethnicities
now overlaid

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.780
upon population density.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.410
And we could zoom in and out.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.020
And this goes down to a very
fine level of detail.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fascinating stuff.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.250
Now, let's just move on to
maybe the Twitter health

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.170
trends that you were talking
about earlier.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.750
BEN LEWIS: So AfricaMap Map is
sort of a typical mapping

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.650
application that somebody's
built from scratch without

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.990
having to be a developer.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.040
This is kind of the future
direction of WorldMap.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.235
This is a platform that's
being called Geops.

00:06:49.235 --> 00:06:52.290
It was developed by
Todd Mostak--

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.250
who's a researcher
at Harvard--

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.460
together with us.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.750
This is about big data, big
geospatial data on the web.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.450
It uses a couple of GPUs to
make possible on the fly

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.660
queries and heatmap generation
for 125 million tweets.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.700
So those are the tweets
themselves.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: So
you can see them

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.250
represented on the map there.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.550
BEN LEWIS: Do you mind if
I do one query here?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Sure.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.980
BEN LEWIS: So let's
try, tornado.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.270
DANIEL SIEBERG: So these are
people tweeting about a

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.560
particular event.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.010
BEN LEWIS: Exactly.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.315
References, say, to tornadoes.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.130
DANIEL SIEBERG: Well, that's
really cool stuff.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:39.600
So then if people want
to check this out,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.770
where can they go?

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.580
BEN LEWIS: This isn't
live, yet.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: But the original
stuff we talked

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.060
about, worldmap.harvard.edu?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.140
BEN LEWIS: Everything
else is live.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.250
Yeah, this will be live
within a month.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: So
worldmap.harvard.edu, though,

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.480
is the original site?

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.880
BEN LEWIS: Worldmap.harvard.edu.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, great.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.080
Thank you so much.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:54.910
BEN LEWIS: Thank you.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.760
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, we're
joined now by Steve, who

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.250
may be familiar to many folks.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.940
Formerly with Reddit, now a
co-founder and CTO within

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.830
Hipmunk, an increasingly popular
travel app for folks,

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.420
and a travel site where you can
book flights and hotels.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.600
But today, we are, of course,
going to focus on Google Maps,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.530
and how you tie that in with
people's hotel booking.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.990
So walk me through what
we're looking at here.

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.490
STEVE HUFFMAN: OK, sure.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.650
So this is our main
map display.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.860
And so what we have here is a
search that we did in San

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.080
Francisco for a weekend
or two from now.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.450
As you see, it's dominated by
the map, because we felt that

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.880
knowing where you're saying is
probably the most important

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.100
thing-- especially if you've
never been to a city before--

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.814
just kind of intuitively seeing
the geography, the lay

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:37.169
of the land.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.260
So we represent the hotels as
dots on this grid here.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.179
And the reason we lay things out
on the grid is if we had

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.320
showed every hotel in the city,
it would just be a big

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.270
splotch of dots.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.740
DANIEL SIEBERG: And you wouldn't
get the relations to

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.110
where everything
else is, right?

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.430
STEVE HUFFMAN: You know, what's
beneficial about the

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.990
splotch of dots is that you
can see kind of where big

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.550
streets are.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.630
But on Hipmunk, we've kind
of split the difference.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.670
And you can see Lombard Street
here is a popular

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.040
neighborhood, and Fisherman's
Wharf.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.550
And then here, the Tenderloin,
or as we would describe it to

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.360
tourists, the hotel district.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.890
And that gives us a nice feel.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.270
And then we do is we basically
take the top 10 hotels as

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.580
sorted by Ecstasy, and
we highlight those.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.690
So those are the hotels we
think you should stay on,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.200
basically based on the area
you're looking at, the price

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.840
of those hotels, the quality
and review scores.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.320
DANIEL SIEBERG: And for people
who know Hipmunk, that's a

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.660
reference to the Agony
and Ecstasy rankings.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:28.980
STEVE HUFFMAN: Right.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.830
When you do a flight search,
we sort by Agony.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.040
And a hotel search is Ecstasy.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.440
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.490
So then these dots here, the
other ones are represented as

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.220
different colors.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.430
That's all tied in
to this ranking.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.420
STEVE HUFFMAN: So
we've basically

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.220
got three price buckets.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.830
The green are the cheapest
hotels, the red are the most

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.880
expensive, and the blue
are the average ones.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.730
Now, you can filter these down,
if you just want to see

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.330
cheap hotels, for example.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.690
By default, we just
show everything.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.820
And we let the Ecstasy
sort do the rest.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.350
Now, what's cool about these
buckets is it varies by city.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.430
What's cheap in San
Francisco is

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.440
nonexistent in New York City.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.080
And the town i grew in Virginia,
you know, $140 is

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.850
probably the most expensive
hotel you're going to find.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.790
So we try to give you a sense,
though, of what the value is.

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.150
Are you paying the market rate
or not, effectively.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.370
Any offerings to other
developers on the experience

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.370
you went through, using
the Maps API?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.470
STEVE HUFFMAN: Sure.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.750
There's something about the
Maps API that are really,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.290
really nice.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.260
I mean, obviously, the
maps themselves work.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.100
You get all this dragging
and zooming and all

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.200
that stuff for free.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.170
One of the cool features
we added is heatmaps.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.370
So we computed heatmaps
of all the hot

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.670
places to be in a city.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.600
Right now, I have the food
heatmap turned on.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.080
And it's actually really cool.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.445
We just computed these
tiles, name them

00:10:41.445 --> 00:10:42.410
with a special format.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.270
And then Google Maps does the
rest, lays them out, loads

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.370
them, all the different
zoom levels.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.900
It's actually really neat.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.740
And we got the most, like, bang
out of that feature for

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.910
developer hours, ever.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.540
It was actually really
simple to do.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.440
But it looks really,
really awesome.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.110
And that's really cool.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.920
There's some other
stuff we do.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.790
Actually, I'll turn on
my calendar here.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:10.740
This integrates with my Google
Calendar, which is another

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:11.670
Google API.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.760
And then I can show, in the
city, where I need to be.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.060
So if you're a business traveler
and you've got things

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.075
do, you can actually see.

00:11:19.075 --> 00:11:20.710
DANIEL SIEBERG: So you could
almost know if you need to

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.720
walk. or you could just
walk somewhere.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:21.960
STEVE HUFFMAN: Exactly.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.900
And if I click the sort by
distance here, I can choose

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.670
one of events.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:28.680
And it'll show me just hotels
near that event.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.810
Or it'll take the hotels near
that event, and then sort them

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:31.445
by Ecstasy.

00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:32.230
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.316
All right.

00:11:32.316 --> 00:11:33.350
Well, Steve, thank
you so much.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.480
Full disclosure, I used Hipmunk
to find my way here

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.030
from New York.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.460
So thank you so much
for that demo.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.180
Appreciate it.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.480
And we finish up our tour in the
Google Maps sandbox with

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.070
Peter, who is a Product Manager
with Google Earth.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.820
And in a sense, we are going
to get our own personal

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.670
helicopter tour here, right?

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:50.420
PETER BIRCH: Absolutely.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.660
So we're really excited.

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.150
Yesterday, here at I/O, we
announced the launch of this

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.530
new 3D imagery technology
in Google

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.040
Earth for Android devices.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.100
And behind us, here, we have a
demonstration showing what

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.075
some of this imagery actually
looks like in what we call our

00:12:09.075 --> 00:12:13.360
Liquid Galaxy, which is this
great way to view this data.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.660
But what's going on here is
that Google Earth has been

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.930
around for a long time.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.400
We've been doing 3D for years.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.980
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right, people
are already familiar with 3D

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.880
buildings, maybe the 3D
Warehouse or something.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.680
But now--

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.200
PETER BIRCH: Absolutely.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.780
So now what we really realized
was that we needed to step it

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.540
up a notch, right?

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.150
We really needed to increase
the scale, the consistency,

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.610
and the coverage of
the 3D buildings.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.180
And we just really needed to
figure out how to notch it up.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.370
And so what we're doing is we
have this new 3D imagery,

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.250
where we're actually using
aerial imagery from planes,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:50.300
where they shoot four
different angles.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.570
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's very
specific patterns that they

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.060
have to fly to gather
all of this?

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.135
PETER BIRCH: Exactly.

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:55.870
So we shoot, basically,
forwards, back, left, right,

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.830
and then straight down.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.580
So there's a fifth shot
that's straight down.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.220
And then from that,
we're able to

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.240
automatically generate 3D data.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:09.340
So the things you're looking at
here is all auto generated

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.760
using something called
stereophotogrammetry, where

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.370
we're actually using the
different images to extract

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.920
the 3D data.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.160
And then we actually take that
and we texture it, or we sort

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.020
of color of the geometry
with the actual photos.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: I almost think
of as like digital sculpting,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.280
or something.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.210
But it's pretty amazing
looking.

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.510
PETER BIRCH: Yeah, I mean, it's
phenomenal how far the

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:34.780
technology has gone, and being
able to have the resources of

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.710
not only the talented engineers
at Google, but also

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.900
the infrastructure that we have
that allows us to build

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.160
3D models at this scale
automatically.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.340
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.920
Now, we're seeing this on bigger
screens, thanks to

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.480
Liquid Galaxy.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.650
But in your hand, you've
got a tablet.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:54.360
And so folks can check this out
in a mobile way, both for

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.310
tablets and phones as well.

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.760
PETER BIRCH: Absolutely.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.200
And what I have right
here, this is a

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.810
Motorola XOOM tablet.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.750
And I don't know if your
viewers will get

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.510
the best view this.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.580
So the best way for people to
check this out is to download

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.670
it onto your Android device,
whether it's

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.890
a phone or a tablet.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.140
It's supported on multicore
phones.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.790
So for example, the great Galaxy
Nexus, as well as a

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.580
Samsung Galaxy 2, and the new
3, and a bunch of other

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.980
devices, as well as, obviously,
the new Nexus 7,

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.090
which we just released.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.620
Works fantastic on
that as well.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Coming soon to
iOS, if people are curious.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.290
PETER BIRCH: And it is coming
soon to iOS as well.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.430
So here you can see,
I'm actually

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.060
going through San Francisco.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.030
We've launched about a dozen or
so cities and metro areas,

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:51.540
including San Francisco, LA,
Portland, Rome, Tampa.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.880

more to come, I assume.

more to come.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.850
We got Charlotte, we've
got a bunch more.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.320
And we've stated that we're
going to have the communities

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.870
of over 300 million
people covered by

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:03.670
the end of this year.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.460
And we're going to just
keep going from there.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.570
So we're really excited about
being able to bring this kind

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.970
of 3D technology to people
around the world.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: And I'm sure
lots of folks will look

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.750

at some point.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.350

helicopter now here in the
