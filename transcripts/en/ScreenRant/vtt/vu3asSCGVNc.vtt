00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.879
Trailers have come a long way since the days
of voice over narrator Don LaFontaine who

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.140
would spell out the setup for a film in plain
detail (while a sizzle real of funny moments,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.970
explosions, or heartfelt scenes of dramatic
tension flashed on screen).

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.780
Movie trailers have become increasingly revealing
- packed full of eye-popping visual spectacle

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.630
and story details that spoil major reveals
and twists.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.480
Here are Screen Rants Best Movie Scenes &amp; Twists
Spoiled by Trailers

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.480
Cast Away

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.830
The Trailer: Despite a dramatic buildup to
Noland's attempted escape, the trailer for

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.820
the film made it clear that, not only does
our hero find rescue, the footage outright

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.269
shows Noland's bittersweet reunion with Frears.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.540
Whether the reunion is a happy one, or not,
is left for filmgoers to discover but Noland

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.550
and Frears' relationship status is about the
only major plot development that isn't covered

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.969
in the trailer.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.969
Dream House

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.770
The Trailer: The trailer wastes no time in
revealing the film's biggest twist, that Atenton

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.870
is a fake identity Ward concocted in psychiatric
care - to hide from the tragedy of his family's

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.870
murder.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.750
While the film isn't quite as blatant about
revealing that his wife and daughter are apparitions

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
(rather than manifestations of his fractured
mind), a trailer shot of ghost Libby opening

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.409
the basement door plays a key part in the
movie's supernatural reveal.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.409
REC /Quarantine

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.500
The Trailer: While REC (and its American remake
Quarantine) borrow heavily from superior zombie/rabies

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.479
outbreak movies, their trailers still manage
to ruin one major surprise- the fate of Angela

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.049
Vidal (which occurs in the closing moments
of the 2007 Spanish film and its 2008 remake).

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.409
While Quarantine wasn't the first horror movie
to spoil the fate of a main character or use

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.009
a climactic scene in trailers (we're looking
at you Paranormal Activity), given that Vidal's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.220
screaming face is also plastered on Quarantine's
posters, it's still a pretty crass and unrepentant

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.290
marketing move (even by Hollywood's standards).

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.060
Terminator: Salvation

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.020
The Trailer: The trailer for the film spends
half of its runtime setting up the post-Judgement

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.390
Day setting (as well as John Connor's�guerrilla
rebellion against the�machines) and the

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.260
other half outright spoiling not only the
film's most interesting twist (a Terminator

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.159
that doesn't�know he's a Terminator).

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.680
Yet, the preview doesn't stop there - since
it also lays out�Wright's entire�character�arc

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.569
- specifically that�he chooses his human
friends over his machine creators by the end.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.819
The Island

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.159
The Trailer: While the Island trailer doesn't
outright spoil why Lincoln and Jordan were

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.370
created, the footage makes it crystal-clear
that the pair�are cloned "products" - and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.909
that the Island is a cover tale�to disguise
the compound's true purpose (extending the

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:02.140
lifespan�of wealthy customers by harvesting
organs from living clones).

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.140
Free Willy

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.849
The Trailer: Given that Free Willy is a feel-good
kids movie, it's no surprise that Jesse succeeds

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.290
in freeing Willy; yet, trailers for the film
left little suspense or doubt to the imagination

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.690
- since the previews (and poster) place the
final sequence front and center.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.000
Additionally, the�Free Willy trailers don't
just spoil how�Jesse succeeds in liberating�the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.130
titular whale, they also spell-out�every
up and down in the�boy's�transformation

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.630
from a selfish and insecure kid to a sensitive
and thoughtful caretaker.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:32.970
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.730
The Trailer:�While not an outright spoiler,�Dawn
of the Planet of the Apes� trailers put

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.250
heavy emphasis on several key sequences - that
made it clear who would be responsible for

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.510
violating the human/ape truce.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.190
The most egregious example of spoilery Apes
marketing was�the use of�Koba (played

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.290
Toby Kebbel) placating human enemies with
circus-like ape tricks -�easily one of the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.439
best moments in Dawn of the Planet of the
Apes.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.040
Understandably, 20th Century Fox knew that
such a clever movie�moment would tempt casual

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.150
viewers�into theaters but there's no doubt
that the overall impact of the scene (a significant�turning

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.629
point in Koba's character arc)�was undercut
by pre-release previews that, across the board,

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.959
played�the sequence near-shot for�shot.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.930
Oblivion

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.860
The Trailer:�The Oblivion trailer makes
it apparent that�the presumed villains of

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.560
the movie, the Skavs, are not aliens - they
are human freedom fighters waging a guerrilla

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.470
war against an unseen�force.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.280
Led by Malcolm Beech�(played by Morgan Freeman),
the Skavs explain�that�the film�s hero,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.940
Jack Harper, has been manipulated�by their
enemy - and is, unknowingly, working against

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.690
the survival of his fellow humans.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.840
Thankfully, the Oblivion trailers refrain
from spoiling one of the film's biggest twists,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.400
specifically Harper�s backstory�but,�with
the reveal of the Skavs's identity, it wasn't

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.620
hard for savvy sci-fi�moviegoers�to fill
in the remaining puzzle pieces ahead of director�Joseph

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.300
Kosinski.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.990
Ransom�

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.259
The Trailer: In order to position�Ransom
as a deviation�from standard�kidnapping

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.250
thrillers,�the studio put a heavy emphasis
on Tom Mullen's unorthodox approach to�finding

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:18.100
Sean - 
outright spoiling one of the film's most interesting

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.500
developments (as well as several tense standoffs
that came before it).

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.900
Instead, the trailer plays coy with another
twist, one that is revealed in the first 15

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.120
minutes: Gary Sinise's Detective Shaker is
actually the�film's primary villain/hostage

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.120
taker.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.210
The Avengers

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.610
The Trailer:�After "killing" Agent Coulson
to galvanize the superhero team forward, it

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.639
was unlikely that another key Avenger would
fall in Marvel's first multi-hero team-up

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.069
film; yet, director Joss Whedon played-up
Tony Stark's scene of sacrifice as if it were

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.560
a real possibility that the�Avenger might
not make it back to Stark Tower (and Pepper

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.560
Potts)�alive.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.539
Unfortunately, The Avengers trailer undercut
any suspense, since it included a memorable�shot

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.169
of Hulk successfully leaping into the air
and�catching�a�powered down Iron Man,

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.110
sucking any�tension out of the film's climactic
moment (at least for anyone who bothered to

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.110
watch the preview more than once).
