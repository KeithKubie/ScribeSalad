00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:10.280
The Truth About The Surprisingly Recent Invention
Of The Tea Bag

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.110
Legend says that brewing tea dates back to
around 2737 BC, when tea leaves fell into

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.550
water being boiled for Emperor Shennong of
China.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.109
There does not appear to be any hard evidence
of tea being discovered this way, but evidence

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:28.860
we do have suggests that brewing tea did indeed
likely start in China, first as part of a

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.070
medicinal elixir.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.050
The first documented reference to this is
found during the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC to

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.110
1046 BC).

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.269
By the Qin Dynasty in the third century BC,
it had become a relatively popular drink using

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.660
just the tea (camellia sinensis), rather than
mixed with other things as seems to have been

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.350
common when used medicinally.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.190
From the beginning until the early 20th century,
very little innovation came about in terms

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.989
of the common method of brewing tea.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.970
This all changed in 1901.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.300
Contrary to popular belief (and what every
single tea manufacturer I could find said

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.651
on their websites, and many-a-tea history
book and paper consulted also stated), it

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:11.030
was not tea merchant Thomas Sullivan who invented
the tea bag in 1908.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.030
While he did (probably independently, given
his reported design was quite inferior to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.300
the original) invent a tea bag that year,
he was beat out by about seven years by Roberta

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.700
C. Lawson and Mary Molaren of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.300
On August 26, 1901, the two intrepid women
filed a patent (US723287) for a rather unique

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.540
(at the time) “Tea-Leaf Holder” that is
remarkably similar to the modern tea bag.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.890
They had identified an issue with the way
tea had been commonly brewed for thousands

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.890
of years.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.680
In their own words, the traditional method
of having to brew a whole pot at a time,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.500
involves the use of a considerable quantity
of tea-leaves to prepare the desired supply

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.090
of tea, and the tea, if not used directly,
soon becomes stale or wanting in freshness,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.200
and therefore unsatisfactory, and frequently
a large portion of the tea thus prepared and

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.390
not used directly has to be thrown away, thus
involving much waste and corresponding expense.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.240
tea-bag2Thus, they invented an open-meshed
woven cotton bag, “folded over upon itself

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.500
and stitched along its side edges, forming
a pocket-like construction having a flap at

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.590
its open end… with the flap at the upper
end folded down over the top end of the pocket

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.590
and inclosed…”

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.280
A small portion of tea was then contained
inside the enclosed cotton-mesh bag and allowed

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.010
the preparer to place it “in a cup and have
water poured thereon to produce only a cup

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.010
of tea fresh for immediate use.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.610
By this means only so much of tea-leaves is
used as is required for the single cup of

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.370
tea, and thereby a cup of fresh.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.070
fragrant tea is prepared…”

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.120
About two years after the ladies filed their
patent, it was granted on March 24, 1903.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.910
However, seemingly they were unsuccessful
at bringing this to market, at least on any

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.560
widespread scale that would have registered
in documented history.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.260
This brings us to Thomas Sullivan.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.750
Sullivan worked as a tea importer in New York
when he (supposedly) accidentally invented

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.220
tea bags in 1908.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.370
The story goes that Sullivan began sending
small silk bags containing samples of the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.790
various forms of tea he sold to his customers
as a way of encouraging sales.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.349
The “accident” part is that a number of
those people who he sent the bags of tea to

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.970
decided to use the bag as something of a tea
infuser, rather than opening the bags up and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.380
brewing the tea normally.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.480
As with Lawson and Molaren’s aforementioned
invention, this allowed a person to make a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.340
single cup of tea, rather than an entire pot,
and made for much more convenient clean up-

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.459
when done, simply toss the bag.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.720
No need to clean out all the tea leaves from
the pot and strainer or infuser.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.600
The little marketing campaign worked and orders
started rolling in, which Sullivan initially

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.440
filled via standard containers of loose-leaf
tea.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.879
Customers who had used the bags as infusers
complained and Sullivan soon began offering

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.760
his tea once again in bags.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.160
However, silk bags weren’t ideal for steeping
standard loose-leaf tea, due to being a little

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.569
too fine and expensive for single serve.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.770
He, thus, replaced the silk of the original
sample bags with gauze and then further tweaked

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.860
things for better steeping by filling the
tea bags with fannings, the broken tea stalks,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.340
and tea dust leftover from processing the
tea.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.010
Sullivan then began heavily marketing his
little innovation and the tea bag was on its

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.040
way to becoming a household staple.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.500
How much of this story is true is difficult
to discern.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.379
While it does appear there was a tea merchant
named Thomas Sullivan who helped popularize

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.140
selling tea in single-serve bags (as well
as in larger tea bags for brewing whole pots),

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.730
there seems to be little in the way of documented
evidence backing up the individual bits of

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.319
the oft-repeated story.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.310
Whatever the case, we do know that commercial
tea bags in the early days were not, on the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.639
whole, as good as Roberta Lawson and Mary
Molaren’s original design, other than perhaps

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.969
the later addition of a string to pull the
bags out of the hot water when steeping was

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:26.969
complete.

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:31.370
You see, early bags often used glue to seal
the tea in, rather than a folded, sewn bag.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.889
This glue then steeped along with the tea,
greatly affecting the flavor.

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.919
Various early fabrics used also often negatively
impacted the taste.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.719
However, despite many companies early designs
being less than ideal at producing the desired

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:46.050
taste, convenience won out, and, partially
thanks to WWI with certain countries’ soldiers

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.770
being given tea bags as part of their rations,
the tea bag began to rise in popularity significantly

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.110
by, and then during, the 1920s.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.360
However, while Americans relatively quickly
embraced the tea bag, the British viewed the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.160
invention with skepticism and a bit of upturned
noses.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.479
Shortages of the materials used to make tea
bags during World War II also helped keep

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.080
the tea bag unpopular in the UK, despite the
convenience factor and that by this time the

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.120
tea bag was mostly perfected in terms of limiting
its influence on the taste of the tea.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.819
However, when the 1950s hit, when products
making common household tasks easier began

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.729
becoming all the rage, the tea bag saw a huge
surge in popularity, and for the first time

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.809
started gaining traction in the UK.

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:31.050
By the late 1950s, the tea bag had gone from
virtually unavailable in the UK to controlling

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.509
about 3% of the market, beginning its slow
and steady climb.

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:40.159
As of 2008, tea bags made up 96% of the tea
market in the UK, a total surprisingly more

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:53.740
than in the United States around that same
time, where tea bags only held about a 90%

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.469
share vs. loose-leaf tea.
