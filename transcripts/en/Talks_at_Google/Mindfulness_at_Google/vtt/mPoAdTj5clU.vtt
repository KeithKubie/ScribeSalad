RACHEL O'MEARA:
Thanks for coming.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.640
I'm Rachel O'Meara,
and I'm really

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.880
excited today to
host Arjuna Ardagh.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.840
He's here to tell
us many things,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.150
to tell us a lot
about the technology

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.110
and our inner wisdom, and
how to really tap into that.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.150
So you're here today
to listen to him talk

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.310
about what it means
to be in the flow.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.080
And how do we get there.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.490
What does it mean when you're
at work here at Google?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.020
What does it mean in your life?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.960
What does it mean with
your relationships?

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.470
What does it mean
for any real reason

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.720
to live a little
more meaningfully?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.940
How many people here feel like
they're in the flow right now?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.680
Show of hands.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.450
Don't be shy.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.880
How many people are like,
what am I doing here?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.160
I just saw this poster.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.461
And I showed up.

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:53.960
OK.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.626
Well guess what?

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:55.800
We're all in the flow.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.540
We're all here today.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.460
Congratulations.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.210
So I know Arjuna
through a mutual friend.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.769
And I actually talked to
him a couple years ago.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.610
And we decided to bring
him in a couple months ago.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.700
And I'm really
excited, because I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.820
think he has a lot of really
great things to share with us.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.060
His latest book-- he's
actually written eight books--

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.590
that's quite an accomplishment.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.500
His latest book is
called "Better Than Sex."

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.860
It is actually not about
what you think it's about.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.190
It's about awakening coaching,
and what does that mean.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.580
And it actually
ties in very well

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.090
with the flow in terms of
how do we live more awake?

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.850
How do we feel more alive?

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.230
Because we all
want more of that.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.810
I'm pretty sure.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.172
So I am very excited
to introduce Arjuna.

00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:43.880
And he's going to tell
us a lot about it.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.540
So thank you for coming.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.730
Thank you for tuning in.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.190
And I will hand it over.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.690
Thank you.

00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:52.485
And we'll also have some
question time at the end

00:01:52.485 --> 00:01:54.960
as well.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.290
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Good afternoon.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.230
Good morning.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.800
Good middle of the day.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.680
I was-- I already have
been a fan of Google

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.479
for a long time in
terms of search engine,

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.020
being able to find
things on the web.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.740
But really, actually, Google's
achievements as a search engine

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.900
are nothing compared to
its achievements as a host.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.090
Because this is a
wonderful environment

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.450
and a very welcoming place.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.530
So we're going to talk today
about genius, I believe.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.237
Is that correct?

00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:30.320
The title of the talk is
the technology of genius?

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.005
Is that how was it was labeled?

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:34.380
We're going to
talk about genius.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.030
Actually, I feel like
genius is a topic

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.110
we don't want to get too
defined about, too comfortable

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.650
about it.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.110
It's an ongoing investigation.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.610
So actually in the
drive down in the car

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.830
while my friend, Jonathan,
was behind the wheel,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.360
I was coming up with
my latest version

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.220
of my understanding of genius.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.970
So I think of genius
as the capacity

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.810
to express things that
are new, the capacity

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.670
to bring forth ideas, an
embodiment of those ideas

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.640
in a way that's not been
done before, but in a way

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.500
that is aligned with
the collective solution

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.350
of humanity.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.250
See the point?

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.850
Because you can come up with
new ideas and new thoughts.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.704
But if it's completely
skewed with to where

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.120
way the rest of
humanity is going,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.130
no one's going to
take any notice.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.890
So an example, one of the
most obvious examples to me

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.330
of genius is Nicolaus
Copernicus, who

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.880
founded Dell computer
I think, was it?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.980
Nicolaus Copernicus back
in the 16th century,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.960
he had just the idea.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.480
It began just with an
inkling that perhaps there

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.560
was a way to explain the
erratic behavior of the planets.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.130
It appeared at that
time that the planets

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.880
were like billiard
balls just going

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.680
in bizarre directions at the
whim of some kind of creator

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.320
with ADD.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.030
And it was Nicolaus
Copernicus who

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.420
thought that maybe it could
be the other way around.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.200
Maybe, in fact,
instead of everything

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.660
going around the earth in a
completely unintelligible way,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.659
maybe, in fact, we
like the other planets,

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:16.700
are going around the sun.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.060
Which suddenly,
everything made sense.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.710
Copernicus' discovery was
not only about astronomy.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.550
It was about things
making sense.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.350
Was about a universe that
actually was intelligible.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.910
And this gave rise to
shifts in humanitarian,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.200
in art, in architecture.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.660
And all kinds of
fields were transformed

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.330
through this shift
in understanding.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.990
So that's an example of genius.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.020
Somebody who had the right
idea at the right time,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.430
but it was aligned with the
next shift for humanity anyway.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.660
So in a way, the same
thing is true of where

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.095
we are sitting today.

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:04.020
Or where I'm standing today,
and you're sitting today.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.380
Years ago, Larry and Sergey
had an idea originally,

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.660
an idea of how we could find
information in the emerging web

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.420
more efficiently, more easily.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.390
And it's turned into probably
the most successful technology

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.660
company in the world.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.680
So what is genius?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.880
What is it that allows
some people to have

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.830
the right idea at the right
time that just takes off

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.040
and is picked up everybody.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.990
And what is it that
causes other people to be

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.360
in a different disposition,
one more of cooperation

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.255
with those ideas,
or following ideas.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.790
And sometimes which could
to a feeling of frustration,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.040
or that there's more to
my life than I'm living.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.330
So what is the
mechanism of genius?

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.320
What is it that allows
this mysterious click

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.960
to happen when you're tapped
into something way bigger

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.940
than the conditioning
of your own mind?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.550
That's really been
the question that

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.850
has governed my entire
adult life, from being

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.470
a student at
Cambridge University.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.000
That was really what fascinated
me more than anything else.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.270
What is it that allows
us-- well first of all,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.370
what is it allows us to live
incredibly fulfilled lives?

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.700
What is the key that allows
some people under almost

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.600
any circumstance to be
living a life of no regret,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.030
to be living a life where
you're impassioned, where you're

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.350
on fire, where you
feel grateful easily.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.730
And what is it that
allows many other people

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.999
to be suffering, not always
for physical reasons,

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.540
but especially in
our culture, people

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.560
suffer more for
psychological reasons,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.180
for attitudinal
reasons more them

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.330
because they don't
have enough food

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:03.210
or water, or physical things.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.670
Initially in this
investigation, I

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.470
thought that
ultimate fulfillment

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.090
was to do with spirituality.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.480
Because a lot of the most
fulfilled people in our culture

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.230
have been mystics,
have been people

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.070
who have created spiritual
traditions or religions.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.760
But actually, when
we investigate it

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.300
in an objective way,
it's not always true.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.030
You can make your life
about spirituality.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.340
You can make your
life about meditation.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.795
Doesn't necessarily,
in a reliable way,

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:36.740
lead to fulfillment.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.830
So what else could it be?

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.320
Then I considered
maybe it's love.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.810
Maybe it's having
perfect relationships,

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.150
having the right spouse,
and the right 2.35 children,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.940
in the right suburb
of the right city.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.740
Maybe that's the
key to fulfillment.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.250
We don't have so long to go
into all the possibilities.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.170
And there are many
possible answers.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.980
But what seems to hit
the nail every time

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.830
is to drop into the
frequency of genius.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.470
When we fall into, as
Rachel was speaking,

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.622
when we fall into a
flow where you know

00:08:11.622 --> 00:08:13.170
you're doing the right thing.

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.800
You know you're creating
the right thing.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.350
You know that you're
contributing exactly what you

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.900
were born to contribute,
to contribute

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.160
to all of us moving forwards.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.970
That I would say,
whenever someone

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.410
falls into that frequency,
it's a reliable key

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.600
to a life of no regret, to a
life of complete fulfillment.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.890
So I want to talk to you here
about some essential keys

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.630
that I've discovered
in investigating

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.240
this my whole life,
essential keys which,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.940
each one on their own, may not
be the reliable key to genius.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.300
But when we bring
these keys together,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.370
I would say they provide
the most reliable,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.410
the most predictable soil
to bring forth genius.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.709
And before we go
into the keys, I

00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:04.250
want to make an
important distinction

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:09.620
for all of us between
meme and method.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.580
We're familiar
with the word meme.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.389
Does it jive for you?

00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:14.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.590
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Oh, yeah.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.470
Big time.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.790
OK so what I mean, what
I understand by a meme

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.570
is a commonly
shared understanding

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.570
about things which doesn't
particularly belong to anybody.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.220
So a great example
would be electricity,

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.580
where electricity
is a principle.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.090
Once we understand that
if you've got cables,

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:40.462
and you got metal, and you
can vibrate-- my physics

00:09:40.462 --> 00:09:42.920
is probably a little shaky to
really explain this properly.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.610
When you could vibrate atoms
at a certain frequency,

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.760
it will be carried
along a piece of metal

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.100
and create energy that can
be moved from one place

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.600
to another.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.391
Is that that-- did I
do a hash job of that,

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.430
or is it in the right ballpark?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.020
So electricity would
be a meme, right?

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.610
It doesn't belong to anybody.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.160
Once we understand
it, it's universal.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.745
The light bulb, invented
by Thomas Edison,

00:10:02.745 --> 00:10:03.495
would be a method.

00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:09.440
It's a method to be
able to use a meme.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.160
If we get too caught
up in methods,

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.550
we become essentially consumers.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.360
If you get too caught up
in loyalty to methods,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.750
then you become a consumer
of General Electric,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.950
the company founded
by Thomas Edison.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.470
And you forget the meme.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.730
The meme, when you have
an understanding of meme,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.420
it opens up possibilities.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.680
When a meme becomes yours,
you become the creator

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.060
of methods instead of
the follower of methods.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.650
So I want to
introduce to you today

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.340
seven important
memes that I would

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.770
say if you can find
a way in your own way

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.880
to embody these, to play with
them, to experiment with them,

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.820
it's going to radically increase
your genius quota in your life,

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.950
starting today.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:58.034
Does that sound like a plan?

00:10:58.034 --> 00:10:59.200
Three people is good for me.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.260
OK.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.310
So the first principle,
reliable principle,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:13.990
which brings forth genius I
would call inspired certainty.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.160
And I don't mean that
you necessarily initially

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.340
are inspired with certainty
about your own ideas.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.240
Inspired certainty
refers to the influence

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.140
that someone else
can have on you

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:34.390
to be able to see through
your conditioned thoughts,

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.270
through your reactive feelings
which very often dominate

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.730
our behavior, to see
into the essence of you,

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:47.110
and to say I see you in there.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.500
Beyond the habits
you've learned,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.310
I see who you really are.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.930
I see the gift that is
a waiting to be born.

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.510
When I was 14 years old, I
went to a boarding school

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.210
in England.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.180
The closest thing you
have to that America

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.013
is the penitentiary.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.420
So I went to an
English boarding school

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.450
where I had an English teacher,
whose name was Mr. Coleman.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:19.290
And he was like Santa Claus,
but with actually a dark beard

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.000
instead of white.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.500
But he had a big,
[INAUDIBLE] beard.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.510
He was a big man.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.876
And he loved great literature.

00:12:26.876 --> 00:12:28.750
So he would give us
every week, he would say,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.210
just write from your experience.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.510
Write from what excites you.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.280
Write from what you're
passionate about.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.170
So I would go and do that.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.170
And I would take him back
my essay, written of course

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.670
in squiggly fountain pen because
we didn't have computers then.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.140
We also didn't have
cars or-- my son

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.505
is sitting here in the audience,
and he sometimes asks me,

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:53.880
Dad-- when he was
young, he said,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880
Dad did they have cars
when you were growing up?

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.010
So no computers.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.660
So I was writing my
essay with a pen.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.550
And I can remember
each week, Mr. Coleman

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:11.950
would give me back my
scrawly essay with wonderful,

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.300
I always look forward
to reading your writing.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.880
And then his illegible
signature in red ink.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.440
If Mr. Coleman had not written
those comments on my essay

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.790
when I was 14, I
don't think I would

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.070
have had the energy
to write eight books.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.280
That's what I would
call inspired certainty.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.315
It can happen to you with a
grandparent, with a parent.

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:38.357
It Could, happen to you
with a school teacher.

00:13:38.357 --> 00:13:40.690
It could happen to you today
in your life with a mentor,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.970
with a coach, someone
who is willing to see

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:48.435
beyond the conditioned
reflexes that you have to life,

00:13:48.435 --> 00:13:52.010
many of which, for most
of us, are limiting.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:56.410
Many of the conditioned reflexes
are messages telling us,

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.680
I can't do it.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.720
Who's going to listen.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.220
It's not possible.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.680
Who am I to do it any way?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.210
You know what I mean?

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.880
Obviously that's a
rare thing at Google.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.400
But anyway, it's the
rest of the humanity.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.820
Many people suffer
from those repeating

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.130
thoughts which
keeps genius at bay.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.730
Inspired certainty is
the first component,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:22.080
which is why the advent
of coaching beyond sports

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.460
in the last 20 years--
if you go back 20 years,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.910
coaching only existed
in the relationship

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:33.990
we understand coaching to
be in a sports context.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:41.480
The bursting out of coaching
beyond the context of sports

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.610
into the rest of life has
allowed a huge acceleration

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.120
in people being able to
bring forth a genius,

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.470
because somebody else being
able to look right into you

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:57.830
and to see what is possible is
a huge accelerator to the gifts

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.640
that you were born to give in
your lifetime actually being

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.480
made manifest.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.350
The second key, which
I'm actually not going

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:09.349
to spend much time on
today, because it has more

00:15:09.349 --> 00:15:12.581
to do with coaching than really
what we're speaking about here.

00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:13.705
It has to do with presence.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.240
Learning, at least
in moments, how

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.100
to show up where
you already are is

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:31.970
a huge key to the
unfolding of your gifts.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:36.430
We put an incredible emphasis,
all of us, on the things

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:42.940
that we say, the things that
we do, the accomplishments we

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.540
can check off on to do list.

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:52.380
But actually, what I've noticed
from studying highly, highly

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.650
creative, successful,
genius people

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:59.260
and from coaching people,
the way that you show up,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.280
the presence with
which you arrive

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.800
into each situation
in your life is

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:11.070
more of a factor in genius
than simply the things you

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.375
accomplish.

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:13.750
I'm going to skate
over that one.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.260
If you want to know
more about any of these,

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.330
they're all seven
of these principles

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.675
are very thoroughly mapped
out in the book that's

00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:23.920
at the back of the room.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.860
But the third principle
of cultivating genius,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.530
in my opinion, is
the most important.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.280
It's the component which,
if you can tap into it,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.700
make it actual yourself,
it's the closest thing

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:42.495
I know to a genius guarantee.

00:16:46.869 --> 00:16:47.535
What was it now?

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:54.450
The most important
key to bringing forth

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.960
genius that I'm
aware of, which is

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.490
why I emphasize it so much
in the coaching method

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:04.000
that we teach, is
the possibility

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.760
to effectively tap into the
dimension of yourself which

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.280
is beyond conditioned
thought and reactive feeling.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.869
We could call that awakening.

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:23.390
A nice little catch all word
for that what I'm describing

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.300
is awakening.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.260
Awakening means that the
attention shifts deeper

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:34.320
than where thoughts
play, deeper than where

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.040
reactive emotions happen,
deeper than identification

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.250
with the body into
a recognition of who

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.270
or what is actually
experiencing this moment.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.200
Traditionally, that
has been thought

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.140
of as the domain of mystics.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.490
It's thought of as mysticism.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:59.580
That's what the word
mysticism means,

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:03.410
is shifting consciousness
to discover the place where

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:09.710
you no longer exist as a
separate, localized point.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:13.575
But you still exist as
consciousness without limits.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.690
I'm curious to know before
we go more deeply into this,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.849
how many people feel you
recognize what I'm talking

00:18:23.849 --> 00:18:25.140
about from your own experience?

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.720
You've had a taste
at least of that.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.700
Great.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:28.900
It's a sign of the times.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:33.630
I've been teaching in this way
for 25 years on this subject.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.550
25 years ago, even if I
went to a group of people

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:42.100
who were predictably
going to say yes,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.460
spiritually-oriented people,
very few hands would go up

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.350
saying, yes I know what you
mean from direct experience.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.290
People would say,
I've read about it.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:55.110
I've sat with a teacher
who could emanate it.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.020
But very few people 25
years ago would say,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.410
I know what you mean
from direct experience.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:05.060
Today, it's becoming almost
commonplace, which is actually

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.610
even bigger news for the future
of humanity than breakthroughs

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:12.810
in medicine or technology.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:17.360
The fact that we're having
these shifts in consciousness,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:23.300
the likes of which we have no
evidence of in our history,

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.480
is extraordinarily
hopeful good news,

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.750
extraordinarily optimistic news.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.510
So let's experiment a little
bit here right now together.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.630
What we mean by
awakening to the degree

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.420
that the word means
anything, it always

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:49.150
points to this very moment now.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:53.070
Awakening in the way that
I want to reference it here

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.320
is never about
anything in the future,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.690
never about anything
that someone else

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.530
has that you could get.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.580
It's always simply a
returning the attention

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.310
to what was already here
underneath the thoughts

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.370
and feelings, but was
easily overlooked.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:14.110
So you don't need to
meditate right now.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.550
You don't need to
close your eyes

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.620
or sit cross legged or anything.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.345
We can just stay
relaxed and as we are.

00:20:20.345 --> 00:20:22.230
But let's just take
a moment together

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:28.240
to recognize that
in this moment,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.398
you are hearing the sound
of this voice, all right.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.880
It's definitely
true for everybody.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.270
You're hearing the sound
of this English accent.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:46.070
And you might be able to say
the words, I hear the voice.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.750
People say sentences like that.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.650
I hear the guy's voice.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:50.480
Who could say that?

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.470
I hear the voice.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.025
You could say that's
true right now.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.670
Equally, you can see the
movement of this body standing

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.170
here.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.517
You can see the
movement of the hand.

00:21:01.517 --> 00:21:03.100
How many people could
say that's true?

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.360
I see the hand.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:11.710
So already in our experience,
without any consciousness

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.530
technology being employed,
already in our experience,

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:21.740
it's perfectly true that the
sounds are being heard already.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.370
The movement of the form
is being seen already,

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.355
and in the same way,
sensations in the body

00:21:30.355 --> 00:21:34.530
are being felt already
perfectly in this moment.

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.240
There's no need to
achieve any higher stake.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.730
It's already completely here.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:46.620
Seeing, feeling, hearing--
already completely here.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.360
So we know what is the sound.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.760
It's this English voice.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.410
We know what is the hearing.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.760
It's the movement of the sound
waves vibrating on the eardrum,

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.780
activating the little
nerve in there.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.280
As you can see, I know
as much about neurology

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.640
as I do about to physics.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.760
But anyway, it does
stuff in the brain.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.210
But still, none of
that explains what

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:15.480
we mean when we say
I. I hear the sound.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.290
Now when you say I hear the
sound, most people honestly,

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:24.590
they're not really subjectively
referring to the brain.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:30.842
Because you could actually
equally say, my brain.

00:22:30.842 --> 00:22:32.550
You could say, I went
to have a CAT scan.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.440
I saw a picture of my brain.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.330
So when we refer to ourselves
as I, or we say me or my,

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.980
it's actually-- if you're
just innocent about it,

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.950
it's not really referring
to any part of the body,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:50.540
including the brain
or the nervous system.

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:54.650
It's referring to something
which, for most people,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.800
is inadequately explored.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.510
Would you agree?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.360
It's been given less attention
then it could be given,

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.300
which is strange since we
use the word are I, or me,

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.250
or mine more than any
other word in the day.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.560
It's strange that it
gets a little attention.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.690
But here it is.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.160
In this moment,
here in this room,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:23.970
you could say I hear the
sound, I see the movement,

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.050
I feel the sensations
in the body.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:30.170
So let's experiment.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.200
Let's just shift the attention
in a very innocent way.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.370
Let's just shift the
attention towards that.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.410
It's non-localized,
so it's going

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.060
to be a little bit
of an experiment

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.540
to shift the attention
towards that which

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:49.880
is hearing, and
seeing, and feeling.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.190
It's already here.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.120
It's already completely here.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:24:00.740
It's what you call me,
only usually the attention

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.260
is Velcro-ing onto the movement
of thought and feeling.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.530
So what happens when
the attention just

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:15.780
begins to turn itself towards
this which we call I or me.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.610
What happens?

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.610
It may just be a tiniest
perfume at the beginning.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:24.250
But what begins
to reveal itself?

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:24.920
Tell me.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:33.060
When you ask this question, who
is hearing in this moment, who

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.975
is seeing, who is feeling,
what do you discover?

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.270
Let's just, if you
wouldn't mind--

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.769
just call out a few
tentative answers so we can--

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:46.810
AUDIENCE: I have no idea.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:47.740
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Great.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.120
Brilliant.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:48.780
AUDIENCE: Present.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.113
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Well, that's
actually-- let's start here.

00:24:51.113 --> 00:24:54.120
That's actually incredibly
honest and scientific.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.330
I have no idea.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.075
It's great.

00:24:56.075 --> 00:24:58.030
It's fantastic.

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.720
And it's a great revelation to
see that all our lives, we've

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.820
been saying I and me, but
when the attention turns back

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.120
to that which is
our true nature,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.960
it's never been
touched yet by thought.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.050
It's beyond the
realm of everything

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.720
that's been thought about.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.940
It's fresh.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.010
It's an undiscovered territory.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.700
It's a brilliantly innocent
and wise statement.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.020
I have no idea.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.670
I found out about
all this other stuff.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.720
I didn't actually check
out who I am, yeah.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.653
You said--

00:25:30.653 --> 00:25:31.412
AUDIENCE: Present.

00:25:31.412 --> 00:25:32.370
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Present.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:32.869
OK.

00:25:32.869 --> 00:25:36.520
So when we tune in to
this which is aware,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.760
it's a dimension of ourselves
which is naturally present.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.850
Thought is not so
naturally present.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.035
It's running in all directions.

00:25:44.035 --> 00:25:47.480
Reactive feeling is
not naturally present.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.990
But when you return
the attention

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.610
to your own true nature,
it's naturally present.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:56.230
Presence without having
to try to be present.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.830
Anybody else like to contribute?

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.626
Yeah.

00:25:58.626 --> 00:25:59.580
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.190
ARJUNA ARDAGH: No thing.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.340
Not a thing.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.400
Yeah.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.910
It's not a thing.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:08.820
That's also a brilliant,
amazing revelation to see.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.640
I've often referred
to myself as though I

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.130
am a thing, as though
I have a number.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.440
And as though I'm separate.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.520
But when I actually
check into that

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.970
which is hearing, and seeing,
and feeling, it's not a thing.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:28.970
Now imagine just for a moment,
if the story of your life

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.130
began to play out more in
alignment with the recognition

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.400
that you're not a thing.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.660
There is a thing.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.330
A body with a name.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.010
But it imagine,
just imagine, if you

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:48.060
began to relate to your young
daughter that we're not things.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.210
There's no thing here.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.400
There's no thing there.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.030
There is a difference between
one thing and another thing.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:27:00.170
But what's the difference
between no thing and no thing?

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:04.280
It starts to dissolve the
trance of separation which

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.540
we have lived in, most
of us our whole lives.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.990
The answers that other people
give to this kind of inquiry,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:15.200
and I've investigated this
with thousands and thousands,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.870
tens of thousands of people
over the last two decades,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:24.150
people will say things like
it's incredibly peaceful.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.920
There are no boundaries.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.010
There's no limits when I check
into this which I truly am,

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.390
there's no beginning,
no end to it.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.710
It has no birth in time.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.100
It wasn't born, because
it's not a thing.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.030
And therefore it
also, it couldn't die.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:48.350
Mostly, people have experience
of this dimension of themselves

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.850
in a taste, in a snapshot.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.040
But a taste is enough.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:02.730
The great Zen poet,
Bunan once said,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.860
I tasted this for 15 seconds.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.650
And I spent the rest of
my life earning the taste.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:20.330
This ability to drop
into limitless dimension

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.910
of yourself, limitless
consciousness, to have

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.710
direct experiential recognition
of the dimension of yourself

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.710
which is free, which was never
born, which could never die,

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:35.090
which is not separate,
in my experience

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.620
of working with
people in this way,

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.710
it's the most potent
fertilizer for genius.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.120
In fact, you could
say conversely

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.760
if we don't have access to the
dimension of ourselves, what

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.300
do we have access to?

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:56.140
We have access to thoughts
and feelings, right.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.720
We have access to repeating
thoughts and feelings which

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:02.620
are almost, without
exception, conditioned,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:06.020
borrowed from our
culture, from our parents,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.310
from religion, from teachers.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.400
The thought machine
is really only

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.360
capable of
regurgitating what it's

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.070
received into
another form, which

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.830
is why so much art, so much
technology is imitative,

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.480
imitating something that
somebody else conceived.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:28.250
When you drop into the dimension
of yourself which is free,

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:34.270
it allows for impulses to arise
which have never arisen before.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.525
There are so many stories
if you investigate.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:45.260
In so many fields, the
leaders, the founding fathers

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.150
of this country, they were
all-- the great majority of them

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.760
anyway, were mystics.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.580
They were exploring the
mysticism of Masonry.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:05.450
You'll find in the writings
of Benjamin Franklin

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.130
many references to
this the importance

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.920
of being able to
drop out of the me

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:19.190
into the dimension where there
is boundaryless consciousness.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.760
If we had longer, we could
explore the great leaders

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.530
in almost every field and
find the same pattern.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:31.230
Having access to infinity is
the way in which impulses arise.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.280
Now, we could talk on
each of these memes,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.400
we could talk for hours.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.000
But let's move on to the
next important meme, which

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.210
has to do with blocks
and conditioning.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:48.270
I think I read
today on Google, I

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.820
found the statistics for
how much sperm a human male

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.220
produces in his lifetime is
like 525 billion sperm, right.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.710
But how many of those
sperm actually make

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.110
it to become an embodied
expression of what

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:06.730
each sperm have the potential?

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.520
It's like a few.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:13.850
Most of the sperm that
comes out of a man

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:18.500
never makes it to become
anything embodied or expressed.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:25.650
In the same way, I would suggest
to you for all of humanity,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.610
for all seven
billion human beings,

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.930
impulses are arising
all the time.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:31.560
When you first wake
up in the morning

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.310
and you're still in a
more spacious state,

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.410
impulses, little ideas,
are arising all the time.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.700
How many of those
impulses actually become

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:45.460
manifest as something that
can radically contribution

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:49.690
to and shift the
destiny of humanity,

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.235
or least people around you.

00:31:51.235 --> 00:31:52.730
You see the theme?

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.310
The majority of impulsive,
creative impulses

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.510
that arise in you,
they meet immediately

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:05.529
with not birth control,
but creativity control.

00:32:05.529 --> 00:32:11.180
And creativity control
means hard set ideas

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:15.620
along the lines of,
I'm not good enough.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.370
I don't have enough time.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.540
Who am I?

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.249
Nobody listens to me.

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:21.290
Does this sound familiar?

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:25.320
Nobody would try it anyway.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.280
It's too crazy.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:30.230
I don't have enough money.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:34.440
We could continue the
whole day cataloging

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.100
the mechanism of
the conditioned mind

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.750
that's suppresses
pure creative impulse.

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:50.420
We could map it very easily if
we sat together in a workshop.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.200
We could easily map
this out, and we'd

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.890
find almost any
conditioned thought

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.120
that anybody came up with.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.430
Most of the rest
of them would say,

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.980
would agree that that's a
conditioned thought for them

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.050
too.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.770
The conditioned mind
is entirely programmed.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:12.020
It operates along
principles that

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.150
are the same for
almost everybody.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.830
So what's necessary in
order to bring forth

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.150
genius in a way
that's reliable is

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:26.490
to have technology to be able
to address those blocks which

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.870
interfere with the arising
of creative impulse.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.940
So how are you going to do that?

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.820
The difficulty is that
you don't consciously

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:41.042
choose those thoughts
when they arise, right?

00:33:41.042 --> 00:33:42.500
A thought like I'm
not good enough,

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.080
you don't have the
idea of, now I'm

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.954
going to have an I'm
not good enough thought.

00:33:45.954 --> 00:33:46.920
Just a minute.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.870
There it is.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.120
You don't do that.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.490
It comes on its own.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:55.780
But when a thought like
I'm not good enough,

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.600
or there's not enough money,
or nobody listens to me, when

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.730
it arises to block creativity,
generally what relationship

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:08.235
instinctively do we
form with that thought?

00:34:08.235 --> 00:34:09.139
AUDIENCE: Aversion.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.139
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Aversion.

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:10.650
Who said it?

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:11.149
Aversion.

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.550
It's totally true, isn't it?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.130
Whenever these creativity
blocking thoughts

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.389
arise, and there
are lots of them,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.480
the immediate
response is aversion.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.810
So we've been experimenting.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.030
I teach a method called
awakening coaching.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:30.040
We've been experimenting
over decades

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.659
to discover what
can we do to unplug

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.610
the power from that
conditioned thinking,

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.909
so that creativity has more
opportunity to express itself.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.889
And the key actually
is what you just said.

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.100
The key is aversion.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.510
When a thought arises, and
it's allowed to pass through,

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:57.500
which is quite rare,
it actually just

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:03.270
has almost no effect on the
way you behave in your life.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.750
You start to discover these
thoughts are like a mouse

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.090
with a megaphone,
making a lot of noise,

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.530
but with very little
inherent power.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.260
So the key is to
have a technology,

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.630
not that gets rid of the
thoughts-- that's actually,

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.000
in my opinion, that's the
rabbit hole that we often

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.710
try to go down.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.590
We try to get rid of
negative thoughts,

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:30.220
or make them into
positive thoughts.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:33.320
But the more energy you
give to a thought form,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.310
the more you turn up the
volume on the megaphone.

00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:40.100
The key as you suggested
is to have a technology,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.080
not to get rid of
the thought form,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:45.170
but to relax the resistance.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:48.010
So that's the meme.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:52.080
That's the meme, is to recognize
that any thought form, when

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:55.340
resisted, becomes real.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.990
The more you push against
it, the more real it becomes.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.230
Any thought form
when unresisted,

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.840
and unresisting is not just
a matter of not resisting.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.710
Unresisting is a creative act.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.330
Any thought form when
unresisted actually,

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.400
instead of becoming
bigger, it dissipates.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.630
It becomes humorous.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:21.410
It passes through,
leaving you free to give

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.962
the gift you were born to give.

00:36:23.962 --> 00:36:25.420
Again, each of
these memes we could

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.830
explore in much greater
depth, but let's move

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.785
on to the next meme, which
has to do with practice.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.120
We don't really need
practice to have awakening.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.090
Awakening is always, in this
moment, simply the willingness

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.900
to return attention
to what is here.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.440
We do need practice
to be able to live

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:52.980
that creative source
in day to day life.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.020
Not only do we have conditioned
thoughts, conditioned beliefs,

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.170
all of us, we have
conditioned ways

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:04.212
of behaving, which are held
in place through homeostasis.

00:37:04.212 --> 00:37:07.670
What that means is, you show
up at work in a certain way.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.450
Maybe you show up.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.730
And you're the guy who was
always a little bit shy.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.990
or you're somebody
who's really--

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.090
and everybody's used to
you behaving like that.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.680
So if the shy guy shows
up one day and goes like,

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.250
yeah, everyone's going
to be completely shocked.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.180
Not because it's a
strange way to behave,

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.692
it's an unexpected way
for that person to behave.

00:37:26.692 --> 00:37:28.257
You see what I mean?

00:37:28.257 --> 00:37:30.840
So as soon as you enter into a
relationship with other people,

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.620
or with an environment, you
enter into an unspoken contract

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:41.550
of homeostasis, which means
that in order to free up genius,

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.740
we need tailor-made practice.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.970
One size fits all
practice won't work.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.720
Because it just
becomes another habit.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.640
We need tailor-made
practice to antidote,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.240
to exaggerate, to make
humorous the habits which

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.509
have governed our lives.

00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:00.550
I'm going to give you a
couple of quick examples.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.099
Again, each of these
topics is a huge thing

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:04.140
to explore in more depth.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:08.080
I'll give you a very quick
example of a university

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.030
professor I worked
with a few years ago

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.540
who wanted to write a book.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.890
Now the habit he
developed over years

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:21.150
was of being a very serious,
respectable university

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:21.650
professor.

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.350
He was-- nobody laughed at him.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.620
And it was to do with his
childhood, his conditioning.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.010
It was important to him to
be taken very seriously.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.700
But you can imagine when
he tried to write a book,

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:35.750
it became very quickly an
academic, very sturgid book.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.310
So we have to find a
tailor-made practice for him,

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.960
not a practice that is going to
be the same for everybody, just

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.490
everybody meditate
for 20 minutes.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:45.080
Or everyone do
this yoga posture.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.470
We had to find the
perfect practice for him,

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:52.480
like a homeopathic medicine,
that would free up his genius.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.060
And this is perhaps one of
the most important gifts

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.020
that a good coach or a good
mentor can bring to you,

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:01.480
is to find tailor-made practice.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.230
So this was the practice
we found for him.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.110
It's a random example.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.680
He had to give lectures
at the university

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:13.100
in the huge auditorium
with 500, 800 seats.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.834
So I said to him,
next time you're

00:39:14.834 --> 00:39:17.000
going to give one of these
really big lectures where

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.520
he was the serious
professor, I said

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:24.110
before you go to give the
lecture, go to a costume store

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:29.104
and buy a cat's tail--
they sell tail there--

00:39:29.104 --> 00:39:30.770
and attach it to the
back of your pants.

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:34.910
So of course he came in.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:36.201
He started to give the lecture.

00:39:36.201 --> 00:39:37.750
Everything was normal.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:39.287
He was the serious professor.

00:39:39.287 --> 00:39:41.120
He quickly forgot about
the tail, of course.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.970
And then he had to turn
around at some point

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:46.240
to write something on the
whiteboard behind him,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.740
revealing the tail.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.016
Well, it was just a little
murmur at the beginning.

00:39:51.016 --> 00:39:53.390
People bringing out-- quietly
bring out their cell phone,

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.430
taking a picture.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:00.530
It only took that one lecture,
one hour lecture of him wearing

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.940
a tail to dismantle
the homeostasis of him

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.227
being the serious professor.

00:40:06.227 --> 00:40:08.060
After that, he could
walk around the campus.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.040
Everybody would give him a wink
or a wave, because they knew.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.410
That's the guy
who wore the tail.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.270
That's just a silly example.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:18.090
There are an infinite
number of examples

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.420
of where the right practice
for the right person

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.770
can disrupt the homeostasis
enough that it frees up,

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.960
not a new way of
behaving-- you see,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.500
that would be
another conditioning.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.650
It frees up a return
to innocence, a return

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:40.100
to childlike play, which is
the environment in which genius

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:40.725
can happen.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.440
The sixth meme I want to
briefly touch on today

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.310
is the recognition
of unique gift.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.010
The recognition as we
drop more and more deeply

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.040
into infinite consciousness,
into consciousness

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.820
without limits, as
we free up blocks

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:05.260
through removing resistance, as
we find tailor-made practices

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.070
that can disrupt
the encrusted habits

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:12.170
and allow you to live more
freely, more spontaneously.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:17.740
What reveals itself after
a while is the astounding

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:20.140
recognition that just as
each of us in this room

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:24.740
has a unique fingerprint, just
as each of us in this room

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.250
has a unique face that is very
rarely confused with anyone

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:31.750
else's face, so each
person in this room,

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:35.430
and each person that
you know in your life,

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:41.840
has a unique gift to
give to the world.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:43.530
But I hesitate to
say unique gift,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.400
because I don't mean
necessarily that there's

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.570
a particular product that
they were born to invent,

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:56.530
or anything is manifest is that
I mean that each person has

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:58.850
a unique, energetic flavor.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.010
A flavor which, if it's not
fully given through you,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.980
it will never be given.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:16.135
Just like if you don't put your
thumb on the thumbprint thingy

00:42:16.135 --> 00:42:17.885
and give your thumb
print, that thumbprint

00:42:17.885 --> 00:42:19.960
will never get recorded,
because nobody else has

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.460
got the same thumbprint as you.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.780
If the gift which is
inherently your genius

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.820
is not delivered into the
world in your lifetime,

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.710
it simply is not given.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.860
It remains unmanifest,
which sounds sad,

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.620
but unfortunately it's still
more or less the default

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.550
setting for humanity.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.970
Most gifts go on giving.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.530
In small ways, they get given.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.510
But I know from coaching
people, majority

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.510
of people I work with, they
know that what they really

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:53.945
came to give is still held back.

00:42:53.945 --> 00:42:54.820
Does that make sense?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.180
We are rapidly, because of
the way society is changing,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:07.797
because of the democratization
of genius with YouTube,

00:43:07.797 --> 00:43:09.130
which is owned by which company?

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:10.790
I've forgotten.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.190
Because of technologies
like YouTube,

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.330
anybody can unlock their
genius and share it

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.810
with the world
very, very easily.

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:23.220
The unique gift means
a reliable technology

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:28.490
to be able to tap into the
energetic flavor, which

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:32.180
is uniquely yours, and to
find the right match for it

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:39.090
in the world, so that the
song that remains unsung

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:41.380
is fully delivered.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.860
And the last meme which
I'll briefly touch on,

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.970
is called spontaneous
creation, which is actually

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:49.860
the opposite of what we
spoke about with unresisting.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.740
Spontaneous creation
means as you

00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:55.800
get more and more proficient in
a technology of consciousness

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.810
that allows you to hover
in a more expansive state,

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:04.240
it's possible to deliberately,
consciously create

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.650
impulses, which were
not there before.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.350
Just like in quantum
physics, where

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:15.510
subatomic particles of both
particular and wave-like

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:18.940
at the same time, depending
upon the observation,

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:23.160
in the same way, it's possible
to become more and more

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.860
adept in hovering in
more expansive states,

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.680
so that we can generate
frequencies out of nothing.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.110
A great example
would be happiness.

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.520
Happiness is
actually a frequency.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.332
Many times, you can be
happy for no reason,

00:44:37.332 --> 00:44:39.290
just because you're in
the happiness frequency.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.610
Well, we try in a
very laborious way,

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.566
to create happiness by
creating circumstances

00:44:45.566 --> 00:44:47.210
that should create
happiness, which

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.320
is quite inefficient actually.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.710
There is the possibility to
be able to vibrate a happiness

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:58.730
frequency in a quantum state,
so that instead of you having

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:01.190
to create happiness by
rearranging your life,

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.410
you can vibrate a happiness
frequency, or a compassion

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.620
frequency, or a
creativity frequency,

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.880
and your life rearranges
itself like the iron filings

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.540
in a magnetic field to
demonstrate the frequency which

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:21.540
you have dropped into an
infinite state or possibility.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:25.230
That was a very rushed guided
tour to a technology of genius.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:28.830
Obviously, it raises more
questions than answers.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.800
But let's take the
last few minutes

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:35.050
to see where you might like
to explore this further.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:35.800
AUDIENCE: Yes, hi.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.240
Thank you for the talk.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.759
I just-- I'm not familiar
with the coaching practice

00:45:39.759 --> 00:45:40.550
that you mentioned.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:41.870
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:42.703
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Yeah.

00:45:42.703 --> 00:45:45.420
So, the coaching practice
is not actually--

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.272
there's not that
much more to say

00:45:47.272 --> 00:45:48.480
about it than what I've said.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:52.730
It's simply, it's-- I talked
earlier about memes and tools.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.910
So the awakening coaching
provides very specific,

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:03.070
reliable, tested tools
which bring into practice

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:04.810
the memes I've described here.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:06.354
So for example--

00:46:06.354 --> 00:46:07.020
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.853
Can you talk a little
bit about more speci--

00:46:08.853 --> 00:46:10.260
is it like an online practice?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.200
Or is it an individual
thing you're doing?

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.200
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Yeah,
coaching is-- the coaching,

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.660
the way we practice coaching is
done in a contract of 10 weeks

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.100
or so, 8, 10 or
10, 12 weeks, where

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.080
the-- the thing about
coaching is everything that's

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.330
important about a
coaching relationship

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.080
needs to emerge from
within the coaching client.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.046
Otherwise, it becomes
teaching, you see.

00:46:32.046 --> 00:46:33.420
If the coach is
going to tell you

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.460
this is where your
life should be going,

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.160
it becomes a form of
didactic teaching.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.420
Coaching is really
a relationship

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.345
which brings forth what
is wanting to burst forth

00:46:44.345 --> 00:46:46.070
from within you.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.032
So in a coaching
relationship, at the beginning

00:46:49.032 --> 00:46:50.490
of the relationship,
you would talk

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.950
with your coach about
the impulses you can feel

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:56.230
are wanting to come alive.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:57.810
Maybe you want to write a book.

00:46:57.810 --> 00:47:02.270
Maybe you want to bring an
invention into solidity.

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.700
Maybe you want to fall
in love and be married.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.670
There's all sorts of
things you might want.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.050
And there's a distinction
in my vocabulary

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:14.360
between wanting something,
and having an intuitive

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.520
longing for something.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.520
It's a little different.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.800
Wanting something is more solid.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.870
I want that.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.470
A longing is more like
a-- it's something

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.420
that's already
within you, wanting

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:30.000
to give birth and
express itself.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.760
So love, I would say
is more of a longing.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.000
A new car is more of a desire.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.550
Whereas-- but
excitement and travel

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.600
could be more of a
longing, you see.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.210
So a coach would help
you get clear about what

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:46.430
are your natural longings.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.130
What is the evolutionary
trajectory which

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.370
is authentically yours,
not imposed upon you.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.670
And that can take
some unravelling.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.290
Because we've been so
conditioned being told what

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.570
we should want in
all sorts of ways,

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.740
by religion but also by the
self-help, self-improvement

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.850
industry, also by spirituality.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.330
All of those forces
have contributed

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.870
to ideas about what
we should be wanting.

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:17.950
Or where we should be pointing.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.250
A good coach will help
you to unravel back

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:27.390
to what is authentically
your evolutionary trajectory.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:32.060
And then the coach will be
able to help you express that

00:48:32.060 --> 00:48:35.800
in verifiable terms that
we can-- so 10 weeks,

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.260
we can see if we
got that or not.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.990
Or if we got to the point where
we're confidence about that

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.600
or not.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.100
When I say confident
about that, you

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:45.130
might have the
evolutionary impulse,

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:48.370
I want to be married and have
a family, and you're single.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.360
I'm not saying you're single,
but somebody might be.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.520
Well, we wouldn't want to
set up an expectation in 10

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:57.020
weeks of coaching, you're going
to be married with a family.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.750
I don't know how
we could do that.

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:02.110
But we could set up an
outcome that at the end of 10

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:06.680
weeks of coaching, any block
or doubt about the flow of love

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.100
could be dissolved, so
it's kind of obvious

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.820
that you are a loving being and
that love flows in your life

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:14.540
easily.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.510
So then a coach
would meet with you.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:23.700
It can be done on Google
Hangout, or any other video

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.360
technology.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.121
It can be done on the phone.

00:49:28.121 --> 00:49:29.620
But you don't need
physical contact.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.720
It's completely unnecessary,
we've discovered.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.300
Or we'll meet with
you every two weeks

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:37.690
for a longer session,
where you mostly

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.260
will drop into radical
awakening, which I described,

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.530
into the direct experience
of infinite consciousness.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.720
And then we use
these technologies

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.180
to dissolve the blocks.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.190
It's a technique called
radical releasing

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.310
that takes only a few minutes.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.360
And it's about 80% effective.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.350
I couldn't say 100%, but
about 80% of the time,

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:05.680
we can take a thought form
like, nobody listens to me.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:06.730
We can dissolve it.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.300
And two weeks later,
when we test it,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.450
it still has no power anymore.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:12.920
And that is then
true in perpetuity.

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.350
About 20% are more sticky.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.850
And then we have to
do that repeatedly.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.500
So a coach will, every two
weeks, will meet with you.

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:24.140
But what's most important
thing, what actually

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:27.960
makes this effective, is
that in that two week gap,

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:31.680
the coach will give you a
set of tailor-made practices.

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.020
It's probably going to
be a set of practices

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.970
that nobody has ever had
before that combination.

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:41.370
And the practices are
to gently and humorously

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:45.870
disturb your homeostasis, all
right, so that you actually

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.180
start to show up
in each situation

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.110
as a different person.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:54.380
It's quite miraculous
to see this happen,

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.950
that after two weeks, the
coaching client comes back

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:58.880
and it's simply not
the same person that

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.100
was there two weeks before.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.880
So they qualify for a whole
new set of practices, you see.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.910
So gradually, you realize
that what you thought was you,

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.750
was just a bundle of habits.

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:13.350
Who you really are is
a pure potentiality.

00:51:13.350 --> 00:51:16.120
Who you really
are is like-- it's

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.420
like the goody box from
which all goodies arise.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:23.500
And certain goodies
are put on display,

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.960
which could be put
back in the box

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.626
and different ones
could be brought out.

00:51:26.626 --> 00:51:30.320
So over time,
different practices

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.430
will free everything up to
allow your natural genius

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:34.310
to flourish.

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:35.810
RACHEL O'MEARA: So
where can we find

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.475
more resources in terms of
finding things on your site,

00:51:39.475 --> 00:51:40.090
or--

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:40.964
ARJUNA ARDAGH: Right.

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:43.420
Well, a really great--
if what I've said

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.420
today was interesting
or resonated,

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:47.960
a really great
next step would be

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.660
to check out the
book that we have

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.710
at the back of the
room, "Better than Sex."

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.270
I would suggest to start
there, because everything

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.360
is in the book.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.270
We have the website,
awakeningcoachingtraining.com.

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:04.210
I have my own website,
arjunaardagh.com,

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:06.780
because I write
other books, too.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.916
And yeah.

00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:09.790
We've got a lot of people
all over the world.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:11.670
If this resonates for you,
if it sounds interesting,

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.753
feel free to get in touch.

00:52:12.753 --> 00:52:15.310
And we can explore more deeply.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:17.500
Thank you so much for
inviting me to Google today.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.583
RACHEL O'MEARA: Thank you.

00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:19.790
