00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.030
I want to write this
expression here as a decimal.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
And the first question
that might pop in your head

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.740
is do I multiply 4 times 1,000,
then add 3, then multiply

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.020
1,000, then add 67, then
multiply by 1 over 1,000?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.069
Or do I do the
multiplication first?

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:19.610
To answer that
question, we just have

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.980
to remind ourselves about
order of operations.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.396
Order of operations, if you
have a bunch of multiplication

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:26.190
and addition in a
row like this, you

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.260
will do the
multiplication first.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.187
Let me put some parentheses
here to remind us of that.

00:00:33.187 --> 00:00:35.270
So let's figure out what
each of these expressions

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.400
in the parentheses
actually represent.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.420
What's 4 times 1 million?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.870
Well, that's 4 million.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.230
What's 3 times 1,000?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.090
Well that's 3,000.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.096
What is 67 times 1 thousandth?

00:00:52.096 --> 00:00:54.220
And there's a bunch of ways
of thinking about this.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.540
Actually, let me write
them all over here.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.510
Well, I'll do the most
obvious one right over here.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.340
67 times 1 thousandth
is 67 thousandths.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.730
And we can represent this
literally as 67/1000.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:19.270
Or we could represent this as
60 over 1,000 plus 7 over 1,000.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.680
And what's 60 over 1,000?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Well, 60 over 1,000
is 6 hundredths.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.820
So let me put that
in a different color.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.010
6 hundredths, 7 thousandths.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.090
So you could view this
is 67 thousandths.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.180
Or you could view this is 6
hundredths and 7 thousandths.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.760
Either way, let's add all
of these things together.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.810
So we have 4 million.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.080
So the 4 in the millions place
literally represents 4 million.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.410
Then we have no
hundred thousands.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.860
We have no ten thousands.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590
But then we have 3,000.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.910
So the 3 is in the
thousands place.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.070
Let me put a comma here, so
we can keep track of things.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.700
And then we have no hundreds.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.220
We have no tens.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.170
We have no ones.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.680
We don't even have any tenths.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.620
But we do have some hundredths.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.896
We have 6 hundredths.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.350
And then we have
some thousandths.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.060
We have 7 thousandths.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.380
So we put that 7 in
the thousandths place.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.640
So we could read this 4 million,
3 thousand, 6 hundredths

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.890
and 7 thousandths.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.213
Or we could read it as
4 million, 3 thousand,

00:02:36.213 --> 00:02:39.304
and 67 thousandths.
