00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.419
Imagine we’ve successfully landed a robot on Venus!

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.150
Nice job... [pause, checks watch]
Annnd now it’s dead.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580
Hello fellow carbon-based lifeforms, Ian here
for DNews.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.840
I want you to imagine building a robot that
can land on the surface of Venus.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.010
Actually, imagine building a robot that will
land on the surface of HELL and you’ll have

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.650
a better idea of what to expect.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.660
Yes, Venus is a toxic hellhole that’s not
only hot enough on the surface to melt lead,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.320
but the thick carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere
has a pressure about 90 times greater than

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.320
Earth’s.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.410
This isn’t very good news for any robots
we want to send there to explore the planet

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.560
and do science.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.560
But there IS hope.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.580
NASA engineers at the Glenn Research Center
in Cleveland, Ohio, are developing a new kind

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.800
of integrated circuit that not only survives
the rigors of being in space, it could also

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.060
allow the delicate electronics inside Venus
landers to live 100 times longer than previous

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
efforts.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.880
It’s not like we haven’t tried landing
on Venus before.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.820
From the 1960s to the 1980s, the Soviet Union
tried to send a series of 16 spacecraft to

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.060
Venus as part of the Venera program — which
included flybys, atmospheric probes and landers.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.480
Of the early landing attempts, Venera 3 to
Venera 6 either burned up, crashed or got

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.370
crushed by Venus’ atmosphere.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.340
Even though it got crushed before touchdown,
Venera 4 has the historic distinction as being

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.320
the first probe to transmit data from another
planet’s atmosphere in 1967.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.970
In 1970, Venera 7 made history as the first
ever soft landing on another planet.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.760
It sent back 23 minutes of data before dying.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.799
After this, the Soviets had more success from
Venera 8 — which landed in 1972, returning

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.010
50 minutes of data.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.560
Venera 9 landed in 1975 and took the first
ever black and white photos from another planet’s

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
surface.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.790
Venera 13, in 1981, and 14, in 1982, returned
color panoramic views from Venus’ surface,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.090
revealing the alien geology and incredibly
hazy atmosphere.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.119
In 1984, Russia launched the two Vega missions
that included landers and atmospheric balloons.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.010
The US even gave Venus a go when they parachuted
probes to the surface during the 1978 Pioneer

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.240
Venus mission.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.350
One of the probes continued to transmit data
an hour after landing on the surface.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.660
But all Venus surface missions quickly succumbed
to the extreme heat and pressure, most lasting

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.000
for less than a couple of hours.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.369
Venera 13 holds the record, lasting 127 minutes
before melting.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.830
Although our technology has advanced since
this exciting era of Venus exploration, we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.680
still don’t have the ability to protect
them from the extreme environment for very

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.760
long.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.120
Conventional silicon circuits stop working
at high temperatures long before they start

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120
to melt.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.340
But now, NASA engineers are testing an extremely
durable "silicon carbide semiconductor integrated

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.169
circuit” — it’s a circuit made out of
a new silicon mix that continues to function

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.799
as a circuit should, only at much higher temperatures.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.419
It was originally being developed for use
in hot sections of fuel-efficient aircraft.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.499
Knowing that they could tolerate temperatures
up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, the NASA engineers

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.400
placed samples of the circuit into the Glenn
Extreme Environments Rig (GEER).

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.700
This instrument not only replicates the temperatures
found on Venus’ surface, it also applies

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.969
the same pressures.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.159
And after 521 hours of extreme testing, the
integrated circuits continued to operate as

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.159
designed.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.689
To use conventional electronics in space,
heavy shielding is needed to protect delicate

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.689
components.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.909
If this new circuit technology is used for
space robots, I’d imagine that this shielding

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.949
may not be required, reducing weight, boosting
electronics longevity in harsh environments,

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.230
reducing launch weight and ultimately costs.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.099
But the thing that makes this kind of tech
development REALLY interesting is the very

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.629
obvious applications a highly durable integrated
circuit has on Earth.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.089
Robotics are used in a range of industries
and are increasingly being used in extremely

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:29.010
hazardous environments — building tougher
electronics to boost their operational lives

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.870
would obviously be a bonus.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.089
