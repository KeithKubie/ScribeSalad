00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.780
- [Instructor] Let's talk a
little bit about reproduction.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.300
Now, on earth, and who knows
if we go to other planets

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.010
we might find new ways that
organisms can reproduce.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.360
But on earth, there's two primary

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.550
ways that organisms reproduce.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.010
The first is, is that,
let's say this is some type

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.260
of unicellular organism,
it essentially just makes

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.830
a copy of itself.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.520
So that's it there, and
then that's its copy.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.820
And in this situation they have
identical genetic material.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.260
So let's say this is the
genetic material of the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.820
first one, and this is the
first one to begin with,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.330
and now you have the second one.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.300
Now this type of reproduction,
where one organism

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.900
by itself can turn into two
organisms, this is known

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.740
as asexual, asexual reproduction.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.910
Or another way to interpret
asexual is it is not sexual.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.940
So the next question is,
what is sexual reproduction?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.300
This is where two
organisms, or at least cells

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.650
from two organisms, need
to get together in order

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.180
to produce a third organism.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.360
Here's a cell from one of
the organisms, let's say that

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.040
cell is from the mother,
it could be an egg cell.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.960
Here's a cell from the
other organism, let's call

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.940
that organism the father,
this would be a sperm cell.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.360
And when the egg and the sperm
get together, when they fuse

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.050
together, they have genetic
information from both parents.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.900
And that new cell can
become the offspring.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.450
And if sexual reproduction
sounds familiar, it's because

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.610
that's how you came to be.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.530
Now, to make this a little
bit more tangible, let's look

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.390
at some cases of asexual

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.210
reproduction and sexual reproduction.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.870
So right over there we
see a diagram of a type

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.086
of asexual reproduction
known as binary fission.

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:52.060
In general, if you hear the
word fission we're talking

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.680
about splitting something,
if people are talking

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.850
about nuclear fission they're
talking about splitting

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.400
of the atom, but binary
fission we're talking about

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.380
one organism splitting into two organisms.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.970
And you can see that you
have its genetic material,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.740
the genetic material it
replicates, and then the organism

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.590
splits into two identical
organisms, or at least identical

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.760
from a genetic point of view.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.150
Now binary fission applies to prokaryotes

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.170
that we talk about in other videos.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.570
These are organisms that don't
have organelles, that don't

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.830
have a nuclear membrane,
they don't tend to have

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.340
multiple chromosomes.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.300
When we talk about eukaryotes
things that do have

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.630
nuclear membranes, things that
have multiple chromosomes,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.350
things that have membrane-bound
organelles, you have

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620
a similar type of reproduction.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.659
This right over here, and
we'll study it in depth in

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.907
biology, this is mitosis.

00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:46.500
And mitosis you can view it as
the analog of binary fission

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.990
but we're now dealing
with eukaryotic cells.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.930
Eukaryotic cells are more
complex, so this process

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.110
is more complex.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310
But at a high level, they're
both asexual reproduction.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.700
In both cases, one cell or
one organism in some cases,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.940
has turned into two organisms
that have the same genetic

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.910
information.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.980
And it's worth calling out
when you take one organism

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.030
and you produce another
organism with the same

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.320
genetic information, it has
a word associated with it,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.350
and that is a clone.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.380
And you might be familiar
with the term clone from

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.400
science fiction movies,
and they usually use it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.310
in a somewhat related context.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.950
In Star Wars when they
talk about the clone wars

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.160
all of those clones they all have the same

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.070
genetic information as
the original bounty hunter

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.580
from which they were derived.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.730
Now mitosis might also
seem familiar to you

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.130
because this is how most of your cells

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.800
in your body divide.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.210
And this is how you grow,
this is how you went from

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.850
being a unicellular organism
to being a multicellular

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:50.900
organism.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.950
Now you might be a little
bit confused at this point.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.850
I just told you that most of your cells

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.910
have experienced or are
experiencing mitosis, but you're

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.860
also the outcome of sexual reproduction.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.540
Well what we'll see in a
second is, as soon as sexual

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.080
reproduction occurs, then
this newly formed cell

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.493
right over here, through
mitosis forms the multicellular

00:04:10.493 --> 00:04:14.464
organisms, the types that
are you and me, but we also

00:04:14.464 --> 00:04:18.510
as we grow and develop, we
also produce what are known

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.380
as gametes, that each have half
of our genetic information.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.220
For human beings, this
would be the egg produced

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.090
by a female, and this
would be the sperm produced

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.870
by a male, and when they
get together, the sperm

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.270
fertilizes the egg, well
then, they can produce

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.130
a viable cell that can
turn into an offspring.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.850
Now along the lines of binary
fission, you have another

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.660
type of asexual reproduction
in which case a mother

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.310
cell produces buds off
a smaller daughter cell.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.380
So like binary fission, it has
to replicate all of its DNA

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.670
and then that DNA gets
inserted into the daughter cell

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.850
but the end product you have a bigger cell

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.130
and a smaller cell.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.568
And we would say that the
smaller cell has budded

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:05.240
off of this larger one.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.900
And so this we call budding.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.610
Another form of asexual reproduction.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.750
When we think about
multicellular organisms there are

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.050
some typical types of
asexual reproduction.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.085
For example, starfish are
famous for their ability

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:26.890
to form a new organism
from a piece of an original

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.610
organism, so let's say
you were to cut that part

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.510
off of the starfish for
many species of starfish

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.360
that could then grow into a new starfish.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.830
The original starfish
would grow that back.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.683
And so this type of reproduction
is known as fragmentation.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.080
It's pretty easy to,
fragmentation, it's pretty easy

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.510
to remember, you take a
fragment of it and it grows

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.420
into another organism and
that's how it reproduces.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.290
Now another fascinating
type of reproduction

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.595
is known as parthenogenesis,
that's a fancy word,

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:01.763
partheno, parthenogenesis.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.870
And what happens here is
is you have an organism,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.720
and this is a baby komodo
dragon right over here,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.210
that can develop from an unfertilized egg.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.260
Remember in sexual
reproduction we talk about

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.310
how a sperm from a father organism

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.320
needs to fertilize an egg
from a mother organism

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.880
and then once they fuse together
then that fertilized egg

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.576
can go through mitosis to
produce a multicellular organism.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:38.576
But in parthenogenesis,
you have an egg on its own

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.230
that can, that does not need
to be fertilized, that can turn

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.230
into a multicellular organism,
like a baby komodo dragon.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.690
Now you might ask, well how can this be?

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.407
Well, sometimes these mother,
these eggs, don't have

00:06:53.407 --> 00:06:55.860
half the genetic material
like we're used to

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.640
with the eggs from sexual reproduction.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.950
For parthenogenesis, many times
this egg has a complete set

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.100
of genetic information
and then it can just go

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.950
and start doing mitosis
and turn to an organism

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.210
or there's even situations
where the egg does have

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.890
half the genetic information,
we'll talk about this

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.240
in future videos, this
would be a haploid cell,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.830
it has half the genetic
information of its parent,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.400
but the haploid cell in
certain cases can develop

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.940
into a full organism.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.860
And there are organisms
like komodo dragons that can

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.340
reproduce both with
parthenogenesis which would

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.710
be asexual, and in certain
cases with sexual reproduction.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.780
So I'll leave you there, two
big categories, I'll draw

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.450
a dividing line here so
we don't get confused.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.620
All the stuff that I drew
on the left, to the left

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.920
of this yellow line, these

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.470
are forms of asexual reproduction.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.340
Where for the most part,
one organism can make a copy

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.870
of itself that has the
same genetic information.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.350
On the right we have sexual
reproduction where in order

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.110
to produce a new organism,
an egg cell and a sperm cell

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.570
need to get together.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.280
The sperm cell needs to
fertilize the egg cell

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.700
and each of them would
have a sample of half the

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.130
genetic information from their parents.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.020
Now, I'll leave you with a
final question, we should

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.730
always be asking this in
biology, is why do we think

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.570
sexual reproduction emerged?

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.400
It actually emerged much later
in our evolutionary history

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.670
than asexual reproduction.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.670
Well one argument for it
is is it produces much more

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.350
variation in its offspring.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.470
And if you have more
variation in your offspring,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:31.770
and if you have more
variation in a population,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.570
you have a higher likelihood
that certain variations

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.150
will be better suited for the environment

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.890
that you are in.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.290
I'll let you think about
that a little bit more.
