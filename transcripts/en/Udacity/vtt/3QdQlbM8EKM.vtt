00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.664
The answer is that the input should be a string

00:00:02.664 --> 00:00:05.414
giving the contents of the rest of the web page.

00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:07.457
That's how "get-next-target" works.

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:10.725
It finds the first target from the current page.

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:14.280
One way to see that, is to look at the code we're trying to replace.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.698
This code defines lots of variables.

00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:19.473
It gives them values.

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:24.322
The only one it uses on the right side, before giving it a value, is "page"

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:27.095
When it uses "start_link" on the right side here,

00:00:27.095 --> 00:00:30.380
well the code defines "start_link" on the line above,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.695
so, it didn't care about the value of "start_link" going into this code.

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:36.629
The only variable whose value we care about

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.178
going into this code

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:39.792
is the value of "page,"

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:41.329
and what "page" is, is a string

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.000
giving the contents of the rest of the web page.
