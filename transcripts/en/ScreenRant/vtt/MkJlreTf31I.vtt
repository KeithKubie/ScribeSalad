00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.560
Acting is a very safe profession, right?

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.510
Well, while it may be thought of as pretty
people playing pretend, it turns out some

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.750
movies can actually put their stars in a great
deal of danger!

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.640
For this list we are taking a look at some
films where the actors ended up in some pretty

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.060
dicey situations.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.230

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.100
Before we start, can you name this movie from
these emojis?

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.200
Hang on to your answer and stay tuned for
more fun movie trivia throughout the video.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.870
Here are 10 Popular Movies That Put Actors
In Danger

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.920
Now You See Me
The best magic tricks happen when the magician

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.420
can fool the audience into thinking there
is actual danger going on.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.890
Unfortunately, the crew behind Now You See
Me needed no tricks as they actually put their

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.969
actress, Isla Fisher, in serious danger while
she was performing the underwater escape trick.

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.320
The actress nearly drowned filming the stunt
after getting caught up in her submerged chains.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.210
The big problem was that the script also called
for Fisher’s character to pretend like she

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.680
was struggling, so it took quite a while for
anyone to realize the actress was in real

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.680
danger.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.140
Luckily, Fisher was able to untangle herself
from the chains and escape before things got

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.750
dicey.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.220
This was a very dangerous moment and we can
understand why her character had to be recast

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:32.420
for the sequel!

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.040
The Hunger Games
The plot of The Hunger Games franchise is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.850
one of the most violent and dangerous stories
of all time so it sort of makes sense that

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.750
the production of the films would end up being
rather dangerous too!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.470
Leading lady Jennifer Lawrence did a lot of
her own stunts, which resulted in numerous

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.820
scrapes and bruises.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.330
Much worse than that though, was when the
cast had to swim in some very cold and dirty

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.920
waters for the second movie.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.800
Several cast members ended up with hard bumps
and ear infections and Lawrence even suffered

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.990
a broken eardrum.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.860
The most dangerous moment of all came while
filming the third movie.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.460
In a scene where Lawrence needed to escape
a burning tunnel, a fog machine busted and

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.740
the actress ended up inhaling tons of smoke
and passing out.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.060
Luckily, she ended up being fine but we won’t
be surprised if Lawrence sticks to safer roles

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.069
going forward!

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.090
Lawrence, while still young, has already racked
up quite a bit of success – do you know

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.980
how many times she has been nominated for
an Academy Award?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.310
Is it 3, 4 or 5?

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:30.010
Hold on to your answer until the end of the
video!

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.069
The Wizard of Oz
The 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz is still

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.519
considered one of the greatest movies ever
made.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.400
Hopefully, this long lasting recognition has
helped to offset the truly dangerous working

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.319
conditions the actors had to go through to
make this movie.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.989
We get it, it was the 30’s and effects weren’t
as advanced as they are today but it’s pretty

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.540
scary to hear about how troubled the production
really was.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.430
The worst part was the makeup that ended up
being so toxic that it burned the faces of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.280
many of the actors including the Wicked Witch
of The West!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.560
If this happened today, it would certainly
cause an enormous legal scandal, as actor’s

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.830
looks are some of the most heavily insured
commodities around.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.150
Inglourious Basterds
Quentin Tarantino is a wild man and his movies

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:26.640
reflect his personality as they often feature
some crazy characters and action sequences.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.430
Inglorious Basterds is undoubtedly one of
his best, but it also happens to be one of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.959
his most dangerous.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.830
The climax of the movie comes when Shoshanna
plans to burn down a theater playing Nazi

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.450
propaganda film – killing all of the high-ranking
Nazis inside.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.900
To film this scene, Tarantino actually lit
an enormous movie screen on fire, but as you

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.069
can imagine things got pretty out of hand.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.120
The flames began to rage out of control, coming
close to burning the cast and crew but Tarantino

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.629
couldn’t call cut as they only had one chance
at getting this scene right.

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.330
This moment was cinematically brilliant but
we have to wonder if some of the nearly BBQ’d

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:08.909
actors wish it had been done in postproduction.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:13.140
Mad Max: Fury Road
The practical effects from 2015’s Mad Max:

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.840
Fury Road have been praised as being some
of the best of all time, but that acclaim

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.579
didn’t come without a cost as director George
Miller put his cast and crew through some

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.650
of the most dangerous conditions of all time
in order to create this masterpiece.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.729
First of all, the movie was filmed in the
African desert, where just standing outside

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.750
in 150-degree heat could kill someone.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.669
On top of that, the region was well known
for violence with Africa’s various civil

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.000
wars making the shoot even more risky.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.009
The action itself was also very dangerous
and stars Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron both

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.320
suffered nearly fatal falls from the action.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.610
The movie did turn out amazing it was probably
all worth it but we wonder if a better title

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.009
for the film might have been Mad George: Scary
Shoot.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.449
We’ve already told you that this movie was
filmed in Africa but do you know where the

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.310
original Mad Max films were shot?

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:05.470
Hang on to your answer until the end of the
video to see how well you know your movies!

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.300
The Expendables 3
At this point, you could probably consider

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.180
Jason Statham more of a stunt man with dialogue
than an actual actor.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.820
Statham’s brand is synonymous with action
and danger and it’s no surprise that he

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.780
keeps popping up in movies like The Expendables,
Mechanic and Furious 7.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.440
While filming the third Expendables, Statham
got into some pretty hot water when he nearly

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.020
drowned in the black sea after he crashed
the truck into the water and was trapped inside.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.780
Luckily, the crew was able to pull him out
and Statham didn’t miss a beat – continuing

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.340
shooting all of his action scenes.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:46.360
Jason Statham is one tough guy that we definitely
don’t ever want to fight!

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.470
Sylvester Stallone – Rocky IV
Sylvester Stallone is one tough looking dude

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.180
so it’s no surprise that while filming Rocky
IV, he actually requested Dolph Lundgren (aka

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.460
Ivan Drago) to really try to knock his character
out.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.380
Unfortunately, Stallone isn’t ACTUALLY Rocky
so after Lundgren landed a few serious blow,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.590
Stallone had to call cut to avoid any more
serious injuries.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.949
As it turns out, Sly had put himself in some
pretty serious danger after all and he needed

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.110
to be rushed to the hospital as his blood
pressure was spiking to nearly fatal levels.

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.840
There’s a reason it’s called acting, and
Stallone definitely learned his lesson that

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.740
day.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.730
The Bourne Supremacy
Lately, the most dangerous thing that Matt

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.250
Damon can do is go anywhere near Jimmy Kimmel
– as the talk show host will undoubtedly

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.250
roast him.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.129
However, it’s not that long ago tha Damon
was one of the most daring action starts working

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:34.129
in Hollywood.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:37.650
While filming The Bourne Supremacy, Damon
performed all of his own stunts including

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.810
some pretty daring underwater drowning scenes
that he was reportedly terrified of doing.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.699
The most dangerous scene from the shoot was
of him smashing another cars together under

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:53.810
tunnel underwater – yikes.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:04.210
The Bling Ring
Directed by Sofia Coppola, 2013’s The Bling

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.120
Ring is probably one of the most dangerously
average movies we’ve seen in a while.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.750
There’s not much that is memorable from
the film but we have to think that Emma Watson

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.419
won’t soon forget making the flick, as she
got pretty hurt during the process.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:19.539
Apparently, while filming a scene at a nightclub
one of the extras stepped on Watson’s toe

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:21.060
with her stiletto heel.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.860
Watson stayed in character and kept on dancing
but when they took a break and the actress

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.190
looked down, her foot was bleeding profusely.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.639
Luckily, foot injuries are rarely life threatening
and we are guessing it was the clumsy extra

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.190
who probably felt like dying in that moment.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.539
Emma Watson stars in the new live action adaptation
of Beauty and The Beast but do you know what

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:41.040
movie she passed up to play the role of Belle?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.030
Hint: it won some Oscars this year!

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.169
The Fifth Wave - Chloe Grace Moretz
For an actress who is only just 20 years young,

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:56.460
Chloe Grace Moretz has already done an impressive
amount of work.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.520
Moretz has unfortunately already suffered
a pretty bad on set injury and while you may

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.370
think it came while filming Kick Ass, Chloe
actually got hurt on the set of The Fifth

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.370
Wave.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.949
While filming the movie, the then 17-year-old
actress suffered a knee injury that forced

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.220
her to wear a brace and walk with crutches.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.259
This slowed down the production big time,
but luckily the actress was able to recover

00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:19.409
rather quickly and was able to finish shooting
the movie.

00:08:19.409 --> 00:08:24.240
That brings us to the end of our list, which
means it’s time to answer those trivia questions!

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.729
Jennifer Lawrence has actually been nominated
for 4 Academy Awards, taking home a win in

00:08:26.729 --> 00:08:27.729
2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.560
The original Mad Max movies starring Mel Gibson
were filmed in...drum role please…Australia!

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.630
And finally, the role that Watson passed up
to play Belle was Mia from 2016’s La La

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.630
Land.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.630
She might be regretting that now seeing as
Emma Stone won an Oscar for the role…That’s
