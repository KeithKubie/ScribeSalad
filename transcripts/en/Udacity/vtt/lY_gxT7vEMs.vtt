00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.155
In this lesson, we're going to look at living in groups and the social

00:00:03.155 --> 00:00:06.816
influence of others. And we're going to do so by breaking the lesson into three

00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:11.745
sections. In the first section, we're going to look at forces that change our

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:15.320
behavior and this includes social facilitation and social loafing as well as

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.034
conformity and obedience. In the second part of the lesson we're going to look

00:00:21.034 --> 00:00:25.841
at social forces that change our perception and attitudes towards others. And

00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:29.375
this includes social perception theory and attribution theory as well as

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:34.193
inclusion and exclusion. Prejudice and discrimination, as well as our attitudes

00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:38.468
and our behaviors. And then finally in the third section we're going to look at

00:00:38.468 --> 00:00:42.966
how we act towards others. And this includes aggressiveness and pro-social

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:48.351
behavior, as well as who we like, attraction, and what love is. But let's get

00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:51.930
started with social forces. I remember back in junior high school when one of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.118
my friends was having a party. Everybody was talking about the invitations that

00:00:56.118 --> 00:00:58.890
they got, what they were going to wear to the party, how exciting it was going

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.234
to be. And given that I had been invited to parties in this group of friends in

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:08.464
the past, I had assumed that I would be invited to this one as well. However,

00:01:08.464 --> 00:01:14.195
it turns out that I realized quite quickly I was not invited to this party. And

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:20.760
I remember feeling a pit in my stomach, I was angry, I was sad, I was envious.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.180
And most of all I felt pain. I had just experienced my first harsh encounter

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.940
with social rejection.
