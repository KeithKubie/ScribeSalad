00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.936
- [Lecturer] We've already talked about

00:00:01.936 --> 00:00:05.353
the Aztec civilization in several videos,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.068
but what we're going to
focus on in this video

00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:13.228
is the Aztec empire which
shouldn't be confused

00:00:13.228 --> 00:00:15.683
with the Aztec civilization.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.208
The civilization is
referring to the broader

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.576
groups of people over hundreds of years,

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:23.586
but the Aztec empire is
a very specific entity

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:27.753
that formed in the 100 years
before Spanish colonization.

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:31.936
What you see here is a zoomed in version

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:35.327
of what today would be southern Mexico

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:38.080
and right over here on the globe

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.494
and you can see many
city-states formed here.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:45.120
A city-state is a city that
is also considers itself

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.194
a state that has its own political

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:49.767
organization, its own way of functioning.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:53.334
It's not dependent on any
other government forms,

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:55.915
and it's analogous to what
we see in classical Greece

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.734
where we have the city-states
of Athens and Sparta.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.900
Now what's particularly
interesting is what's

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.983
going on around Lake
Texcoco in the 14th Century.

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:12.308
In 1325 you have the
city of Tenochtitlan form

00:01:13.903 --> 00:01:17.092
on this island in Lake Texcoco

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.515
and initially Tenochtitlan is one of the

00:01:19.515 --> 00:01:22.765
weaker city-states around Lake Texcoco.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.260
You see many of these city-states,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.856
some of the stronger ones
you have Texcoco right here,

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.841
and in particular you have Azcapotzalco,

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:35.258
but as we fast forward roughly 100 years,

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.433
you get to a situation where Azcapotzalco

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.450
falls into a civil war.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.861
Their ruler dies and
there's a succession battle

00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:50.028
and the various city-states
around Lake Texcoco take sides.

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:54.517
What eventually happens is Tenochtitlan,

00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:57.850
Texcoco, and Tlacopan form what is known

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.972
as a triple alliance
or the triple alliance

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:06.389
and are able to conquer the Azcapotzalco.

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:10.657
And so in conquering the Azcapotzalco,

00:02:10.657 --> 00:02:14.824
what you have forming is
known as the Aztec empire.

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:19.805
Now it starts as an alliance between

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:24.620
these three city-states and
other city-states in the area,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.744
but over time Tenochtitlan
which is sometimes

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:30.577
referred to as Mexico Tenochtitlan

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.567
because it is a city-state
of the Mexico people

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:36.960
and this is where the name Mexico

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.415
or Mexico actually comes from.

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.175
Now even though it's an alliance,

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:43.870
over time, Tenochtitlan essentially

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.203
becomes the capital of this alliance,

00:02:46.203 --> 00:02:49.258
or the capital of this Aztec empire

00:02:49.258 --> 00:02:52.581
which continues on for roughly 100 years

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:56.748
until 1521 when it is
defeated by Hernando Cortes.

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:02.781
Now the story of how Hernando Cortes

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:06.180
is able to conquer this
empire is fascinating

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.678
and I'm not going to be able to go into

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.995
all of the details in this
video, but needless to say

00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:14.018
he's able to convince
several hundred conquistadors

00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:17.470
to come and try to conquer the empire

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.188
and he's able to do so by
recruiting tens of thousands,

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:23.153
some estimates I've seen
are 100,000 soldiers

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:25.625
from neighboring
city-states who had issues

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:29.729
with the Mexico or with the Aztec empire

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.996
and so he's eventually able to take over

00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:34.948
the famed city of Tenochtitlan.

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.560
It's really important to recognize

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.667
how advanced they were at the time.

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:40.697
You see these causeways, these bridges

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:42.897
leading into the island.

00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:44.701
They had a fairly advanced dam system

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.609
to collect freshwater from the rain

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.781
while also to control flooding.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:49.883
In fact a lot of that was destroyed

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.614
when the conquistadors
came and Mexico City

00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:55.903
which eventually gets
founded over this lake

00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:57.737
is going to have issues with flooding

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.037
for some time in the future.

00:04:00.037 --> 00:04:02.542
In fact the Spanish, in order
to control the flooding,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:06.709
end up draining this lake and
it's where Mexico City forms.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.789
But the big takeaway here is near the end

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:13.405
of the Aztec civilization,

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:17.827
as we get to the 100 years
before the conquistadors arrive,

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:20.562
you have this empire form.

00:04:20.562 --> 00:04:24.424
This empire which starts as
an alliance of city-states

00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:27.215
but eventually becomes a tributary empire.

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:29.130
Unlike the neighboring Mayans,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.138
which were on the Yucatan peninsula.

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:33.913
On this map they would be in
this region right over here,

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:38.073
the neighboring Mayans were
autonomous city-states.

00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:40.428
Some might have had more
power, more influence

00:04:40.428 --> 00:04:44.918
at different times, but the
Aztec tributary state means

00:04:44.918 --> 00:04:48.764
the other city-states are
paying tribute to Tenochtitlan.

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:51.310
They are paying revenue,
they are paying service

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.671
to what essentially is the capital

00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:58.927
or the seat of that empire
until it is conquered

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:01.256
by the Spanish with, and remember,

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:02.290
the Spanish are able to do this

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.078
with several hundred conquistadors

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:06.924
with the help of neighboring city-states

00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:09.778
and a smallpox epidemic which kills

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:12.908
50% of the population of the region.
