00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:04.760
Narrator: Let's say that
I am a producer of wine

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.946
and in this axis, vertical axis,
this is dollars per bottle,

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:13.610
so 10, 20, 30, $40 per bottle.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.633
On this axis right over here I will have

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.017
quantity of bottles I produce per week.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.619
Let's say that this is
100, this is 200, 300

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.732
and then 400.

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:31.954
This is quantity of
bottles per week, per week

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:36.361
and this is dollars per bottle.

00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.131
Let's think about the demand curve here.

00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:40.524
The demand curve for my type of wine,

00:00:40.524 --> 00:00:42.192
we're going to assume this
is highly differentiated

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:45.859
wine, the demand curve
looks something like that.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.356
Now, I'm doing it as a
straight line for simplicity.

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.901
The demand curve looks like that.

00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:52.391
Since I said differentiated,
this is not going to be

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:53.661
perfect competition.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.995
I have a monopoly in my type of wine,

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:57.979
so this isn't the market
for wine generally,

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.998
this is a market for my wine.

00:01:00.998 --> 00:01:02.995
My wine has won some taste tests,

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.334
it has this unique
flavor and whatever else,

00:01:05.334 --> 00:01:09.460
so you can view me as a
monopolistic competitor.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.410
There's obviously
competition from other wine

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.072
labels, from other wine producers,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.803
but my wine is differentiated
and I have a monopoly

00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:18.535
in my particular type of wine.

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.204
We've done this multiple times,

00:01:20.204 --> 00:01:22.377
if I have a monopoly in my type of wine,

00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:24.136
we're talking about the market in my wine,

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.733
then my marginal revenue curve,

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:28.180
my marginal revenue curve
will have twice the slope

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.581
of this, so it will look
something like that.

00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.913
It will actually keep
going negative after that,

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:37.000
so that is my marginal revenue curve.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.739
Then we can think about the cost side.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.117
The cost side of things, my marginal cost

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.599
might look something like this.

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.527
Marginal cost or you
could even view that as

00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:48.988
a supply curve for my wine.

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:51.324
Then we can also do average total cost.

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:53.725
So the average total cost start off high,

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.596
we have a fixed cost
divided by a small quantity,

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:59.159
but the marginal costs
are lower than the average

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.825
so the average keeps going down and down

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.680
and down and down, then they're equal.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.481
Now each incremental unit is bring up the

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.376
average in cost, so then
the average total in cost

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:08.873
might look something like that.

00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:10.526
Average total cost.

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:13.693
We've seen this show multiple times.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:16.127
If in the near term, I
do have a monopoly here,

00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:19.068
so I will just produce the quantity where

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:21.862
my marginal revenue is
equal to my marginal cost.

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:23.861
Before that quantity, for every unit,

00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:26.098
I'm getting economic
profit, economic profit,

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:27.194
economic profit.

00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:28.394
If I produce more than
that I'm not getting

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.462
any economic profit
anymore, so I'm going to

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.271
produce this quantity which, I don't know,

00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.016
looks like about 160 units
and I'm going to sell it

00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.681
... I'm going to sell it for ...

00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:40.269
Oh, I'm going to be careful here.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.195
The price I'm going to be able to sell it,

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.539
so this is the quantity that
I'm going to be able to sell,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.139
the price that I'm going to sell it at,

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.278
go up to the demand curve,
that point of the demand

00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:50.279
curve and it looks like
I'll be able to sell it

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.767
for about, I don't know, $33 a bottle.

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:56.861
So, $33 a bottle and if
we want to think about

00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:59.796
economic profit, this
is the average revenue

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.880
per bottle, this is the
average cost per bottle.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.933
So, this is the average economic profit

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:07.428
per bottle and I multiply
that times the total number

00:03:07.428 --> 00:03:11.178
of bottles and I'm going
to get my economic profit.

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:15.361
This area right over here
is my total economic profit.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.457
We can think about how
much are the consumers

00:03:17.457 --> 00:03:20.017
benefiting from it and how
benefit are they getting

00:03:20.017 --> 00:03:21.859
excess of what they're paying for it

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.199
and that would be this
area right over here.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.687
That is the consumer surplus.

00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:30.394
(writing) Consumer, consumer surplus.

00:03:30.394 --> 00:03:32.195
Now, let's say I'm just
not happy with this.

00:03:32.195 --> 00:03:34.065
I see that there's an
opportunity here to get

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:36.203
even more economic
profit because after all

00:03:36.203 --> 00:03:38.390
we've been talking about
this from the beginning.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.234
There are people here who are getting over

00:03:40.234 --> 00:03:43.491
$40 of benefit from my
wine, but I'm selling

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:45.140
it to them for only $33.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.936
Everything we've assumed so
far is that we're selling

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:50.392
... all the consumers are
buying something at the

00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:54.270
exact same price, but I'm
a crafty wine producer

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.813
and I say, well, let me
call that in to question.

00:03:56.813 --> 00:04:00.059
Why can't I just put a
different label on my exact

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.559
same wine and sell it to these people for

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.937
a different price and so
I do that exact thing.

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:07.604
I still produce this exact same quantity,

00:04:07.604 --> 00:04:09.678
I produce this exact same quantity,

00:04:09.678 --> 00:04:12.874
but the first hundred units of my quantity

00:04:12.874 --> 00:04:14.563
I put a different label on it.

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:17.741
This label says 'Super Fancy Wine.'

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.992
(writing) Super Fancy
Premium, the best wine

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:20.890
you ever drank.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.189
Super Fancy Premium Wine,
it has all of the awards,

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.459
all of the fancy people who like it.

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:28.486
I put it in the best wine boutiques

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:30.532
and the best restaurants, with that label,

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:32.327
all the exact same stuff in the bottle

00:04:32.327 --> 00:04:35.026
and I sell that one at $40 a bottle.

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:38.737
So the first hundred units
I sell at $40 a bottle,

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.263
so now my economic
profit on those units ...

00:04:41.263 --> 00:04:43.659
remember, I'm producing 150, so my average

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.404
total cost is down here.

00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:47.575
My average total cost is
this line right over here.

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:49.488
So, on those bottles I'm getting this much

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:51.079
economic profit per bottle times

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:52.431
these hundred units.

00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:54.927
I've now increased my economic profit.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.577
I've eaten into the consumer surplus.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:04:59.859
I've taken some of that for
myself and turned it in to

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:01.819
economic profit and then the other,

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.345
I don't know, this looks
like about 60 or 70 bottles,

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.994
I just have with the traditional label

00:05:05.994 --> 00:05:08.142
and I maybe sell at the supermarket.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:11.484
(writing) Traditional, traditional label

00:05:11.484 --> 00:05:13.123
and I just sell it at the supermarket.

00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:14.913
I call it, just, Pretty Good Wine,

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.593
just so in case someone
who bought it at the fancy

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:18.352
place doesn't see that
the Pretty Good Wine

00:05:18.352 --> 00:05:20.567
is the exact same thing.

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:23.751
What I've just done here
is I've discriminated,

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.594
I've discriminated amongst consumers

00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:27.992
depending on consumers willingness to pay,

00:05:27.992 --> 00:05:29.926
I've essentially charged
them different prices

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:33.075
and also, to some degree,
based on where they shop

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:35.272
and their gullibility, I am charging them

00:05:35.272 --> 00:05:37.243
two completely different prices.

00:05:37.243 --> 00:05:43.786
This right over here is
called price discrimination.

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:48.712
It's a way that a supplier
can essentially take

00:05:48.712 --> 00:05:51.116
some of the consumer
surplus for themselves,

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:54.454
eat into some of that
excess marginal benefit

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.380
that they're essentially
giving it to the consumer

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.143
and turning it into economic profit.
