00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.120
The first answer to keep snooping sys admins from knowing

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.250
everyone's passwords. That's actually correct. That's there's no reason why you

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.480
as a website owner should, you know, know your user's passwords.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.490
Or maybe there are a few reasons but not very good

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.250
ones. And this, you know, eliminates a whole, you know, issue

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.860
that you have to worry about. Because people often use the

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.980
same password for many websites. This also correct answer. I wish

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.200
people didn't, and you may think well, it's not my problem.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.430
But, if you're accepting user's passwords you do have

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.550
a bit of a moral obligation to keep them safe.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.820
Because no matter how loud you yell and scream,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.320
people are going to continue to use the same password,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.850
allows the passwords for many websites. If the database

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.240
is compromised the passwords are reasonably safe, this is also

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.440
true. They're not completely safe of course. You know

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.460
they have your database now, they know what those hashes

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.860
are they can figure out the passwords in some potentially huge amount of time.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.660
But it's a lot safer than just giving them the passwords. And if you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.160
don't, you will regret it. This is also true. And I'm going to share

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.160
a tale of, of me goofing on this and how much I regret it.
