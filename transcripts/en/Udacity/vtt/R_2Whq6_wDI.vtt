Okay, most likely, we would expect to see the RNA folded on itself somehow. And

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.660
it can do this because, wherever base pairing

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.590
can actually occur, meaning whenever you have a

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.980
stretch of nitrogenous bases or letters that

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.650
actually match up. That the RNA can actually

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.620
fold back and pair with itself. So although

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.270
it doesn't have a complete complementary second strand

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.140
like DNA would have. It can still base pair and usually it will base pair

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.087
on itself, if it can by just folding back an matching any regions that it has.

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:39.330
