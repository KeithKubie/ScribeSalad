JAY BLAKESBERG: Hey, everybody.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.120
Thanks for coming out and
spending your time with me.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.980
I appreciate it.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.630
My name is Jay Blakesberg,
and I'm a photographer.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.160
And I live in San Francisco, and
I do a lot of video work, also.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.660
And most of my career has
been in the music industry

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.150
as a photographer.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.570
You know, you hear about people
all the time saying, God,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.700
I want to be a
rock photographer.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.220
And somehow I pulled it off.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.920
So it's been pretty good ride.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.140
So, I grew up in New
Jersey, suburban New Jersey,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.049
and I went to high
school in the 1970s.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.300
I went to high school
from '75 to '79,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.140
classic dazed and
confused years.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.304
And this is in upstate
New York, actually.

00:00:39.304 --> 00:00:41.970
This is my best friend from high
school, moved up to upstate New

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.300
York, and we used to go up
there every weekend we could

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.720
and get wasted.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.940
And that's me as a young
teenager-- that's about 1978.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.490
And we would party, like any
other teenager in the 1970s.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.630
We didn't have the internet.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.130
We were young, stupid teenagers.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.989
And this picture, when I put it
on Facebook a couple weeks ago

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.030
for a throwback Thursday,
got a lot of attention.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.700
People really liked the fact
that I was smoking marijuana.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.570
And then, in 1977, my sister
took me to my first Grateful

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.220
Dead concert, and nothing
has been the same sense.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.450
This is me at Englishtown, which
was a very famous Grateful Dead

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.470
concert, Labor Day weekend 1977.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.410
There were 100,000 people
that came to this concert.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.120
And pretty
life-changing experience

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.172
for me, which we'll get
into as time goes on.

00:01:32.172 --> 00:01:34.380
Not because I'm passed out
with a bong on my stomach,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.030
but just because of the journey
that I've taken with that.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.190
And yes, what a long,
strange trip it has been,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.430
and continues to be so.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.220
This is my very,
very first photograph

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.930
that was ever published
in a magazine.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.530
And it was published
in Relix magazine

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.330
and that is Jorma Kaukonen, from
the Jefferson Airplane and Hot

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.180
Tuna.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.290
And Hot Tuna had just broken
up-- this was taken in 1978.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.610
And-- I need a couple
of dates here--

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.459
and it was a solo
concert for Jorma.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.750
It was billed as Hot Tuna
but Hot Tuna had just broken,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.979
up Jorma played
it solo acoustic.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.340
And I was 16 years old.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180
And we drove up with
a friend of mine

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.300
who was a senior in high school.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.930
And he had a little Carmen
Ghia-- you know, those little,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.930
Volkswagen Carmen Ghias?

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.350
And me and my friend, Nicky, who
were about this big back then,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.060
sat in the back.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.580
And after the
concert, we decided

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.980
we were going to follow
Jorma's limo into New York City

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.700
to meet Jorma, because
we were 16 and stupid.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.037
And so, we followed him in.

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:36.120
And he stopped at a
delicatessen to get some food.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.890
I went in there.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.157
I had my brother's camera
that I had borrowed,

00:02:39.157 --> 00:02:40.990
and I said, hey, Jorma,
how about a picture?

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.160
And I got this picture.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.630
And then I send
it in as a letter

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.710
to the editor in Relix magazine.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.660
Relix is still around today.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.170
And they published it
with my little story

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.000
about following Jorma
into New York City.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.541
And that was my very
first photograph

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.180
that was ever published-- but
not paid for-- as a letter

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.800
to the editor.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.310
Jorma, who still
makes music today,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220
is a good friend of mine.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.310
We talk and
communicate regularly,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.050
and I still go shoot
him and go to his shows.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.290
That's me graduating
from high school.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.180
So that previous photo
was in November of '78.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.324
This is in June of '79.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:14.740
I don't know if
you can see there,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.480
I've got a Grateful
Dead skull and roses

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.480
patch on my graduation gown.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.704
And then, right after
high school was over,

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.620
I was starting to bring
my camera to concerts.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.850
And this to me is a
very iconic photo.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.760
This was taken-- I
believe in June of '79--

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.180
at Radio City Music Hall.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.930
And this is BB King,
James Cotton, Muddy Water,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.730
and Johnny Winter.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.030
And these are like, you know,
the guys in blues music.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.119
And you know, I think out
of the roll or two of film

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:43.160
that I shot, I think this
is the only shot that's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.490
really, actually in focus
and exposed properly.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.170
I was still trying
to figure it all out.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.920
Back then, we didn't
have digital cameras,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.400
so you actually had to know
how to expose film, and develop

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.782
film, and whatnot.

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:54.490
Another photo that I
took a couple months

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.510
after graduating high school,
Crosby, Stills and Nash,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.619
Madison Square Garden,
September of '79.

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:01.160
This was at the big
No Nukes concerts

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.370
that they did back then.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.910
And it's sort of indicative
of how everything--

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.820
how valuable
intellectual property is.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.390
You know, people say, what
do you do for a living?

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.800
And depending on who you
are, I might say, well,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.675
I create intellectual
property and license it

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:17.767
across multiple platforms.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.350
Which is really what
I do, but I do it

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.800
with photography and video.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.390
So Stephen Stills used,
not this exact shot,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.400
but one similar in color
for his new box set

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.544
that just came out six
months ago or whatever.

00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:28.960
So here's a photo
that I took just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.300
out of high school in
1979, 35 years ago,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.920
that still has value today
as intellectual property.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.140
This is me at a Grateful
Dead concert in 1980,

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.570
so I was starting
to kind of come out

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.760
as a full blown hippie.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.520
And by 1981, I was the full
blown, sophisticated, groovy

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.120
hippie on Grateful Dead
tour that I am today.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.100
Few years later, I
kind of was laying low,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.270
wasn't doing much photography,
I moved to Olympia, Washington

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.020
and I went to the
Evergreen State College.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.780
And after I graduated
from Evergreen in '85,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.934
I believe it was, I
was back up in Seattle

00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:06.850
visiting some friends.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.970
And I went to this
concert, which

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.330
was the band X. It was actually
X and the Red Hot Chili

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.710
Peppers.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.590
This is at the Moore
Theater up in Seattle.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.112
And I just love this
shot because this guy--

00:05:16.112 --> 00:05:17.570
this stage was
really high, you can

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.410
see from their faces-- I mean,
this guy he came crashing down

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.310
on these people like
from 15 feet in the air.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.610
So, shortly after that I
became a house photographer

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.690
at a nightclub in San
Francisco on Haight Street

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:30.439
called the I-Beam.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.610
The I-Beam doesn't
exist anymore,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.114
that whole block was
knocked down and rebuilt.

00:05:35.114 --> 00:05:36.530
And this is actually
Chris Cornell

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.400
from Soundgarden stage
diving at that show.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.500
And this is in
1989, when I think

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.310
just before "Louder
Than Love" came out.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.430
Soundgarden's sound
man at the time

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.480
was my college roommate
at Evergreen before that.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.188
He actually grew up
with a couple of guys

00:05:50.188 --> 00:05:51.054
from Soundgarden.

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:53.220
He has a big recording
studio in Seattle to this day

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.920
that everybody's recorded in.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.570
Another shot of Chris Cornell.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.370
And then, this is the
same show, and that's

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.199
Eric Johnson, who was their
tour manager and merch

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.740
guy at the time-- he's actually
Neil Young's tour manager now

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.135
and has been for the
last 12, 15 years.

00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:07.510
After working for
Soundgarden, he

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.370
started working for Pearl Jam,
and then Neil stole him away.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.690
Another shot from the I-Beam.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.500
Just a crowd shot.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.600
This concert, the
band was called

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.220
The Godfather, who
are a British band.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.980
They had one big hit, I think
it was called "Love Work, Taxes

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.760
Death", something like that.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.640
Something like Birth, School,
Taxes, Death-- Birth, School,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.350
Work, Death--
something like that.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.170
Anyway, you know, a lot
of craziness at the I-Beam

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.395
and I got crushed
frequently at that club.

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:35.270
And they only had live
music on Monday nights

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.770
at the I-Beam,
which was very odd.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.311
And the other nights
on the weekends,

00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:40.270
it was a gay dance club,
which was very odd.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.320
But they had all
sorts of great bands.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.980
Butthole Surfers-- this
is actually at the I-Beam,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.180
but it was the I-Beam West.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.180
They have like-- did a
few shows south of Market

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.405
at some warehouse that
is now some dot com

00:06:51.405 --> 00:06:53.550
or something like that.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.780
This is Nirvana, taken
up on Haight Street,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.340
before Dave Grohl
was in the band.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.504
This is before
"Nevermind" came out,

00:06:59.504 --> 00:07:01.420
and they were doing an
in-store at Rough Trade

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.730
Records on Haight Street.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.476
I invited them back
to a photo studio

00:07:04.476 --> 00:07:06.100
afterwards, on their
way to Sacramento,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.019
to do a band portrait.

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:08.560
And they got lost
and never found it,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.060
and called me from Sacramento
hours later like, sorry, dude,

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:11.940
we're not coming.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.470
So I never got to do a portrait
of Nirvana, unfortunately.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.140
This sort of the
beginning of my big break.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.670
This is U2 during the
filming of "Rattle and Hum."

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:22.900
and that's me over
there with the camera.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.404
And this was taken
into a mirror.

00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:27.070
When they were filming
"Rattle and Hum,"

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.780
they came to the
Mission District.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.640
And they were touring
a bunch of murals.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.100
And this is at the
Mission Cultural Center.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.474
And this guy right
here, his name

00:07:33.474 --> 00:07:35.542
is Rene Castro and
his wife, Deborah.

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:38.000
Deborah worked at Sammy's Camera
in the city-- which is now

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.850
back, it was Pro
Camera for a while.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.340
And I was friends with her.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.910
And this guy, Dave, was
friends with Bono and The Edge.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.940
And Rene was a famous
artist in Chile

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.140
who was kidnapped and tortured
by the government back

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.807
in the '70s.

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:53.640
And then Amnesty
International released him.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.140
And obviously U2 was big
with the whole Amnesty thing.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.336
And so they came
and toured this.

00:07:59.336 --> 00:08:01.710
Another shot of Bono from
visiting in the Mission Culture

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.210
Center.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.152
This is November of 1987.

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:05.610
And then, a couple
days later, they

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.830
did a free concert in
downtown San Francisco,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:08.710
which was in "Rattle and Hum."

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.918
And if you go watch the
movie, I'm the guy down front

00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:14.380
with the Nikon and the
mullet, you can't miss me.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.999
But the really important thing
about this particular shot

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:18.540
is, this was my very
first assignment

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.630
for "Rolling Stone"
magazine in print.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.260
I've done over 300 assignments
for "Rolling Stone" magazine

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.090
in print.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.090
And this is the shot that
ran in "Rolling Stone"

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.665
and I was literally--
the sound system

00:08:30.665 --> 00:08:33.039
for this free concert was the
Grateful Dead sound system.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.071
And so, there was a lot of buzz
going around in that circle

00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:37.320
that this was going to happen.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.194
And I got a phone call
from a friend of mine,

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:41.250
he's like, free U2
concert, it's happening,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.309
today, now, Justin Herman plaza.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.562
And I was putting all
my camera stuff together

00:08:45.562 --> 00:08:47.520
to take BART into the
city, and the phone rang.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.290
And it's like, hey
Jay, this is Jodi--

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.890
Jodi Peckman is still the photo
editor at "Rolling Stone"--

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.310
I have your big break for you.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.560
And she assigned me to
shoot this free concert.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.970
And that was my first photo
in "Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.420
This is The Pixies,
also, in 1988.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.454
Going back to the
I-Beam again, this

00:09:04.454 --> 00:09:06.620
is one of the just quick,
little backstage snapshots

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.240
that I did flash-on-camera.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.680
And the thing that is so great
about it is, three months ago,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.110
The Pixies hired me to do
their new publicity photos

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.130
for their next
whole album cycle.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.270
So we spent-- this was I think
in February of this year,

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.040
just a couple
months ago-- and we

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.620
spent three, four
hours in Alameda.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.620
They played The Fox in
Oakland the night before,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.830
and they were playing in
San Jose the next day.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.420
And we did all new publicity
photos of The Pixies.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.200
And I showed them that picture.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.450
It's in my book-- one
of the ones that's

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:33.783
out here in the hallway-- and
they were just blown away.

00:09:33.783 --> 00:09:37.790
And it's just amazing that
it's now 25 years later, like

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.430
that, you know?

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.540
"BAM" magazine was
a magazine here

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.480
in the Bay Area for many,
many, many years, decades-- all

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.750
through the '70s,
all through the '80s.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.620
It was a newsprint magazine.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.190
It stood for Bay Area Music.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.060
They eventually did
an edition down in LA.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.650
They used to have a
music awards thing

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.610
called the BAMies, the
Bay Area Music Awards.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:00.870
That was super fun.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.480
This was my first magazine
cover that I shot for them.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.230
I had been starting
to shoot some stuff.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.899
I basically walked in, met
with the editor, and said,

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:09.190
I want to shoot covers for you.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.760
I had never shot a
magazine cover before.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.010
And this is the first one
they did-- they assigned me.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.590
And this was Camper
Van Beethoven,

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.590
shot down in Santa Cruz.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.851
Red Hot Chili Peppers--
this was a "BAM" cover.

00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:21.350
These next few are
all "BAM" covers.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.940
This was actually
shot at The Film,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.820
or upstairs in the balcony
there, I set up a backdrop.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.005
And 1989, just some of my
favorite-- I mean, these-- you

00:10:29.005 --> 00:10:32.270
know, Flea and Anthony look like
babies in these pictures here.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:34.690
But some of my favorite
Chili Pepper shots.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:35.940
This is the band, Primus.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.740
This is my first
shoot with Primus.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.365
And this is-- we're going to do,
I think, questions afterwards,

00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:41.220
at the end.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.660
So write them down
or remember them.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.290
So Primus, I've had a really,
super-long relationship with,

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.790
which we'll get into a little
bit later in the presentation.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.170
But this was my first
shoot with them.

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:51.370
And it was a "BAM" cover.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.850
Less is really into
boating and fishing,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.120
and so we met at the dock.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.430
This is his boat
in San Pablo Bay.

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.810
I believe that's the actual
cover shot they used.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.282
I had them ride in their
boat, and as Less tells it,

00:11:03.282 --> 00:11:05.740
he says that I kept telling
them to come closer to the dock

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.823
until he smashed his boat.

00:11:06.823 --> 00:11:08.970
But I just think it was
his bad boat-riding,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.320
but he blames me to this day.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.760
Another cover with Iggy
Pop for "BAM" magazine.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.819
And you know, Iggy had
this leather jacket on,

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:19.110
and I was like-- you know,
I had 20 minutes with Iggy--

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.901
and I'm like, will you
take the jacket off?

00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:22.690
And he's like,
"er, um, fuck you."

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.380
You know.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.260
And then, like,
two minutes later,

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.301
he's like, "OK, fuck it."

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:27.174
You know, I'll take
the jacket off.

00:11:27.174 --> 00:11:29.340
So that's how we started,
with a jacket and a shirt.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.256
Then he took the shirt
off, put the jacket on.

00:11:31.256 --> 00:11:33.734
A little before-- you know,
eventually he was bare chested.

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:36.150
Because, you know, Iggy's got
that gnarly-- if you've ever

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.691
seen a picture of
Iggy, you know he's

00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:39.239
got that gnarly, gnarly body.

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:40.780
Jellyfish-- I don'
t know if you guys

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.740
remember Jellyfish,
great power pop band.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.680
My first photo shoot
with Carlos Santana.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.940
I've gone on to do a 25-year
relationship with him

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.290
and working with him.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.800
I love working with Carlos.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.380
Ice-T-- for awhile
there, they decided

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.970
that they were
going to put my name

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:58.830
and the writer's name
on the cover of "BAM"

00:11:58.830 --> 00:11:59.700
every time there was a story.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.670
So it would say, written
by Steve Stolder,

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.070
photographs by Jay Blakesberg.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.700
And when we did
this Ice-T cover,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.072
my name was bigger than Ice-T's.

00:12:06.072 --> 00:12:08.030
And after that issue,
they didn't put our names

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:11.176
on the cover anymore.

00:12:11.176 --> 00:12:12.550
Jane's Addiction--
this was right

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.970
before the very
Lollapalooza in 1991.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.690
They were doing a
short, little tour.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.200
This is up in Sacramento.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.840
And these guys hated each other.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.050
I mean, you know, Eric, the
bass player in the back,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.384
and Dave wouldn't talk to Perry.

00:12:23.384 --> 00:12:25.758
Everybody talked to the drummer,
Stephen Perkins, the guy

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:26.810
in the upper right.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.650
But the band did not
get along at all.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.170
And they just were not
happy to be doing it.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.461
And they were even unhappy--
there was an Almost Famous

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.210
moment-- when the
cover story came out,

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.640
it was just Perry on the cover.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.470
So, do you remember that scene
in "Almost Famous" were like,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.094
the singer's like in the lead on
the t-shirt and everybody else

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:41.136
is way in the background?

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:42.510
It was like one
of those moments.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.080
But they were just
all super unhappy.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.740
And I think Dave Navarro
was eating a cookie.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.060
And I said, "Can you
put the cookie away?"

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.268
And he goes, "Fuck you, dude.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:49.580
This is my time, not yours."

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.080
You know?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.910
And so, it was like
super, super tense.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.490
And then, that's like something
that they ran on the cover--

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:57.660
could've been that one
or something similar.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.580
Spinal Tap-- I got
to see Spinal Tap.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.880
This is a "BAM" magazine cover.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.470
We shot this in the conference
room at MCA Records.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.310
They were giving
away promo material.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.900
It's like a Spinal Tap joke.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.580
They said, you know,
to the record company,

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:15.080
"We want to do limited edition
calendars, calendars" right?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.330
You know, they wanted calendars
with pictures on them.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.090
But the label thought they
were saying "colander",

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.015
so they made
limited-edition colanders.

00:13:21.015 --> 00:13:21.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.680
JAY BLAKESBERG:
I still have one.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.850
I have like a little
metal colander.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.266
It's got a ticket
on it, you know,

00:13:25.266 --> 00:13:27.920
on a chain that says,
limited edition, one of 200,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.430
or something like that.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:30.640
Pretty funny.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.950
Cracker, who was the guy
from Camper Van Beethoven--

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.090
another "BAM Magazine" cover.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.566
Blind Melon, before
Shannon Hoon went off

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.740
and accidentally overdosed
and killed himself.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.890
Counting Crows-- this was
also a big cover for me--

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.490
this was in 1993.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.760
And this was their
first magazine cover,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.610
a cover of "BAM."

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.240
But the thing that was great
about this particular day

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.700
is that, after I did this
shoot, I want up to Mill Valley

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.420
to David Grisman's house
and did a magazine cover

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.878
with Jerry Garcia
and David Grisman

00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:57.520
for "Acoustic Guitar" Magazine.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.340
So a big day for me
to be doing that.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.770
Sheryl Crowe-- I also shot
her first magazine cover,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.320
which was for "BAM."

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.007
When that big, first
record came out,

00:14:06.007 --> 00:14:08.590
the "Tuesday Night Music Club",
her first single they released

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.740
was "Run, Baby, Run", if you
go back and listen to it.

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.800
And it did nothing at radios
before the next song, which

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.216
was "Leaving Las
Vegas", I believe

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:15.320
is the name of that song.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.110
And they didn't know
what to do with her,

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.630
but they decided to put
her on the cover of "BAM."

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.970
She came there, no hair,
no makeup, no stylist.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.810
Her and her manager-- who
is still her manager today--

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.180
he ignored me, we shot for
an hour, and that was it,

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.484
her first magazine cover.

00:14:27.484 --> 00:14:28.900
Same with Alanis
Morissette-- this

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.710
is right before
"Jagged Little Pill."

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.620
Actually, "Jagged, Little Pill"
had just come out this week,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.390
and it sold like 10 copies.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.594
This was before she exploded.

00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.010
And so it was a "BAM" magazine
cover and at the same time,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.470
we shot a cover for another
magazine called "Request."

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.800
So I got two magazine covers
out of that same shoot.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.310
Third Eye Blind-- I have
a long term relationship

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.540
with these crazy people.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.850
I've been shooting
them since day one.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.734
And that's sort of like
the wrap up of "BAM."

00:14:52.734 --> 00:14:55.150
I think there's another 10 or
20 magazine covers in there,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.550
but I didn't want
to bore you anymore.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.150
So back to the
Grateful Dead, which

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.389
of course is the
life-changing experience.

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:02.930
They're not the best
at what they do,

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.721
they're the only ones
that do what they do.

00:15:04.721 --> 00:15:07.030
And it's certainly true.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.410
I tapped into the
Grateful Dead early on.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.580
And I was a hippie on tour.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.660
You saw the pictures
early in the presentation,

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.440
and I lived the life.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.180
You know, we went on tour, we
smoked marijuana, we did LSD,

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.680
we saw a lot of Grateful Dead
concerts, we had a lot of fun.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.780
This one in here was my
girlfriend at the time.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.444
And just recently,
this photo ran

00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:29.610
in "Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.636
About a year ago, they
did a special issue

00:15:32.636 --> 00:15:33.510
on the Grateful Dead.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.070
And they wanted to run
this photo, which they did.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.100
And they called me
up, and they said,

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.100
we need some caption info.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.308
Do you have any caption info?

00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:41.027
And I was like, "yeah, you
know, the girl's name is Tammy.

00:15:41.027 --> 00:15:42.360
She's from Monterey, California.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.980
It was taken on
September 6-- I think

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.564
it was-- 1980 in
Lewiston, Maine.

00:15:47.564 --> 00:15:49.480
And her father was a
Colonel in the Air Force,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.900
and we kidnapped her and took
her on Grateful Dead tour.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.400
You know.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.840
A little bit more information
than they were expecting.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.320
More deadheads from that show.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.780
We lived in hotel rooms.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.610
And you know, this
to me was sort

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.350
of the beginning of what I
consider really what I do.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.907
Which is, I do
visual anthropology.

00:16:06.907 --> 00:16:08.490
You know, anthropology,
the definition

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:10.300
is the study of humankind.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.330
And this was a great
subject matter,

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.760
to have a bunch of freaks
to be able to photograph.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.440
This is my wife, over
here on the left.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.440
We were not married at
the time this photograph.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.981
I met her at a
Grateful Dead concert.

00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:21.830
Still married today.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.220
Ample opportunities to
photograph people having fun,

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.310
losing their minds at a
Grateful Dead concert.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.890
Like I said, just a great
anthropological study

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:33.630
of this culture.

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.930
And now, you know, this
picture was taken in 1986

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.430
at the Greek Theatre--
and I've been

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.180
posting a lot of this
stuff on Facebook.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.739
And the response--
like, I can post

00:16:40.739 --> 00:16:42.280
a picture of Jerry
Garcia on Facebook

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.989
and get a few thousand
views or whatever.

00:16:43.989 --> 00:16:45.696
I'll put something
like this on Facebook,

00:16:45.696 --> 00:16:47.560
and 10,000, 20,000
people will look at it

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.590
and be freaking out,
because this stuff is just

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:54.030
so classic now that
it's 25 years old.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.640
Good friend of mine, Jennifer.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.750
And people are always
saying, why don't you

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.350
have any pictures of
me when you were taking

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.520
pictures of deadheads back then?

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320
I'm like, because you all
thought I worked for the DEA,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.930
and you all ran away from me
when I took my camera out.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.869
And all the pictures are
people of my friends.

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:07.535
These are all people
I was on tour with,

00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:11.630
and I was hanging out with, and
eating dinner with, and living

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.984
in hotel rooms
with, and so those

00:17:14.984 --> 00:17:16.359
are the people in
my photographs.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.720
So this is my very
first interaction

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.510
with a Grateful
Dead band member.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.750
This is Bob Weir and Brent
Mydland from the Grateful

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.540
Dead-- guitar, singer and
keyboard player-- and this

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.420
was in May of 1979.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.560
I was 17 years old.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.700
And I convinced my
mother that I was

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.140
going to drive to Virginia,
six hours away from New Jersey,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.650
with some stranger to go
see the Grateful Dead.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.222
And she let me go.

00:17:42.222 --> 00:17:44.180
Go figure, I'm not letting
my daughter do that.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.850
She's 18.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.840
No way.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.550
And anyway, so the day
after the show in Virginia,

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:53.070
there was a big,
giant no nukes rally

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.060
on the front steps
of the capital.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.857
And Joni Mitchell played,
Jackson Browne played,

00:17:59.857 --> 00:18:00.940
bunch of different people.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.960
And I was walking around and I
found one of those little staff

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.970
badges on the ground.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:06.770
It said press.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.895
And I walked backstage,
and I was backstage.

00:18:08.895 --> 00:18:10.880
You know, I was 17 years old.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.650
And I ran into Bob
Weir and Brent Mydland,

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.865
who were playing in Baltimore,
I think, later that night.

00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:19.240
Except for the guy I was
driving down with from Virginia,

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.950
he was so drunk after
the show in Virginia,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.449
he actually totalled his car
pulling out of the parking lot,

00:18:23.449 --> 00:18:24.970
and we hitchhiked to Baltimore.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.976
So here I am, 17,
hitchhiking to Baltimore,

00:18:26.976 --> 00:18:28.600
and then hitchhiking
home to New Jersey

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.766
after the show in Baltimore.

00:18:29.766 --> 00:18:35.850
But that's just the way we
rolled, because we had to.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.140
More deadhead stuff.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.960
OK, so this was a "Rolling
Stone" magazine assignment.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.300
Slightly after that U2 one.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.800
Benefit concert
that Bill Graham put

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.633
on-- that's Bob Weir,
Bill Graham, and Jerry

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:47.751
Garcia-- at the Kaiser.

00:18:47.751 --> 00:18:50.000
And it was members of the
Grateful Dead, Bonnie Raitt,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.416
Carlos Santana,
and this was maybe

00:18:51.416 --> 00:18:54.110
my second or third-- I think it
was my second "Rolling Stone"

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.810
magazine assignment.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:57.880
Just some classic shots.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.419
This is probably my most
iconic shot of Jerry Garcia.

00:19:00.419 --> 00:19:02.960
And this was a photographed for
a magazine called "The Golden

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.950
Road," which was a Grateful Dead
fanzine that everybody loved.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.760
And I shot this up
at the Grateful Dead

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.500
office in San Rafael in 1991.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.920
And it was a little,
little, tiny office,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.050
I mean, literally, from
like here to that wall.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.390
And I had to sit on the desk.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.730
And I was, like, you
know, this close to Jerry.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.870
And the publicist was outside.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:24.362
And I started shooting, and
I shot for about 15 seconds.

00:19:24.362 --> 00:19:26.070
And he came in and
said, OK, you're done.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.915
And I'm like, no, and
I, literally, just-- I

00:19:28.915 --> 00:19:30.530
didn't shoot any
medium format, which

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.550
is a Hasselblad
square format, which

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.070
are those square photos
you saw from "BAM" covers.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.050
And I shot like a roll and
a half of black and white,

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.230
as fast as I could, and
about 10 frames in color.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:42.690
And then I was out, and he
went off and did the interview.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.110
You know, most of these guys--
Jerry Garcia, Carlos Santana,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.526
Neil Young, people that I've
been working with now for 15,

00:19:47.526 --> 00:19:50.832
20, 25 years-- they've
done hundreds, hundreds,

00:19:50.832 --> 00:19:51.936
hundreds of photo shoots.

00:19:51.936 --> 00:19:54.310
But every time I go to a photo
shoot with Neil or Carlos,

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.307
whoever, like I want
to be brilliant.

00:19:56.307 --> 00:19:58.890
I need to be-- because I'm only
as good as my last photograph.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:00.950
Who cares that I shot
Jerry Garcia in 1991.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.810
The photo editors I'm working
with today are art directors.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.520
They want to see
what I did yesterday.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.562
And so, I want to do the
best photograph I can.

00:20:07.562 --> 00:20:09.270
They just want to
leave and go eat lunch,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.353
or have a turkey sandwich.

00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:11.390
They don't really care.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.580
They've been there,
they've done that, they've

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.330
been doing it for
their whole career.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.490
This is a Jerry Garcia
puppet from a video

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.670
they were making down
in Monterrey in 1987,

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.930
in May of '87.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.270
And I'm in this video,
"Touch of Grey" video.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:30.310
If you go on YouTube, you can
see me dancing down front.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.870
Again, I'm the guy
with the mullet.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.880
And all my friends were like,
we're going to be in the video.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.830
And they ran and got
right in the center.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.070
And I'm like, I'm going
to be over to the left.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.810
It's a better angle
to photograph.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:43.020
And I'm the one in the
video, and none of them are.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.859
So, more Grateful Dead.

00:20:44.859 --> 00:20:47.400
Bob Weir and Rob Wasserman--
Bob Weir with the Grateful Dead.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.900
This is the first time I got
hired by a Grateful Dead member

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.910
to photograph them.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.660
Bob was starting a
side project, which

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.009
was an acoustic duo
with Rob Wasserman.

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:56.550
And they needed new
publicity photos.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.952
And so Bob's people
called me and hired me,

00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:01.410
and for a couple
years, I was doing

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.390
a whole bunch of
different stuff with Bob.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.450
He did a couple children's
books with his sister.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.190
And these are like
for the jackets.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:12.200
And you know, all the publicity
photos of Bob from about '90

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.510
to '93, '94 were all stuff
that I had shot of him.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.760
This is for an ad for
that guitar company.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.650
And another portrait
I did of Bob in 2003,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.920
I believe this was, when
they were doing a tour.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.510
This was a crazy day.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:29.540
I woke up the day
before this photo shoot,

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.850
and I fell down on the
ground like with vertigo.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:32.800
I was like all dizzy.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.760
And so that day, I had to
drive up to the Dead warehouse

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.620
to scout some locations.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.450
And I was like totally spun out.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.790
And I drove up to Marin, and
I'm in the bushes outside

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.081
be Grateful Dead office just
throwing up in the bushes.

00:21:45.081 --> 00:21:47.230
And I drive home
and I'm throwing up.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.834
And then the next
day, I came and I

00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:50.250
brought all these
extra assistants

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.730
in case I was going to
fall off the ladder.

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.440
And I did this whole big shoot
with the members of the Dead

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.420
for their 2000-- actually,
I think it was 2004-- tour.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.854
But one of those weird moments.

00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.270
This is one of the portraits
I did of Jerry the same day I

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.110
shot the Counting Crows cover.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.084
We call this one "The Smoker."

00:22:09.084 --> 00:22:10.500
This is one of the
most bootlegged

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.950
photos of the Grateful
Dead out there.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.616
This was on the set
of a video that they

00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:15.854
were filming for
"Throwing Stones," right

00:22:15.854 --> 00:22:18.020
across the street in Oakland
from where I was living

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.620
at the time, actually,
and I just sort of walked

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.940
onto the set and pretended
I needed to be there all day

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.940
with them.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.440
Way, way back, I actually took
that-- so somebody handed him

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.520
that Happy New Year
thing, somebody

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.004
wanted it for a
New Year's thing.

00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:31.670
But I took a piece of paper, and
some rubber cement, and a razor

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.160
blade, and covered
it, and then wrote,

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.940
"I need a miracle
ticket" in hand writing.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.690
This was pre-computers.

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.130
And that photo's been bootlegged
everywhere in the world.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.980
One of my other photo
sessions with Jerry, in 1992.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.959
This is from the same one
as the Counting Crows day.

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:51.000
And of course, because I
had all this great stuff

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.876
on the Grateful Dead, I had to
do a book on the Grateful Dead.

00:22:53.876 --> 00:22:55.500
This is my first book
that I published.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.540
And this was in 2002.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:03.800
I start working on the contract
for this in the summer of 2001.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.290
And we signed a contract
about a week before 9/11/2001.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:11.422
And of course, when 9/11 hit,
the phone stopped ringing,

00:23:11.422 --> 00:23:13.130
there was no more
business, and this book

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:15.030
saved my career, or
at least my business,

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.490
because they gave me an upfront
advance and upfront production

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:19.320
money.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.490
I had one employee
and he stayed on,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:26.840
and we produced this book,
which came out in 2002.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:31.030
But that gave me the bug
to really do another book.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.080
And so, now we're
back to Primus.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.220
Another thing that's
always been important to me

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.172
is being able to work with a
band for a long period of time.

00:23:41.172 --> 00:23:42.630
Because A, it shows
that they trust

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.010
you and they respect
what you're doing.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:49.640
But I think, again, from the
visual anthropology standpoint,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.695
it's a real great study.

00:23:50.695 --> 00:23:52.070
And so Primus is
a band that I've

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.690
been working with since
1990 on a regular basis.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.972
And I did a book on them.

00:23:57.972 --> 00:23:59.430
After I dead my
Grateful Dead book,

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.010
I had a bug, like I
wanted to do another book.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.640
And I proposed this to
Les Claypool in Primus,

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.560
and we co-published it together.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.060
Actually, I published it,
but we were partners on it.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.110
And this was a
limited edition book.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.030
You could only buy it on
the website-- their website

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.860
or my website--
it was $100 book.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.860
They were all signed and
numbered by me and Les.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.110
They come with an 8 by 10 print.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.943
We still have a couple
hundred of them left.

00:24:21.943 --> 00:24:23.460
But it was a very
successful book.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.450
And just goes to
show that, if you

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:29.280
work with one artist for--
that's another "BAM" cover,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.720
"Guitar Player" magazine cover.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.345
A lot of my stuff I
was doing with them

00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:33.610
was for magazine features.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.290
And then, of course,
they were hiring me also.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.340
Like, you know, here's someone
that's comfortable enough

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.947
to drop their drawers
at a photo shoot

00:24:38.947 --> 00:24:40.280
and put a leaf in front of them.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:49.260
Just, you know, Primus,
super, super creative people,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.862
great references
to pop culture--

00:24:51.862 --> 00:24:53.570
this is from a video
shoot that they did.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.620
Remember those, were they
Ever-ready commercials,

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.660
or Duracell
commercials, remember,

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.951
where they have these costumes?

00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:00.820
The same people built them these
costumes as those commercials.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.890
This was one of
Les's solo projects.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.860
This was a great idea that he's
like, I want to be in a frame.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.580
And I came up with this
idea to put a frame

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.080
on a piece of white seamless,
and we cut it out and hung it,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.321
and had him behind it.

00:25:14.321 --> 00:25:15.820
Another one of Les's
solo projects--

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.400
that's the Frog Brigade.

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.340
More Primus.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.880
And then the Primus book.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.360
The Flaming Lips, another band
that I've done a lot of work

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:24.910
with.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.880
This is my first shoot
with then, this is in 1989.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.014
They were managed by a woman
who lived here in San Francisco.

00:25:33.014 --> 00:25:34.180
And I'd never heard of them.

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:35.929
And she said she needed
a publicity shoot,

00:25:35.929 --> 00:25:39.420
a little, alternative punk
rock band from Oklahoma.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.100
And so we did a bunch
of shots of them.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.016
And then they came back
a couple months later,

00:25:43.016 --> 00:25:44.810
because they had a new
member of the band.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:48.670
And so, this was right
after the earthquake in '89

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.070
that we shot this
second set of shots.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.530
October of '89, I think
it was a week after that.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:59.320
And he's in the back, Michael,
the bass player in the back,

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.757
is reading "Interview
With a Vampire."

00:26:02.757 --> 00:26:05.090
And then I didn't see these
guys for four or five years.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:06.630
And then I got assigned
by "Rolling Stone"

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.050
magazine to cover Lollapalooza,
when Lollapalooza still a

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.330
touring festival.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.910
And for not the first year of
Lollapalooza, but the next five

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.310
or six years, I went to
the opening of Lollapalooza

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.810
no matter where it was in the
country for "Rolling Stone"

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.730
magazine.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.090
And have any of you
guys seen The Flaming

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:22.360
Lips in the last couple years?

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.390
Do you know what their
stage show is like?

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.780
So this is their first thing.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.130
And that scaffolding in the
back, with that guy on it,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.400
has a bubble machine on it.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.250
And that was their
first stage prop.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.870
If you don't know what their
stage shows look like now,

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.994
go online and check it out.

00:26:32.994 --> 00:26:34.444
It's completely out of control.

00:26:34.444 --> 00:26:35.860
But this was sort
of the beginning

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.590
of all of that madness.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.570
And this is the shot that
ran in "Rolling Stone."

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.020
Just one of those great shots.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.620
So you have Wayne, this
is from the soft bulletin,

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.120
I did the publicity
photos for that.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.536
This is sort of what their new
show looks like-- actually,

00:26:49.536 --> 00:26:51.930
their newest one's a little
bit different-- but you know,

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.317
they would bring up audience
members to dance on stage.

00:26:54.317 --> 00:26:56.150
So this is just some
random audience member.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.483
They would put them in costumes.

00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:59.760
They have people on either
side of the stage dancing.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.990
I brought my son and my daughter
to the Yahoo Christmas party

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.090
like, I don't know, 10 year ago,
and The Flaming Lips played.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.310
And they were dancing on
stage with animal masks

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:10.460
on their head.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.450
This is at Bimbo's
from Noise Pop a year

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.540
or two ago when they played.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.430
And of course, so
what did we do?

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.180
We did a book on
The Flaming Lips.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.931
Wayne, the singer's,
wife-- actually, not wife.

00:27:20.931 --> 00:27:21.930
They were never married.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.200
His girlfriend at the time
is also a photographer.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.611
And I was sort of mentoring her.

00:27:25.611 --> 00:27:26.860
And so she had a lot of stuff.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.900
I had a lot of stuff.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.790
And we did this book.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.373
Again, this is a
limited edition book.

00:27:30.373 --> 00:27:32.160
You can't really
find it anymore.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.470
It was only available on the
band's website, and Warner

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.995
Brothers website, and
I think Amazon had it.

00:27:37.995 --> 00:27:39.620
But if you go on
Amazon and look at it,

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:40.590
it's got some glowing reviews.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:42.673
And I've seen them floating
around for $500, $600,

00:27:42.673 --> 00:27:44.420
$700 now.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.827
Limited edition, signed
and numbered by the band.

00:27:46.827 --> 00:27:49.160
So now we just get into a
bunch of portraits that I did.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.720
This is The Indigo
Girls, right when

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.170
their very first
record came out.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.760
Early Soundgarden-- I don't know
if you guys know this story,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.910
but this guy over here,
Jason, he was in Nirvana.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.285
And left Nirvana because
he wanted to be a rock star

00:28:01.285 --> 00:28:03.451
and Soundgarden was bigger
than Nirvana at the time.

00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:04.820
And he joined Soundgarden.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.710
And then he left Soundgarden
because he was so depressed,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.372
probably, for leaving
Nirvana, I don't

00:28:11.372 --> 00:28:13.224
know, that he eventually
left the band.

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.640
But there was a
big article on him

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.257
recently in the New York Times.

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:17.590
I'll bet you can find it online.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.520
He, like, joined the
army and became, like,

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:23.220
a special-- like a
Army Seal or something,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.490
like super, super ranger dude.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.880
And kind of left
rock and roll behind.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.970
Jason Everman is his name.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.095
So this is one of my early
shoots with Soundgarden.

00:28:33.095 --> 00:28:35.990
And I did a whole bunch
of stuff with that.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.850
Stone Temple Pilots-- this
was for a magazine story.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.010
Radiohead, when their
first record came out,

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.035
do you remember their
first hit song, "Creep"?

00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:45.160
That's when this was taken.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.350
This was for "Us" magazine.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.850
We shot this in San Francisco
at the Phoenix hotel.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.870
You know, you can't even
talk to these guys anymore.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.750
There's too many
people protecting them.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:56.730
Then I shot them for
"Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.580
This is in the alleyway
right behind Slims.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.290
They were playing
Slims that night.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:01.390
After we did this
photo shoot, they all

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:03.830
came over to my studio, which at
the time was at 9th and Folsom,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.944
to look at a bunch of
photos I had taken of them.

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:08.360
Doing a free, live concert--
you probably don't know this,

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.651
but Radiohead did a free,
live concert in San Francisco

00:29:10.651 --> 00:29:13.630
at Justin Herman Plaza in 1995.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.340
More shots-- that's this
is taken with a four

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.450
by five camera with Polaroid
film that has a negative also.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.650
A '95 portrait.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.620
This was my next
shoot, I think in '96.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.560
This was done for
"Addicted to Noise,"

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.220
which was the first
online music magazine.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.240
Also at the Phoenix hotel.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.790
This is REM.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.700
This was shot down at
the Chateau Marmont

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.500
down in Los Angeles.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.880
And it was a magazine cover
for a German magazine.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.990
And I set this shot up
right here for the cover.

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:49.860
And Michael Stipe would not
put his bag down for me.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.050
And I had a 20-minute slot.

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.266
And I sat down and I
shot my cover shot.

00:29:54.266 --> 00:29:55.890
And you can see this
is a square format

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.764
image-- this is shot
with a Hasselblad, which

00:29:57.764 --> 00:30:00.260
is what we used to shoot most
of our magazine covers with--

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.030
and I shot for like
four or five minutes.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.030
Was getting ready to move
them to the next spot,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.810
and I turned to the publicist,
I go, "We're doing great.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:08.650
That was five minutes.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.510
We've got 15 to go."

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.400
And she looks at me, she goes,
"Honey, that was 15 minutes.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.150
You have five minutes to go."

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.210
And I was like, woah.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.860
So I just like
went into high gear

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.577
and did a quick available
light shot facing

00:30:19.577 --> 00:30:20.410
the other direction.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.296
Then moved them to a window for
the last shot, and I was done.

00:30:23.296 --> 00:30:25.920
Another shot of the Indigo Girls
for a cover of "Acoustic Star"

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.630
magazine, also shot in
the alleyway behind Slims.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.790
I shot in every,
single back alley

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.640
in San Francisco,
and every warehouse.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.556
And you know, if you
guys know the city at all

00:30:34.556 --> 00:30:36.760
or live in the city, the
Dogpatch neighborhood

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.980
was like my photo studio.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.460
There were so many great,
dilapidated warehouses.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.410
And I'd go do a photo
shoot, come back,

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.850
and the warehouse would be gone.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:45.107
So my whole stomping grounds.

00:30:45.107 --> 00:30:47.190
I don't know where all the
young photographers are

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.132
going to shoot all
the cool bands now,

00:30:49.132 --> 00:30:50.590
because there ain't
no places left.

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.220
You've got to go to Oakland.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.070
Soundgarden at Lollapalooza '92.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.790
Same thing, this was shot
for "Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:03.785
Booker T and the MGs-- did
Duck Dunn just die, did I hear?

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:05.510
You know, the bass player?

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.410
Blues Traveler-- this was
shot for their record, "Four."

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.870
I did the CD packaging for that.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.320
It's on A&amp;M. That was their
big, hit record, which

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.570
I think they're doing a
25-year anniversary of it,

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:17.310
coming up next year.

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:20.750
The worst CD package ever in
the history of CD packages.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.320
Just terrible,
terrible, terrible

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.880
because the singer got a big
fight with the record company

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.150
about how big the
lyrics should be.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.566
And they just kind
of screwed them

00:31:27.566 --> 00:31:29.524
and just did a really bad job.

00:31:29.524 --> 00:31:31.815
I don't know if guys remember
The Squirrel Nut Zippers.

00:31:31.815 --> 00:31:33.284
I shot two albums for them.

00:31:33.284 --> 00:31:34.450
They're from North Carolina.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.033
Actually, I was
nominated for a Grammy

00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:38.450
for one of these
for CD packaging.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.510
The band Phish, shut down
at Shoreline right down

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.820
the street here.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.040
The Donnas-- they were a
Palo Alto band and they

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.330
started out as young
teenagers in high school.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.580
And we went to this abandoned
high school in Palo Alto

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.330
and shot them in the bathroom.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.580
Because that's where bad
girls in Palo Alto hang out,

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.220
in the bathroom.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.870
The Talking Heads-- so I'm a
huge Talking Heads fan, always

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:58.580
have been.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.737
In 1992, I went and
saw The Talking Heads

00:32:01.737 --> 00:32:03.320
on the "Stop Making
Sense" tour, which

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.700
was the movie that
Jonathan Demme-- right?

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.590
That's who directed
that, right?-- did.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.239
And this was taken for the
15th anniversary of that movie.

00:32:12.239 --> 00:32:13.780
They were doing a
thing at the Castro

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:14.939
Theater in San Francisco.

00:32:14.939 --> 00:32:17.480
But when I went and saw them in
'92, I didn't have any money.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.630
I was in college and
tickets were like $12.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.190
And so we made
counterfeit tickets.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.480
But back then, the way
we did it is we took--

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.889
we Xeroxed them in
black and white--

00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:30.430
they were theatre tickets, not
like Ticketron or Ticketmaster

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.890
or whatever it is, they
were like theater tickets--

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:35.010
we photocopied them
in black and white.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.770
Then we watercolored them
with watercolor paints.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.820
And then we glued a
bunch of pieces of paper

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.290
together until they were
about the right thickness.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.820
And then perforated
them with a pen.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.420
And it worked.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.290
We all got into the show,
like four or five of us,

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:45.789
we snuck in.

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:48.690
And so, when I did this
shoot with these guys,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:49.874
David Byrne got there first.

00:32:49.874 --> 00:32:52.165
And these guys don't like
each other, or at least Chris

00:32:52.165 --> 00:32:54.010
and Tina, who are
husband and wife,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.680
never really got
along with David.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.930
They all got there separately.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:57.850
So David got there
and I told him

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:59.766
the story about making
the counterfeit ticket.

00:32:59.766 --> 00:33:01.840
And I go, so, I guess
I owe you 10 bucks.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.430
And I whip out $10
to give it to him.

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:04.854
He's like, no, that's OK, dude.

00:33:04.854 --> 00:33:06.520
You don't have to pay
me for the ticket.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:12.860
This is the only band photo that
has been taken of The Talking

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.610
Heads since they broke up
back in the early '90s.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:19.450
It was all taken at the
Miako Hotel up in the city.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.340
This is from a
photo shoot that I

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.545
did with a bad called Lag
Wagon-- punk rock band out

00:33:23.545 --> 00:33:25.940
of San Francisco, great
band-- and these were all

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:26.590
band members.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.970
And we dressed everybody up
like they were from the '50s.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:34.370
You know, the teacher, you know,
warning signs of communists,

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.960
long hair on men,
short hair on women.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.120
The gas station attendant,
of course the milkman,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.750
and Joey again.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:47.299
And the whole band.

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:48.840
This picture has
great meaning to me.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.423
This is the Doobie Brothers, and
I did their publicity photos.

00:33:51.423 --> 00:33:54.990
This is in my old
studio south of Market.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:58.050
And the Doobie Brothers was
my very, very first concert,

00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.640
when I was in ninth
grade in 1975.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.960
Halloween night, 1975,
Madison Square Garden,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.418
I went and saw The
Doobie Brothers.

00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:07.300
So when I had them in my
studio, I was like, hey,

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.770
you guys were my first concert.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.550
I had good taste in music back
then, and still hopefully do.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.120
But just one of those moments
that you're with somebody

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.620
that you've been along
that ride with for so long.

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.470
Third Eye Blind-- this
is actually a still

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:21.719
from a video we were shooting.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:25.400
I did a whole video--
you can find it online,

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.636
on YouTube-- of all
still photographs

00:34:27.636 --> 00:34:28.719
with this kind of setting.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.010
And it's all animated together.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.060
There's like 6,000
still photographs.

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.500
The band Mo.

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.110
Smashmouth, who can't
get arrested these days,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.719
but I shot all
their early albums.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:46.120
And this is a publicity shoot
we just did a few years ago.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.070
Turtle Island String Quartet--
this was done for them.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.856
This is Furthur, the guys from
the Grateful Dead-- Phil Lesh

00:34:51.856 --> 00:34:53.960
and Bob Weir-- you
know, here I was

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.679
16, 17-year-old
deadhead in New Jersey.

00:34:56.679 --> 00:35:01.875
And 30 years later, I'm doing
their band publicity photos.

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:04.000
That's the drummer from
the Grateful Dead in a band

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.860
that he had called The
Seven Walkers, Blame Sally,

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.150
a band called ALO--
shot a couple albums

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.280
for them, Bay Area band.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.034
Them again.

00:35:12.034 --> 00:35:13.450
Yonder Mountain
String Band-- this

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:16.590
was shot up in the
Marin Headlands.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:20.520
Trigger Happy with Joan Osborne,
shot in Golden Gate Park.

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.932
Mumford and Sons-- this
was shot down in Monterey,

00:35:22.932 --> 00:35:24.390
two years ago, I
guess it was, when

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.030
they played that
festival down there.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.290
And this is was for the cover
of "Acoustic Guitar" magazine.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.370
And what was so
great about that is,

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.840
that night they were doing like
some sort of John Steinbeck

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.362
thing at some
theater in Monterey,

00:35:38.362 --> 00:35:40.070
and they were playing
a Bruce Springsteen

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.930
song, "The Ghost of Tom Joad."

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:44.710
And they basically,
during my photo shoot,

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.252
they rehearsed it
for like 15 minutes

00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:47.543
while I was just shooting them.

00:35:47.543 --> 00:35:49.000
They just went over and over it.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.230
You can't see it but my
iPhone is like right here.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:52.835
I Photoshopped it out.

00:35:52.835 --> 00:35:54.460
And they're like
reading the lyrics off

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.780
of my phone that was in that
shot while they were doing it.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.050
And I was like, that's
great, because I wanted

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.750
pictures of them playing anyway.

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.840
Band call Materialized.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.725
This is a cemetery up in
Oakland that I love to shoot in.

00:36:04.725 --> 00:36:07.100
Just such a great, old cemetery
and I shot a lot of bands

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.050
there.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.050
I asked permission once.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.591
I was shooting the
band, Cake, there.

00:36:11.591 --> 00:36:13.770
And we went and talked
to the cemetery director.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.860
And he was like the
creepiest guy ever.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.290
Like, I swear to God, like
when we left, we were saying,

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.540
he's got women locked up in
some of these tomb-like things.

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:24.045
It was that creepy.

00:36:24.045 --> 00:36:26.170
Tim and Nicki Bluhm, Nicki
Bluhm and the Gramblers,

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.767
and The Motherhips.

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:29.850
Good friends of mine I've
done a lot of work with.

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.599
I just did this with
them not too long ago

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:33.770
for Yamaha guitars.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.486
This is like a Yamaha
guitar marketing piece.

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.860
Huey Lewis and
the News, you guys

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:42.210
know the 1982 record,
"Sports" 30 years ago?

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.830
This is a reproduction that
we did of this last year.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:47.380
So we went back to the
same bar in Mill Valley.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.421
And I actually should have
put the original cover

00:36:49.421 --> 00:36:51.296
in so you could see it.

00:36:51.296 --> 00:36:52.670
So we recreated
that album cover.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.110
Go up and look at
it online, you can

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:55.568
see the comparison
between the two.

00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:56.870
But fun shoot.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.830
Tea Leaf Green, shot in
Alameda for their new record.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.520
The Deadly Gentleman,
a Bluegrass band.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.930
The Shipp Twins from Portland.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.270
This is something I just shot.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.840
So this is real
contemporary work.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.130
I think that, as a
photographer, it's

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.164
so important to stay relevant.

00:37:13.164 --> 00:37:14.830
I've been doing this
a really long time.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.557
And I know a lot
of photographers

00:37:16.557 --> 00:37:18.890
that are my age that have
been doing it for a long time,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:19.931
they don't shoot anymore.

00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:21.910
And I think that,
for me, it's always

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:24.517
been important to remain
relevant and not be a relic.

00:37:24.517 --> 00:37:25.850
And to be able to keep shooting.

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.726
And I feel like work like
this-- I love this photograph.

00:37:29.726 --> 00:37:31.850
Personally, I just think
it's a stunning photograph

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:35.000
of two stunning women
that are twin sisters.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.820
But I'm still trying to
continue to reinvent myself

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.380
as a photographer in
the digital world.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.510
Because I went from very
analog to very digital.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.510
Neil Young, another one
of my favorite subjects.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.860
This was shot for the cover
of "Pulse" magazine, which

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.410
was "Tower Pulse" when
Tower Records was around.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:54.420
And this was shot
a couple of days

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.980
after Bill Graham died
in the helicopter crash.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.520
And a couple days before they
did the big memorial show

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.670
for him in the park.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.800
And I have a lot
of Neil in here.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:05.344
Neil is a very, very,
very, very intense person.

00:38:05.344 --> 00:38:06.843
If you've ever been
around Neil, you

00:38:06.843 --> 00:38:13.150
know that he is the
epitome of mad genius.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:16.110
And I was told that
I was going to have

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:18.680
10 minutes to photograph
him for this cover.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.670
And he was telling me
my 10 minutes was up.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:22.620
And so, it was pretty funny.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.402
So we shot him in
the train room.

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:26.110
You know, he lives
down here in Woodside.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:27.651
And he has this room
that-- you know,

00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:29.824
he was part owner of
Lionel trains for a while.

00:38:29.824 --> 00:38:30.990
I don't know if he still is.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.860
And he had a train room.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.610
And it was just this
giant room-- probably

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.050
twice the size of this room--
with this giant train track

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.710
and these ceilings
that were painted

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:38.947
with clouds and mountains.

00:38:38.947 --> 00:38:40.530
And it was just this
incredible thing.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.240
And we found this little corner
that hadn't been painted yet,

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.840
and we shot him
there for the cover.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.400
And then I convinced
them to go outside and do

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.840
one other shot with me outside.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.140
This was from the same shoot.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.845
And then we were done.

00:38:49.845 --> 00:38:51.220
This is from
another shoot that I

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.634
did for another magazine,
"Musician" magazine.

00:38:53.634 --> 00:38:55.550
Do you guys know what
the Mountain Home is, up

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.470
on Skyline Boulevard?

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.594
It's a restaurant up there.

00:38:57.594 --> 00:39:00.320
So he was doing a bunch of
press for all sorts of stuff.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.550
And I was told to be
there at a certain time.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.907
I'm tooling down Skyline
Boulevard at 50 miles an hour.

00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:06.990
And all of the sudden, the
Mountain Home comes up,

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:09.452
and I hit the brakes, and
pull into the parking lot,

00:39:09.452 --> 00:39:10.285
and it's all gravel.

00:39:10.285 --> 00:39:11.900
And I'm screeching and skidding.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.390
And he's doing a video interview
with Kurt Loder from MTV.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.640
And the producer guy comes
running over and he's like,

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.144
"shh."

00:39:18.144 --> 00:39:19.935
And you know, I'm like,
OK, dude, whatever.

00:39:19.935 --> 00:39:21.250
You know, I'm here, I stopped.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.050
And so, they finish
their interview.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:26.020
And again, I'm told I have 10
minutes to photograph Neil.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.337
So I sit him down.

00:39:27.337 --> 00:39:28.670
And this is still shooting film.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.920
And I shoot a picture
with a Polaroid back,

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.160
which tests your lighting.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.410
And it takes 90 seconds
to develop, right?

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.950
So I pull the
Polaroid, Kurt Loder

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:38.920
comes back and start
talking to Neil,

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.732
10 minutes goes by
I'm like waiting.

00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:42.940
The publicist comes back
and goes, "OK, you're done."

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.940
I'm like, "I only
shot a Polaroid.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.440
That's it.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.155
I'm not done."

00:39:45.155 --> 00:39:47.530
And he looks at Kurt and he
goes, "Kurt, get out of here.

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:48.460
Neil, sit down."

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.240
And I shot for my 10 minutes.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.410
And I did three set ups.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:52.710
This was the last one.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.540
This is shot with a
high-contrast, high-grain,

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:59.620
black-and-white Polaroid
film called Polagraph.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.132
And it has 12
frames on the role.

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:03.465
And it's so sensitive to light
that you have to bracket.

00:40:03.465 --> 00:40:05.500
And you usually only
get three frames

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.217
that are correctly
exposed out of the roll.

00:40:08.217 --> 00:40:10.300
That's one of the portraits
from that shoot, where

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.590
he was sitting down.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.469
This is a shoot I did
for "Esquire" magazine.

00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:15.260
This is backstage at
Shoreline Amphitheatre

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.682
during one of the
Bridge School benefits.

00:40:17.682 --> 00:40:19.640
Another one of those
things where I, literally,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.390
had five minutes.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:21.960
And that's the
guitar case that was

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.020
given to him by Hank
Williams's granddaughter.

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.760
And he has Hank
Williams's guitar.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.200
And his guitar tech
told me where the guitar

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.874
was in this trunk
in this big truck.

00:40:31.874 --> 00:40:34.165
And I had my son with me at
the time, who was probably,

00:40:34.165 --> 00:40:36.650
I don't know, 11 or 12.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.970
And so I told Sam, my
son, "Go get that guitar

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:40.170
case that I showed you."

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:42.800
He comes walking out with
Neil's Hank Williams guitar.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.610
And Neil looks and him and
he goes, "I'll take that."

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.400
Pretty classic moment.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.910
But I love working with Neil.

00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:52.470
And you know, one of these
days I'll do a book on him.

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:56.080
But I think I have to wait until
a little bit further along.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.890
This is my most recent
portrait that I did of Neil.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.575
I was asked to do a
visa photo for him,

00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:03.070
because he was traveling to
Brazil a couple years ago.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.520
Because Neil can't just
walk into Walgreen's

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.850
and do a visa photo.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:08.569
And so I did it for
him, his manager,

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:10.360
and two crew guys that
were going with him.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.070
And so, we set up backstage at
Shoreline in the Bridge School.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.520
And you're not allowed to
wear a hat for a visa photo.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.404
And he didn't shave.

00:41:16.404 --> 00:41:17.820
And you're supposed
to be straight

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.490
onto the camera and
all these things.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.585
He sat for me for about,
literally, maybe 60 seconds.

00:41:22.585 --> 00:41:23.710
And he's like, "You got it?

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.020
You got it?"

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:24.700
And I'm like, "One more."

00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:25.190
He goes, "OK."

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.840
And he grabs this
hat and looks at me.

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.880
And I take one shot, and
he gets up and walks away.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.360
And that was the.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:29.922
Shot.

00:41:29.922 --> 00:41:32.380
So that's the only one without--
that's not the visa photo,

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.230
but I just love that picture.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:40.500
Ken Kesey-- so this is a
section on photographs of people

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.800
that I've shot that
are not musicians.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.210
Ken Kesey wrote "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest"

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.840
and "Sometimes a Great Notion"

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.560
Merry Pranksters, Acid Tests
with the Grateful Dead,

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.210
et cetera.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:53.950
Anybody know who Anton LaVey is?

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.550
The Church of
Satan, you guys ever

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.310
hear of The Church of Satan?

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.360
Look it up on Wikipedia.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:02.710
And this was shot in his
basement in San Francisco.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.050
Very interesting.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:06.790
This room here was called
the den of iniquity.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.490
And the church of Satan was
basically all about sex.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.110
As you can see, the mannequin
Cub Scout with the erection.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.270
And the drunk woman passed out.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:18.380
And it's a whole thing.

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.589
Anton LaVey with his pentagram.

00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:22.130
This was a fashion
shoot, by the way,

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.470
that we did with him for
"The Nose" magazine which

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.210
is sort of like "The
Onion" in print.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.710
Allen Ginsberg, the beat poet.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.847
Lemony Snicket--
Daniel Handler-- this

00:42:33.847 --> 00:42:36.430
was shot at the Palace of Legion
of Honor up in San Fransisco.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.630
It's a four by five Polaroid.

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.790
Shaquille O'Neill--
did this in LA.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.020
He was making one of those
bad movies that he made.

00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.874
And he had a giant penthouse
with no furniture in it.

00:42:45.874 --> 00:42:47.290
Like, he didn't
really live there.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:49.164
He was just staying
there during the filming.

00:42:49.164 --> 00:42:50.770
And he had this
big Superman ring.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:53.231
It doesn't look that big, but
when I put it on my fingers,

00:42:53.231 --> 00:42:54.855
I think it covered
three of my fingers.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.540
Latrell Spreewell-- remember
when he was on the Golden State

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.426
Warriors and he
choked the coach?

00:43:01.426 --> 00:43:03.550
I shot this for "The Source"
magazine at that time.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.370
Bill Clinton-- he
was still president.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.690
This was at the Presidio
in San Francisco.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:13.330
And they were
turning the Presidio

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.160
over to the city
of San Francisco.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.680
And there was
governors and senators

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.230
and-- I was shooting for
the GGNRA-- which is not

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.630
the National Rifle Association,
which is the Golden Gate

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:28.410
National Recreation Area-- and
I needed to be on the beach

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.877
when he was walking on the
beach with the GGNRA director.

00:43:30.877 --> 00:43:32.710
And they only let one
photographer up there.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.126
It was a pool photographer
from Time Magazine or whatever.

00:43:35.126 --> 00:43:37.130
And I'm like talking to
my ranger contact, who's

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.340
talking to the Secret Service.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.450
And they finally
let me on the beach,

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.033
and I make it like
four steps, and I'm

00:43:41.033 --> 00:43:42.990
in a headlock by
the Secret Service.

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:45.190
OK.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:50.127
And so anyway, I got the
shot and survived that one.

00:43:50.127 --> 00:43:51.960
I'm going to go fast,
because I think I only

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.880
have about 10 minutes,
and then we're

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.463
going to go into
question and answers.

00:43:54.463 --> 00:43:56.030
Is that correct?

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.839
OK, oh, wow, times is flying.

00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:59.380
These are a bunch
of ads that we shot

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.666
for different publications,
or different ad companies.

00:44:03.666 --> 00:44:04.290
This was great.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:07.290
We got to rent an elephant.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.430
Steve Ballmer-- you guys know
who Steve Ballmer is, right?

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.020
OK.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.740
I was doing a lot
of stuff, but then I

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.181
was asked to
photograph, in 1995,

00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:15.430
a little company called Yahoo.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.730
They had just incorporated
a few months before that.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:21.920
And this is Filo and Yang in
their office at Yahoo in 1995.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.249
They had 20 employees.

00:44:23.249 --> 00:44:25.040
This was shot for
"Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.530
That is their
entire data center.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:28.690
OK?

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:32.920
So then a couple of years
later, in October of '99,

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.729
I was hired by
"Fortune" magazine

00:44:34.729 --> 00:44:36.520
to shoot a brand new
company called Google.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.570
There were 80 employees here.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.170
We shot Sergey and Larry.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.790
And then we shot them in
front of the company car.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:47.290
OK, there were no jets,
but we did shoot them

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:49.210
in front of-- that
was the Google car.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.710
And that was in '99.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:55.150
This is Carlos Santana, the
back cover of Supernatural.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:57.880
And again, Carlos is someone
I've done a lot of work

00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.820
with over the years.

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.510
And one of these days, I'll
do a big book on Carlos,

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:04.860
but not quite yet.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.630
This was just taken at Jazz
Fest just a few weeks ago,

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.370
or two weeks ago.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.120
John Fogerty for
"Rolling Stone" magazine.

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.710
He was on trial for a
plagiarizing his own music.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:17.000
Shot for "Rolling
Stone" magazine.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.580
This is a band called Minus
5, which is the guys from REM.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:23.570
And the art director said, bring
your axes, bring your guitar,

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:24.320
bring your axes.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.426
So they brought their axes.

00:45:27.426 --> 00:45:30.050
BB King-- this was shot for the
cover of "Fret Board" magazine.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.133
BB wanted me to shoot him
in this little back area

00:45:32.133 --> 00:45:33.620
of his bus, and I
was like, no way.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.040
So I convinced
him-- when he came

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.665
offstage, I had a room-- it was
in Paramount Theater in Oakland

00:45:37.665 --> 00:45:40.780
and I dragged him into
this room very quickly.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:43.819
I'm going to try and-- Brian
Wilson, from the Beach Boys.

00:45:43.819 --> 00:45:45.360
It's a great story,
but I'm not going

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.100
to tell it because
we don't have time.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.260
David Byrne-- another one.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.884
He came to my studio
for a photo shoot.

00:45:49.884 --> 00:45:51.575
This was also for
"Addicted to Noise."

00:45:51.575 --> 00:45:53.700
And he rode up on his
bicycle with his bike helmet.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.620
And he rang the doorbell
and my assistant at the time

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.024
thought he was a bike messenger
and handed him a package.

00:45:59.024 --> 00:46:00.190
He said, "No, no, I'm David.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.340
I'm here for a photo shoot."

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.780
But, you know.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.560
Dr Dre-- this is right after
he left Death Row Records

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.000
and there was a hit put
out on him by Suge Night.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.879
And he had 20 guys surrounding
him everywhere he went.

00:46:12.879 --> 00:46:15.170
And he didn't like the wardrobe
that we had picked out.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:18.140
So he disappeared with his
entourage for three hours

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.090
to go up to Melrose.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.620
This is after, actually, me
flying to LA the night before

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.190
and him cancelling the shoot
because he was too tired from

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.240
a all night session.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.510
He came the next day.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.540
They went shopping on
Melrose for four hours

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.210
and got a black t-shirt,
which we had nine of.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:34.150
And so we shot him.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:37.400
This is when some art director
at "The Source" magazine

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.360
decided that the nice,
white, Jewish kid should

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.400
be the next cool
hip-hop photographer

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.149
and shoot cover
for "The Source."

00:46:43.149 --> 00:46:44.690
Perry Farrell from
Jane's Addiction--

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.030
this is from a "BAM" magazine
cover with his then wife.

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:51.320
They were editing a concert
film in their hotel room.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.294
More Jane's Addiction.

00:46:52.294 --> 00:46:53.960
This is Me First and
the Gimmee Gimmees,

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.714
which is a San Francisco
punk rock super group that I

00:46:56.714 --> 00:46:59.790
shot a bunch of
album covers for.

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.360
That's their most
recent album cover

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:06.256
that just came out in the last
couple weeks called "Divas."

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.130
Michael Hedges, which
is another great story.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:09.140
If you know who
Michael Hedges is,

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.639
he's an incredible
guitar player who

00:47:10.639 --> 00:47:12.100
is known for his
incredible guitar

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.230
playing and his
long, flowing hair.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:16.530
I did two photo shoots
with him, six years apart.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.300
And both shoots, he
shaved his head three days

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.460
before the shoot.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.620
And he died in a horrible
motorcycle accident

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.010
riding home to Monterey.

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.710
Alkaline Trio, shot
in that same cemetery.

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.300
And of course, we
came by a grave

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.716
that they were just digging,
so I jumped down in the grave

00:47:33.716 --> 00:47:35.160
to photograph them.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.750
Roger McGuinn, from The Byrds.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:40.090
I shot this in high
school, April 14, 1979.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:44.830
And just by chance,
April 14, 2004,

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:46.960
he was in my studio shooting
for a magazine cover.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.450
So 25 years to the day.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.810
I was anal.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.380
Back when I was a
kid, I kept track

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.030
of the exact date of
everything I shot.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.031
Which is so important.

00:47:55.031 --> 00:47:57.030
I know so many photographers
that don't do that.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.571
Aaron Neville from the Neville
Brothers, down in New Orleans.

00:47:59.571 --> 00:48:03.650
We shot a bunch of album covers
for him for his gospel records.

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:07.170
The Barenaked Ladies--
became good friends of mine.

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.690
This is the shoot that we did
for their record, "Stunt."

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.050
and this is Kevin, the
keyboard player, who

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.080
had been feeling sick with
the flu for about two weeks

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.450
leading up to this photo shoot.

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:18.740
When he was getting
off the plane,

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.157
something fell out of the
overhead, hit him in the head

00:48:20.157 --> 00:48:21.740
and he was gushing with blood.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.250
And you know how with head
wounds, you bleed a lot anyway.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.570
We did the photo shoot,
he was really exhausted,

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:28.100
really wasn't feeling well.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.660
He flew back to
Toronto the next day

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.159
and they diagnosed
him with Leukemia

00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:33.580
and said he had
six months to live.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.120
This was in 1999.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.400
He's still alive today,
which is pretty remarkable.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:42.100
That's the shot that's
on the album, on the CD.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:45.350
Tom Waits-- all right, we have
time for one good Tom Waits

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:45.850
story.

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.391
This isn't the first
time that I shot

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:49.870
Waits, which was
in August of '92,

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.389
for "The Bone Machine" record.

00:48:51.389 --> 00:48:52.930
And I'm not going
to tell this story.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.305
I'm going to tell
the next story.

00:48:54.305 --> 00:48:57.140
So the next time I was asked
to photograph Tom Waits

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.270
was in 1999.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:02.716
And we went back up
to the same place.

00:49:02.716 --> 00:49:04.590
This is a recording
studio called Prairie Sun

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.850
up in Cotati, where he
records his records.

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:07.979
And it's a chicken farmer.

00:49:07.979 --> 00:49:09.770
There's chickens running
around everywhere.

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:12.020
And there's old, abandoned
motorcycles and claw tub

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:12.720
bathtubs.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.420
And I would walk
around, and I said,

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.610
you know, I said-- there was
old, wrought iron furniture.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.750
And I sat Tom down, and I said,
"Let's shoot the cover here

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:21.310
on this."

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.860
He goes, "Jay, this furniture
looks like it could be

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:27.790
my grandmother's."

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.812
So I brought him over
to the motorcycle

00:49:29.812 --> 00:49:31.395
and he wouldn't let
me-- I brought him

00:49:31.395 --> 00:49:33.442
to the claw foot bathtub.

00:49:33.442 --> 00:49:34.900
He wouldn't let me
shoot him there.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.580
Go to the motorcycle,
I'm freaking out

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.430
because I only have like
30 minutes to do the shoot.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.970
He's like, "No, I
don't like this."

00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:41.600
And then I bring him
to this spot here.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.240
And I say, "Let me do a
shot of you sitting there."

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.114
And he's like, "No,
let's do it standing up."

00:49:45.114 --> 00:49:47.630
I go, "Let's do a Polaroid--
standing up or sitting down."

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:49.129
I show him the
Polaroid standing up.

00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:50.800
He goes, "Jay, you're right.

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.010
Looks better sitting down,
but just watch my chin."

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.110
So then, finally, he
goes, "I got an idea.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.505
Let's jump in my car and go
just two miles down the road,

00:49:59.505 --> 00:50:01.630
because there's this old,
abandoned car that I saw.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.270
And we'll take some
photographs there."

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.282
So we jump in his car.

00:50:04.282 --> 00:50:05.240
And he's looking at me.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.573
He goes, "Do you remember the
old Woody Woodpecker thing

00:50:07.573 --> 00:50:08.760
from the '60s?"

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.995
He was like, you know, making
that face at me, right?

00:50:10.995 --> 00:50:11.620
I'm like, yeah.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:13.530
So it was just me
and him in the car.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.850
And he's like, "It's just
three minutes down the road."

00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:18.040
Well, we went from
Cotati to Petaluma,

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.020
which took 30
minutes to get there.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:22.070
So we're driving down
all these back roads.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:24.681
And he's like, "Jay, I think
we're going to run out of gas."

00:50:24.681 --> 00:50:25.180
Right?

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.710
And I'm thinking, "OK,
well that's great.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:28.700
Let's stop and get gas.

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.384
I'll take pictures
of you pumping gas."

00:50:30.384 --> 00:50:32.300
"There ain't no gas
stations between here and.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.610
Petaluma."

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:34.930
So we get down there.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.580
And he gets out of
the car, his truck,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.750
and he goes, "I don't
know whose house this is

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:39.780
and I don't know
whose car that is,

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:40.870
but you'd better go
and to ask and see

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.446
if we can take pictures there."

00:50:42.446 --> 00:50:43.820
So I go up and
ring the doorbell.

00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:45.897
Nobody answers, nobody answers.

00:50:45.897 --> 00:50:47.480
Finally, we're walking
up the driveway

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.771
and this little lady comes out.

00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:51.410
And I say, "Hey, can I
take some photographs

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.850
in the car in the back?"

00:50:52.850 --> 00:50:54.720
And she goes, "Car?

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.189
It's got no wheels."

00:50:56.189 --> 00:50:57.480
I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no."

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.270
And I've got, like, three
cameras around my neck.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:00.470
Because when we left
the chicken ranch,

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:01.470
I didn't bring any equipment.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:02.386
No lighting equipment.

00:51:02.386 --> 00:51:03.430
Just all my cameras.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.000
I looked like Dennis Hopper
in "Apocalypse Now," right?

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000
And so, I have all these
cameras around my neck.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.250
And I go, "No, no, no.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:10.541
We don't want to drive the car.

00:51:10.541 --> 00:51:13.070
We want to take a photograph
of my friend, Tommy, here."

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:18.100
She goes, "Car hasn't driven
since my husband died in '62."

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:18.840
You know?

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:21.090
And like, I mean, is
this like Tom Waits's,

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:22.010
like, everyday life?

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.134
And she's got like a scarf
wrapped around her head.

00:51:24.134 --> 00:51:26.082
And this long trench
coat, you know?

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.749
So finally, I go,
"Can I give you $25?"

00:51:28.749 --> 00:51:30.040
I write it on a piece of paper.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.762
I will give you
$25 to use the car.

00:51:32.762 --> 00:51:33.470
And I showed her.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.230
She's like, "I don't
want your money."

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:35.730
Right?

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.691
So we go over, we
hop over the fence,

00:51:37.691 --> 00:51:38.940
and we shoot all these photos.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.682
And Tom's pretending that
he's a used car salesman.

00:51:41.682 --> 00:51:43.890
And then he says, "Take a
picture of me by the grill,

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:45.849
because it looks like my face."

00:51:45.849 --> 00:51:48.140
So we're shooting all these
pictures of him down there.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.973
And this whole thing--
you know, here he is,

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:51.850
"You want to buy a car?"

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.610
You know, doing all the
stuff with Tom, right?

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:56.574
And then he goes,
"OK, I got to go."

00:51:56.574 --> 00:51:57.490
I'm like, "No, no, no.

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:57.570
Wait.

00:51:57.570 --> 00:51:58.240
One more roll."

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.410
And I break out my
toy, plastic camera

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.700
that's in the Google colors.

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.320
You ever seen like a little--
what are those things called?

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:05.870
What's that?

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:07.340
No, not a LEGO.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.440
I'll think about it.

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.382
It's a low-mo type camera.

00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:11.840
Anyways, it's
literally, it's green

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.240
and yellow and red and blue.

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.820
And it's plastic and it takes--
and it has a lens that spins.

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.760
And you get four
frames at once, right?

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.600
And it's plastic.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.600
And it's out of focus.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.956
And so I'm like shooting
Tom with the plastic camera.

00:52:21.956 --> 00:52:22.830
And he's hanging out.

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.330
And then he goes,
"OK, I got to go."

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.372
And he jumps over there
the barbed wire cow fence

00:52:26.372 --> 00:52:27.913
and starts running
down the driveway.

00:52:27.913 --> 00:52:30.180
And I'm chasing after him
with a 1960s Polaroid.

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.674
You know, shooting and
running, and pulling Polaroids,

00:52:32.674 --> 00:52:34.090
and dropping them
on the driveway.

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:35.540
And he gets to the car and
he looks at me and goes,

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:36.479
"OK, see you later."

00:52:36.479 --> 00:52:37.270
And he drives away.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:40.130
And we were being followed by my
assistant in the publicist car,

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:41.590
so there was another car there.

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.450
And he just drives away.

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:44.159
And I'm like, OK.

00:52:44.159 --> 00:52:46.824
We get back in the car, drive up
to Cotati, get all of our stuff

00:52:46.824 --> 00:52:49.172
that we just left scattered
everywhere on the property--

00:52:49.172 --> 00:52:51.380
four by five camera, lighting
equipment, everything--

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:52.230
and packed up.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:55.440
And that was the end of
my shoot with Tom Waits.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.144
So let's see.

00:52:56.144 --> 00:52:57.560
And there's one
of the Polaroids--

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.730
one of the last Polaroids.

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.960
It was a Polaroid that
had a negative, also.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.640
Ben Harper-- Jared, are we done?

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.280
Dave Matthews-- you know
what, I'm going to go fast.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.880
Bob Scagg,s Emmylou Harris,
George Clinton, James Brown,

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.992
Johnny Cash and June Cash,
Joni Mitchell, Josh Groban--

00:53:17.992 --> 00:53:19.200
I shot his first album cover.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:20.300
That's the cover,
although they used it

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.758
in black and white--
Siouxsie Sioux

00:53:21.758 --> 00:53:25.187
from Siouxsie and the Bansees,
Snoop, Snoop smoking pot.

00:53:25.187 --> 00:53:27.270
Snoop passed out in the
middle of his photo shoot.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.030
And he said, he
goes, "Hey, man, I'm

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.580
known for passing out
in my photo shoots."

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.130
Steve Miller, Tori Amos--
her first magazine cover,

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:40.140
cover of "Keyboard" magazine--
Chris Isaac, Waylon Jennings,

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.790
Jello Biafra, The Neville
Brothers down in New Orleans,

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:46.810
Gil Scott Heron, Ike
Turner as in Ike and Tina,

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.980
JJ Cahill who just
died last year,

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.810
Country Joe McDonald,
Fiona Apple--

00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:54.070
who is as depressed
as her picture looks.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.770
Jamie Foxx, the actor.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.860
I shot his first album cover.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.510
OK?

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:01.541
And after the shoot was over,
we were talking about ping-pong.

00:54:01.541 --> 00:54:03.540
He's like, "I got a ping
pong table at my house.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.540
Let's go play ping-pong."

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.140
So we go to his house.

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.660
He's in the flat
lands of Hollywood.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.735
This is before "Ray,"
before he was a big--

00:54:08.735 --> 00:54:10.110
and I'm pretty
good at ping-pong.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.710
Like I can hold my own.

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:14.110
And he destroyed me.

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:17.600
He was like Olympic-level
ping-pong player.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.550
But shot Jamie's first album.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:24.390
Isaac Hayes, Michael Penn, Bob
Mould-- this was done in 1990,

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:27.440
and I just did Bob Mould's
new album three months ago,

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:31.310
25 years later-- Chris
Whitley, John Lee Hooker,

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:36.040
John Lee Hooker, Hooker,
Hooker, Jorma, Taj Mahal--

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.440
that's for an album cover.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.523
And then I did a book
called "Travelling on a High

00:54:39.523 --> 00:54:41.400
Frequency," which is
also out here, which

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.600
was all of the stuff
that you just saw.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.189
Some new work that
I did recently.

00:54:45.189 --> 00:54:46.230
This is all digital work.

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.377
Peter Rowan-- we're almost done.

00:54:48.377 --> 00:54:49.710
We've only got a few more to go.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:52.767
Eddie Money, Chris
Robinson-- that

00:54:52.767 --> 00:54:55.100
was a magazine cover-- Elvis
Costello at Hardly Strictly

00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:58.100
Bluegrass, Emmy Lou Harris,
Jackie Greene, Jackie

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.900
Greene, Rambling Jack Elliott,
Essence, Josh Redman--

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:06.159
shot his last record-- Phil
Lesh from the Grateful Dead.

00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:07.950
And that's the cover
of my new book, "JAM,"

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:10.230
which is all the live stuff,
which is available for sale

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.730
out here.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:12.517
And that's all live
concert photography.

00:55:12.517 --> 00:55:15.100
All right, I think we're going
to go into some questions here.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.280
Allman Brothers, and
Carlos, Elvis Costello,

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.250
Government Mule, Jackie
Greene, Jane's Addiction-- this

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.280
is all stuff that's
in my new "JAM" book.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:26.480
I really wanted to do a book--
I'm going to tell one more fun

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.940
story because this
is a good one.

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.856
So this was shot at the
Bridge School Benefit.

00:55:29.856 --> 00:55:32.490
This is Eddy Vedder and Neil
Young at the Bridge School.

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.462
Epic photograph, right? "Rolling
Stone" ran it full page.

00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:37.670
When you opened the magazine,
it was the first photo.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:38.960
They took where it
said Bridge School

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:41.084
and they put their little
circle there and wrote RS

00:55:41.084 --> 00:55:42.900
with the issue
number that they do.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.150
So the next year, I'm
back at the Bridge School.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.816
And I've been shooting
the Bridge School

00:55:46.816 --> 00:55:48.164
for 25 years for Neil and Peggy.

00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:50.080
And I walk up to Eddie
and I introduce myself.

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:52.496
And I say, "Hey, I'm the guy
that took that picture of you

00:55:52.496 --> 00:55:54.155
and Neil that was
in "Rolling Stone."

00:55:54.155 --> 00:55:55.470
And he goes, "Oh, I
love that picture.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:56.090
Can I get a copy?"

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:56.631
I go, "Yeah."

00:55:56.631 --> 00:55:58.480
He goes, "But I've got
to tell you a story.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.530
You know that scarf that
I'm wearing in that?"

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:04.034
He goes, "You know the
actor Bradley Cooper?"

00:56:04.034 --> 00:56:05.450
I'm like, "Well,
I know who he is.

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.240
Like, I'm not hanging
out with Bradley Cooper."

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.730
He goes, "Well, Bradley
Cooper called me up

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.570
and needed a favor.

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:11.270
He needed me to, like,
autograph some things

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.240
for some friend of his
or relative or whatever.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.573
And I'm like, sure, no problem."

00:56:14.573 --> 00:56:17.512
So, Eddie autographs some CDs
or prints, whatever it was,

00:56:17.512 --> 00:56:18.720
sends them to Bradley Cooper.

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.428
And in exchange,
Bradley Cooper sends him

00:56:20.428 --> 00:56:22.610
this scarf, right,
as a thank you.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:24.426
So then, this shot
is in "Rolling Stone"

00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:25.550
and Bradley Cooper sees it.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.265
And calls Eddie and goes,
"I really miss that scarf.

00:56:28.265 --> 00:56:31.300
Can I have it back? "

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.804
And Eddie was like, "Fuck, no."

00:56:34.804 --> 00:56:36.970
So Eddie told me that story,
which is a great story.

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.930
Neil Young from his
"Last Electric" tour.

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.826
Fish at Red Rocks, String
Cheese at Red Rocks,

00:56:41.826 --> 00:56:43.700
Spearhead-- another one
of my favorite bands.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.825
I've been working with
Michael Franti and Spearhead

00:56:45.825 --> 00:56:47.440
since the late '80s.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.110
I do a lot of video-- The
Roots, Kirk from The Roots

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.240
has become a good friend--
My Morning Jacket,

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:54.760
who's on the cover
of the new book.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.400
Black Keys, before
anybody really

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.950
knew them, playing at a small
festival on the East Coast.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:03.670
This is Mo at Red
Rocks, Gogo Bordello--

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.940
and I think we're
just about done.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.020
I've got like five more.

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:09.875
Grace Potter, Lukas Nelson, the
Avett Brothers at Mountain Jam.

00:57:09.875 --> 00:57:11.750
And then I got a lot of
crowd shots in there.

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:13.520
And that's because I'm going
to do my next book, which

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.850
is going to come out
in 2015, and that's

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:16.360
going to be called
"Hippie Chick."

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:19.250
And it's going to be exactly
what you think it is.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:20.530
Hippie chicks.

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:23.390
And what a long strange
trip it continues to be.

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.837
Thank you very much.

00:57:24.837 --> 00:57:28.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:31.400
JAY BLAKESBERG: Do we have
time for a couple of questions?

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.941
AUDIENCE: Hi, do
you have any stories

00:57:32.941 --> 00:57:37.210
about the '70s scene of like
Jackson Browne, and Tom Petty,

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:38.560
and people in the LA area.

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.490
JAY BLAKESBERG: Not
really, because I was still

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:40.830
in high school in the '70s.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:43.690
And so, I mean, I've been
face to face with those guys.

00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:45.529
And Jackson, I love
Jackson, and I've

00:57:45.529 --> 00:57:47.320
photographed him many
times over the years.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.080
But not really from the '70s.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.000
I was still a kid
with a camera, trying

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.100
to figure out my
place in the script.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.440
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite venue to shoot in?

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.970
And then, also,
what musician have

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:59.150
you seen evolve the
most over the years

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.031
that you've been able to shoot?

00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:03.530
JAY BLAKESBERG: You know, I
like shooting in smaller-- like,

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.760
as far as festivals go,
I like smaller festivals.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:08.200
I like Mountain Jam and
Summer Camp and Moedown

00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.780
and Gathering the Vibes--
these are East Coast festivals.

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:16.240
Like I don't love big you
know, 90 bands over 17 stages.

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.570
Like at JazzFest
where I was last week,

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:20.320
you know, when Carlos
Santana was playing,

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.580
I was on stage shooting him.

00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:22.440
I do a lot of work with him.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:23.650
And I stayed for the whole set.

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:25.930
And most people that are at
JazzFest that are shooting,

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:27.710
it's 15 minutes here,
it's 15 minutes here,

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:29.520
it's 15 minutes here, it's
15-- and I don't like that.

00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.020
I like the-- like
the way you get

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.630
the epic photograph is you
wait for the photograph.

00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:35.720
It just doesn't happen
in the first 15 minutes.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.605
And so, on the festival side,
I like smaller festivals.

00:58:38.605 --> 00:58:40.310
And I like to be
able to concentrate

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:42.790
on staying in one place
as long as possible.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.054
Venue-wise, I mean, I
love all the-- I love

00:58:45.054 --> 00:58:46.720
Slims and the Great
American Music Hall,

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.130
and The Fillmore, and The
Warfield, and The Fox,

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:51.056
and all the--
Terapin Crossroads,

00:58:51.056 --> 00:58:52.680
I love shooting at
Terapin Crossroads--

00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:53.530
and the Sweetwater.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.738
I mean, there's so many
great venues in the Bay Area.

00:58:55.738 --> 00:58:57.784
I like venues with low stages.

00:58:57.784 --> 00:58:59.700
And that's why I like
shooting on stage a lot.

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.090
And I've kind of
earned, or gotten

00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:04.284
to the point where I'm
allowed to be on stage a lot.

00:59:04.284 --> 00:59:05.700
Because you can
see people's feet.

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:07.320
When you're on a high
stage and you're shooting,

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.444
you seen them from here up.

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.620
And it's a different look.

00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.767
And so, I like
being on stage, or I

00:59:11.767 --> 00:59:13.850
like shooting in rooms
that have low stages, where

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.410
if I'm standing in front of
it, like I can see everything.

00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.550
So what musician have I
seen develop the most?

00:59:19.550 --> 00:59:20.400
You know, so many.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.780
I mean, Primus, Michael
Franti in Spearhead,

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.852
you know, I think those are
people that have really-- you

00:59:26.852 --> 00:59:28.310
know, when Spearhead
first started,

00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:30.200
they were concerned
more of a hip-hop group.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.955
And Primus was considered
a heavy metal band.

00:59:32.955 --> 00:59:35.080
And now they're both darlings
of the jam bad world.

00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:37.880
Because I think that fans
in the jam band world

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:41.440
are way more open-minded
than most other musical fans.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.770
And really, if you
look at all the punk

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:47.010
rock that was happening in the
late '70s and stuff like that,

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:49.150
a lot of that stuff is
gone and disappeared.

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:52.300
But look at bands
like Moe and Fish,

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.500
that are 25 and 30
years into their career,

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.630
and they're still
vibrant, vibrant bands.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.630
And so, even, like, Michael
Franti in Spearhead,

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:02.370
I first photographed him,
I think, in '87 or '88.

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:05.480
So long careers
that have evolved

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.190
into being who these people are.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:11.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wonder if you
have a favorite perspective,

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.620
because I saw you shot,
like, a lot of fish eye.

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:17.000
JAY BLAKESBERG: So,
back in the day,

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.681
I did love the fish eye lens.

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:20.430
And I haven't really--
I don't have a fish

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.920
eye-- I do have a fish eye
lens-- but I never bring it

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.200
with me.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.320
I shoot with a wide lens.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:27.070
I have a 14 to 24 Nikon,
which I love and adore.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.220
So it is a very wide lens,
but it's rectangular,

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.754
it's not curved at all.

01:00:30.754 --> 01:00:33.170
Although it does stretch people
out on the ends, and makes

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.460
people look fat.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.672
But I've always
been-- like my style,

01:00:37.672 --> 01:00:39.130
and so, when you're
a photographer,

01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:40.830
you're sort of
defined by your style.

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:43.060
At least, you should be
defined by your style.

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.560
And I think a lot of
people don't have a style,

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.620
because they don't really
understand what they're doing.

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.330
And they picked up
a digital camera

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:49.420
and they're just shooting.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.409
And so people used to
tell me all the time

01:00:52.409 --> 01:00:54.700
they can tell my work, because
I always shot very wide.

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.116
And so, even my
live stuff-- like,

01:00:56.116 --> 01:00:58.664
I know some photographers
that like to be far back

01:00:58.664 --> 01:01:00.830
and shoot with long lenses
to get that compression--

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:03.250
but I like to be right
up front, like always

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.630
with a 24 millimeter
lens, or now my 14.

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:07.650
When I was shooting
prime lenses,

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:10.553
Nikon film, I think my
widest lens was a 20-- well,

01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:12.410
I had the 16
millimeter fish eye--

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:15.520
but I would much prefer to be
right in your face shooting

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.270
then back.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:21.297
It's just the style that I
liked and that I gravitated to.

01:01:21.297 --> 01:01:23.880
AUDIENCE: So, how many photos
do you typically take at a show.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.640
And how many of
those are the quality

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.206
that you would give to--
or, yeah, that were deleted.

01:01:29.206 --> 01:01:30.830
JAY BLAKESBERG: So
I'm a heavy shooter,

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:31.790
and I always have been.

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:34.380
Even when I shot film,
I shot way more film

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.679
than everybody else.

01:01:35.679 --> 01:01:37.220
Because I always
truly believed that,

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:41.540
if you're in front of
Jerry Garcia and its

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:44.690
September 1, 1985,
you're never going

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.630
to be at September
1, 1985 again.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.690
So I've shot a lot of film.

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:53.520
And digital, I even shoot more.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.330
Like a typical show,
especially if I'm

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:57.490
shooting the whole set--
like Santana at JazzFest,

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.765
I think I did 2,500 images in 90
minutes or something like that.

01:02:00.765 --> 01:02:02.140
And that's pretty
typical for me,

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.870
to shoot about 2,500 images.

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:06.830
I typically delete 50%
of what I shoot, like,

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:08.420
pretty consistently.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.715
I look at every single
photo that I shoot.

01:02:10.715 --> 01:02:12.090
I have a full time
guy that works

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.310
for me that handles
all my digital IT,

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:18.010
and all my maintenance and re
touching and stuff like that.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:22.810
And so our workflow, as it
all goes into his system,

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:25.570
and then I come in I edit it.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.580
And it's sort of like, I work
in light room, so it's a delete

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.080
or a keep.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.480
And if I'm keeping it,
I'm one starring it,

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.190
or two starring it,
or I'm rating it

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.050
so I can come back to it.

01:02:35.050 --> 01:02:37.080
But I might deliver
to a client--

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.740
like if I'm shooting a band
like a publicity shoot,

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.197
I might try and get it down
to 200 or 300, out of like,

01:02:42.197 --> 01:02:44.030
let's say 1,000 that I
might end up keeping,

01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:45.510
or 800 that I'm
keeping that I'll

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.320
deliver to the client as a
web link for them to look at.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:51.230
AUDIENCE: So I love the
old pictures of the hippies

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:54.580
at the dead shows, because I
see my old friends in them.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.480
And I was wondering if
there's any way you could just

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.176
dump a huge library on
the internet somewhere.

01:03:01.176 --> 01:03:03.050
JAY BLAKESBERG: Well,
go to my Facebook page.

01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:07.362
There's hundreds of them--
Jay Blakesberg Photography.

01:03:07.362 --> 01:03:09.320
AUDIENCE: Since you
started in film, obviously,

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.940
how do you feel about
having to transition

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.340
to digital with your workflow?

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:15.720
Do you feel like it's
affected your personal style

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.862
or improved it?

01:03:17.862 --> 01:03:20.320
JAY BLAKESBERG: So, when the
transition-- so I was actually

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.750
a pretty early
adapter to digital.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.890
Early on, we shot
film, but I've invested

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:33.680
in scanning technology, like
some of the early scanners.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:36.640
And we would deliver our jobs
digitally to our clients.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.710
And it was actually-- from
a business standpoint,

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:40.490
it was also good, because it
generated a lot of revenue.

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:42.370
Because at that time, clients
were still like, yeah,

01:03:42.370 --> 01:03:44.000
we'll pay for
scanning, of course.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.760
We used to pay for prints,
now we'll pay for scanning,

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.290
and we skip the-- you know, we
don't have to pay for prints

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.830
and then get the scans.

01:03:48.830 --> 01:03:54.440
And so I have over-- I've
scan over 85,000 pieces

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:56.250
of film of mine that I shot.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.180
I've probably shot over
a million images on film.

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:03.255
I've got over a million
images in my digital archive.

01:04:03.255 --> 01:04:05.380
And so, when I first started
shooting with digital,

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.020
I hated it.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:06.900
I hated the look.

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.540
It was also really
one of the reasons

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:13.812
why I stopped-- I never really
wanted to get into video.

01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:15.270
I do a lot of video
directing, now,

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:17.478
because the technology has
changed to the point where

01:04:17.478 --> 01:04:19.060
the look and feel
of it, creatively,

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.460
looks a lot like film, right?

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.140
24 frames per second,
stuff like that.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:26.340
And so early digital
photography look like bad video

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.265
from the '80s, you know
bad soap opera video,

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:30.140
you know what I mean?

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:30.848
It had that look.

01:04:30.848 --> 01:04:31.690
It was very sterile.

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:32.625
It was very pixel.

01:04:32.625 --> 01:04:35.000
And you know, all the camera
manufacturers would be like,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.080
you've got to shoot digital.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.163
Look at how sharp this is.

01:04:37.163 --> 01:04:38.610
Look at how many
pixels there are.

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:40.389
And I'm like, that's not--

01:04:40.389 --> 01:04:42.680
You know when I used to shoot
film, I go out on a shoot

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.638
and I'd shoot color, I'd
shoot black and white,

01:04:44.638 --> 01:04:47.700
I'd shoot fast film,
slow film, grainy film,

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.370
because that was sort
of what made the style.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:53.140
Large format, medium
format, small format--

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.820
it was all those things
in the palette that

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.660
helped us create it.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.494
So all the sudden, you
get a digital camera.

01:04:58.494 --> 01:05:00.534
And everybody's taking
pictures, and it comes out

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:01.840
of the camera looking the same.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.548
All of our pictures
are looking the same.

01:05:03.548 --> 01:05:08.410
So I, early on, spent--
pre-Instagram filter land--

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:10.780
spent months, and
months, and months

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.220
with my IT digital re-toucher
guy developing like custom

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:18.610
filters that we created to
kind of make my digital photos

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:19.236
look like film.

01:05:19.236 --> 01:05:20.610
And if you looked
at a lot-- it's

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:21.970
maybe hard to see on the screen.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:23.700
But a lot of those images
that are shot digitally,

01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.820
we would add grain, and
noise, and contrast,

01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.280
and over-sharpening, and
all these different filters.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.750
And we played around with
it for months and months

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.500
until we kind of came
up with a formula.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.240
And so, until I kind of
came up with that look--

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.614
and if you pick up the book
"JAM" outside and look at it,

01:05:35.614 --> 01:05:38.420
you'll see it in those
pictures, because they jump out

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:42.510
at you-- that's kind of
how I got to the point

01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:44.942
where, creatively, I was
like, OK, I like this.

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.400
And it was also
the digital cameras

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.170
getting bigger files--
full sized chip

01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:50.676
cameras made a difference.

01:05:50.676 --> 01:05:52.050
And so, we were--
like I said, we

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:54.936
were early adapters to
digital, slow adapters

01:05:54.936 --> 01:05:57.060
to using digital cameras,
because I didn't like it.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:57.976
And I was a Nikon guy.

01:05:57.976 --> 01:06:01.300
Canon was ahead of Nikon,
and the early Nikon cameras

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.990
were all small chip cameras,
and I hated the way it looked.

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:05.731
You know, like,
realistically, some

01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:07.230
of the first photos
I took digitally

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:10.220
on those early cameras,
I kind of equate

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:12.400
them to like Instamatic
photos from the '70s.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.650
Like that's how bad they are.

01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:15.020
Like, they're garbage, really.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.330
They're two, three,
four megabyte photos

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.770
that we didn't shoot raw.

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.340
Or if we did, they're just bad.

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.680
And we've lost digital files in
the transition in the migration

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.370
and whatnot.

01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:26.520
You know.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.530
But I like where I'm
at now, digitally.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:30.494
And I think if you saw
some of the recent work

01:06:30.494 --> 01:06:33.160
that I was showing, you can kind
of see where my style has gone.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.710
And it doesn't look like it's
cookie cutter and off-the-shelf

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:36.918
and what everybody else does.

01:06:36.918 --> 01:06:39.975
And I think that it
also has inspired

01:06:39.975 --> 01:06:41.350
a lot of other
photographers that

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.300
do music, that know
me and know my work,

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:46.097
to try and go down
that same road.

01:06:46.097 --> 01:06:48.180
JARED: Great, well thank
you very, very much, Jay.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.440
JAY BLAKESBERG: Thanks,
Jared, for hosting me today.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:51.870
Jared Kelly from
Google, you guys.

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:54.020
