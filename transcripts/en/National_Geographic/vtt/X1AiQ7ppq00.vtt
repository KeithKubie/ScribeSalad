00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.401
We have taken fish
out of the ocean

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:03.803
faster than they can reproduce.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.806
Ninety percent
of the large fish,

00:00:07.806 --> 00:00:10.509
<i>like the tuna and the sharks,
 are gone.</i>

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.146
<i>And we killed them in the
 last 100 years alone.</i>

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.548
<i> Right now about a third
 of the fisheries</i>

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.916
<i>of the world have collapsed.</i>

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.752 line:0%
<i>If we continue like this,
 before 2080</i>

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.889
most of the fisheries of the
world will have collapsed.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.958
Not only do we take fish
out of the ocean

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.760
faster than they can reproduce,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.363
but, also, we are doing it
in a very destructive way.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.634
<i> These are trawlers,
 shrimp trawlers,</i>

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.169
<i> in the South China Sea.</i>

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.971
<i> You can see their tracks
 from a satellite photo.</i>

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:42.675
In some places, for every pound
of shrimp that is caught,

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:45.211
ten pounds of other animals,

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:48.414
including fish,
starfish or corals,

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.984
are killed
and discarded overboard.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.586
And on top of that,
we have pollution,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.455
and now, every year,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:01:00.826
eight million tons of plastic
enters the ocean.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.998
And on top of that we have
climate change, global warming,

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.033
which is making the ocean
warmer and more acidic,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.169
which is killing
coral reefs everywhere.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.370
<i>This used to be a coral reef</i>

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.372
<i> now this is a ghost
 of a coral reef,</i>

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.609
<i> dead broken coral
overgrown by seaweed and slime.</i>

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.845
So, in 2008,
I moved to Washington,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:22.649
and we started by
asking questions.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.283
The main question was:

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.719
"Are there pristine places
left in the ocean?"

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:29.289
<i>So, we found this place in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean.</i>

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.589
<i> The Line Islands.</i>

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.725 line:0%
<i> Seven of these islands
 are uninhabited.</i>

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.728
<i>And off we went for five weeks
 to places like this.</i>

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.863
<i> Millennium Atoll.</i>

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.099
<i>This is the size of Manhattan,
that belongs to Kiribati.</i>

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.068
<i> And as soon as we jump
 in the water,</i>

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.435
<i> this is what we see.</i>

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:47.807
<i>Not only we saw healthy reefs,
 but lots of predators.</i>

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.942
<i> Lots of predators.</i>

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:52.445
( audience laughter )

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.146
<i>You know, you jump in the water</i>

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.748
<i> and as soon as
 your bubbles clear,</i>

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.517
<i> you are surrounded
 by 10-12 sharks.</i>

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.889
If you go to the African plains,
to the Serengeti,

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:04.690
you know,
you would expect to see

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.259
hundreds of thousands
of wildebeest,

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.526
and zebras, and antelopes,

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.995
and all the animals that
eat the grass.

00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:09.996
The herbivores.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.232
And then just a few thousand
or a few hundred lions, right?

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.969
This is what we thought
would happen on the reef.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.269
This is what we learned
in school.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.871
This is what we found
in textbooks.

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:22.775
But when we went to a pristine
reef for the first time,

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.612
<i>we discovered then what we
thought was natural was not.</i>

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.681
That biomass pyramid
is upside down.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.116
You go to one of
these pristine reefs

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.886
and more than half of
most of the biomass,

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.721
<i> more than half of
 the biomass of fish,</i>

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.689
<i> is accounted for by
 the top predators.</i>

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.826
<i> The big guys on top
 of the food chain.</i>

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.863
But then we went to a reef
with 5,000 people nearby

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.331
and this is what we saw.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.066
Dead coral, no fish.

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.402
Only 5,000 people
were able to do this.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.404
Now, the question now is:

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:55.541
"How many people are enough
to turn something pristine

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:57.210
into something that is not?"

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.212
So, we decided to go to a place
with less people

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.814
and test that question.

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.984
<i> So, we went to the
 most extreme place.</i>

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.152
<i> Pitcairn Island.</i>

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.655 line:0%
<i> Fifty-two people live
 on Pitcairn Island.</i>

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.223 line:0%
<i> It belongs to the UK.</i>

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:13.158
Pitcairn is inhabited
by 52 people.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:15.361
The other three islands
are uninhabited.

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.696
<i>We jump in the water and...</i>

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:20.033
<i> the visibility
 was extraordinary,</i>

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.868
<i> but there are no fish.</i>

00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:24.603
<i> There were some fish
 but no sharks,</i>

00:03:24.603 --> 00:03:26.071
no groupers,
no snappers.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.207
And then, we had to do it.

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.976
We had to go to these
places without people

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:32.045
and see what we find.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.914
<i>So, we went to places like this.
 Henderson Atoll.</i>

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:36.482
<i> And we jump in the water</i>

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:38.985
<i>and the coral reefs were really,
 really, really healthy.</i>

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:39.918
<i> Spectacular...</i>

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.087
<i>And of course, lots of sharks.</i>

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.823
<i>The same thing we found on the
Line Islands we found here.</i>

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:46.392
This inverted biomass pyramid.

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.261
The place where
the predators dominate.

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:50.630
So, there you go,
that was our question answered.

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.900
Even 52 people,
a population as small as 52,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.471
are able, over time, using just
traditional fishing methods

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.740
are enough to turn
something pristine

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.009
into something that is not.

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:05.611
The corals were fine,
they didn't have the impact

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:08.314
that the 5,000 Polynesians
had on that reef,

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.250
but they were able to remove,
over time,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.920
all these large fish that
previously inhabited the reef.
