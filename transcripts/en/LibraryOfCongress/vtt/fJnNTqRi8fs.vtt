00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.010
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.310
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Morning.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.610
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Morning.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:18.910
Did you guys have a
great tour this morning

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.210
of Baseball Americana?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.810
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: That was the
fastest self-guided exhibit,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.110
right [laughs]?

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.410
You had 15 minutes.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.710
I hope you had some
favorite parts.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.540
Did you see stories of
some unexpected people

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.580
in the baseball exhibit?

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.620
And I know you only had 15
minutes, so the good news is

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.830
that you can keep exploring
this exhibit online.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.040
You can go to loc.gov and
check out Baseball Americana,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.130
and you can see so
many things online.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.150
You can take a closer look.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.110
You can engage with the
stories a little bit closer

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.640
and check it out some more.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.610
So, today's program
is really special,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.170
because one of the
stories we have

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.340
in the exhibit is
coming alive right

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.180
in front of you [laughter].

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.590
We have the story
of a very special,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.400
very interesting baseball player
Mamie-- nicknamed "Peanut"--

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.650
Johnson, and you will hear
about this pioneer player

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.760
from the author of her
biography, Michelle Y. Green.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.650
Mrs. Green is a storyteller.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.490
She went to school to learn
how to tell people stories.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.320
She teaches others
how to tell stories,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.920
and she has published a
lot of stories she told

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.140
about people in her life.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.110
She writes a children's book
series called "Willie Pearl,"

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.410
and that's about
her mother living

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.710
in the Depression era [laughs].

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:42.640
And, also, here she is,
the protagonist [laughter].

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.550
And Michelle Y. Green also
wrote the biography called

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.020
"A Strong Right Arm,"
which is about the hero

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.950
of the story you're
going to hear today.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190
And that's A Strong Right Arm,

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.160
the story of Mamie
Peanut Johnson,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.330
which was published in 2002.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.810
So, the story is actually
going into the next step

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.580
of a book's evolution
that happens sometimes,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.590
and it's going to
become a movie.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.090
And the movie is called
"Throw Like a Girl," [laughs]

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.430
and the production is starting
in February of next year.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.750
So, that would be
really cool to see how.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.050
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.150
&gt;&gt; Your friendships evolve
into stories that millions

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.290
of people can participate in.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.830
So, no more delays.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.790
Let's welcome Michelle
Y. Green, everybody.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.560
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Thank you.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.030
[ Applause ]

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.330
I like to walk around.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240
I have a Fitbit, you see.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.540
It counts my steps.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.840
I'll sit down when I read,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.420
but right now I'm
going to walk around.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.020
What was your favorite
part of the exhibit?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.280
I talked with this
young man, earlier.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.230
Let's hear from some
of the women.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.530
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] microphone
so we can hear the kids.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.830
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Oh.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.130
All right, [laughs] okay.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.430
Anybody? Yes.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.420
&gt;&gt; I liked the handwritten
things,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.680
and I also liked the
little pocketbook.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.980
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Okay.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.280
Great. Anybody else
want to chime in?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.790
This is interactive.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.440
You can talk to me, and
I'll talk back to you.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.740
Go ahead.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.330
&gt;&gt; I liked to see the dresses

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.390
that women would have
wear for baseball.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.690
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Yes, we're going to talk

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.970
about a woman ballplayer this
morning named Mamie Peanut

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.260
Johnson, and guess
what the best part is?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.430
She was from Washington D.C.
She could walk to the Library

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.670
of Congress anytime
she wanted to.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.150
She passed away in February,
sadly, but her legacy,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.100
her story, still remains.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.990
They have a Little League
team named after her,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.560
Mamie Peanut Johnson team.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.980
And they went all the way to
the championships this year.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.610
They didn't win it.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.900
My bad. They didn't win it,
but they tried their best.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.070
There's a playground named
after Mamie Peanut Johnson

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.690
in Washington D.C.,
and there's a mural,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.900
a big painting of
her on the wall.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.980
And I like to think that
something in my discovery

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.420
of Mamie led to her
wonderful success.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.200
We got a question
over here, a comment?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.830
&gt;&gt; I like the part where you
could, like, feel how, like,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.210
different the balls were then

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.980
and how they are
now and the gloves.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.280
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Baseballs?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.030
I have a very old baseball.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.350
Look at this.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.680
And a very little mitt.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.930
They called her "Peanut," but
she wasn't that small [laughs].

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.770
This is a prop that
someone gave me.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.430
Okay, before I start talking
about Mamie, I want to talk

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.810
about what it's like to
be a real live author.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.820
How many of you have
met an author before?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.320
Been to a book signing?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.510
Good. A lot of you.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.350
Well, let me pull the
curtain back a little bit

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.010
and tell you what it's like
to be a real, live author.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.730
Guess what I had for
breakfast this morning?

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.090
Cereal and juice [laughs].

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.930
You see, not all
authors are famous

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.010
like J.K. Rowling
and people like that.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.970
We live right in
your neighborhood.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.650
I live-- on a good day--

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.950
about an hour from here

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.050
in a little town called
Upper Marlboro, Maryland,

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.350
and my family is here.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.930
Let me introduce
the rest of them.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.390
There's my husband,
Oliver Green.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.060
He's from Baltimore.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.920
Unfortunately, the Orioles
didn't do too well this

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.220
year [laughs].

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.590
As a matter of fact, I
think they had the worst--

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.030
Were they the worst in baseball?

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.550
[Inaudible] In their
entire lives.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.620
Now, I met this handsome man
at the University of Maryland

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.120
where I went to college, and
we married right after there.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.080
And guess where he took
me on our very first date?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.380
&gt;&gt; The Library of Congress?

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.940
&gt;&gt; No, not the Library
of Congress [laughter].

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.350
That's a good guess.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.150
Actually, we might have
gotten married sooner

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.590
if he had taken me to
the library [laughs].

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.780
But we went to Baltimore on
the bus from College Park

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.600
where I got my journalism
degree,

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.400
and we went to Memorial
Stadium, because he grew

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.810
up loving the Orioles.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.260
He lived not far
from there, you see.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.900
Unfortunately, I hadn't gotten
into baseball at that time.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.950
So, we took the long
bus from the University

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.250
of Maryland to Memorial Park.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.720
It was a night game.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.020
And guess what happened?

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.520
It rained.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.930
Not only did it rain, but
they had a game delay.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.750
So, now I'm sitting
there with this stranger,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.770
this handsome stranger, in the
rain watching a baseball game.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.390
And then it stopped,
and we weren't

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.690
in the nice, cushy box seats.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.990
We were up, way up, because
we were students, you know?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.360
While there was a rain delay,
he taught me about baseball,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.800
what the different pitches
were, what it means to steal.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.620
I didn't know any
of those things.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.000
We have two sons.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.300
One is Brian.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.300
He's a filmmaker
in Philadelphia.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.680
The other is Evan.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.100
He's a music producer and
a vocalist in Los Angeles.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.300
But before that, both
of them played baseball.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.370
They started out very
little as playing tee-ball.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.730
Anybody here play tee-ball,
or baseball, softball?

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.810
Anything? Any ball?

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.110
Okay, [laughs] a few of you.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.730
Good. Well, we forced
Brian to play.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.260
We said, "Try it
for one season."

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.560
He hated it.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.140
But Evan went on to play
baseball all the way

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.080
through to high school
in Upper Marlboro.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.110
Now, sitting next to
him is Willie Pearl,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.360
who waved at you before.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.090
My very first book that I
wrote 20 years ago is called

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.440
"Willie Pearl."

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.740
How many of you think
you might would

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.680
like to be a writer one day?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.440
Anybody? Are you journaling?

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.790
[Inaudible] You write
stuff down.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.090
That's good.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.330
Let me tell you the
secret of good writing.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.590
Write what you know, and nobody
knows your family like you.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.610
If you're stuck for
something to write,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.200
write your family story,
the good and the bad.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.550
Now, Willie Pearl has three
books in her series, and,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.650
next to her, is-- You're
not going to believe this--

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.850
my bowling coach [laughter].

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.330
You see? I'm not good at
baseball, but I bowl pretty good

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.630
and so does Willie Pearl.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.490
We went on tour together,
if you can believe that.

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.960
Once, I won a lot
of badges [laughs].

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.970
So, sitting next to her is Mark,
Mark Henson [assumed spelling]

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.360
from Prince Frederick, Maryland.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.000
Mark, do you like baseball?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.600
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Loves it.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.900
He loves all kind of sports.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.820
They talk to one another every
night that the game is on.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.440
Sitting next to Ollie
[assumed spelling] is a very

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.740
special friend.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.040
Her name is Alexis
[assumed spelling].

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.150
Now, Alexis is the farthest
away from any of you.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.620
She lives in Bermuda,
a little island.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.010
It's beautiful there.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.730
I started going there
when I was a child.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.480
Our family went there a lot.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.010
Alexis is here, and I think
she's kind of pretty [laughs].

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.060
Okay. She's also in school.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.400
She's going to College
of Southern Maryland

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.950
in La Plata, Maryland.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.290
And she's deciding
to be an accountant.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.860
Yes? [Inaudible]
How do you spell it?

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.160
[Inaudible] It's
the same as yours.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.460
Very good.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.760
Maybe you're related [laughter].

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.880
Let me tell you a funny story.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.550
This has nothing to do with
baseball, has everything

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.080
to do with Willie Pearl.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.010
We like to share family stories.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:16.860
By the way-- Can I tell them?--
She's 94 years old [laughs].

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.830
So, for her 94th birthday,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.740
my sister Adrienne [assumed
spelling] gave her one

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.880
of those fancy Alexa machines.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.180
Do you know what they are?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.870
You plug them in, and it talks
to you, tells you the weather,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.100
the score of the ball game,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.130
helps you remember things,
and plays your music.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.340
Well, poor, Alexis,
when mom says "Alexa,

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.640
what's the weather like?"

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.140
Alexis comes running [laughs].

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.320
And sometimes she gets their
name mixed up [laughs].

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.530
Okay, back to being a writer.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.480
My dad was a Tuskegee Airman.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.640
Does anybody know what that is?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.440
Tell me.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.160
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.470
Yes.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.010
Let's give him a hand.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.200
My father, Eddie Lee
Young was a pilot,

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:13.070
a bombardier, and a navigator.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.220
That's called triple rating,
and only two men, two black men

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.500
in history, were
ever triple rated.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.970
And guess what book
I'm working on now?

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:24.210
It's called "High Flight,"
the story of Eddie Lee Young.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.070
And guess where I'm
doing my research?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.370
At the Library of Congress.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.020
I come down here maybe once
a month and spend the day.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.970
I wear comfortable shoes,
because it's a lot of walking.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.240
But they have great photographs
here for you to research,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.570
oral histories that
are recorded,

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:46.140
very knowledgeable people that
if you want to know anything,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.780
they'll be glad to help you.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.140
It's like that in
most libraries.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.630
How many of you like
to go to the library?

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:52.930
Everybody.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:56.310
Good. Well, because my
dad was in the air force,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.660
we grew up all over the world.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.320
I lived in Germany, Texas,
Maine, Mississippi, Canada,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.900
and we travelled
all over the place.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.330
I got my first love of writing
when I was in the fifth grade.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.270
Now, many of you-- Are
you in the fourth grade?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.570
&gt;&gt; Fifth grade.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.870
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
You're in the fifth grade.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.420
I knew I wanted to be a
writer from the fifth grade.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.450
My mom still has my
report card that says

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.030
that I was a good
writer [laughs],

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:25.200
so I started writing family
stories when I was young.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.240
I didn't get published
until I got out of college,

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.800
but I love writing, and I
love mentoring young writers.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.760
Let me get back to the
first rule of writing,

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.870
which is "Write what you know."

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.600
So, it's no secret that when I
wrote my first children's book,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.180
I wrote it about Willie Pearl.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.790
That's her real name,
Willie Pearl,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.000
who grew up in the
mountains of Kentucky.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.570
And there are three
books of that series.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.660
Now, what does it take
to be a good writer?

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.960
What do you think?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.390
What are some things that
you think make a good writer?

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.690
&gt;&gt; Creativity.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.000
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Creativity.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.300
That's number one.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.740
What else?

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.040
&gt;&gt; Knowledge.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.340
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Knowledge.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.640
That goes with research.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.940
I'll talk about that
in a minute.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.240
Anything else?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.540
It takes something to
write with, doesn't it?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:09.840
&gt;&gt; A pencil.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.140
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
A pencil, a pen,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.700
a crayon, a laptop, a journal.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.220
How many of you have
access to computers?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.870
I figured so.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.430
Okay, all of you.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.220
So, you have no excuse.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.880
You can get on the internet
and do your research there.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.410
You can come to the
Library of Congress.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.370
You can come to your
branch library and find

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.240
out all the stuff that you
do need to know [laughter].

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.590
I wrote a little book
called "Oscar Invincible."

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.890
I'm reworking it now.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.190
I wrote it for children.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.490
Now I'm writing it for adults.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.310
Oscar Micheaux was a slave.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.410
His family were slaves.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.190
He was a farmer in
Kansas, and then he went

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.700
on to be a home setter
in South Dakota.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.960
But the thing that people don't
know about Oscar Micheaux is

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.830
that he was a filmmaker.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.820
He lived in a little
soddy out in the middle

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.180
of nowhere South Dakota.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.220
He bought himself a
little pot of land.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.810
He was a black man.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.900
Everybody thought he was weird.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.570
He built himself a house out
of sod, and he was lonely.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.130
He had no friends in that little
town of Gregory, South Dakota.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:16.430
So, what did he do?

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.290
He started writing.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.020
He started writing.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.690
He wrote five novels.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.190
And then when he couldn't
get them published,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.490
guess what he did?

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.790
He published them himself.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.210
Way back in the 1920s.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.480
People are self-publishing
now, so you don't have to wait

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.650
for a publisher to get
your works published.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.330
You can go on the internet and
self-publish through Amazon.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.630
You don't have to be published.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.050
You can write in a
journal and share it

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.350
with your friends and family.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.030
The important thing for a
writer is to keep at it.

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.270
Those of us who do it
for a living like I do,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.710
we try to write 500 words a
day, and that's not a lot.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.450
That's like one page.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.700
So, if you want to be a
writer, the first thing

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.000
to do is write [laughs].

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.710
You got to write.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.010
Keep at it.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.240
And don't worry about proper
grammar, proper spelling.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.000
The first time you do something
it's called a "first draft."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.220
Just write out whatever
is on your mind.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.930
There's something
called morning pages.

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.040
When you first get up and the
creativity is just flowing.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.640
Before you get ready for
school, before you get ready

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.520
to do all your chores and
all that, take a few minutes

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.850
to write what's on your mind.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.830
There's something about sleep
that brings the imagination up.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.090
Well, this morning, I was up
at 4 o'clock in the morning.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.890
Can you believe that [laughs]?

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.820
Usually, I get up
at a quarter to six.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.870
And before I have breakfast
or anything, I go to my laptop

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.380
or the journal beside my
bed, if I decide to sleep

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.770
in a little bit, and I just
write whatever comes to mind.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.630
I'm not worried about grammar.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.490
I'm not worried about
punctuation.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.790
I'm not worried.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.090
That's just for me.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.390
It's not for anybody
else to see.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.690
It's kind of like a diary.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.560
Now, Alexis keeps
a wonderful diary.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.280
She let me read some
of it one time.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.990
She's an aspiring writer.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.810
That means she wants
to be a writer, too.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.370
I think that's terrific.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.090
But when I was in the
fifth grade, we were living

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.040
in Ramstein, Germany,
an air force base,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.750
and I had this wonderful
teacher, Mrs. Raoule [phonetic].

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.950
Mrs. Raoule would read
to us an hour every day.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.250
Can you believe it?

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.860
We've come back from
the cafeteria all full

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:15.220
of good cafeteria food
[laughs], and we'd be all comfy,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.970
cozy in the classroom.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.210
And guess what she would read?

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:20.590
Little House on the Prairie.

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:22.770
How many of you know that book?

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.070
Oh, great [laughs].

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.670
And it's a TV show, too,
but I love the books.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.170
So, she would read
to us after lunch.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.340
And sometimes we'd put
our head on our desk

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.300
and sleep a little
bit or nod off.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.330
But when I kept hearing Laura
Ingalls Wilder all the time,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.170
when I started to write
Willie Pearl, guess what?

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.770
It sounded a lot like
Laura Ingalls Wilder.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.950
She was my role model.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:51.670
Does anybody know what the
word "muse" means, M-U-S-E?

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.540
Anybody? Wanna take
a stab at it?

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.840
What's a muse?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.710
&gt;&gt; Like a maze.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.010
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: A what?

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.310
[Inaudible] A maid?

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:01.610
&gt;&gt; A maze.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.910
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Oh, a maze?

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.210
I thought you said, "a maid."

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.510
I'd love to have
a maid [laughs].

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.710
A maze? No, a muse is a
person, like a role model,

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.190
that inspires you to write.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.780
Like, I have a muse.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.190
His name is-- Well,
it's not important,

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.800
but he's a famous musician.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.630
And when I sit down to write,
I like to write with music

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.650
in the background and
a good cup of coffee.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.070
That's why I get up early.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.930
So, that's what the
writing life is.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.680
It's getting up, writing
whatever's on your mind.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.350
And then if you have an
important story to tell,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.520
to do the research and
do all kinds of research.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.620
It's not just about going
to a library and digging

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.350
into the encyclopedias.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.920
It's called experiencing
things, and that's going

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.050
to bring me right
around Peanut Johnson

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.430
and how this story happened.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.270
Here's a picture of
Mamie and me in what used

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.260
to be the Negro league's
baseball shop in Mitchellville.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.560
It's not there anymore.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.860
It's a church now.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.390
But before you know it, this
is how we became acquainted.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.690
This is Mamie.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:00.990
Everybody see her?

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.950
A real live person.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:09.140
Well, I live in Upper
Marlboro, and my son,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.680
Evan, was playing baseball.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.980
He was just starting out.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.550
He wasn't that good at it.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.460
So, I was driving around,
doing my errands one Saturday,

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.580
and I pulled into a new store

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.910
to grand opening Negro
league's baseball.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.720
Now, being a writer, I
was curious, instantly.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.020
So, I went in.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.160
I said, "Maybe I can find
a jersey, or a videotape,

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.270
or a book to help my little
Evan out play baseball better.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.930
So, I walked to the store.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.230
They had videos, books,
jerseys like this.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.530
They had all kinds of stuff.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:48.180
I went to a rack, and they
had jerseys like this,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.650
and it said "Clowns" on it.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.740
Well, I got interested.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.460
And, not only that, they had
T-shirts that had this image

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:02.540
of a woman hurling a ball or
pitching a ball, and I thought,

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.950
"This is really exciting.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.030
It said "Pitcher"
on it P-I-T-C-H-E-R,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.330
pitcher, like a pitcher.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.560
I said, "I got to know
more about this woman."

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.390
So, I bought the shirt.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.870
I took it to the
register, and I said,

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.210
"I'd like to buy this shirt.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.600
And he said, "Cash or credit?"

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.670
And I said, "Can
I write a check?"

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:29.140
[laughs]. So I wrote the
check, and then he said, "Well,

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.480
you know, the woman
Mamie Peanut Johnson is

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.600
in the store right
now, autographing.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.900
Would you like to meet her?"

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:39.280
I said, "Oh my goodness, Mamie
is in the shop right now?"

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.580
It's the great opening.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.330
They had other Negro league's
baseball players there.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.620
So, I walked over with my
jersey, and I said, "Mamie,

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.660
would you sign my
jersey, please?"

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.430
And she signed it.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.730
You can hardly see.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.950
It says, "Indianapolis
Clowns, Mamie,

00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:03.170
1953 and to 1955"
is when she played.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.350
And I said to her, "I didn't
know there were female

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.150
ballplayers that were
African-American.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.440
She said-- She likes to
use the word "honey"--

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.940
"Honey, there were three of
us, three women who played

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.980
in the professional Negro
league's black baseball.

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.400
And of the three, I'm the
only one still alive."

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.840
And the writer in me went,
"There's a story here" [laughs].

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.220
So, I sat down next to
her, and I said, "Mamie,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.530
has anybody written your story?"

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:40.320
And she said to me, "Honey,
[laughs] I've been waiting

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.810
for someone to ask
me that question."

00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.600
And I said, "Well, this is
your lucky day" [laughs].

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.100
We didn't start interviewing
right away, because I had

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:56.470
to get back to my children, but
I made an appointment with her

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.330
to start doing my research.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.210
What's the first kind of
research you think I did?

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.050
I'm just meeting her
for the first time.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.040
She's a living legend.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.630
What kind of research did I do?

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.330
What process did I use?

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.040
[Inaudible] I asked
her her story, yes.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.780
You had a comment?

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.080
The same thing.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.930
It's called interviewing, right?

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.230
You've seen interviews.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:22.530
You know what interviewing is.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.830
That's when you talk
to someone to find

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.130
out more about their life.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.540
So, if you're going to write
a story about your family,

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.390
or your grandparents, or your
famous rock star, or something,

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.300
you try to get an
interview with that person

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.550
and ask some questions.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:39.190
When I wrote Willie Pearl,
I had a favorite cousin,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.410
her younger brother called
"Johnny" [assumed spelling].

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.470
And Johnny would get up
very early in the morning

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.120
to make his coffee,
so I would join him.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.960
He was a coalminer.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.770
Her family were coalminers,
so they'd get

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:52.310
up early in the morning.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.770
So, I would have
to get up at 4:00,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.140
sit down with my Uncle Johnny,

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.690
and I had a little
tape recorder,

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.050
a little microcassette.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.350
And you know what?

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.080
I would just ask him to talk,
talk about what was important

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.190
to him, what was on his
mind, what he liked to do.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.840
So, I did the same
thing with Mamie.

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.560
So, if you're going
to interview someone,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.460
always ask permission first.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.470
But you'll find that most
people are willing to talk

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:16.800
about themselves, okay?

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.710
So, I sat down in the Negro
league's baseball shop

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.700
and started interviewing Mamie
while she was signing books,

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:24.930
signing baseballs, and so forth.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.590
The next thing I had to
do, I had to learn how

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.250
to play baseball,
because she was a pitcher,

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:36.330
the only professional
woman pitcher who played

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.300
with a man's team
ever in history.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.430
And I didn't know
much about baseball.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.790
Evan was learning.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.630
Ollie was helping him.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.190
So, guess what I did?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.650
I joined Evan's Little
League team [laughs].

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.190
Well, I didn't actually join.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.960
I talked to the coaches, and
I said, "Could I, you know,

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.750
learn some stuff from you?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.050
Like what?

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.320
Well, I need to know how
to throw the curve ball."

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.650
That was Mamie's favorite pitch.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.980
He said, "Well, we
can teach you that."

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.030
This man was on her
team, Hank Aaron.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.330
Maybe you've heard of him.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.630
Very famous.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.450
When she was with the
Indianapolis Clowns,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.940
Hank Aaron was her teammate.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:24.900
This guy, Satchel Paige,
okay, he taught her how

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.120
to throw the knuckleball.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.640
This man, Satchel
Paige, was so talented.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.120
He was very tall and skinny
like you can see here, okay?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.660
But he had pitches that
were so unbelievable

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.160
that they gave them names.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.080
They gave his pitches names.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:49.520
They used to call him [laughs]
the "Chocolate Whizbang,"

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.700
because he would throw
a pitch, and it would go

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:58.590
so slow it would drop
right down on the plate.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:59.890
No one could hit it.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.280
And in the next pitch he
threw was so wild, so fast,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.540
the call it the "bee
ball," because it was

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.850
so fast the batter
couldn't even see it.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.630
Okay. Getting back to Mamie.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:21.370
I worked out with Evan's team
for about a whole season.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.660
And at the end of the year,
they had a special event

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.980
where the parents
would play the kids,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.550
just a fun kind of a thing.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.050
So, then I got to
actually take the field.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.350
I was so excited.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:34.460
I was going to be able to
show off what I learned:

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.540
hitting, running.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.590
You know what the
coach said to me?

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.830
"Oh, here comes Michelle."

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.190
Parents, you have to throw
with your opposite hand,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.650
because you have an
advantage over your kids.

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.100
So, if you're a right-hander,

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.970
you have to do everything
with your left hand.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.080
If you bat right, you're
going to have to bat left.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.810
And they said to
me, "Mrs. Green,

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.030
[laughs] you can use
your right hand."

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:02.470
I was so bad, but I had a ball.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.860
And from Evan's coaches,
and from playing,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.370
I got to experience baseball.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.880
So, if you're writing about
something that you don't know,

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.100
try to experience it,
not just do interviews

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.030
and research in the library.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:17.660
Try to experience it
so it becomes your own.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.960
That's where the passion is.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.420
It's something that you really
know that you want to express.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.990
Okay, I toured around
with Mamie.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.100
Wherever she went to
baseball trading cards.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.200
We travelled all
around the area.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.730
And then it took me-- guess
how long-- to write the book.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:44.220
How long did it take for
me to do my research?

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.520
[Inaudible] Very good.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.820
It took me three years [laughs].

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.420
And when I wrote about Oscar
Micheaux, it took longer

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.700
than that, because I had
to travel to South Dakota

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.730
to see his soddy and to Kansas
so interview his family.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:57.800
So, writers often do
a lot of traveling.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.410
We take a lot of photographs.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.280
Now, the photographs
in this book--

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.400
And you'll see, because
everybody's getting a copy

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.510
of it and a baseball card.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.230
[ Applause ]

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.540
Let me show you this.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.280
It's called photo research.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.780
So, I got to go to the archives
and, also, I got to ask Mamie

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.670
for her family pictures.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.110
This is Mamie when
she was 12 years old.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.780
Isn't she gorgeous?

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.630
You see that?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.050
She went through her Bible and
pulled out old photographs.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.780
There's one here of her mother.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.800
Let me find it.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.350
And her best friend.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.210
Well, I can't find
it, but you'll see it

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.700
when you read the
book on your own.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.480
Okay. So, research can mean
interviewing, going to places

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.490
like the Library of Congress,
the National Archives,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.880
asking people what's
important to them,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.130
experiencing whatever
you can for your own,

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.360
because it becomes
what you know.

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.760
And that makes for
very vivid writing.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.580
Well, some of you
are saying, "Well,

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.880
I'm not that good in English."

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.180
In fact, I hate English.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.480
That doesn't matter.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.240
They have something called
"editors" that will help you

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.890
out with the small stuff.

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.300
Just write your story.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.950
Start with your family.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:23.020
Okay, so here's what I learned.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.630
Mamie used to play baseball

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.500
in her grandmother's front
yard in South Carolina.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.400
And they didn't even
have a real ball.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.830
You know what they used?

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:39.290
A rock with sticky tape,
masking tape, a rock.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.860
They didn't even
have a real bat.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.190
They used a tree branch.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.940
You read about this in the book.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.770
They didn't have
nice white bases.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.830
They had a broken pie plate
that they used for bases.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.820
And her uncle she
called "Bones,"

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.360
who was just a little bit older
than she was, taught her how

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.650
to pitch, and she loved it.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:00.730
Then her grandmother died
suddenly, and she had to move.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.030
Her mother was living

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.700
in Washington D.C. Mamie was
staying with her grandmother.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.570
She had to move from
place to place to place.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.610
And everywhere she went,
she wanted to find out

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.230
"How can I play baseball here?"

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.640
She moved to Long
Branch, New Jersey--

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.780
New Jersey's not
that far from here--

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.240
and she lived with
her aunt and uncle.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.610
There were no baseball
teams that girls could join,

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.710
and she didn't like softball.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.140
How many of you have
played softball

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.800
and know what softball is?

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.890
Softball is kind
of like baseball,

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.480
only you pitch differently,
and the ball is really big.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.780
She didn't like that.

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.550
She wanted to play hardball.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:38.180
So, guess what Mamie did?

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.440
She went to a-- It was
an all white boys' team

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.300
and would watch them.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.260
And they would ridicule her,

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.510
because she was a little black
girl, new to the community,

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.020
and she would watch
them from the fence.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.270
She found out that they were
the Police Athletic League,

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.570
PAL League.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.110
They still have them everywhere.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.490
So, guess what she did?

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.630
She walked over to
the precinct house.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.000
That's where all the law
enforcement people were,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.900
and she said, "Excuse me, I
want to be on the PAL team."

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.890
And they said, "You're
kidding, right?"

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:14.010
She says, "No, I love baseball,
and there's no baseball for me.

00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:16.270
I want to be on the PAL team."

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.990
And one officer said, "Well,
let me see what you can do."

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:23.300
So, he took her to the
back of the precinct house,

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.110
put a ball in her hand, and she
said, "Well, I like to pitch.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.470
I'm good at hitting,
but I love to pitch."

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.910
He said, "Well, show me
your fastball, then."

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.140
And they played for about 20
minutes right in the backyard

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.440
of the precinct house.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.280
And he said, "You know what?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.300
You can join the team."

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.130
But having the coach say
she could join the team

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.430
wasn't enough.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:49.200
She, actually, had [laughs]
try out with the boys.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.770
Now, what do you think
that must have been like?

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.520
She was, like, 12
years old then.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.030
And she shows up, and this
little red-haired boy started

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.570
ridiculing her until
she took to the mount.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.230
And nobody could hit her.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:04.850
[Laughs] Nobody could hit her.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.190
So, she went on to play with
this boy's team and led them

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.790
to the championship
for two years.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.090
Can you believe that?

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:12.390
At the age of 12.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.790
Now, let me tell you how
she got the name "Peanut."

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.730
Well, Mamie was only 5 foot 2.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.360
Willie Pearl is 5 foot 2?

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.160
[Laughs] So, when she stands
up later, you'll be able

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.010
to see how 5 foot 2--
I'm 5, 5 and a half.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.740
So, Mamie was shorter than me,

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.240
and she signed her
first contract

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.080
when she was 16 years old.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.360
She auditioned in Washington
D.C. at Banneker Field.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.420
I went to Banneker Field
across from Howard University

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:47.080
and saw the field
where she played,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.380
where she had her audition.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.500
Mamie, she was a
wonderful thing.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.260
She had a fine sense of
humor, a Southern drawl.

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.650
She called everybody
"Sugar" and "Honey."

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.330
She was really good to get along
with, and she told me stories

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.380
of what it was like to
travel with the men's team.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.850
Now, remember, she
was the only woman

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:11.940
on a professional men's team
that toured all year round.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.100
Her team was called the
"Indianapolis Clowns."

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.010
You see it on my hat.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.310
You see it here.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.910
In fact, I'll pass this
around so you can see it.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.660
They were called the "Clowns,"

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.990
not because they
didn't play well.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:34.740
Has anybody heard of the Harlem
Globetrotters basketball?

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:40.140
Well, these Indianapolis
Clowns were so talented that,

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.640
before the game would start,
they would warm up the crowd

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.180
by doing all kinds
of stunts and tricks,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.220
like the Harlem Globetrotters
did.

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.880
That's why they were
called the "Clowns."

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.800
I said, "Didn't you
have trouble being

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.100
on a team called the 'Clowns?'

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.820
Didn't you feel ridiculous?"

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.120
She said, "Oh, no.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.670
If you could see us play, you
could laugh all you wanted

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:01.970
to before the game started.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:03.270
But once the game started,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.350
we were dead serious
about what we did."

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.000
Indianapolis Clowns.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.200
Let me talk a little
bit about her jersey.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.560
By the way, this cover
was done by Kadir Nelson

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.000
when he was very young.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.500
Now Kadir is famous, famous.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.710
He does covers for
the The New Yorker.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.080
Adults, if you've seen his
latest work, it's just awesome.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.070
He does covers for The
New Yorker all the time.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.710
When he first showed me, he
did it as a large painting,

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.160
about the size of that poster.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.460
This was a large painting.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.450
And when I went to New York
to see it for the first time,

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.260
I said, "Oh my goodness, I
can't believe my book is being

00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:42.710
illustrated by this
talented person."

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.010
I showed it to Mamie.

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.450
You know what she said?

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:46.750
"Why are my feet so big?"

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.050
[laughter].

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.350
And the other thing.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.190
You can see it here
a little closely.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.260
She has a ponytail.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.410
Well, when he first drew her,
because he'd never met her,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:00.300
he drew it with just
her ball cap on.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.620
And she said, "Oh, no.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.010
My hair was long."

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.310
And it was long.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.030
She kept it long until she died.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.130
So, he had to add a little
ponytail stuck on there.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.280
You can barely see it,
[laughs] but it's there.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.410
And, yes, her feet do look big,
but that's his style [laughs].

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.770
She didn't like that very much.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.790
Mamie would travel with the
boys' team, with the men,

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.730
24 sweaty men on a bus.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:26.540
It wasn't like baseball
players today.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.350
They got paid pennies a day.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:32.850
It depended upon how many
people came to the game

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.830
and whether they won or lost.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.960
If they won, they
got more money.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.620
If they lost, the other
team got all the money.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.640
They would play and go on
a bus from place to place,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.040
especially in the South.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.140
And during that time in the
1950s-- I was born in '54--

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.440
she was actually playing then.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.130
I didn't know her--
African-Americans--

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:55.020
"Negroes" we were called then--
couldn't just eat anywhere.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.850
Couldn't just sleep anywhere.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.680
You've, probably, learned
that in your history classes

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.130
or social studies, right?

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.600
You know about Brown vs.
Board, things like that.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.500
You look like a very
smart group.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.540
So, she would travel
on this bus.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.380
The bus was so old and rickety

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.810
that sometimes it
would break down.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:13.160
They'd have to all get off
and push it to the next place.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.700
Or they didn't have enough
money to buy gas to get

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.740
to the next place that
they were playing.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.540
So, it wasn't like the glory
days now with Cal Ripken,

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.910
who just got married by
the way, from the Orioles.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.760
He made a lot of money.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.580
Who's watching the World
Series, by the way, anybody?

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:32.550
Who do you like?

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:33.860
[Inaudible] The Dodgers?

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:39.760
Oh. Well, you know, black
baseball has Dodgers.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.060
Anybody else?

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.400
Anybody like Boston?

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.230
[Laughs] Well, I like Boston,

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:56.740
because Boston adopted this book
Strong Right Arm, one summer,

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.320
and used it as a part of their
special promotions for kids.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.760
They gave away a lot of these
books, and Mamie got to go

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.540
up to Boston and throw out the
first pitch at a Boston game.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.230
Before the Nationals were
a team in Washington D.C.,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.830
when they were just
becoming a team

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.640
and they had their very first
game, the Washington Nationals.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.050
Guess who was there?

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:24.060
Mamie, me, and my son Evan.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.550
We sat right next to the mayor.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.330
Can you believe that?

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.080
Before the Nationals became
the Washington Nationals.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.670
You've seen their big
stadium, haven't you?

00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:35.510
I went to a rock
concert there [laughter].

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.830
Saw the Eagles [laughter].

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.480
Getting back to baseball
[laughter].

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.970
Writers can be crazy people.

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.010
I said, "Mamie, tell me
about your uniforms."

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.310
She said, "Oh my goodness.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.610
These uniforms."

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.410
This is an actual
replica, a copy,

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.410
of the kind of uniform
that Mamie wore.

00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.750
And if you feel the hat, it's
made out of the same material.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.340
It's wool.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.240
Now they have synthetic fabrics,
polyester, cotton blends.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.540
They're very comfortable.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.840
How many of you own a jersey?

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.040
Maybe you've gone to baseball
game and gotten a jersey?

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.580
They're expensive,
aren't they [laughs]?

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.960
But they're very nice.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.000
Well, back then,
they played in wool.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.170
It was a natural
fabric, but it itched.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:21.470
I said, "What was it like?

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.670
And if you see on the cover,
I just have the jersey on.

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.580
But they had wool pants
in the summertime.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.960
Why do you think
they played in wool?

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.260
Anybody have an idea?

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.050
Any grownup have an idea?

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.510
What do you think?

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:42.390
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.200
Well, that's part of the reason.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.700
Wool did get dirty.

00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.690
It lasted a long time.

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.050
Wool lasts a long time.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.390
It might itch, but
it doesn't wear

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:55.370
out like a cotton
jersey when you wash it.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.910
And they're going to be fooling
around in the dirt all the time.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:01.460
It's going to wear
very, very well.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.950
And I said, "Well, okay."

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:10.380
That's what book is called
before it's published,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.040
when it's typed up and
someone's editing it,

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.680
it's called a "manuscript".

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.190
When my editor saw the
manuscript, she said,

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.900
"It's not enough
to say it itched.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.200
Tell us how it itched.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.800
What did it feel like?"

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.900
And so I said, "It
itched like all get-out,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.740
which is what we would
say in the South."

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.530
She said, "No, I
don't like that."

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.540
She said, "How about"-- and
we tried different things.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.950
I took it back to Mamie.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.300
She said, "It just
itched [laughs]."

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.790
So, that's how it appears in
the book when you read it.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.090
It just itched.

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.360
You don't have to say
like, "It itched like this.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.660
It itched like that."

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:47.440
It just itched, but
it was durable.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.230
Now, ladies, I got to tell you.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.640
How many of you have brothers?

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.080
Okay. Older brothers,
younger brothers?

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.380
Older brothers?

00:36:55.380 --> 00:37:00.090
Okay. All the men cover
your ears [laughs].

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.190
No, not really.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.960
Thank you.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:08.830
She would be the only
woman on a bus with men.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.740
Men can be disgusting at
times [laughs], especially,

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.040
if they played a game.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.340
They're sweaty.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.640
They're hot.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:21.000
They like to blow off steam by
playing cards, maybe, you know,

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.300
drinking a little something
stronger than Coca-Cola.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.350
And Mamie was right
in the middle of it.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.900
Now, what do you think that
would happen when they had

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.920
to get ready to change their
uniforms or when they're

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.380
on the bus and had
to make a potty stop?

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.820
Keep in mind, they couldn't
go into the white bathrooms.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.330
Mamie had to go in the bushes.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.860
When you got to go, you've
got to go [laughter].

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.340
And when she changed her
uniform, all the men would have

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.670
to get off the bus so Mamie
could change into her uniform.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.540
I said, "Well, Mamie, what
was it like playing with men?"

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.450
She said, "Honey,
[laughs] I loved it.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.040
They treated me like a lady,
and they protected me."

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.990
And I got to meet some of
her old-timey baseball guys

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.950
in the baseball shop
and in other places.

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.250
And you know what?

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.550
They're just the
most polite people

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.660
that you ever want to meet.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.750
Now, before I read a
part of the chapter,

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:19.260
do you have any questions
about baseball, about Mamie,

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.750
about women playing in sports?

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.780
There is another pitcher.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.880
Her name is Ila Borders.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.660
A few years back,
she was, actually,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:30.460
pitching with a Minor
League way out in Colorado.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.080
And we still don't have
any women baseball players

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.190
in a professional sense
in this country, do we?

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.870
But we have Olympians.

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:39.550
We have soccer players.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.680
We have other women that
are doing wonderful,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.430
wonderful things in sports.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.730
Any questions for
me before I read?

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:46.030
Oh.

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:54.080
&gt;&gt; Did she ever get, like, booed
because she was the only woman?

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.380
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Did I ever get booed?

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:56.680
Did she ever get booed?

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, at, like, a game.

00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.280
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Oh, yes.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.580
There's a chapter in here.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:01.880
It's one of my favorites.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.180
I'm glad you brought that up.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.480
She's a really good pitcher.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.390
She could throw the fastball,
the knuckleball, the curveball--

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.550
all these different
kinds of pitches.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.640
She was playing in the
championships once,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.050
and this heavy hitter,
someone who's really,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.400
really good, came
up to the plate.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.250
And he started intimidating her.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.550
This is how she got her name.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.830
It's a good question, because
I forgot to tell you that.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.620
He stood up there and he
said, "Ain't no peanut

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.180
of a woman gonna strike me out."

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.480
He was tall.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.530
He was 6 feet something,
muscular.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.830
He's in the book.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.340
You'll see him.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.180
Mamie, that's all the
motivation she needed.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.740
She threw a few curveballs,
strike one.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.220
A knuckleball, strike two.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.220
Yes? [Inaudible]
I'm not telling you.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.860
You have to read it for
yourself [laughter].

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.370
That's a way of saying my
memory's a little shot.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:00.670
No.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:01.970
No [laughs], you
read it for yourself.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:04.140
It's, really, my
favorite chapter.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:11.760
She struck him out one by one,
and she said, "Call me Peanut,"

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.800
and she adopted it
as her nickname.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.100
Ballplayers are famous

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.380
for having nicknames,
and so was she, okay?

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.870
Other questions before I read?

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.350
About writing, about sports.

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.680
Oh, in the back.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.980
Yes.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:31.200
&gt;&gt; How long did she
play for with the boys?

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.500
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
How long did she play?

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.100
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: She played
for three years, and they went

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.250
to the championship every
single year that she played.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.450
A lot of people will tell
you the Negro leagues

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:42.130
weren't talented.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:45.690
You've, probably, heard of
this man, Jackie Robinson?

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:49.920
He was the very first colored
player, the first Negro,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.070
to cross over and play
for the white teams.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:55.250
And after him, little by little,

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.560
they started letting
black talent go

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.150
into the Major Leagues.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.830
And so all the good
players started going

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:05.090
to the white teams, and
the Negro Leagues died out,

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.400
because people would
want to pay good money

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.720
to see a black man play

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.950
on a white team even though
he was threatened with suicide

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.770
and death threats all the time.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:17.700
He was a college educated man.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.000
You should read Jackie's
[inaudible].

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.850
I got to meet his daughter once.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:25.150
Mamie and I were on tour,
and we got to sign books

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.640
and baseballs with her.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:28.940
Fascinating story.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.240
Was there another question?

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.170
&gt;&gt; So, in the three years
that Mamie has played

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.470
and when they went

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.790
to the championship have
they won the championship?

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.090
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Did
they win the championship?

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.390
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:46.690
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Yes, they did.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:47.990
Yes, they did.

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:49.290
There were two other
women, eventually,

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.500
that played black
baseball: Connie, Stone,

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.880
and another lady [laughs].

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.880
They're in the book, too.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.180
Their picture's in the book.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.240
When I met Mamie, they
had long since passed.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.790
Okay. Let me read
to you a little bit

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.790
of my favorite chapter called--

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:09.220
Oh, I was talking about the
talent in the Negro leagues.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.430
After Jackie Robinson
crossed over,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.810
many of the black
players started playing

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.550
on the white teams.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.490
No women, though.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.680
This chapter is called
"Carolina Summers."

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.580
Now, it's fall now.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.960
Pretend like it was a few
weeks ago when it was really,

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.760
really hot instead of
cold like it is today.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.570
I'm going to sit down now.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.600
I'm just going to
read a part of it.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.970
You can read the whole
thing for yourself.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.490
Sometimes I read it
with Mamie's accent,

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.790
but I'm not going
to do that today.

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:50.050
I'm going to use my own voice.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:52.740
Carolina Summers.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:55.450
Summers in South
Carolina where I live

00:42:55.450 --> 00:43:00.690
with my grandma Cendonia
Belton were almost hot

00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:02.370
but not city hot.

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:06.430
In Ridgeway, South Carolina,
in 1945, the heat had room

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.830
to move around, to
swirl off the dust,

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.280
and bother the sweet gum trees.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.340
It got carried around on
the backs of dragonflies

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:20.110
and dazzled the clothesline tea
towels into brilliant white.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:21.780
It settled on screen doors.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.300
It stuck to the back of necks.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.820
"Summer was too hot for
baseball," Grandma said.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.950
But every day, as soon as
she could [inaudible] away

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:34.020
from her watchful eye Leo,
and me, and the other kids

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.130
around would be out
in the yard to play.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.130
Leo-- We called him "Bones"--
was my uncle but close enough

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.010
in age to be my big brother.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.910
Here's that picture of her
grandmother Cendonia Belton

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:53.010
and Bones, her uncle,
from her family album.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:57.050
We marked out the bases every
day, like we didn't already know

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.720
that the pie plate was
first, the broken piece

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.520
of flour pot the second, and
the large root about three feet

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.150
from the lilac bush was third.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.220
And when we'd slide into home
plate, we'd always be sliding

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.450
over the smooth white
lid of a 5-gallon bucket

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:16.570
of King Cane sugar, the
sweetest in the South.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:17.870
You see, they didn't
need real bases

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:19.200
and real baseballs and things.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.660
They used their imagination.

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:26.500
I was 10, and it was
my job to get the ball.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.160
For that, I didn't have to go to
no dry goods store 2 miles away

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.080
or to Thorntree School to beg.

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:35.370
No-legs Levy [assumed spelling],
our principal, for one--

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.130
That was his nickname,
"No-legs Levi."

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:43.520
All I had to do was find a nice
size rock and wrap it round

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.120
and round with sticky tape
until it had a good heft.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.530
They let me get the ball,

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.240
because I was always
the one throwing it.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:53.230
I loved everything
about baseball,

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.940
but it was pitching
I loved the best.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.820
Oh, sure, I could run the
bases faster than a jackrabbit.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.840
But nothing made me grin on
the inside like pitching.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.870
I like the standing up tall.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.830
The looking the other fellow
in the eye to size him

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.250
up for a changeup or a fastball.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.160
And then the pitch.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.520
And I didn't pitch
like a girl, either.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.330
Bones made sure of that.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:20.950
Not an underhanded fling of the
ball, but a surefire, windup,

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:24.070
coming-right-at-you pitch
smack dab over the plate.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.010
One that let him know
I meant business,

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:30.170
one that could tear the bark
right off the tree branch the

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:33.000
other fellow was
using for a bat.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.680
Grandma said that pitchers
mound was no place for a girl.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.980
Even my best friend, Mary Alice
Quails [assumed spelling],

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:43.340
who was pretty and all
the boys liked her--

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.510
She didn't hold any
truck with baseball.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.020
But baseball was what I liked.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:51.770
The only thing better
was a package from home.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:53.770
Ridgeway was where I
lived with grandma,

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:59.010
but my real home was Washington
D.C. Just about every month,

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.600
I'd get a package from my Mama.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.920
There's a picture of
her beautiful mother.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.020
I'd get a package from
my Mama who lived there

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:10.390
and worked hard to support me.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.690
Skipping forward.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.530
But Grandma's house in
Ridgeway was big enough

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.930
to hold all my dreams.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.230
It had 18 rooms.

00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:21.500
It sat on 81 acres.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:26.400
It had fruit trees of every
kind: plums, peaches, pears,

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.600
running streams, and no fences.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.490
Maybe I dreamed such big dreams
because there was plenty of room

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:37.140
to spread them out in
Ridgeway, room for them to run,

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.610
and stretch, and grow.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:41.990
I remember thinking the city
was no place for big dreams.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:43.510
They'd get all cramped
up and bent,

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.540
like trying to throw a
fastball with your arm cocked.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.260
In my room, in Ridgeway, I could
look out into the night sky

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:57.540
and see starlight, a wide open
sky where my dreams could run.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:01.420
Once, I saw a shooting star.

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.100
God must like baseball,
I imagine.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.810
He's got a fastball
as good as mine.

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:09.510
And that's the end
of Carolina Summers.

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:15.750
[ Applause ]

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.490
Now, you might note
that the big is written

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:21.510
in what's called first person.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.360
Who knows what first
person is, or who can guess?

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.810
Someone who hasn't
answered before.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.800
&gt;&gt; It's, like, the
first person view, like,

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.550
your own view kind of,
like, that person's view.

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:35.850
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Right, right.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:38.580
You see, I travelled with Mamie
so much and got to know her

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:42.550
so much, she called
me her "daughter."

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.280
She adopted me, because,
everywhere she went,

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.750
I went to learn more about her.

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.530
We went to ballgames
together, practiced together.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:52.650
She tried to show me how
to throw a curveball.

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:55.340
I said, "Don't waste
your time [laughs]."

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:58.290
But first person is
when the narrator,

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.890
the person who's
telling the story,

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.530
is talking in their own voice.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:05.640
Instead of saying "She did
this," it would be "I did this."

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.700
Now, I wrote it in
first person, because,

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.570
when I sat down after all
the research that I did,

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:15.650
the first line that came to
me was in Mamie's own voice.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.310
So, it's called a
biography, because it's really

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.040
about her life, but it
doesn't quite fit the mold

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.120
of a real biography,
because I used Mamie's voice,

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.610
her way of speaking.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:28.310
It's gotten me in a little
bit of trouble, because,

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:30.250
when they categorize
it in libraries,

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.630
they don't know how
to categorize it.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.930
Is it biography?

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.230
Is it fiction?

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.530
What is it?

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:36.830
Well, who cares?

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.630
It's a good read [laughs], and
you'll get a chance to read it.

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:44.570
You'd also see a baseball
that's of me in Mamie's clothes,

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.470
and there's a description
of the book on the back.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.040
It's a trading card, and my
son Brian, the photographer,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.370
took it right on my back deck.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.700
So, see, we have families too,
and we do crazy things together.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.050
What else can I tell you?

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.070
I have a website.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:05.370
It's just my name .com,
michelleygreen.com, so, adults,

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:09.270
if you can remember,
it's user friendly.

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.490
It's got pictures of Mamie
on it, pictures of my family,

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.880
a video from my son, another
music video from my other son,

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.630
and a video about my
dad, a Tuskegee Airman.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.850
Now, today, when I leave here,
I drive down to Fredericksburg,

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.910
Virginia to be in
a harvest festival.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.630
I'm representing
the Tuskegee Airmen

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:29.520
in an exhibit there
for four days.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.860
So, I told them "I'm coming
in a baseball uniform,

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.800
but I'll change into my Kathy's
[assumed spelling] once I get

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.100
there [laughs]."

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:39.200
So, if you're in town, or
if you're free, Saturday,

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.730
harvest festival, Shannon
Airport, and you'll learn

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.030
about Tuskegee Airmen.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.610
They have a P-51,
which my father flew.

00:49:46.610 --> 00:49:48.690
They have a panoramic
movie that's going

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:50.510
to describing those
kinds of things.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:51.920
And like I said, I'm
writing his book.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.220
It's called "High Flight."

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.170
There's another website
called highflight.academy,

00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.960
but if you go to my website,
it'll link you directly

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.130
to the other website, as well.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:04.510
Any more questions?

00:50:04.510 --> 00:50:09.280
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.580
Excellent [inaudible].

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:21.420
&gt;&gt; My grandma was an
author, and she wrote a book

00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.120
about my dad and uncle.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.420
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Great.

00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:25.720
&gt;&gt; And she put it on Amazon.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.020
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: On Amazon.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.110
You see, when I was first
writing, there was no Amazon.

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:32.050
I lived in the dinosaur
age, by the way.

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:33.580
I have a little secret for you.

My birthday is coming
up, November 5.

Anybody want to take a guess?

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.020
How old am I going to be?

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.320
Don't hurt my feelings.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.950
Remember, I have a
94-year old mother.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:49.010
How old do you think I am?

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.300
Take a guess.

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.600
&gt;&gt; Sixty-seven [laughter]?

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.900
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Actually,

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.200
you're not that far
off [laughs].

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.500
&gt;&gt; Sixty-two?

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:58.880
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: I'm 63.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.490
I'll be 64 next month.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.790
Congratulations.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.090
Yes?

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:04.390
&gt;&gt; Sixty-five?

00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:05.690
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Oh, he guessed 63.

00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.870
I'm 63. I'll be 64
in a couple of weeks.

00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:09.170
Yes?

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.470
&gt;&gt; My birthday's November 24.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:11.770
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Really?

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:13.070
Congratulations.

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:14.370
How old will you be, 67?

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:15.670
&gt;&gt; Ten.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:16.970
&gt;&gt; Ten [laughter].

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.950
Okay. The same age Mamie was
when she started playing ball

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:20.860
in her grandmother's backyard.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.160
Any other questions?

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.670
Adults? Oh, let me tell you
a little bit about the movie.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:25.970
I'm sorry.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.270
Go ahead.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:31.460
&gt;&gt; Back to Mamie's comment was
she's been waiting her whole

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.760
life for somebody to ask her.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.060
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Right.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.300
&gt;&gt; What does she
think of the story?

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.600
I'm curious.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.900
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.760
Once I got the research down,
the writing was really fast.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:44.400
Once I got all the ideas, I
sat down, and I knocked it

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.700
out in a couple of weeks.

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.000
So, I took my manuscript
to Mamie and said,

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.510
"Would you please read this
before I send it off to my agent

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.180
to be published and
to be edited."

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.900
And you know what
she said to me?

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:57.290
"I don't want to read it.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:58.990
I want to be surprised."

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:01.950
I said, "Mamie, [laughs] I
might have made some mistakes."

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:04.020
She said, "Honey, you know
me better than anybody.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:08.470
I don't want to read
it until it comes out."

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:10.560
So, when the book finally
arrived in its little box.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.080
The first books were
in hardback like this.

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:17.660
They don't make the hardbacks
anymore, only made paperbacks.

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:18.960
Thank goodness that they do.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.260
Oh, by the way.

00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:25.330
If you want to listen to
it, it's on audible.com.

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:30.860
They read the whole book in
Mamie's accent on Audible.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.740
And by the way, Audible
is running a special now,

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.380
so you can get it for free.

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.390
So, ask your parents or your
caregivers to download it.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.910
Your question again?

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:46.110
&gt;&gt; What Mamie thought
of the story.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.070
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: So,
when the book came out,

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:49.390
you know what she did?

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.210
She cried.

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.510
She cried.

00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:54.630
And when we go out
on tour together,

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.320
they would introduce
her and introduce me,

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.820
she'd call me her "daughter."

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:03.080
And often, she would
just break down in tears.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.760
My own mother does
that, too, sometimes.

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.170
I think she's crying
now [laughs].

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:11.050
That's, okay, you
can cry [laughs].

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.990
I cry all the time [laughs].

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.850
Now, let me tell you just
a bit about the movie.

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:18.810
It's called "Throw Like a Girl."

00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:21.800
Where did that expression
come from do you think?

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.680
Anybody want to guess?

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.960
You. [Inaudible] Yes, when
a guy was making fun of her.

00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.780
And you probably
have heard this.

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:35.080
You're just a girl.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.380
What can you do?

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.920
You throw like a girl.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.570
Well, we're proud to
throw like a girl.

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.410
If you can strike people
like Hank Baylis is the name.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:46.420
Hank, if you can throw
people out like Hank Baylis,

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:50.140
I'd be glad to throw
as good as that.

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:52.150
Throw Like a Girl.

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.160
It won an award for best script

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.030
in last February,
this past year.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.060
I got to go to New
York with my sister

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.050
and see the script
writer, a female,

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.990
Laurie Lahey [phonetic]
wrote the script.

00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.340
It was her first time
doing a screenplay,

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.250
and she won an Athena
Award for best screenplay.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.230
Now, they're in the middle
of casting it right now.

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.870
Can I drop a little nugget?

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:20.470
Guess who might be cast?

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:21.770
Octavia Spencer.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:23.070
Do you know her?

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:26.200
She's a famous actress,
and there will be others.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.580
So, keep your fingers crossed,
and I'll keep everybody in touch

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.130
with the Library of Congress.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:32.430
Who knows?

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.260
We might need some extras to
sit in the crowd, you know?

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.730
We'll think about you.

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.030
So, it's introduction.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:41.140
It's taken 10 years for
the film to come this far.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.070
Three tries.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:45.210
It's hard to get into films.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:46.510
My son is a filmmaker.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:47.920
It's hard to get into films.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.150
It's hard producing a film.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:54.110
But, like Mamie, we're proud
to say, "We're trying."

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:56.560
And I think it's really
going to come to fruition.

00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.110
I think it's going to happen.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:59.410
Anything else?

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:00.710
No?

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:02.010
&gt;&gt; Last question.

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.310
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
Last question.

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:07.390
&gt;&gt; How come she cried
when the book came out?

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:09.810
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: She
cried out of gratitude.

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:11.320
She cried out of gratitude.

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.890
Someone had, finally,
written her story, and,

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:19.070
because of that book, I'm
so proud of that book.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:23.280
Because nobody knew who
Mamie was, and now--

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.520
Her heart gave out on
her-- before she passed,

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:31.540
she has what's called
a "legacy."

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:33.730
Who knows what a legacy is?

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.730
&gt;&gt; When, like, a lot of
people know about you.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.030
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: When a
lot of people know about you.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.460
It's what you leave behind.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:43.490
So, she knows that, even though
she may not be with us anymore,

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:48.220
her story is still being
enjoyed by people like you.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.100
Something else that
happened with this book

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.040
that was really amazing.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.360
Authors sometimes
get fan letters.

00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:58.440
It's one of my favorite
thing to get a fan letter

00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.780
in the mail or a Tweet.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:01.530
I get Tweets now.

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:02.900
Yes, I Twitter.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.400
I Facebook.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.410
I Tumblr. I do all that stuff.

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:12.490
Some of the comments that I've
gotten are from women my age

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:15.080
and younger who said, "The
reason I love your book is

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.940
because I wanted to play
ball when I was little.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.020
I wanted to play ball.

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:21.500
They wouldn't let me.

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.800
We played softball.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.590
I wanted to play hardball,
and we weren't able to.

00:56:27.590 --> 00:56:29.560
So, thank you very
much for showing us

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.720
that women can do
whatever they please

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.360
if they put their mind to it."

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.970
That and a little luck.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:37.710
Let me just say this one
thing, because I know

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:39.600
that in the exhibit
someone mentioned

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:42.970
that the All-American
Girls League was there.

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:48.010
Uniforms? Well, Mamie tried
out for the All-American Girls.

00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:49.310
She tried to.

00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:50.610
It's in the book.

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:51.910
I won't tell you what happened.

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:53.830
Read it for yourself, but
she and her best friend went

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:59.510
down to the field-- Actually,
it was in Virginia-- to try out.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:02.430
So, when the All-American
Girls were finally inducted

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:04.910
into Cooperstown-- That's where
all the baseball memorabilia

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:07.850
and baseball hall of fames
in Cooperstown, New York.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:12.260
When they took the All-American
Girls and inducted them

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:17.510
into the Cooperstown Museum,
they invited Mamie to come.

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.380
What did Mamie say?

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.210
What did Mamie say?

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:26.880
"No way. You didn't
want me then.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.340
I don't want you
now" [laughter].

00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:32.180
So, she didn't go be a
part of the grand opening

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:37.030
when they had the league of
their own team inducted there.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.160
But there's some good news.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:43.060
Ollie-- We call him
"Ollie Bug"--

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.180
took Evan, my baseball-playing
son to Cooperstown,

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:48.830
and I got this phone call.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.500
They're selling A Strong Right
Arm in Cooperstown [laughs].

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.820
So, you see, Mamie got
her justice [inaudible].

00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:57.950
Oh, that's it.

00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.510
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Thank
you very much.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.210
[ Applause ]

00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:06.490
Thank you all so much for coming
to the Library of Congress

00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:10.430
for exploring Baseball
Americana and for listening

00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:12.830
to our awesome author talk with
Michelle Y. Green [laughs].

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:14.130
How about we say "Thank you

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.190
for getting us all
a copy of the book"?

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:17.490
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green: Yup.

00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:18.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:20.090
&gt;&gt; Michelle Y. Green:
You're welcome.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.580
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Thanks,
everybody.
