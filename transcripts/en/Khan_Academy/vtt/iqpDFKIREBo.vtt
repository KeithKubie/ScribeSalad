00:00:01.085 --> 00:00:05.866
So we're asked, "how many liters of
soda do we have for the party?"

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:08.337
And they give us all of this other
information.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:12.907
I encourage you to pause this video
and think about which of this information

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:17.049
you actually need to answer this first
question and then try to answer the question:

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:20.879
"How many liters of soda do we have
for the party?" So pause now.

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:23.501
Let's look at this information:

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:29.159
"20 people are coming to the party."
This doesn't let us know how many liters we actually have.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.358
So we know we can ignore this.

00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:38.779
"We have purchased 5 bottles of soda for the party."
Well, this seems useful - we're going to have 5 bottles of soda.

00:00:38.837 --> 00:00:54.442
So that's 1... 2... 3.... 4.... and 5 bottles of soda.
That's this piece of information right over here.

00:00:54.523 --> 00:00:59.694
If only we now knew how much soda is in each bottle.

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:04.373
"The party will last for 3 hours." This has nothing
to do with how many liters of soda we have.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:12.785
"Each bottle has 2 liters of soda." This
is interesting.

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:18.719
This is 2 liters... this is 2 liters... this is 2 liters...
this is 2 liters... and that is 2 liters.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.227
If we wanted to figure out the total number 
of liters of soda we have,

00:01:24.277 --> 00:01:31.919
We have 5 bottles, and each of them are
2 liters each. So we have 5 times 2

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:34.423
And what is that equal to?

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:40.926
5 times 2 is the same thing as
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2

00:01:41.258 --> 00:01:50.527
You have five 2's added together.
Let me write this down...

00:01:50.597 --> 00:01:56.988
Which is equal to: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 
5 times 2 is 10.

00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:01.542
We have 10 liters of soda for the party.
We're able to answer it without even looking

00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:06.027
at this last one. This last one tells us how
many bottles of soda we had for the picnic last week.

00:02:06.198 --> 00:02:10.967
which doesn't seem related at all
to our current party.
