00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
I have a problem here
from my cousin.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.410
Let's see what it says.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.450
It says Milwaukee, Wisconsin
is directly west of Grand

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.630
Haven, Michigan, on opposite
sides of Lake Michigan.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.020
So let me draw that.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:19.535
So if we say that this
right here is Milwaukee.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.760
It's due west of Grand
Haven, Michigan.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.110
So if I were to draw-- let
me draw a horizontal line.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.145
We're going over water so
let me do it in blue.

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:37.710
It's due west of Grand
Haven, Michigan.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.640
You know, you go straight east.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.240
If I were to go straight
east, I would get to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.870
Grand Haven, Michigan.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.430
Which is right here.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.540
Let me just label that, g.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.350
All right.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.840
On a foggy night, a law
enforcement boat leaves

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.190
from Milwaukee on a
course of 105 degrees.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.570
The hardest part of these
problems, in my opinion, is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.970
really just trying to figure
out the convention

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.300
they're using.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.560
When they say a course of 105
degrees, what does that mean?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.860
What direction is it?

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.330
And I checked with my cousin,
and her book says that in, I

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.710
guess in the boating world,
the course is how many

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.800
degrees clockwise you're
going, of due north.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.230
So due north is 0 degrees.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.370
So 105 degrees.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.590
So due north would
be 0 degrees.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.310
Due north would be--
that's 0 degrees.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.100
So he's going 105 degrees
clockwise of that.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.090
So if we 105 degrees-- so
he's going 105 degrees.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.060
So that's like 105 degrees.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.700
Something like that.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.090
He's going 105 degrees.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.860
And I'll do him in magenta.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.160
His course is 105 degrees.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.100
So that's 105 degrees
clockwise of due north.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.120
And what is that-- oh, it's
like my screen just backed up.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.030
So what is that angle, in kind
of what we're familiar with?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.970
Well, this would be 90
degrees right here.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.520
Going here.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.220
And then he goes
15 more degrees.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.770
So in kind of unit circle
terms, this would be

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.040
negative 15 degrees.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.540
Or if we wanted to figure out
the angle of this vertex right

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.710
here, that would be 90, and
then we'd go another 15.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.530
So this angle right here
is going to be what?

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.080
It's going to be 15 degrees.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.530
Because he said his
course is 105.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.700
So 90 plus 15 is 105.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.610
So how much south he's going
of, kind of, straight

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.590
west-east, is 15 degrees.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.990
This whole thing is 105.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.880
OK, let me keep
reading the problem.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.660
He leaves from Milwaukee at a
course of 105 degrees at the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.910
same time that a small
smuggling craft steers a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.820
course of 195 degrees
from Grand Haven.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.710
195 degrees.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.510
So once again, due
north is 0 degrees.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.560
And this guy's going 195.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.940
So we figure-- this is
just a convention.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.910
You figure out-- well,
he's going 195 degrees

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.260
clockwise of due north.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.350
So 195 degrees is going to be--
let's see, it's going to be

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.790
a 180 degrees and then some.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.070
It's going to be like that.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.350
So his course is going to
look something like this.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.090
His course is going to
look something like that.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.770
And let's see if we can
figure out what this

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.870
angle right here is.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.180
Because we, as you can kind of
see where this is going, we're

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.820
trying to figure out probably
the size of this triangle,

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.330
if I had to guess.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
I haven't even read the
whole problem yet.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.490
Let's see.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.150
So he's going 195 degrees.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.690
So if we were to drop,
well, like here.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.450
This right here is a 180
degrees, to go clockwise from

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.530
straight up to straight down.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.950
This is 180.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.480
And so he went 195.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.515
So this is going to be-- that's
going to be 15 degrees.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.750
And if this angle is 15
degrees, what is this

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.960
angle going to be?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.050
Well, this entire angle
is 90 degrees, right?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.790
It's kind of the third
quadrant when we're thinking

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.330
in unit circle terms.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.810
So this angle right
here is going to be 90

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.100
minus this 15 degrees.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.200
So what's 90 minus 15?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.930
It's 75, right?

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.885
75 degrees.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.890
And if we wanted to convert
his, kind of, course angles

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.220
into unit circles-- you know,
with unit circles, you start

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.980
here and you go all the
way around this way.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.720
So I think you would get
something like 255 degrees.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.020
But anyway.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.200
So we figured out that this
angle is 15 degrees, this

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.100
angle is 75 degrees.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.380
What's this angle going to be?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.260
This angle is going to be--
these all have to add

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.290
up to 180, right?

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.255
So this is going to be
180 minus 15 minus 75.

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:41.250
And what's that?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.550
That's 180 minus 90.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.210
So 180 minus 90 is 90 degrees!

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.600
So this angle here
is 90 degrees.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.060
It's a right angle.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.770
It's a right angle.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.610
Interesting.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.210
OK, so what do they tell us?

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.660
They tell us the law
enforcement boat

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.580
averages 23 knots.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.710
So he's traveling in this
direction at 23 knots.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.790
All right, that's a little bit
faster than 23 miles per hour.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.790
And collides with the
smuggling craft.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.850
What was the smuggling
boat's average speed?

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.940
So they both leave their
respective sites at the

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.210
same time, and they
both collide, right?

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.420
So the time they
traveled is the same.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.200
Let's call that time, t.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.640
Right?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.060
I don't know.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.890
They both left at the same
time and it took some

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.780
time for them to collide.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.230
So let's say that the time
between when they left and

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.340
the time they collided is t.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.350
So how far did the
patrol boat travel?

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.590
Well, he traveled at a speed of
23 knots, and it took him time,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.410
t, to get to the collision.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.105
So the distance he
traveled is 23t.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.570
Speed times time is
equal to distance.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.900
So the length of
this side is 23t.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.260
Similarly, this guy, we
don't know his speed.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.650
Let's call it, I don't know.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.240
Let's call it x.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.390
His speed is x.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.160
But the distance he
travels is x times t.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.920
x times t, right?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.110
So that's the length
of this side.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.850
So let's see if we can
figure out what x is.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.340
So what do we know?

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.900
We know a lot about this.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.510
We know this is a right
triangle, et cetera.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.225
We know this angle.

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:23.190
So if we wanted to solve
for xt and use this 23t

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.130
information, let's see.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.650
We know-- look at this angle.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.230
If we use the 75 degrees, we
know the opposite angle.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.950
The opposite side, sorry.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.120
Which is 23t.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.600
And we know the adjacent
side, which is xt.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.120
So let me write SOHCAHTOA here.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.900
So what deals with
opposite and adjacent?

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.480
Well, that's tangent, right?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.500
TOA.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:59.130
So if we say the tan of 75
degrees is going to be equal to

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.340
the opposite side-- 23t-- over
the adjacent side-- that's this

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.170
side, opposite over
adjacent-- xt.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.270
Well, the t's
cancel out, right?

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.425
The t's cancel out.

00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:14.460
And let's see if we
can solve for x.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.320
Multiply x times both sides.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.450
You get x tangent of
75 is equal to 23.

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.540
And then divide both sides by
the tan of 75 and you get x is

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:33.610
equal to 23 divided by the
tangent of 75 degrees.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.840
And so that's our answer.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.480
And if I had to-- well,
actually, I have-- let's see.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.950
Tangent of 75 degrees.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.350
I don't have a calculator
in front of me.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:43.285
You could calculate it.

00:07:43.285 --> 00:07:47.240
It's actually going to be
a pretty high number.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.200
So you could try
to fit, you know.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.760
If you have a calculator,
just type in 75 degrees.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.230
Take the tangent of it, and
perform this calculation.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.790
But we've essentially
solved this problem.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.110
I'll see you in the next video.
