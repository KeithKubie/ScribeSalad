00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.819
Female: Upon first
hearing that Salman Khan

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.359
would be speaking at
Castilleja during Global week,

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.222
my mind immediately went to
the famous Bollywood actor

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.212
who goes by the same name.

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:16.622
After seconds [paused],

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:18.944
I recognized the absurdity of the thought,

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:21.132
and realized who actually was coming.

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:22.978
While the Salman Khan, who joins us today,

00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:25.312
might not possess flashy dance moves,

00:00:25.312 --> 00:00:27.776
he is nevertheless a
world-renowned movie star

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:29.525
in his own right.

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:32.877
Salman, or Sal Khan, is the
founder of the Khan Academy,

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:34.979
a not-for-profit
organization that provides

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.079
a high-quality education for free

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.396
to anyone with internet access,

00:00:39.396 --> 00:00:44.128
regardless of location,
social stratification, or age.

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:46.653
Sal has recorded over
1,000 YouTube videos,

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:49.066
available at khanacademy.org,

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.571
covering everything from
arithmetic and algebra

00:00:51.571 --> 00:00:56.630
to calculus, physics,
chemistry, biology, and finance.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.900
Sal personally helps more
than 70,000 students a month

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.652
from all over the world,
my family members included.

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:05.538
Whenever my sisters or I have a problem,

00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:07.319
the first thing my parents tell us to do

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.898
is visit khanacademy.org.

00:01:09.898 --> 00:01:12.775
Sal has successfully helped
me study for the SAT,

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:14.943
helped my older sister
prepare for the MCAT,

00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:16.898
and help my younger sister understand

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:19.237
difficult chemistry concepts.

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:21.024
My mom even frequently visits the website

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:22.900
to learn more about the credit crisis,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.093
and to brush up on her
differential calculus.

00:01:26.093 --> 00:01:29.022
Before quitting his day
job in September of 2009

00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.754
to work on the Khan Academy full-time,

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.923
Sal was a Senior Research Analyst

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:36.235
at a Bay Area investment fund.

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:38.822
He had previously held
positions in venture capital,

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:41.613
engineering, and product management.

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:44.231
He received his MBA from
Harvard Business School

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:46.172
where he was a student body president,

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:48.776
holds a master's degree and
a bachelor of science degree

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:51.788
in electrical engineering
and computer science,

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:53.579
and has a bachelor of science degree

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.983
in mathematics from MIT,

00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:58.313
where he was President
of the Class of 1998.

00:01:58.313 --> 00:02:00.949
What started as a way to
help his younger relatives

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:03.340
and family friends
understand course material

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.915
and do well in school,

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:06.687
has turned into a global sensation,

00:02:06.687 --> 00:02:08.614
touching students from San Francisco,

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:11.852
Switzerland, Uganda, and beyond.

00:02:11.852 --> 00:02:14.249
He received a 2009 Tech
Award in Education,

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.912
an award that honors innovators
from around the world

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:20.296
who apply technology to benefit humanity.

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:23.180
He has also appeared on the
Rick Sanchez Show on CNN

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.042
to explain the credit crisis,

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:27.704
spoken on NPR's "All Things Considered,"

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:32.020
and been interviewed in a recent
San Francisco Chronicle article.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.874
In this article, Sal was quoted saying,

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:36.262
"With so little effort on my own part,

00:02:36.262 --> 00:02:40.841
"I can empower an unlimited
amount of people for all time.

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.795
"I can't imagine a better use of my time."

00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:49.459
Sal's dedication to educating
and enlightening the world,

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.287
free of cost, has inspired
[and aided] millions of people.

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:55.935
It is my pleasure to introduce Sal Khan.

00:02:55.935 --> 00:02:59.134
(applause)

00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:03.936
But first, he'll be showing
a video before he comes up.

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:22.910
(light music)

00:05:07.153 --> 00:05:10.525
(applause)

00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:17.525
Sal: Thank you for having me here.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:22.020
It's incredibly exciting
on a whole set of levels.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.148
I think the first thing that
makes it really exciting

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:26.979
to be here, in particular,
at Castilleja ...

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.264
Many of y'all may know it.

00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:29.958
Some of y'all might not know it.

00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.631
This was the first place
where I was taken seriously.

00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.299
3 or 4 years ago, I was just this guy

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:36.523
working at a hedge fund,

00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:38.296
who had this little
software that barely worked,

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.547
and I had a couple of videos on YouTube.

00:05:40.547 --> 00:05:43.806
I wanted to get people, other than people

00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:47.685
who I was maybe related to,
to actually use it. (laughter)

00:05:47.685 --> 00:05:52.367
I approached Ryanne ... I guess
y'all call her Ms. Saddler.

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:53.701
She was the site director

00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:56.198
for the Peninsula Bridge
here at Castilleja.

00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:57.536
I tried to convince her.

00:05:57.536 --> 00:05:58.780
"Hey, why don't y'all use this

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.903
"in the Peninsula Bridge Program?"

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:01.992
She was the first person
who essentially took

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:04.093
the Khan Academy seriously.

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:06.163
The talk I want to give today,

00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:10.300
is really about how things can
start small, and how an individual,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.557
with the tools that we
have on hand right now,

00:06:12.557 --> 00:06:15.807
can do pretty far-reaching things.

00:06:15.807 --> 00:06:18.514
You really can't underestimate the power

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:21.849
of those first few people
who believe in something,

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.902
and help you take it to the next level,

00:06:23.902 --> 00:06:27.423
and make you feel like
it's a legitimate project.

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:29.698
My first visit to Castilleja
was a very positive one,

00:06:29.698 --> 00:06:31.705
and actually played a very crucial role

00:06:31.705 --> 00:06:33.647
in what you saw in that video.

00:06:33.647 --> 00:06:35.525
Actually, Ryanne is
now on the board of ...

00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.266
We have a 2-person board where ...

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:41.108
2-person board, and I'm
essentially the company.

00:06:41.108 --> 00:06:43.587
(laughter) It's a fairly
small organization,

00:06:43.587 --> 00:06:45.953
which is another theme I want to touch on

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:49.333
throughout this--what I want
to be more of a conversation

00:06:49.333 --> 00:06:51.499
than a lecture or a talk.

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:53.552
One thing I want ... set the ground rules.

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:54.750
Raise your hand.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:55.819
If something comes to mind,

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.170
or if you don't agree with something,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.607
or if you just get
inspired, raise your hand,

00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:01.273
and I'd be happy to address something,

00:07:01.273 --> 00:07:04.169
or if I say something that confuses you.

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:08.105
The other reason why I'm
incredibly excited about being here

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:10.742
is, 1, I love the theme of Global Week,

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:12.796
especially that it's peace.

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.426
It's this notion that is ...

00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:18.099
I think most people are afraid
to talk about things like peace

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:22.399
because it's such an audacious goal.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.822
You almost feel that if you start thinking

00:07:23.822 --> 00:07:25.864
in terms of world peace,
you're destined to fail.

00:07:25.864 --> 00:07:27.497
We can get inspired here today,

00:07:27.497 --> 00:07:28.736
but then when we turn on the news,

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.472
we're going to see people
talk angrily at each other.

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:34.347
We're going to probably
find out about some bombing,

00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:37.343
or whatnot, in some place in the world.

00:07:37.343 --> 00:07:40.244
It's very hard to tackle this subject.

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:43.395
I think it's a very impressive
thing to be tackling.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:47.797
The other reason why it's incredibly
interesting to talk to y'all

00:07:47.797 --> 00:07:53.741
is I think the people in this
room are in a unique position.

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:54.751
When I say in a unique position,

00:07:54.751 --> 00:07:57.400
a unique position as
a function of your age

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.044
and a function of where we are in history,

00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.588
that I think for the first time,

00:08:01.588 --> 00:08:06.417
I can legitimately tell y'all
that you are in a position

00:08:06.417 --> 00:08:09.749
to do something at least as
good as the Khan Academy.

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:11.569
We don't even know where the
Khan Academy is going to go,

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.307
but the tools now exist.

00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:17.005
If 20 years ago, someone
like me was giving a talk

00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:20.557
to myself when I was your age,

00:08:20.557 --> 00:08:23.251
and they were to say, "Hey,
you could change the world,"

00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:24.792
I would've rolled my eyes.

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:28.174
The best I could've done is
maybe had a signature campaign,

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.196
or sent a letter to a politician,

00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:32.897
or volunteered in my local community,

00:08:32.897 --> 00:08:34.557
which all would've been great,

00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:36.708
but they wouldn't have
reached the threshold

00:08:36.708 --> 00:08:38.922
of changing the world.

00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:45.507
Now, I can stand here, and
legitimately tell y'all about my story,

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:47.709
and hopefully through
my story you'll realize

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:50.844
that you also have the tools at hand

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:55.260
to touch the world in ways
that we can't possibly imagine.

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.091
It really is a unique
opportunity based on the age

00:08:58.091 --> 00:09:00.984
and your specific life experience.

00:09:00.984 --> 00:09:03.164
I think y'all are in a
better position to do it

00:09:03.164 --> 00:09:05.910
than large corporations
with millions of dollars,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:11.365
or large governmental agencies,
or the UN, or whoever.

00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:13.760
I think the people in this
room, using technology,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.245
maybe the type of technology
I use with the Khan Academy,

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:18.310
or maybe other things,
really have the potential

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.869
to do amazing things.

00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:21.582
What I want to talk about,

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:25.275
or give you the outline of this talk,

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:27.716
I'm going to tell you the
story of Khan Academy,

00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:31.768
but the whole point of
telling you this story

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:35.274
is to put yourself in my shoes as someone

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:38.099
who's doing something
interesting for them,

00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:41.520
rewarding on a very small scale.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.023
I want you to take in the
experience of how it happens,

00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:48.106
how it's a very organic,

00:09:48.106 --> 00:09:49.668
that it's not like I
just sat down one day,

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:52.649
and I wrote on paper, "I
want to educate 80,000 people

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:55.047
"in the world, or 80 million
people in the world, or bust.

00:09:55.047 --> 00:09:56.624
"If I don't do that,
then I'm a big failure."

00:09:56.624 --> 00:09:59.274
I started off very small,
with very small goals,

00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:02.825
really to just impact a
very small set of people,

00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:05.216
all of whom I happen to be related to.

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:09.610
It slowly had grown into something more.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.855
I'm going to tell you the
story about Khan Academy.

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:13.954
You got a little bit of
a tidbit right there.

00:10:15.985 --> 00:10:17.462
After that, I want to talk a little bit

00:10:17.462 --> 00:10:19.426
about what that means for education.

00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:21.297
That's another reason
why it's neat to be here.

00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:22.779
This is a school.

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:24.962
What could be a more
interesting discussion

00:10:24.962 --> 00:10:27.215
than where education is going?

00:10:27.215 --> 00:10:29.049
I think Khan Academy
might play a role in it,

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.635
but I think there are some
trends that are going to happen,

00:10:31.635 --> 00:10:33.435
whether or not the Khan Academy ...

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:35.328
if I got hit by a bus,
God forbid, outside.

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:37.295
(laugther)

00:10:37.295 --> 00:10:39.429
Regardless of what
happens with Khan Academy,

00:10:39.429 --> 00:10:42.775
there are things that I
think are going to occur.

00:10:42.775 --> 00:10:45.878
I think they're going to
occur in the next 10-15 years.

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:48.604
I think it's a very
interesting discussion to have.

00:10:48.604 --> 00:10:52.128
Then finally ... I have
attended, when I was young,

00:10:52.128 --> 00:10:53.526
a lot of talks that inspired me,

00:10:53.526 --> 00:10:57.331
and I wanted to go out and change
the world and start a revolution.

00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:59.742
I would be all inspired, and
have all this inspiration,

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.358
and I would go home, and I
would just twiddle my thumbs,

00:11:02.358 --> 00:11:07.580
and not know what to do
with myself and my energy.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.437
I had a friend who was a hardcore athlete.

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.100
He always told me, "Never
waste inspiration."

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.910
What I want to do ...

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.764
It's actually a very valuable
commodity, so it shouldn't be wasted.

00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:23.323
What I want to do at the end of
this talk is throw out ideas.

00:11:23.323 --> 00:11:24.890
I don't want to just tell
you my story, and say,

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.840
"Look, you can change
the world. Now, go home."

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.211
What I want to do is say, "Look. I
did this, really almost by chance."

00:11:32.211 --> 00:11:34.080
Here's 4 or 5 things you all could do.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.921
These are really just
to be seeds in your head

00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:38.182
of stuff that you could work on.

00:11:38.182 --> 00:11:39.915
You might think they're horrible ideas,

00:11:39.915 --> 00:11:42.821
but hopefully it'll at least
get your juices flowing

00:11:42.821 --> 00:11:47.642
on ways that you might be
able to impact the world.

00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:51.664
To start off, you got a
little tidbit right there.

00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:56.070
4, 5 years ago, I was a newly-minted MBA.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:57.773
I was working at a hedge fund.

00:11:57.773 --> 00:11:59.281
It's kind of a bad word now,

00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:01.702
but not all hedge funds are evil.

00:12:01.702 --> 00:12:07.227
(laughter) Many are, though. (laughter)

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:11.061
My portfolio manager,
who is a vegetarian ...

00:12:11.061 --> 00:12:14.194
If we made money off of an egg company,

00:12:14.194 --> 00:12:17.732
he would donate his profits
to fight abusive chickens.

00:12:17.732 --> 00:12:19.619
I have not made this up.

00:12:19.619 --> 00:12:23.407
We were a more ethical hedge fund.

00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:25.907
I was a newly-minted MBA,

00:12:25.907 --> 00:12:28.829
working as a hedge fund analyst in Boston.

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:30.913
I had just gotten married in New Jersey.

00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:33.349
I had some family that
wanted to visit me in Boston,

00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:36.187
my aunt and uncle, and their children;

00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:38.006
Nadia, Armand, and Ali.

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.160
Nadia was the oldest.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.543
She was 12 years old at the time.

00:12:41.543 --> 00:12:44.370
They visited me just to see
Boston, take in the sights.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.256
It was exciting for me
because it was the first time

00:12:46.256 --> 00:12:48.629
that I really got to spend
time with my cousins.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:50.362
When I was in New Orleans ...

00:12:50.362 --> 00:12:53.177
They were from New Orleans.
I grew up in New Orleans.

00:12:53.177 --> 00:12:55.674
When I was there before high
school, they were toddlers,

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:58.164
and I never had really a
serious discussion with them,

00:12:58.164 --> 00:13:00.338
or I never really was
able to bond with them.

00:13:00.338 --> 00:13:02.371
Now, when they visited me in
Boston, for the first time,

00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:04.740
I was really able to connect with them.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.764
Nadia especially impressed me.

00:13:06.764 --> 00:13:08.847
I think this story is
especially interesting,

00:13:08.847 --> 00:13:10.194
talking to many of you all,

00:13:10.194 --> 00:13:11.583
because when I look out into the audience,

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.745
I see a lot of Nadias.

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:20.767
I see a lot of bright,
motivated young women who ...

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:23.186
In Nadia's case, as soon as I
spent a couple hours with her,

00:13:23.186 --> 00:13:26.137
talking to her about life
and what she wanted to do,

00:13:26.137 --> 00:13:27.936
and politics, and philosophy,

00:13:27.936 --> 00:13:29.505
and I would give her brain teasers.

00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:31.355
She was just ultra sharp, and here was I.

00:13:31.355 --> 00:13:35.192
I thought I was this
reasonably-sophisticated
25 or 26 year old,

00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:37.603
and I literally could
talk to her as an equal.

00:13:37.603 --> 00:13:41.196
Sometimes, I felt like I was
a little bit out of my league.

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:44.311
I was just wildly impressed by her.

00:13:44.311 --> 00:13:45.928
You can imagine. I think it's ...

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:46.942
You've probably experienced this

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:48.702
a little bit with your own parents.

00:13:48.702 --> 00:13:53.154
When you have a ... When
you meet a young person,

00:13:53.154 --> 00:13:54.821
who you're very impressed by,

00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:56.494
who you think has a lot of potential,

00:13:56.494 --> 00:13:57.902
you have this natural inclination

00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:00.202
to have them follow in your footsteps.

00:14:00.202 --> 00:14:01.849
Everyone thinks that what they do

00:14:01.849 --> 00:14:05.148
is the best possible thing.

00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:08.842
While we were touring around
Boston, we visited MIT.

00:14:08.842 --> 00:14:11.129
When I was visiting MIT, I told Nadia,

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:12.076
and the whole family was there.

00:14:12.076 --> 00:14:14.485
I said, "Nadia, I know there's probably

00:14:14.485 --> 00:14:15.842
"all these stereotypes in your head

00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:18.339
"that make you not think that
you want to go to this school,

00:14:18.339 --> 00:14:20.865
"and it has this [unintelligible],

00:14:20.865 --> 00:14:22.995
"but I generally think, based
on interacting with you ...

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:27.843
"You're creative. You show
this analytical ability.

00:14:27.843 --> 00:14:30.363
"I really think ... I'm just going
to put this seed in your head.

00:14:30.363 --> 00:14:32.204
"You don't have to do it. No pressure,

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.713
"but I really think this
would be a good place

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:35.623
"for you to think about coming to.

00:14:35.623 --> 00:14:37.046
"Maybe you'd want to be an engineer,

00:14:37.046 --> 00:14:39.134
"and become an engineer, and then one day,

00:14:39.134 --> 00:14:43.251
"work at a hedge fund, but a
good hedge fund." (laughter)

00:14:44.805 --> 00:14:46.373
If any of you all are
interested in that career path,

00:14:46.373 --> 00:14:48.621
talk to me afterwards. (laugther)

00:14:48.621 --> 00:14:50.151
I'll be your personal counselor.

00:14:52.197 --> 00:14:54.980
She kind of, I think, did
what a lot of y'all would do

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.155
when your mom or dad tries to
get you into the family business.

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:01.841
She rolled her eyes a little bit and said,

00:15:01.841 --> 00:15:03.761
"Thanks, but I don't know about it.

00:15:03.761 --> 00:15:06.873
"I was thinking of becoming
a journalist, or something."

00:15:06.873 --> 00:15:08.842
I don't know if I really
got a lot of traction,

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:10.426
but when I said that,

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:12.555
at the same time that
I was talking to Nadia

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.547
about possibly coming to MIT,

00:15:14.547 --> 00:15:17.991
I saw my aunt and uncle
give each other a look,

00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:21.377
a look like, "What's Sal talking about,

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:23.554
"asking our Nadia to go to MIT?"

00:15:23.554 --> 00:15:25.130
I didn't know how to interpret that look.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.958
I thought maybe it's another one
of these stereotypical things

00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:30.920
about women in technical fields,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.705
and engineering, or whatever.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:34.310
Maybe it was something deeper. Who knows?

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.365
Maybe it was just my
aunt was mad at my uncle

00:15:36.365 --> 00:15:39.935
for some other random reason. (laughter)

00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:43.234
I didn't know, but it caught my eye.

00:15:43.234 --> 00:15:46.728
The next morning, before
everyone else had woken up,

00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:50.086
my aunt [unintelligible] had come to ...

00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:51.274
We were just hanging out.

00:15:51.274 --> 00:15:52.985
Everyone else was still asleep.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.985
She said, "Sal. I can't
tell you how great it is

00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:59.234
"that you're a bit of a
role model for my children.

00:15:59.234 --> 00:16:00.855
"They really look up to you.

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:02.662
"They're enjoying this trip tremendously.

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.808
"I can't tell you how
much it's affecting them.

00:16:04.808 --> 00:16:06.439
"They're getting inspired to do things.

00:16:06.439 --> 00:16:08.207
"They all want to come to
Boston to go to college.

00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:10.110
"They love the area."

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.080
She said, "The one thing
you probably don't know,

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.602
"and it's concerning us, and
it's been an issue in the family

00:16:15.602 --> 00:16:18.948
"is that Nadia's actually
having a lot of difficulty

00:16:18.948 --> 00:16:21.666
"in math right now, and
she was actually placed

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:25.146
"into the slower track in her ...

00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:26.779
"as she goes into 7th grade.

00:16:26.779 --> 00:16:28.138
"They didn't place her into the track

00:16:28.138 --> 00:16:30.561
"that would allow her to
take algebra in 8th grade,

00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:32.284
"and then progress on that track."

00:16:32.299 --> 00:16:34.478
I think many of you are
on ... that allows you

00:16:34.478 --> 00:16:36.111
a college preparatory track,

00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:38.595
where you take calculus
in high school, whatnot.

00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:41.339
For me, this was obviously surprising.

00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:43.413
I just told you how impressive Nadia was.

00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:44.438
Sometimes when I would speak to her,

00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:48.940
I felt like I was speaking to
someone out of my own league.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.429
For me to think that in 6th grade,

00:16:50.429 --> 00:16:54.157
there was something that
was tripping her up.

00:16:54.157 --> 00:16:57.882
It was almost hard for me to believe.

00:16:57.882 --> 00:17:00.793
When Nadia woke up, I [pulled her].

00:17:00.793 --> 00:17:02.734
I was like, "Hey, your mom
says you're having an issue

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:06.780
"with something in mathematics.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.437
"What do you think is the situation?"

00:17:08.437 --> 00:17:10.285
She says, "I just don't get units."

00:17:10.285 --> 00:17:19.612
She just doesn't get kilograms to
milligrams, or pounds to ounces.

00:17:19.612 --> 00:17:22.461
It does. It gives all of us
a little bit of a headache,

00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:24.404
but she just didn't get it.

00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:26.155
She says, "When I see those problems,

00:17:26.155 --> 00:17:30.089
"my brain just shuts down, and
I just think it's beyond me."

00:17:30.089 --> 00:17:35.370
I told her. I said, "Nadia, let's
do a deal. You're here for ..."

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.592
actually another ... I think it
was the last day of their visit.

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:40.306
"You're going to leave tomorrow,
go back to New Orleans,

00:17:40.306 --> 00:17:45.711
"but I am 100,000% convinced
that you are well capable

00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:47.438
"of learning units, and
I actually suspected

00:17:47.438 --> 00:17:50.800
"you're capable of learning
things far deeper than units,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.094
"but it's just my suspicion.

00:17:54.094 --> 00:17:57.831
"Why don't we do some
type of remote tutoring?

00:17:57.831 --> 00:17:59.702
"You go back to New Orleans.

00:17:59.702 --> 00:18:02.717
"We'll get on a speakerphone.

00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:04.299
"We'll get some pen tablets, maybe.

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:07.200
"We'll find something
that where we can write.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.081
"We can both see. We're each writing,"

00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:11.887
and she agreed.

00:18:11.887 --> 00:18:14.886
I think she was, 1,
excited about this idea

00:18:14.886 --> 00:18:17.804
of having someone
interested in her directly,

00:18:17.804 --> 00:18:20.242
and giving her that 1-on-1 attention,

00:18:20.242 --> 00:18:23.284
and someone to be able to connect with.

00:18:23.284 --> 00:18:26.386
I was kind of like her older brother.

00:18:26.386 --> 00:18:27.511
But on the other level, I think she was

00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:29.340
a little bit daunted by the idea.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.174
It was a little extra
pressure above and beyond

00:18:32.174 --> 00:18:33.589
what you already have from school

00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:37.848
and being a middle
school ... a young woman,

00:18:37.848 --> 00:18:40.588
which a lot of pressures that
y'all are probably facing

00:18:40.588 --> 00:18:41.863
on some dimension right now.

00:18:41.863 --> 00:18:44.531
It's actually very strange to
be talking to y'all about Nadia,

00:18:44.531 --> 00:18:48.024
because I keep realizing that
a lot of y'all are Nadia,

00:18:48.024 --> 00:18:51.781
or in some way have elements
that are similar to her.

00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:55.846
It adds a whole new level
to this conversation.

00:18:55.846 --> 00:18:58.631
She agreed. Within a week,
we both had our pen tablets.

00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:02.689
She was in New Orleans. I was in Boston.

00:19:02.689 --> 00:19:05.537
I would come home from work,
right after the market closed.

00:19:05.537 --> 00:19:07.037
I would call her up.

00:19:07.037 --> 00:19:08.639
She would be done with all of her ...

00:19:08.639 --> 00:19:10.461
I think she was on the
basketball team at the time.

00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:12.061
We would start doing these sessions.

00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:19.162
I've got to tell you, the
first week was painful.

00:19:19.162 --> 00:19:22.158
The tone of the conversation ...

00:19:22.158 --> 00:19:27.163
When we were just speaking
as friends, or as relations,

00:19:27.163 --> 00:19:30.743
it was a dynamic conversation,
really intelligent,

00:19:30.743 --> 00:19:33.286
really engaging, really fast-paced,

00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:36.958
but as soon as we entered
this domain of units,

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.906
which was our first subject to tackle ...

00:19:40.906 --> 00:19:42.435
As soon as we entered that domain,

00:19:42.435 --> 00:19:44.412
I felt like she just shut down.

00:19:44.412 --> 00:19:46.241
I would ask her a question.

00:19:46.241 --> 00:19:50.814
"How many kilometers would that be?"

00:19:50.814 --> 00:19:53.657
There would be this long pause.

00:19:53.657 --> 00:19:55.786
I didn't know if I lost her on the line,

00:19:55.786 --> 00:19:58.333
if something happened with
our internet connection.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.175
Then, her answers were always
in the form of a question.

00:20:01.175 --> 00:20:05.284
They were always like, "100? 10?"

00:20:05.284 --> 00:20:09.750
I had no idea. I said,
"Nadia, are you guessing?"

00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:13.482
It was just very difficult.

00:20:13.482 --> 00:20:15.238
I could imagine if it was painful for me,

00:20:15.238 --> 00:20:17.782
it was probably 10-times
as painful for her

00:20:17.782 --> 00:20:19.673
because above and beyond
this being a subject

00:20:19.673 --> 00:20:20.964
that she was struggling with,

00:20:20.964 --> 00:20:22.471
and we all have had that feeling

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:24.371
of struggling with something.

00:20:24.371 --> 00:20:27.380
She was working with her cousin,

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.583
who she probably wanted to impress

00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:31.748
because he was already impressed by her.

00:20:31.748 --> 00:20:32.929
He already believes in her.

00:20:32.929 --> 00:20:37.159
She probably felt all this anxiety
of being judged, and what not.

00:20:37.159 --> 00:20:39.304
Literally, after a week of
this, I started questioning

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:41.555
whether this made sense,

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:45.783
whether I had done more harm than good,

00:20:45.783 --> 00:20:46.971
She was already having difficulty,

00:20:46.971 --> 00:20:50.203
and I was getting pretty
close to giving up on her

00:20:50.203 --> 00:20:53.309
just because it felt like
we had made no headway

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:56.258
in a week after 5 sessions.

00:20:56.258 --> 00:20:57.598
I made a last-ditch effort.

00:20:57.598 --> 00:20:59.037
The next conversation
I had with her, I said,

00:20:59.037 --> 00:21:02.703
"Nadia. I know you're smart.

00:21:02.703 --> 00:21:04.494
"I know it by based on
interacting with you,

00:21:04.494 --> 00:21:09.424
"and we also share a certain
amount of DNA. (laughter)

00:21:09.424 --> 00:21:12.800
"That, by itself, is proof enough.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.159
"I am not judging you.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:17.620
"I am not judging you in
no way, shape, or form.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.371
"You need to view me as a
resource, purely as a resource.

00:21:20.371 --> 00:21:21.949
"There is nothing that you can ask me,

00:21:21.949 --> 00:21:24.276
"that in any way, will
make me think less of you.

00:21:24.276 --> 00:21:25.739
"In fact, the more questions you ask,

00:21:25.739 --> 00:21:27.451
"will make me think more of you.

00:21:27.451 --> 00:21:30.320
"I need you to be completely honest

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.348
"when you don't understand something.

00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:34.420
"When I ask a question, either say,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.162
"'I do not know the answer
to that question, Sal.

00:21:36.162 --> 00:21:39.069
"'Please explain it,' or
answer in the affirmative.

00:21:39.069 --> 00:21:41.128
"Don't say, 'Ten?' Say, 'Ten,'

00:21:41.128 --> 00:21:42.489
"or say, 'I do not understand.

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:46.682
"Just be a little bit more
engaging," and it worked.

00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:49.132
Over the next week, because
she started giving me

00:21:49.132 --> 00:21:52.912
more information about what
it exactly was in her brain,

00:21:52.912 --> 00:21:55.258
that was having trouble with units,

00:21:55.258 --> 00:21:57.498
I was able to hone in a little bit better,

00:21:57.498 --> 00:22:01.553
and address those small points
of confusion that she had.

00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:03.330
When do you multiply? When do you divide?

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.192
I think that's the
confusion many people have

00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:06.829
with concepts of units.

00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:09.937
You're always multiplying and
dividing by different things.

00:22:09.937 --> 00:22:11.133
But, she got it.

00:22:11.133 --> 00:22:13.544
Once she got it, it was fascinating

00:22:13.544 --> 00:22:16.436
because something clicked in her head.

00:22:16.436 --> 00:22:20.037
Not only did she go from
thinking that it was this huge,

00:22:20.037 --> 00:22:22.294
intractable, impossible thing to do.

00:22:22.294 --> 00:22:23.793
She went to thinking that it was easy.

00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:25.793
She thought it was so
easy, and so intuitive,

00:22:25.793 --> 00:22:27.884
that she was almost angry about it.

00:22:27.884 --> 00:22:30.413
She was angry that something
that she now found,

00:22:30.413 --> 00:22:34.084
3 weeks later, to be intuitive,
and easy, and natural.

00:22:34.084 --> 00:22:38.954
She was angry that this was
potentially derailing her career,

00:22:38.954 --> 00:22:42.931
derailing her self-impression,
or not allowing her to proceed

00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:47.597
with her other friends into
the normal-track math class.

00:22:47.597 --> 00:22:49.881
I want to take a side
here, from Nadia's story,

00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:51.193
because I think that experience ...

00:22:51.193 --> 00:22:53.438
and I don't know if any of
y'all have experienced it yet.

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:54.513
Hopefully you will.

00:22:54.513 --> 00:22:56.405
I've experienced it
multiple times in my life,

00:22:56.405 --> 00:22:58.505
where you have this intractable problem

00:22:58.505 --> 00:23:00.005
that you're almost ready to give up,

00:23:00.005 --> 00:23:05.507
that you just think your brain is
not built for this type of problem.

00:23:05.507 --> 00:23:07.091
When you're faced with
something like that,

00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:09.680
most people give up, and the
rest of their life they think,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.289
"I'm not meant to do algebra.

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.638
"I'm not meant to do calculus.

00:23:12.638 --> 00:23:14.158
"I'm not meant to do physics."

00:23:14.158 --> 00:23:16.844
I used to know people on the other side.

00:23:16.844 --> 00:23:18.061
"I'm not meant to be a writer.

00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:22.260
"I'm not meant to ... I'm a slow reader."

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.639
Whatever it might be, we all face this,

00:23:24.639 --> 00:23:26.034
and most people tend to give up.

00:23:26.034 --> 00:23:29.935
That experience of facing
it once in your life,

00:23:29.935 --> 00:23:32.107
and then overcoming it,
and overcoming it in a way

00:23:32.107 --> 00:23:34.747
that you realize that it's
actually an easy thing,

00:23:34.747 --> 00:23:37.112
that's tremendously powerful.

00:23:37.112 --> 00:23:38.751
I think it's tremendously
transformational.

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.455
I encourage you all to try to
have those type of experiences,

00:23:41.455 --> 00:23:43.194
to try to really engage with things

00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:45.800
that you find intractable right now,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.199
because I guarantee you, at the
age that you're at right now,

00:23:48.199 --> 00:23:51.406
if you discover that it
really is not so intractable,

00:23:51.406 --> 00:23:54.497
and if you really can
overcome that hurdle,

00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:58.661
the rest of your life, you won't
really find anything to be impossible.

00:23:58.661 --> 00:24:00.289
You're going to realize that
you just have to engage,

00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:02.641
and be aggressive, and
find the right resources

00:24:02.641 --> 00:24:05.311
with enough energy and
things will work out.

00:24:05.311 --> 00:24:07.123
Nadia--to make a long story short--

00:24:07.123 --> 00:24:09.169
she just progressed tremendously.

00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:13.248
From then on, once she figured out
that if she just engaged enough

00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:16.026
that she would be able to
understand the concepts.

00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:17.757
We just keep proceeding forward.

00:24:17.757 --> 00:24:18.957
After a month or two, I said,

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:20.249
"Nadia, the stuff we're covering now,

00:24:20.249 --> 00:24:22.570
"this is stuff that not only
you would normally expect

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.738
"of a smart, or an
advanced, 7th or 8th grader.

00:24:25.738 --> 00:24:27.361
"This is material that you would expect

00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:29.418
"of a advanced 9th or 10th grader."

00:24:29.418 --> 00:24:31.335
From then on, and since then ...

00:24:31.335 --> 00:24:34.994
This was in 2004, 2005 that we started.

00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:37.662
Nadia just turned into a rock star.

00:24:37.662 --> 00:24:42.494
She ended up taking ... or
maybe I should say a mathlete.

00:24:42.494 --> 00:24:45.659
(laughter) She ended up ...

00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:47.788
I don't want to give you the impression

00:24:47.788 --> 00:24:49.785
that I think this is
the measure of a person

00:24:49.785 --> 00:24:52.745
of what math classes they take,
and what year, and all of that.

00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:55.561
I want to give you a very tangible example

00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:57.142
of someone who I saw firsthand,

00:24:57.142 --> 00:24:58.929
who went from someone
who was ready to give up

00:24:58.929 --> 00:25:03.697
on mathematics at the age of 12 or
13, to someone who took calculus

00:25:03.697 --> 00:25:05.370
when she was a freshman in high school,

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.415
who ended up having to go to
the University of New Orleans

00:25:09.415 --> 00:25:10.999
when she was a sophomore
because they had run out

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:13.455
of math classes at her high school.

00:25:13.455 --> 00:25:18.688
But, at the same time, she now
still wants to be a writer.

00:25:18.688 --> 00:25:20.257
This isn't something where ...

00:25:20.257 --> 00:25:21.859
She's actually going to
go to Sarah Lawrence,

00:25:21.859 --> 00:25:24.477
and she wants to be a
writer, and God bless her.

00:25:24.477 --> 00:25:27.938
She didn't want to be an engineer
and a hedge fund manager,

00:25:27.938 --> 00:25:31.092
(laughter) but this is
the important thing.

00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:32.669
She didn't become a writer.

00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:34.973
I think in a lot of Asian, in a lot of ...

00:25:34.973 --> 00:25:37.560
My family is originally from South Asia.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.837
In our culture, there's this notion of,

00:25:39.837 --> 00:25:40.974
"Oh, they're becoming a
writer because they couldn't

00:25:40.974 --> 00:25:44.301
"be an engineer, or because
they couldn't be a doctor."

00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:45.688
In Nadia's example, she can say,

00:25:45.688 --> 00:25:49.054
"Oh yeah. Well, I could've been
one, but I'm deciding to do this."

00:25:49.054 --> 00:25:53.642
I think it's super important
for people to have that option,

00:25:53.642 --> 00:25:58.327
for her to know that she made
the decision to be a writer

00:25:58.327 --> 00:25:59.722
as opposed to being forced into it

00:25:59.722 --> 00:26:01.389
because when she was in 6th grade,

00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:03.305
she had given up on mathematics.

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:05.093
After Nadia's story, I've got to tell you.

00:26:05.093 --> 00:26:07.814
That was probably the
most rewarding experience

00:26:07.814 --> 00:26:09.169
in my life up to date.

00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:11.639
You can imagine. I was a
guy working at a hedge fund.

00:26:11.639 --> 00:26:13.364
It's an intellectually-stimulating job,

00:26:13.364 --> 00:26:16.913
but it's a job where it's
hard to answer the question

00:26:16.913 --> 00:26:20.558
of what did you do for humanity today?

00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:23.560
I actually used to have this
rationalization [as well].

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.639
In a Communist system, you
have these central planners

00:26:25.639 --> 00:26:27.154
who like to allocate the capital,

00:26:27.154 --> 00:26:29.626
but in the Capitalist system
you need people participating

00:26:29.626 --> 00:26:31.724
in the market to make sure that
prices are set efficiently,

00:26:31.724 --> 00:26:33.552
and only when prices are set efficiently,

00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:35.588
can capital be allocated efficiently,

00:26:35.588 --> 00:26:37.726
and because of that,
people will be better off.

00:26:37.726 --> 00:26:40.639
That was my rationalization
for working at a hedge fund.

00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:43.200
As you could imagine, it's
a convoluted argument,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.469
and it would always make
my wife roll her eyes.

00:26:47.469 --> 00:26:51.709
To be able to come home and touch
someone in a meaningful way,

00:26:51.709 --> 00:26:53.342
someone who I was related to,

00:26:53.342 --> 00:26:58.401
and feel that I was impacting
her life's trajectory,

00:26:58.401 --> 00:27:00.115
tremendously satisfying.

00:27:00.115 --> 00:27:01.641
I decided I wanted to keep going.

00:27:01.641 --> 00:27:04.790
I started with her younger
brothers, Armand and Ali.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:08.255
Then, I started with some other
cousins, other family friends.

00:27:08.255 --> 00:27:12.544
This is really, now we're
going into 2005, early 2006.

00:27:12.544 --> 00:27:14.592
I had this cohort of
about 15 or 20 students

00:27:14.592 --> 00:27:19.272
that I would use ... I tried
to replicate the Nadia model.

00:27:19.272 --> 00:27:21.107
I would get on a conference call,

00:27:21.107 --> 00:27:24.472
and we would use Yahoo! Doodle
to write with each other,

00:27:24.472 --> 00:27:25.841
and to see what we're doing.

00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:27.186
As you could imagine, [unintelligible]

00:27:27.186 --> 00:27:28.975
just getting very hard to scale up.

00:27:28.975 --> 00:27:33.478
I had the luxury with Nadia of
having this 1-on-1 interaction.

00:27:33.478 --> 00:27:35.917
Even when I started having small groups

00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:37.261
of 2 or 3 students at the same time,

00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:39.473
it just became completely
different, hard to scale,

00:27:39.473 --> 00:27:40.809
but I thought really hard.

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:43.221
How can I ... that same
thing that I did with Nadia,

00:27:43.221 --> 00:27:46.308
how can I somehow scale it up?

00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:49.364
How can I print out
more versions of myself,

00:27:49.364 --> 00:27:52.438
so that other people could
interact in the same way.

00:27:52.438 --> 00:27:55.110
One thing I did, is I started
writing some software.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.806
It was fun for me, again,
because I had given up

00:27:57.806 --> 00:28:02.239
my computer science part of my
brain to go work in finance,

00:28:02.239 --> 00:28:03.809
so it was just a fun project for me.

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.306
The whole goal of the software was

00:28:05.306 --> 00:28:07.560
to be able to hone in on that weak point,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.560
to automate that process that I had,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.478
that question-and-answer
process that I had with Nadia,

00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:14.543
where I was able to realize, oh,

00:28:14.543 --> 00:28:18.256
she just doesn't get
this more basic concept,

00:28:18.256 --> 00:28:22.093
and that's why she was having
trouble with the idea of units.

00:28:22.093 --> 00:28:23.809
I wrote a little bit
of software like that,

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:25.201
and I put a little database behind it,

00:28:25.201 --> 00:28:27.944
so that I could keep track, what
the students were working on.

00:28:31.205 --> 00:28:32.952
My cousins, they liked it.

00:28:32.952 --> 00:28:34.903
They enjoyed the fact that it
was generating problems for them,

00:28:34.903 --> 00:28:37.636
and they could practice,
but the harder problem ...

00:28:37.636 --> 00:28:40.082
and this is what really directly led

00:28:40.082 --> 00:28:41.856
to where the Khan Academy is now,

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:44.232
is how do we schedule
time with each other,

00:28:44.232 --> 00:28:47.738
or how can I teach all of these students?

00:28:47.738 --> 00:28:49.637
I only had 20 right
now, but it was already

00:28:49.637 --> 00:28:51.233
becoming too much for me,

00:28:51.233 --> 00:28:53.814
in a way that they could
learn at their own pace,

00:28:53.814 --> 00:28:56.505
they could learn at their own time.

00:28:56.505 --> 00:28:58.385
That's where the idea ...
and it really wasn't my idea.

00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:02.446
I have to give credit to
a friend of mine who said,

00:29:02.446 --> 00:29:04.334
"Hey, why don't you just put
some stuff up on YouTube?"

00:29:04.334 --> 00:29:07.666
I have to say, my own pride, right?

00:29:07.666 --> 00:29:08.721
When he said that, I
was like, "No, no, no.

00:29:08.721 --> 00:29:10.164
"My software is enough. YouTube vidoes ...

00:29:10.164 --> 00:29:12.688
"My software is so good,
it gives people hints,

00:29:12.688 --> 00:29:15.356
"and it's web-based,
and it has a database,

00:29:15.356 --> 00:29:18.152
"and you should see the database."

00:29:18.152 --> 00:29:22.824
After I got over the fact that
I didn't think of the idea,

00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:26.016
(laughter) I said, "Look, maybe I'll try

00:29:26.016 --> 00:29:27.447
"some of these YouTube videos."

00:29:27.447 --> 00:29:30.529
The very first YouTube video I
did was a least common multiple,

00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:34.948
so if you watch that video, it's
by far the most rough video.

00:29:34.948 --> 00:29:38.335
Hopefully it'll be a part of
history one day. (laughter)

00:29:38.335 --> 00:29:45.169
I made that video, and my
cousins and family friends,

00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:46.847
who needed to learn the
least common multiples,

00:29:46.847 --> 00:29:49.938
they actually said they
really liked it because ...

00:29:49.938 --> 00:29:51.582
Actually, one of them told me ...

00:29:51.582 --> 00:29:53.262
and this was a bit of a
backhanded compliment.

00:29:53.262 --> 00:29:54.621
I didn't know what to think of it.

00:29:54.621 --> 00:29:56.188
They said, "Oh, I like
you better on YouTube."

00:29:56.188 --> 00:29:58.918
(laughter)

00:29:58.918 --> 00:30:00.745
It's actually funny.

00:30:00.745 --> 00:30:02.463
He was the first person to say it,

00:30:02.463 --> 00:30:05.257
but I got that feedback
over and over again.

00:30:05.257 --> 00:30:10.014
I think the core issue of why
I'm better on YouTube is 1,

00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:12.924
there isn't this stress when
you have this interaction

00:30:12.924 --> 00:30:14.874
with a tutor or a teacher of,

00:30:14.874 --> 00:30:16.783
"Hey, do you get this?"

00:30:16.783 --> 00:30:21.481
You're kind of like, "Oh,
gee. He's looking at me."

00:30:21.481 --> 00:30:23.128
I'm sorry. You were just
standing right there,

00:30:23.128 --> 00:30:24.887
(laughter) so you have to ...

00:30:24.887 --> 00:30:28.652
But, it's hard to think when
someone is waiting for you

00:30:28.652 --> 00:30:31.303
to process something
that you're just learning

00:30:31.303 --> 00:30:33.127
to get your hands around.

00:30:33.127 --> 00:30:35.229
Maybe I said something
that you don't understand,

00:30:35.229 --> 00:30:38.380
but you don't want to ask me
because it's a basic concept,

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.380
and you want me to think that
you're a smart individual,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.139
but this is something that
you really should've mastered

00:30:42.139 --> 00:30:45.234
probably in 4th or 5th grade,
and you're in 9th grade now.

00:30:45.234 --> 00:30:47.086
If you tell me that you
really don't know ...

00:30:47.086 --> 00:30:50.266
Dividing decimals is still
this little gray area,

00:30:50.266 --> 00:30:53.129
and if dividing decimals
actually is, you're not alone.

00:30:53.129 --> 00:30:54.825
I actually want to go to a mall one day,

00:30:54.825 --> 00:30:56.152
and just see how many
adults ... (laughter)

00:30:56.152 --> 00:30:59.830
That's a whole ... I can't
tell you how many letters I get

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.390
from all sorts of people,
all walks of life,

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.789
that dividing decimals is the one thing

00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:08.328
that no one wants to admit
that they forgot how to do,

00:31:08.328 --> 00:31:11.780
but it's a huge need [unintelligible] ...

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.978
But anyway, that's a ... I
go on tangents. (laughter)

00:31:14.978 --> 00:31:18.210
I was talking about why
I'm better on YouTube

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.775
is that you can pause me.

00:31:19.775 --> 00:31:20.928
You can repeat me.

00:31:20.928 --> 00:31:23.887
If I say something you don't understand,

00:31:23.887 --> 00:31:27.102
you can go to Wikipedia,or
go to some other site,

00:31:27.102 --> 00:31:32.182
or go to one of my other videos,
and get that concept filled in.

00:31:32.182 --> 00:31:34.281
There's no stress. You're
doing it at your own time.

00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:38.439
I actually got a letter
from a college student once.

00:31:38.439 --> 00:31:42.102
He wrote me ... I can't tell
you how valuable this is.

00:31:42.102 --> 00:31:44.844
He said, "I actually have a
very good calculus professor,

00:31:44.844 --> 00:31:47.882
"but our class is at 7 in
the morning on a Monday,

00:31:47.882 --> 00:31:50.357
"and when I'm there,
there's this cute girl

00:31:50.357 --> 00:31:52.201
"who sits two rows in front of me.

00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:56.210
"All I can think about all day,
throughout the entire class

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.186
"is whether I'm going to have
the guts to walk up to her

00:31:58.186 --> 00:32:00.684
"after class and ask her out.

00:32:00.684 --> 00:32:02.276
"I think about whether
I want to write memoirs

00:32:02.276 --> 00:32:05.353
"about what I did last
weekend." (laughter)

00:32:05.353 --> 00:32:07.057
By the time all those thoughts go on,

00:32:07.057 --> 00:32:09.430
he's completely missed the calculus class

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.876
at 7 in the morning,

00:32:10.876 --> 00:32:12.926
and then he goes home, and he
watches the YouTube videos.

00:32:12.926 --> 00:32:16.641
His story, it's actually very realistic.

00:32:16.641 --> 00:32:20.542
It's what happens all the
time in the model that's ...

00:32:20.542 --> 00:32:25.152
In the standard model, you're learning,

00:32:25.152 --> 00:32:28.318
you and the teacher in a room
that's dictated by some schedule.

00:32:28.318 --> 00:32:30.228
It has to be, based on logistics.

00:32:30.228 --> 00:32:32.071
It's no one's fault, really.

00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:36.054
If I had to teach you a concept
everyday at 7 in the morning,

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:38.488
sometimes I'm not going
to be on my A-game.

00:32:38.488 --> 00:32:40.519
I'm not going to be
super passionate about it

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:44.421
because teachers are people, too.

00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:49.448
Sometimes it's hard to ... (laughter)

00:32:49.448 --> 00:32:51.485
It's hard for the teacher sometimes,

00:32:51.485 --> 00:32:53.822
and it's especially hard
for the student to engage,

00:32:53.822 --> 00:32:54.983
especially if there's some other thing

00:32:54.983 --> 00:32:57.792
that they're thinking
about, or they're sleepy,

00:32:57.792 --> 00:33:02.674
or there's some core concept that
they missed in the last class.

00:33:02.674 --> 00:33:04.478
This idea of being able
to get something on demand

00:33:04.478 --> 00:33:06.778
is tremendously useful, and
once I got that feedback

00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:08.653
from my cousins and family friends,

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:11.282
I made more videos.

00:33:11.282 --> 00:33:12.984
At first, I put the videos up.

00:33:12.984 --> 00:33:15.433
[Obviously], I expected about
10 or 20 people to watch them,

00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:18.774
but slowly, people that
weren't related to me,

00:33:18.774 --> 00:33:21.773
or who didn't know me personally,
started watching them,

00:33:21.773 --> 00:33:23.677
and that kept growing.

00:33:23.677 --> 00:33:24.836
I got excited.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:26.305
I don't know, how many of
y'all have seen the movie,

00:33:26.305 --> 00:33:28.782
"Julie and Julia?" Have you?

00:33:28.782 --> 00:33:30.675
Okay, when I was watching that movie,

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:34.251
I felt like this is like ...
on some metaphysical level,

00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:36.575
I felt some ... It was actually,
I didn't want to watch it.

00:33:36.575 --> 00:33:38.175
I thought it was about
cooking, or something.

00:33:38.175 --> 00:33:40.850
I didn't realize it was about
someone who started a blog

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:41.393
that became very popular.

00:33:41.393 --> 00:33:45.329
That experience she had where
she keeps pressing "refresh,"

00:33:45.329 --> 00:33:48.142
and she's amazed that someone,
other than her mother,

00:33:48.142 --> 00:33:49.477
actually read her blog.

00:33:49.477 --> 00:33:52.593
That was me. That was me 4 years ago.

00:33:52.593 --> 00:33:55.895
I put a video up, and I
would keep refreshing it.

00:33:55.895 --> 00:33:59.327
I still do this. I'm not as
secure as I might appear to be.

00:33:59.327 --> 00:34:01.233
(laughter)

00:34:01.233 --> 00:34:05.552
I keep refreshing it
until I get some feedback.

00:34:05.552 --> 00:34:07.780
Something, either the
little YouTube people rate,

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.381
if they give it 5 stars,
I'm very sensitive.

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:12.104
If someone even gives 4 stars,

00:34:12.104 --> 00:34:14.533
I question whether I'm
doing the right thing,

00:34:14.533 --> 00:34:17.350
and whether I should go back
to finance, and what not.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.781
(laughter) It's a very
emotionally-trying experience.

00:34:20.781 --> 00:34:24.990
But, I keep refreshing, and I wait
to see some positive feedback.

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:27.330
Eventually, someone will
just say, "Thank you."

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.339
As soon as they say thank you, it's like,

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:30.582
"Oh, good. This was
somewhat useful to somebody.

00:34:30.582 --> 00:34:32.849
"I'll record the next video now."

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:37.935
(laughter) I can't tell you
how valuable that notion is.

00:34:37.935 --> 00:34:40.198
More and more people kept watching it

00:34:40.198 --> 00:34:43.740
over the course of the next few years.

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:46.175
It grew roughly 20% a month,

00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:49.570
and if y'all are familiar with
the compounding of growth,

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:51.370
that's actually a very fast rate.

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:52.798
You're growing several fold every year.

00:34:52.798 --> 00:34:56.242
Now, as I was thankfully introduced,

00:34:56.242 --> 00:34:58.351
it's reaching, actually [on the order]

00:34:58.351 --> 00:35:01.285
of about 100,000 students now a month,

00:35:01.285 --> 00:35:03.912
and 40,000 video views a day.

00:35:03.912 --> 00:35:05.324
What's really exciting about it

00:35:05.324 --> 00:35:07.807
is that's just a small sliver of people

00:35:07.807 --> 00:35:09.715
who just happened to
have found out about it

00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:11.713
through word of mouth, or
through friends and family,

00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:14.760
or through the blogisphere.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.097
Someone might have written about it.

00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:18.437
It's a very small sliver
of, I think, the people

00:35:18.437 --> 00:35:21.050
who could benefit from
something like this.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.969
On top of the 100,000 people,
it's still mind-boggling to me

00:35:25.969 --> 00:35:27.550
when I say these numbers.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.137
Here I am, just sitting in my pajamas,

00:35:29.137 --> 00:35:31.389
recording YouTube videos all day.

00:35:31.389 --> 00:35:34.854
While I'm having breakfast, or at work ...

00:35:34.854 --> 00:35:37.686
I didn't quit my job until 3 months ago.

00:35:37.686 --> 00:35:39.055
While I was at work, or sleeping,

00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:41.537
somebody around the world
is learning from me.

00:35:41.537 --> 00:35:43.809
They're being empowered on some level.

00:35:43.809 --> 00:35:47.499
This is what I think is the
most important ingredient

00:35:47.499 --> 00:35:51.597
in the theme of peace, of
that individual empowerment.

00:35:51.597 --> 00:35:54.182
and it's happening with
no effort on my part,

00:35:54.182 --> 00:35:57.468
no cost to me, nothing I'm doing,

00:35:57.468 --> 00:35:59.104
but that person is getting empowered.

00:35:59.104 --> 00:36:00.961
It's like a perpetual motion machine.

00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:04.190
It's like you're making gold out of lead.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.639
It's like creating
something out of nothing.

00:36:06.639 --> 00:36:09.716
That idea, to me, is still mind-boggling.

00:36:09.716 --> 00:36:11.414
It didn't have to be 100,000 people.

00:36:11.414 --> 00:36:13.084
Just the idea that it's even 1 person

00:36:13.084 --> 00:36:15.294
that it's happening for is
even mind-boggling to me.

00:36:15.294 --> 00:36:17.048
Then, when you throw out
numbers, like 100,000,

00:36:17.048 --> 00:36:18.887
or we've had 9 million [unintelligible],

00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:24.309
I have trouble even completely
understanding what that means,

00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:27.302
but it just amazes me.

00:36:27.302 --> 00:36:31.631
Out of the blue ... Once again,
I want this narrative to show you

00:36:31.631 --> 00:36:33.539
how organically things can happen.

00:36:33.539 --> 00:36:36.358
Out of the blue, I got
a letter from somebody

00:36:36.358 --> 00:36:40.037
who distributes computers
in Uganda, and said,

00:36:40.037 --> 00:36:41.550
"We distribute these computers,

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.601
"and we don't have any internet access,

00:36:43.601 --> 00:36:46.459
"but we love the Khan Academy videos.

00:36:46.459 --> 00:36:48.284
"We've seen some of the
students interact with them.

00:36:48.284 --> 00:36:51.622
"They love them. How
can we get these videos

00:36:51.622 --> 00:36:53.117
"to these students in Uganda?"

00:36:53.117 --> 00:36:54.467
I had no idea.

00:36:54.467 --> 00:36:56.280
I was just recording YouTube videos.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.373
The very next email ... This is why ...

00:36:59.373 --> 00:37:01.702
I'm not the most religious
person on the planet,

00:37:01.702 --> 00:37:03.653
but sometimes things
happen in certain ways,

00:37:03.653 --> 00:37:05.242
where you think, "Gee,
there's some aliens,

00:37:05.242 --> 00:37:10.139
"or something, controlling what's
happening to me," [laughter]

00:37:10.139 --> 00:37:13.068
but the very next email was
this group of volunteers,

00:37:13.068 --> 00:37:15.517
from Cisco Systems, that said,

00:37:15.517 --> 00:37:16.949
"Hey, we like your videos.

00:37:16.949 --> 00:37:19.926
"We view them as a K-12 school-in-a-box

00:37:19.926 --> 00:37:23.989
"for children who don't have
access to good teachers.

00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:27.156
"Why don't we ... Can
we download your videos,

00:37:27.156 --> 00:37:28.302
"and put them on hard disks,

00:37:28.302 --> 00:37:29.986
"and distribute it to other groups?"

00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:31.421
I said, "Yeah, not only can you do that,

00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:33.404
"but there's this other
guy who just emailed me

00:37:33.404 --> 00:37:34.914
"literally 4 minutes ago.

00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:36.740
"Why don't you send him a hard drive?"

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:40.712
Literally, in about 4
minutes of forwarding emails,

00:37:40.712 --> 00:37:43.017
I got a letter from the group.

00:37:43.017 --> 00:37:46.919
It's called [viewconnect.org],
in Uganda, a week later, saying,

00:37:46.919 --> 00:37:48.689
"We have the hard drive from that group

00:37:48.689 --> 00:37:50.323
"at Cisco, [World Possible]."

00:37:50.323 --> 00:37:51.983
Literally, it just happened
with a couple of email forwards,

00:37:51.983 --> 00:37:55.090
"and the kids in Uganda love it."

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.539
I did nothing. (laughter)
I did absolutely nothing.

00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:01.084
I forwarded a couple of
emails between people.

00:38:01.084 --> 00:38:04.918
We're at this period in
... and I want this ...

00:38:04.918 --> 00:38:08.084
This is my story, but I
want you to think about

00:38:08.084 --> 00:38:09.876
this could kind of be your story as well,

00:38:09.876 --> 00:38:13.090
because we're at this point
in where technology is,

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.089
and how society is getting interconnected,

00:38:15.089 --> 00:38:16.771
where people are just waking up,

00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:19.043
and they're realizing, "Gee.
That's there. That's there.

00:38:19.043 --> 00:38:20.503
"If we put those two things together,

00:38:20.503 --> 00:38:22.556
"and take it over there, that's free gold.

00:38:22.556 --> 00:38:25.752
"We're turning lead into gold
with no cost for anybody."

00:38:25.752 --> 00:38:29.089
I think Khan Academy is
just one small sliver

00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:31.470
of what could be done.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.071
I think there's a whole set of dimensions.

00:38:33.071 --> 00:38:36.174
I think the people in this room
probably could think of ...

00:38:36.174 --> 00:38:37.703
You've been immersed in this from ...

00:38:37.703 --> 00:38:39.642
You're immersed in it right now,

00:38:39.642 --> 00:38:42.175
in whatever you want to call it, web 2.0.

00:38:42.175 --> 00:38:43.834
You understand this.
It makes sense to you.

00:38:43.834 --> 00:38:46.974
I think there's no reason
why everyone in this room

00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:48.882
couldn't do something similar,

00:38:48.882 --> 00:38:50.843
although I don't know in
what form it might take.

00:38:50.843 --> 00:38:54.338
We can talk more about that later.

00:38:54.338 --> 00:38:56.767
Khan Academy, that's the organic story

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:58.757
of how it happened, how I ended up here.

00:38:58.757 --> 00:39:00.978
Somewhere in there, I
showed up with the software

00:39:00.978 --> 00:39:03.176
and the videos at Ryanne's office.

00:39:03.176 --> 00:39:05.932
I said, "Can you use this
for the Peninsula Bridge?"

00:39:05.932 --> 00:39:07.970
At first, she's like,
"Does it work on Macs?

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.194
"Because we only have Macs. If
it doesn't work on Macs ..."

00:39:10.194 --> 00:39:12.017
(laughter) Actually, it didn't
work on Macs at the time,

00:39:12.017 --> 00:39:13.590
but I said, "Well, I think it does."

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:18.508
It's a little part of salesmanship
you have to learn early on.

00:39:18.508 --> 00:39:22.642
(laughter) Anyway. If you think, it's
not necessarily [unintelligible].

00:39:22.642 --> 00:39:25.851
(laughter) Anyway. We
got it working on Macs.

00:39:25.851 --> 00:39:27.176
It was used at Peninsula Bridge.

00:39:27.176 --> 00:39:29.457
Actually, that was a tremendously
powerful experience there,

00:39:29.457 --> 00:39:31.426
because at Peninsula Bridge,

00:39:31.426 --> 00:39:33.391
we saw that pattern that I saw with Nadia.

00:39:33.391 --> 00:39:35.626
There's a chart. Actually,
I'll show the chart.

00:39:35.626 --> 00:39:36.600
Well, I won't show the chart.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.458
It's small and all of that.

00:39:38.458 --> 00:39:40.497
The big takeaway ... and this leads

00:39:40.497 --> 00:39:42.432
into where education is going.

00:39:42.432 --> 00:39:46.266
Right now, when you learn,
there's just snapshots.

00:39:46.266 --> 00:39:48.042
You get assessed at certain
points in your life.

00:39:48.042 --> 00:39:51.044
Those assessments tell you
whether you're good at math

00:39:51.044 --> 00:39:53.432
or bad at math, or good at
reading or bad at reading.

00:39:53.432 --> 00:39:55.925
What we saw when we
dealt with the students

00:39:55.925 --> 00:39:59.644
at Peninsula Bridge, who had a
whole spectrum of backgrounds,

00:39:59.644 --> 00:40:02.825
is that when you started
everyone at 1+1=2,

00:40:02.825 --> 00:40:05.762
and then let them progress
at their own pace,

00:40:05.762 --> 00:40:06.950
that there were some students who had

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.103
just very, very basic deficiencies.

00:40:09.103 --> 00:40:11.133
They just didn't understand
negative numbers,

00:40:11.133 --> 00:40:13.515
or they didn't understand borrowing,

00:40:13.515 --> 00:40:15.014
or I guess it's called regrouping,

00:40:15.014 --> 00:40:16.182
or however you want to call it.

00:40:16.182 --> 00:40:18.231
They didn't understand
subtracting numbers.

00:40:18.231 --> 00:40:20.296
In a traditional learning model,

00:40:20.296 --> 00:40:22.191
when those students get to algebra ...

00:40:22.191 --> 00:40:25.482
I think they were rising
7th or 8th graders.

00:40:25.482 --> 00:40:27.425
You could have the best
algebra teacher on the planet,

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:29.758
and you can be the smartest
student on the planet,

00:40:29.758 --> 00:40:31.751
but if you are having a basic weakness

00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:35.626
in negative numbers,
or subtracting numbers,

00:40:35.626 --> 00:40:39.345
that conversation, you're just
going to be talking past each other.

00:40:39.345 --> 00:40:40.899
The teacher's going to get frustrated.

00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:42.781
The teacher's going to wonder
what they're doing wrong.

00:40:42.781 --> 00:40:44.176
The student's going to wonder,

00:40:44.176 --> 00:40:46.685
"Why do I not get this when
everyone else gets this?"

00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:48.726
The main issue is this core weakness,

00:40:48.726 --> 00:40:50.189
very early on in their careers,

00:40:50.189 --> 00:40:54.101
that can't be addressed the way
the current system is structured.

00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:55.479
Once again, it's no one's fault.

00:40:55.479 --> 00:40:58.901
It's all a by-product of being
able to get people in a room,

00:40:58.901 --> 00:41:02.766
and being able to have one
teacher teach 10, 20, 30 students.

00:41:02.766 --> 00:41:05.851
But, the exciting thing is
over the next 10, 15 years,

00:41:05.851 --> 00:41:08.433
through technology, I think
some of this can be addressed.

00:41:08.433 --> 00:41:09.892
When I talk about technology,

00:41:09.892 --> 00:41:11.827
I don't want to give anyone the impression

00:41:11.827 --> 00:41:14.319
that I want to take the
human out of the equation.

00:41:14.319 --> 00:41:15.732
I think it's the opposite.

00:41:15.732 --> 00:41:19.064
I think what technology
will allow us to do

00:41:19.064 --> 00:41:21.884
is let the human be the human,

00:41:21.884 --> 00:41:24.750
and the technology will
take away all the minutia,

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.844
take away all of the things that
it's hard for a teacher to do,

00:41:27.844 --> 00:41:30.671
whether it's writing
exams, or grading papers,

00:41:30.671 --> 00:41:35.124
or trying to assess what the core
weak points are in a student.

00:41:35.124 --> 00:41:36.513
Let the technology do that,

00:41:36.513 --> 00:41:38.833
and then let the teacher
go in and be that mentor,

00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:40.133
be what I was with Nadia.

00:41:40.133 --> 00:41:43.128
Guide them and really focus,

00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:45.253
and give them that
instruction that the videos

00:41:45.253 --> 00:41:47.250
and the software could never do.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.749
I want to make that very clear.

00:41:48.749 --> 00:41:51.589
Sometimes people see me as this background

00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:53.081
about potentially robot.

00:41:53.081 --> 00:41:54.996
I'm the kind of guy that people think

00:41:54.996 --> 00:41:57.226
wants robots to take over
the world, and whatever.

00:41:57.226 --> 00:41:59.885
(laughter) Nothing can be
further from the truth.

00:41:59.885 --> 00:42:02.942
One question I get a lot from,

00:42:02.942 --> 00:42:05.381
especially when I started off,

00:42:05.381 --> 00:42:08.842
was people asking, 1,"Why
are you doing this?"

00:42:08.842 --> 00:42:12.831
And 2, "How do you know
that this is working?"

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:14.522
I have a lot of data, and
I could show you the data,

00:42:14.522 --> 00:42:15.271
but that would bore you.

00:42:15.271 --> 00:42:19.251
The single-biggest thing that
I think has been motivating me,

00:42:19.251 --> 00:42:21.811
and I think has proved that it's working

00:42:21.811 --> 00:42:22.970
is some of the letters I get.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.648
I'll just read a couple of letters.

00:42:24.648 --> 00:42:26.026
I feel a little bit
awkward about doing this

00:42:26.026 --> 00:42:28.083
because it's kind of self-praise.

00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:31.550
My wife has made me very
conscientious about self-praise.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:38.772
(laughter) I want you to think
of how I would feel reading this,

00:42:38.772 --> 00:42:40.118
working at a hedge fund,

00:42:40.118 --> 00:42:41.429
where all day, the best thing I could get

00:42:41.429 --> 00:42:43.831
is maybe a couple extra
dollars bonus from my boss.

00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:47.159
He never writes me a letter
like this. (laughter)

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:49.659
Let me read. These are mind-blowing.

00:42:49.659 --> 00:42:51.996
The point here is I want you to realize

00:42:51.996 --> 00:42:53.780
that Internet and web technologies

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:59.089
can touch people in
tremendously meaningful ways.

00:42:59.089 --> 00:43:01.970
"Hello, Sal. My
12-year-old son has autism,

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.769
"and has had terrible time with math.

00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:07.015
"We've tried everything, viewed
everything, bought everything.

00:43:07.015 --> 00:43:08.727
"Well, we stumbled across
your video on decimals,

00:43:08.727 --> 00:43:12.244
"and it got through. Then we
went onto dreaded fractions.

00:43:12.244 --> 00:43:14.084
"Again, he got it. We couldn't believe it.

00:43:14.084 --> 00:43:17.142
"He was so excited. It's your
soothing voice and calm manner,"

00:43:17.142 --> 00:43:19.978
(laughter)

00:43:19.978 --> 00:43:23.978
"coupled with an easy-going
explanation and examples.

00:43:23.978 --> 00:43:27.732
"I can't say thank you
enough. You are a hero."

00:43:27.732 --> 00:43:30.267
Once again, I didn't jump
into a burning building.

00:43:30.267 --> 00:43:33.383
I didn't save someone's
kitten from a rooftop.

00:43:33.383 --> 00:43:35.457
I'm not G.I. Joe. (laughter)

00:43:35.457 --> 00:43:39.133
This person--while I'm sleeping,

00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:41.077
or eating lunch, or at work

00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:44.917
analyzing financial statements
for my hedge fund --

00:43:44.917 --> 00:43:46.510
this person is calling me a hero,

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:47.950
with no extra effort [unintelligible].

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.383
Here's another one.
I'll just read this one.

00:43:49.383 --> 00:43:52.803
This one is almost ... When I read this,

00:43:52.803 --> 00:43:54.379
this is pretty much what sealed the deal

00:43:54.379 --> 00:43:55.955
for me to quit my job.

00:43:55.955 --> 00:43:58.628
I got this in August of '09,
and I quit 2 weeks later,

00:43:58.628 --> 00:44:00.629
just because I realized if people
are being touched in this way,

00:44:00.629 --> 00:44:03.819
I've got to be able to figure
out a way to do this full-time.

00:44:03.819 --> 00:44:06.200
"Mr. Khan. No teacher
has done me any good.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.786
"This may sound harsh, but
I mean it quite literally.

00:44:08.786 --> 00:44:10.919
"I was force-fed medication
to keep me from talking,

00:44:10.919 --> 00:44:13.454
"and chastised for not
speaking out when called on.

00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:14.825
"Where I'm from, blacks are not welcome

00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.846
"with open arms into schools.

00:44:16.846 --> 00:44:18.757
"My mother and her sisters
had to go to a small shack,

00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:21.184
"2 hours from home, when
they went to school.

00:44:21.184 --> 00:44:23.760
"About 5 years ago, my
family collected enough money

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.392
"to move from where I was born,

00:44:25.392 --> 00:44:27.055
"so that I could have a
chance at an education,

00:44:27.055 --> 00:44:28.628
"and living a real life.

00:44:28.628 --> 00:44:30.362
"But, without a real
mastery of elementary math,

00:44:30.362 --> 00:44:31.962
"I was slow to progress.

00:44:31.962 --> 00:44:33.357
"I am now in college, and learning more

00:44:33.357 --> 00:44:35.257
"than I ever have in my life.

00:44:35.257 --> 00:44:37.081
"But an inadequate math background

00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:38.540
"has been holding me back.

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:40.709
"I found the Khan
Academy in June of 2009."

00:44:40.709 --> 00:44:42.258
This is literally 6 months ago.

00:44:42.258 --> 00:44:44.448
"Right after I had completed Math-141,

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:45.879
"a college algebra course,

00:44:45.879 --> 00:44:47.878
"I spent the entire summer
on your YouTube page.

00:44:47.878 --> 00:44:50.841
"I just wanted to thank you
for everything you're doing."

00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:52.697
Once again, "You are a Godsend."

00:44:52.697 --> 00:44:54.314
I don't know what to even say.

00:44:54.314 --> 00:44:57.295
That makes me feel awkward. (laughter)

00:44:57.295 --> 00:45:00.349
"Last week, I tested for
a math placement exam,

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:02.689
"and I am now in Honors Math-200."

00:45:02.689 --> 00:45:03.830
This is the [unintelligible].

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.836
"No question was answered incorrectly."

00:45:05.836 --> 00:45:09.194
This goes from someone
... It's mind-blowing.

00:45:09.194 --> 00:45:10.370
"My placement-test holder was so impressed

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:11.738
"by the breadth of my knowledge of math,

00:45:11.738 --> 00:45:13.910
"that he said I should
be in linear algebra.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:15.246
"Mr. Khan, I can say, with any doubt,

00:45:15.246 --> 00:45:19.486
"you've changed my life and the
lives of everyone in my family."

00:45:19.486 --> 00:45:21.837
This is happening through the Internet.

00:45:21.837 --> 00:45:23.243
This is something you can reach people.

00:45:23.243 --> 00:45:24.649
It doesn't have to be through education.

00:45:24.649 --> 00:45:26.522
I think any time that
you interact with people,

00:45:26.522 --> 00:45:27.872
and they can see humanity,

00:45:27.872 --> 00:45:30.867
you are fostering world peace.

00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:35.059
I want to finish off with
things that you can do.

00:45:35.059 --> 00:45:36.918
I promise I would throw
out some tangible ideas.

00:45:36.918 --> 00:45:39.399
The first thing is y'all
could do exactly what I did,

00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:41.327
teach things, even teach mathematics.

00:45:41.327 --> 00:45:42.928
Different types of teachers,

00:45:42.928 --> 00:45:44.839
people respond to different types

00:45:44.839 --> 00:45:46.427
of instruction all of the time.

00:45:46.427 --> 00:45:48.031
Your take on things
might connect with people

00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:49.616
and you in innovative ways.

00:45:49.616 --> 00:45:53.451
Teach English. There's no
better way to empower people

00:45:53.451 --> 00:45:54.874
in the developing world to participate

00:45:54.874 --> 00:45:57.152
in the global economy
than learning English.

00:45:57.152 --> 00:45:59.968
That's something I think
everyone in this room could do.

00:45:59.968 --> 00:46:01.436
Set up Skype buddies, so that
you can start interacting

00:46:01.436 --> 00:46:03.153
with people across the world.

00:46:03.153 --> 00:46:06.322
Even better, try to get
people in Iran and Israel

00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:07.658
to interact with each other,

00:46:07.658 --> 00:46:10.003
or Pakistan and India to
interact with each other.

00:46:10.003 --> 00:46:11.805
That is very tangible world peace.

00:46:11.805 --> 00:46:13.405
That's something that you can go home,

00:46:13.405 --> 00:46:15.557
right now, and do from your living room.

00:46:15.557 --> 00:46:19.347
You could ... One idea
that I threw out ...

00:46:19.347 --> 00:46:22.390
Record videos, little
screenplays, 3-minute videos,

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:23.936
and I think everyone in
this room collectively

00:46:23.936 --> 00:46:25.845
could get the job done
in a couple of weeks,

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:28.548
where y'all just use SAT words.

00:46:28.548 --> 00:46:31.217
Use them flagrantly. (laughter)

00:46:31.217 --> 00:46:34.680
The idea being ... It would be cheesy,

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.417
and it would be silly, and
it would be ridiculous,

00:46:37.417 --> 00:46:41.629
but I guarantee you, 1, to the
process of making those videos,

00:46:41.629 --> 00:46:44.427
you're going to do a lot better
on the SAT verbal section,

00:46:44.427 --> 00:46:47.202
but even more importantly,
it'll be used by your peers,

00:46:47.202 --> 00:46:49.238
probably future young women at Castilleja,

00:46:49.238 --> 00:46:50.678
and even more interestingly,

00:46:50.678 --> 00:46:53.054
I guarantee you, if they
are smart, and funny,

00:46:53.054 --> 00:46:56.338
but rough, and genuine, and human,

00:46:56.338 --> 00:46:59.233
that people all over the world,
very likely will start to use it,

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:04.117
and you will be empowering
them to perform well

00:47:04.117 --> 00:47:07.070
on things that really do matter.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.847
Hopefully, through my story ...

00:47:09.847 --> 00:47:14.734
and you do appreciate this idea
that y'all are in a position

00:47:14.734 --> 00:47:17.740
to go home right now,
without millions of dollars,

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.652
without governmental support,

00:47:19.652 --> 00:47:21.588
to start something that has the potential,

00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:22.988
over the next 5-10 years,

00:47:22.988 --> 00:47:25.115
to touch millions of people.

00:47:25.115 --> 00:47:27.717
Even if it doesn't touch millions
of people, you should ...

00:47:27.717 --> 00:47:29.746
If it just touches your direct community,

00:47:29.746 --> 00:47:31.003
and your direct friends and family,

00:47:31.003 --> 00:47:33.508
that alone makes it worthwhile.

00:47:33.508 --> 00:47:36.014
I thank y'all very much for having me.

00:47:36.014 --> 00:47:37.583
I'm open to any questions.

00:47:37.583 --> 00:47:45.034
(applause)

00:47:45.034 --> 00:47:46.827
If anyone has any questions or ...

00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:48.436
Oh. Yeah?

00:47:48.436 --> 00:47:50.300
Female: Do you think that
you'll ever do anything

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:54.244
like history lessons or English
lessons in Khan Academy?

00:47:54.244 --> 00:47:57.514
Sal: Yes. That's actually on
my to-do list on my whiteboard.

00:47:57.514 --> 00:47:59.461
I want history lessons,

00:47:59.461 --> 00:48:01.840
1, just because I think
there's this huge gap

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.968
between the news and what goes
on in history class right now,

00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:05.796
where the news is these
30-second sound bites,

00:48:05.796 --> 00:48:07.300
and history class, you start off

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.890
with Mohenjo-daro and Harappa.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.278
If you're lucky, you
might get to World War 2.

00:48:12.278 --> 00:48:14.656
There's this huge gap between that and ...

00:48:14.656 --> 00:48:15.893
I don't think that happens
here at Castilleja.

00:48:15.893 --> 00:48:18.304
I never got beyond World
War 2 in my history.

00:48:18.304 --> 00:48:21.179
That leaves this huge
gap in why is the world

00:48:21.179 --> 00:48:22.116
the way it is right now?

00:48:22.116 --> 00:48:25.059
Actually, I would like
to do a little 10 minutes

00:48:25.059 --> 00:48:27.251
on Israel and Palestine conflict,

00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:28.520
10 minutes on Indian ...

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:30.138
Obviously, these are very touchy issues,

00:48:30.138 --> 00:48:32.145
and I'm going to have a
lot of caveats out there.

00:48:32.145 --> 00:48:33.652
I actually have a whole set of videos

00:48:33.652 --> 00:48:35.225
on intelligent design and evolution.

00:48:35.225 --> 00:48:38.302
I keep [unintelligible].

00:48:38.317 --> 00:48:39.730
I don't want to skew your opinion.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.472
But anyway, I do intend to do that.

00:48:42.472 --> 00:48:45.659
I do want to do grammar.
I want to do everything.

00:48:45.659 --> 00:48:48.448
I think all of y'all should join in.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:51.354
Female: Sorry.

00:48:51.354 --> 00:48:55.399
Female: How do you know so
much on all of these subjects?

00:48:55.399 --> 00:48:56.795
(laughter)

00:48:56.795 --> 00:48:58.642
Sal: My wife would be
rolling her eyes right now.

00:48:58.642 --> 00:49:03.822
(laughter) There's a small set of things

00:49:03.822 --> 00:49:07.216
that I do know based on my background.

00:49:07.216 --> 00:49:11.953
I was a mathlete in high school,
on some level. (laughter)

00:49:11.953 --> 00:49:16.541
Other things, like biology,
I took the courses.

00:49:16.541 --> 00:49:18.889
I got an A in the course,
but that doesn't mean

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:21.072
I'm an expert on biology.

00:49:21.072 --> 00:49:23.456
What I do is ... and this
is what's really fun for me.

00:49:23.456 --> 00:49:25.800
The other aspect that really motivates me

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.463
is I get to sit and learn things

00:49:27.463 --> 00:49:28.918
when I never learned them before.

00:49:28.918 --> 00:49:33.367
For example, I did some videos
on entropy a few weeks ago.

00:49:33.367 --> 00:49:35.258
Entropy was something that
I never understood properly

00:49:35.258 --> 00:49:36.004
in high school.

00:49:36.004 --> 00:49:37.752
I could write the right words on the exam,

00:49:37.752 --> 00:49:40.532
but I never quite
understood what it meant.

00:49:40.532 --> 00:49:42.051
I literally pondered it for 2 weeks.

00:49:42.051 --> 00:49:43.884
I would call up my
thermodynamics professor friends

00:49:43.884 --> 00:49:45.267
at Standford and MIT.

00:49:45.267 --> 00:49:47.438
I was like, "Let's have a
conversation about entropy."

00:49:47.438 --> 00:49:49.653
We would do that. Then, over the
course of time [unintelligible],

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.951
I was like, "Okay. Now I get entropy,"

00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:52.522
and I would make the videos on them.

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.354
A lot of it, it's a
learning process for me,

00:49:54.354 --> 00:49:56.169
and that's what makes it so much fun.

00:49:57.246 --> 00:49:59.203
Female: Mr. Khan. Can you repeat
the questions that are asked?

00:49:59.203 --> 00:50:00.651
Sal: Oh. Sorry. Just so y'all know,

00:50:00.651 --> 00:50:02.465
the question was, "How do I know so much?"

00:50:02.465 --> 00:50:06.556
(laughter) That was the ... Yeah.

00:50:06.556 --> 00:50:08.497
Female: When exactly
did your YouTube videos

00:50:08.497 --> 00:50:11.283
become the brand, Khan Academy?

00:50:11.283 --> 00:50:13.093
When was that transition?

00:50:13.093 --> 00:50:14.598
Sal: Oh, you're one of the few people

00:50:14.613 --> 00:50:16.657
that refer to it as a
brand, but that's exciting.

00:50:16.657 --> 00:50:18.501
The question is, "When
did the YouTube videos

00:50:18.501 --> 00:50:22.105
"become the brand, Khan Academy?"

00:50:22.105 --> 00:50:25.416
I think I was at a birthday
party for a friend.

00:50:25.416 --> 00:50:26.838
He was the first person to say,

00:50:26.838 --> 00:50:28.209
"What you're doing with your cousins,

00:50:28.209 --> 00:50:29.942
"this is actually something
that could be generally useful.

00:50:29.942 --> 00:50:31.781
"You should do something with it,

00:50:31.781 --> 00:50:33.512
"make it into some type
of an organization."

00:50:33.512 --> 00:50:35.935
The Khan Academy is a
non-for-profit organization,

00:50:35.935 --> 00:50:37.312
but when he told me that,

00:50:37.312 --> 00:50:40.200
that was the first time that
I thought about the idea,

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:42.098
"Wow, this could be a virtual school,

00:50:42.098 --> 00:50:43.903
"or this could be something."

00:50:43.903 --> 00:50:45.608
Since it's a nonprofit organization,

00:50:45.608 --> 00:50:47.153
I was like, "Well, gee.
There's no ownership.

00:50:47.153 --> 00:50:48.907
"How do I make sure they
don't fire me one day?"

00:50:48.907 --> 00:50:50.769
I said, "Well, let me
name it after myself."

00:50:50.769 --> 00:50:57.397
(laughter)

00:50:57.397 --> 00:50:59.998
Female: How'd you develop a curriculum

00:50:59.998 --> 00:51:02.282
for each course that could be used

00:51:02.282 --> 00:51:05.696
for people all over the
world [unintelligible]?

00:51:05.696 --> 00:51:08.424
Sal: The question was, "How
did I develop a curriculum?"

00:51:08.424 --> 00:51:09.562
I actually get a lot of ...

00:51:09.562 --> 00:51:10.796
I actually talked to
the State of California,

00:51:10.796 --> 00:51:12.198
and that's the first question they asked,

00:51:12.198 --> 00:51:13.577
"Where's the curriculum come from?"

00:51:13.577 --> 00:51:15.486
It initially started very organically.

00:51:15.486 --> 00:51:17.835
It was math and science as I had known it,

00:51:17.835 --> 00:51:20.446
with the theory being if I'm able

00:51:20.446 --> 00:51:22.940
to convey that understanding
in those connections,

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.515
that that's a good understanding.

00:51:24.515 --> 00:51:27.745
YouTube had 10-minute time
limits on me, initially.

00:51:27.745 --> 00:51:30.478
That was super fortuitous because
it forced me to 10 minutes.

00:51:30.478 --> 00:51:32.241
What that allowed me to
do is make the concepts

00:51:32.241 --> 00:51:36.030
very granular and short.

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.126
Miami Dade County has actually used them

00:51:38.126 --> 00:51:39.491
for teacher training.

00:51:39.491 --> 00:51:41.814
It's very easy to map it to
almost any curriculum now

00:51:41.814 --> 00:51:45.597
because the videos just cover
one small concept at a time.

00:51:45.597 --> 00:51:47.616
You could say, "Oh. The standard 2.3.2

00:51:47.616 --> 00:51:50.531
"in the California Standards,
that's these 4 videos."

00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:52.614
I don't have ... but some of
the things I am doing now,

00:51:52.614 --> 00:51:53.945
I do look at textbooks.

00:51:53.945 --> 00:51:57.046
I do look at what the AP
Curriculum, the standards are,

00:51:57.046 --> 00:51:58.947
so I do try to make it so it's useful

00:51:58.947 --> 00:52:01.531
for tests that people are
going to have to take.

00:52:03.285 --> 00:52:05.372
Up there, in the [black].

00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:07.177
Female: How do you make it available

00:52:07.177 --> 00:52:09.233
to people [unintelligible]?

00:52:09.233 --> 00:52:11.551
Sal: The question is, "How
do I make it available

00:52:11.551 --> 00:52:14.482
"to people who don't speak English?"

00:52:14.482 --> 00:52:17.084
English is the only language I speak well.

00:52:17.084 --> 00:52:20.986
I can laughably speak
Hindi [unintelligible],

00:52:20.986 --> 00:52:22.755
but that wouldn't do the job.

00:52:22.755 --> 00:52:24.234
That's an excellent question.

00:52:24.234 --> 00:52:25.556
People have come out of the wood works.

00:52:25.556 --> 00:52:27.231
This is another thing I
actually forgot to talk about.

00:52:27.231 --> 00:52:28.368
People have come out of the wood works

00:52:28.368 --> 00:52:30.723
over the last 3 months to
start translating the videos.

00:52:30.723 --> 00:52:32.403
Because, in the videos,
you don't see my face,

00:52:32.403 --> 00:52:34.281
the translations work really well.

00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:35.545
They look like they were natively spoken.

00:52:35.545 --> 00:52:37.736
There's actually a chemistry
teacher in Uruguay,

00:52:37.736 --> 00:52:40.275
who has started translating
the chemistry videos.

00:52:40.275 --> 00:52:43.232
He set up a "Khan Academy
en Espanol" channel.

00:52:43.232 --> 00:52:45.017
It's just happening organically.

00:52:45.017 --> 00:52:49.093
Translators are [unintelligible]
Polish, German ...

00:52:49.093 --> 00:52:51.128
Once again, I'm doing nothing.

00:52:51.128 --> 00:52:52.737
All I'm just saying is, "Go ahead,"

00:52:52.737 --> 00:52:55.186
and people are translating it.

00:52:55.186 --> 00:52:56.776
Female: Do you still
find that there are some

00:52:56.776 --> 00:52:58.432
children who need personal tuition?

00:52:58.432 --> 00:53:00.327
Are you still doing that at all?

00:53:00.327 --> 00:53:04.143
Sal: I am no longer directly interfering.

00:53:04.143 --> 00:53:05.655
The question is, "Do I
find that there's still

00:53:05.655 --> 00:53:07.909
"some children who need personal tuition?"

00:53:07.909 --> 00:53:09.389
Kind of what I was used to doing

00:53:09.389 --> 00:53:11.159
with Nadia and her brothers.

00:53:11.159 --> 00:53:14.226
I still call them up and check in on them,

00:53:14.226 --> 00:53:17.310
but I haven't been doing
that 1-on-1 session

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:18.332
with them anymore.

00:53:18.332 --> 00:53:19.561
They're all in high school now.

00:53:19.561 --> 00:53:21.543
They've, I think, gotten over
their hurdles, but I' not.

00:53:21.543 --> 00:53:23.738
I think ... I don't want to make it sound

00:53:23.738 --> 00:53:25.388
like this solves all the problems.

00:53:25.388 --> 00:53:27.264
I think this gets a lot of
problems out of the way,

00:53:27.264 --> 00:53:29.937
so that the personal time with a teacher

00:53:29.937 --> 00:53:31.482
or a tutor can be a lot more productive.

00:53:31.482 --> 00:53:33.307
I'm sure there are people
who can always benefit

00:53:33.307 --> 00:53:36.188
from that personal instruction.

00:53:36.188 --> 00:53:40.074
Yeah. Right here. How about
you in front? Yeah. You.

00:53:40.074 --> 00:53:41.944
Female: When you're making the videos,

00:53:41.944 --> 00:53:43.689
how do decide which concept

00:53:43.689 --> 00:53:45.383
you're going to cover next?

00:53:45.383 --> 00:53:47.192
Sal: The question is,
"When I make the videos,

00:53:47.192 --> 00:53:50.929
"how do I decide what
concept I cover next?"

00:53:50.929 --> 00:53:52.426
Some of it ... I get emails all the time,

00:53:52.426 --> 00:53:53.174
and I take requests.

00:53:53.174 --> 00:53:54.258
I'm telling this to all of y'all.

00:53:54.258 --> 00:53:56.280
If y'all have a
particularly hairy problem,

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.665
that I haven't ... Send
it to me, seriously.

00:53:59.665 --> 00:54:02.586
I literally put your email up,
and we'll do a video on it,

00:54:02.586 --> 00:54:05.537
and it'll be up there.

00:54:05.537 --> 00:54:10.747
I do take requests, but
a lot of it is my mood.

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.512
I'm doing this almost out of ...

00:54:12.512 --> 00:54:14.841
It's fun for me, so I
do what's interesting,

00:54:14.841 --> 00:54:17.489
where I think a lot of people
would find value from it.

00:54:17.489 --> 00:54:19.950
The simple answer is,
what I feel like teaching

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.150
is what I teach, which is
a huge luxury, I think.

00:54:23.457 --> 00:54:24.569
Oh, you.

00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:26.125
Female: Where do you see
the Khan Academy going

00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:27.823
in the next 5 or 10 years?

00:54:27.823 --> 00:54:30.187
Sal: Yeah, where I see it going.

00:54:30.187 --> 00:54:32.095
I could talk for another hour.

00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:37.196
Right now, there's the videos.

00:54:37.196 --> 00:54:38.529
I intend to keep making videos,

00:54:38.529 --> 00:54:39.700
several hundred a year.

00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.285
I really want to cover everything.

00:54:41.285 --> 00:54:43.720
Oh, the question was, "Where
do I see Khan Academy going

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:45.300
"over the next 5, 10 years?"

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.947
I'm going to keep making videos.

00:54:46.947 --> 00:54:48.315
The software piece, I want to build out.

00:54:48.315 --> 00:54:50.283
I'm talking to some philanthropic groups

00:54:50.283 --> 00:54:53.385
about potentially being able to
hire a small team of engineers

00:54:53.385 --> 00:54:56.456
to build out the software
so people can practice,

00:54:56.456 --> 00:54:58.898
and we can get data on what
works and what doesn't work.

00:54:58.898 --> 00:55:02.264
Then, this actually ties into world peace.

00:55:02.264 --> 00:55:04.696
What I want to do is overlay
that with the community,

00:55:04.696 --> 00:55:06.779
where people are using the vidoes.

00:55:06.779 --> 00:55:08.403
People are using the software,

00:55:08.403 --> 00:55:09.737
but if they still don't get it,

00:55:09.737 --> 00:55:12.285
the site knows what they're
having difficulty with,

00:55:12.285 --> 00:55:14.369
and it can match them
up with someone else.

00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:16.294
You are a 9th grader in [Taron].

00:55:16.294 --> 00:55:19.341
You have trouble with
systems of equations.

00:55:19.341 --> 00:55:24.145
There's a brilliant teacher
who is a 10th grader,

00:55:24.145 --> 00:55:26.532
in Tel Aviv, and we'll
connect the two of you.

00:55:26.532 --> 00:55:27.912
Y'all will have a session.

00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:29.449
Y'all will talk about mathematics,

00:55:29.449 --> 00:55:31.445
and respect each other, and do well.

00:55:31.445 --> 00:55:33.058
As you can imagine, over time,

00:55:33.058 --> 00:55:35.636
that can foster a whole
set of other things.

00:55:35.636 --> 00:55:37.119
Actually, I'm talking to
these philanthropic groups

00:55:37.119 --> 00:55:39.551
because there's potential
of going to rural villages

00:55:39.551 --> 00:55:41.234
where you can't find algebra teachers,

00:55:41.234 --> 00:55:43.697
where students, even if you build them

00:55:43.697 --> 00:55:45.250
the best school on the planet,

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:46.303
and you give them the teachers,

00:55:46.303 --> 00:55:47.231
they're not going to show up

00:55:47.231 --> 00:55:48.644
because they have to
help out their families

00:55:48.644 --> 00:55:51.788
during the harvest, or
work, or whatever else.

00:55:52.957 --> 00:55:55.010
The idea is really have
a school-in-the-box,

00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:56.565
where kids can learn on their own time,

00:55:56.565 --> 00:55:58.312
and then the philanthropic group

00:55:58.312 --> 00:55:59.777
can actually take a step back,

00:55:59.777 --> 00:56:01.351
and the data comes back to them,

00:56:01.351 --> 00:56:03.644
and see what the kids in the
villages are actually doing.

00:56:03.644 --> 00:56:07.107
I envision this world-wide virtual school.

00:56:07.107 --> 00:56:08.159
That's my dream.

00:56:08.159 --> 00:56:09.866
It might even have physical incarnations.

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:11.656
But, the physical
incarnations are just places

00:56:11.656 --> 00:56:16.772
to plug into this world-wide
school that spans all continents.

00:56:16.772 --> 00:56:18.842
That's my dream.

00:56:19.793 --> 00:56:22.680
Any ... right there.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.297
Female: Have you ever felt like,

00:56:24.297 --> 00:56:25.981
with all the [unintelligible] and stuff,

00:56:25.981 --> 00:56:28.827
that you need to hire people to
help you with [unintelligible]?

00:56:28.827 --> 00:56:29.917
Sal: I have, many ... The question is

00:56:29.917 --> 00:56:32.958
"Have I ever thought that I need
to hire someone to help me?"

00:56:33.988 --> 00:56:37.440
The answer is, yes. I have.

00:56:38.701 --> 00:56:41.674
Right now, it's being
funded by the Salman Khan

00:56:41.674 --> 00:56:45.500
Bank of America checking
account, (laughter)

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:50.076
and they're pretty stingy. (laughter)

00:56:50.076 --> 00:56:51.769
I do want to hire people,

00:56:51.769 --> 00:56:53.144
especially on the software side.

00:56:53.144 --> 00:56:54.643
I've actually thought
about bringing other people

00:56:54.643 --> 00:56:57.172
for on the content side, even in English.

00:56:57.172 --> 00:56:58.968
It's actually harder than I thought.

00:56:58.968 --> 00:57:02.159
I have a lot of friends who would
probably be brilliant instructors,

00:57:02.159 --> 00:57:04.306
but something about the YouTube format,

00:57:04.306 --> 00:57:05.334
they start to freeze up.

00:57:05.334 --> 00:57:06.736
I think one of the big values about it

00:57:06.736 --> 00:57:07.892
is when I started making this,

00:57:07.892 --> 00:57:09.133
I wasn't getting paid to do it.

00:57:09.133 --> 00:57:10.966
It wasn't stressed about it.

00:57:10.966 --> 00:57:12.287
I was like, "This is for Nadia and Armand.

00:57:12.287 --> 00:57:13.866
"They're going to take what I give them."

00:57:13.866 --> 00:57:16.293
(laughter) I literally ...
I'm answering the phone.

00:57:16.293 --> 00:57:17.904
I'm talking to telemarketers on some

00:57:17.904 --> 00:57:19.041
of these early videos.

00:57:19.041 --> 00:57:21.038
It has this very ...

00:57:21.038 --> 00:57:23.716
You hear my wife yelling at me
sometimes in the background.

00:57:23.716 --> 00:57:24.676
(laughter) It's really low-key,

00:57:24.676 --> 00:57:27.171
but I think that's why
it's connected with people.

00:57:28.509 --> 00:57:31.525
The answer is I would like
to hire up a small team,

00:57:31.525 --> 00:57:33.781
probably 5 or 10 people, eventually.

00:57:34.529 --> 00:57:36.622
Oh, our last question.
Right there in the back.

00:57:36.622 --> 00:57:39.599
Female: Have you ever considered
visiting the rural areas

00:57:39.599 --> 00:57:43.334
where your videos are being
watched [unintelligible]?

00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:45.306
Sal: The question is, "Have
I ever considered visiting

00:57:45.306 --> 00:57:49.408
"the rural areas where the videos
are being watched firsthand?"

00:57:49.408 --> 00:57:51.695
I would love to do that.

00:57:51.695 --> 00:57:53.608
I have an irrational fear of flying,

00:57:53.608 --> 00:57:55.027
which I need to get over.

00:57:55.027 --> 00:57:58.128
Other than that, I would love to.

00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.295
In particular, the group in Uganda,

00:58:02.295 --> 00:58:03.472
they seem to be doing tremendously.

00:58:03.472 --> 00:58:05.807
They send me pictures all of the time,

00:58:05.807 --> 00:58:08.668
but nothing would be more
exciting than to do that.

00:58:08.668 --> 00:58:13.045
Actually, my mother's village,
which is outside of Calcutta,

00:58:13.045 --> 00:58:15.403
I would love to ...
they're apparently using it

00:58:15.403 --> 00:58:17.517
on some level over there as well.

00:58:17.517 --> 00:58:18.838
I would love to go visit there,

00:58:18.838 --> 00:58:21.883
and see how it's being used.

00:58:21.883 --> 00:58:26.286
Thank you, very much. (applause)
