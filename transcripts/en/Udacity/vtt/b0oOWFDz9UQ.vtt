00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.930
When we look at the plot, a few things

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.030
pop out right away. We can see a nonlinear

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.400
relationship. Maybe it's exponential or maybe it's something else.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.656
We can see that the dispersion or variance of

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:17.282
the relationship also increases as carat size increases. With

00:00:17.282 --> 00:00:19.298
just a quick look at the data we've learned

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:22.658
two important things about the functional relationship between price

00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:25.300
and carat size. We can add a linear trim

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.236
line to the plot by using the stat smooth function

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:32.515
with method equals lm. We can see that the linear

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.287
trend line doesn't go through the center of the data

00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.572
at some key places. It misses it here. It should

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:41.947
curve a little bit in the center of the relationship,

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.863
and it should slope up more toward the end. And

00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:47.671
if we tried to use this to make predictions, we

00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:50.695
might be off for some key places inside and outside

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.450
of the existing data that we have displayed.
