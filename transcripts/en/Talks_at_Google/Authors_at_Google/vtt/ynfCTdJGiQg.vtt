MALE SPEAKER: And
now, please join me

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.370
in welcoming Thunder Levin,
the writer of "Sharknado."

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.630
THUNDER LEVIN: Thank you, David.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.370
Thank all of you
for joining me today

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.160
for this most
important presentation.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.080
Since the beginning of
history, human society

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.620
has been held together by
a common language and frame

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.480
of reference provided by the
shared communal experience

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.354
of storytelling.

00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:30.770
From Neanderthals
sitting around a

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.810
campfire, to the
classic Greek plays,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.100
to the commoners
assembling for Shakespeare,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.440
to the works of
Hitchcock and Spielberg

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.730
playing for packed
movie theaters,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.400
those shared communal
experiences are

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.820
what held our society together.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.760
They gave people from disparate
backgrounds, cultures,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.410
and socioeconomic classes
a common framework

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.200
and understanding.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.410
Just a generation ago,
every man, woman, and child

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.240
in America was required to
watch the Tonight Show starring

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.410
Johnny Carson so that they would
know what everyone was talking

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.840
about the next morning.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.280
But as the technological
revolution of the internet

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.690
has fractured the way we consume
media, with people watching

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.330
what they want, when they want,
where they want, how they want,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.690
that water cooler
moment has been lost.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.500
If half your friends
cover their ears

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.920
when you start talking about
Game of Thrones on Monday

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.300
mornings because they
haven't seen it yet,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.990
you understand what
I'm talking about.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.060
And with that fracturing,
with that loss of the shared

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.700
communal storytelling
experience, and the resulting

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.910
loss of a common language, our
society began to break down.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.090
Friends no longer spoke face to
face, or even on the telephone.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.300
Instead, we poked each
other electronically.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.310
People no longer gather
together in groups,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.590
but instead posted
in chat rooms,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.160
without ever truly knowing
who they conversed with.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.470
And conversation itself
became a lost art,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.530
giving way to texts
and emoticons.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.930
And so our civilization careened
toward self destruction.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.560
Into this pre-apocalyptic
decline in July of 2013

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.510
came the most
unlikely of saviors.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.390
When a ridiculous TV movie
about a tornado of sharks

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.640
premiered on the SciFi channel,
the most surprising thing

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.810
happened.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.630
Our society as a whole
ground to a halt,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.430
and billions and billions
of people all over the world

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.550
flocked to Twitter
and began to converse.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.750
Our modern gods, also
known as celebrities,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.190
join the conversation.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.480
Such luminaries as Elizabeth
Banks, Will Wheaton,

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
Patton Oswalt, Olivia
Wilde, Judah Friedlander,

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.850
Damon Lindelof, the
producer of LOST,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.740
and even Mia Farrow
and Philip Roth

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.170
all tweeted about "Sharknado".

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.060
During the initial broadcast,
the Sharknado hashtag

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.790
generated over 5,000
tweets per minute.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.150
That night, the movie became
the first shared communal

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.280
storytelling experience
of the internet age.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.910
And by the next morning,
the water cooler moment

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.760
had been reinvented and society
had a new common language.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.180
Therefore in summary,
I'm sure you'll

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.770
agree that I'm not exaggerating
when I suggest what

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.800
the humble sci-fi movie
"Sharknado" has saved

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.930
civilization as we know it.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.036
Thank you for your time.

00:03:42.036 --> 00:03:45.382
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:48.620
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, Thunder.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.380
Well, thank you.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.770
It's hard to know how
to follow that up.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.460
THUNDER LEVIN: The
key to "Sharknado"

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.620
is that no one ever seems
to know when I'm kidding.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.000
So I like to just--

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.480
MALE SPEAKER: So while we
were sitting there watching

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.400
the trailer, you mentioned
that that opening scene, which

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.390
was cinematically criticized--

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.250
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes,
even in our promo,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.290
they pointed out that the
opening scene with the mafioso

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.476
had nothing to do with
the rest of the movie.

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:18.850
And that shouldn't
be surprising,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.620
because I didn't write it.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.490
I had one opening shot of a
Mexican fisherman on his boat

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.120
looking up at this huge
wave of sharks and saying,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.400
"necessito un barko mas grande,"
which obviously you can tell

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.441
is, "I'm going to
need a bigger boat."

00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:40.815
And then the wave crashed over
him and the sharks ate him

00:04:40.815 --> 00:04:42.310
and that was it.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.510
And it was just one shot.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.679
But when the director
came to shoot it,

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:47.220
this being a low
budget film and all,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060
he couldn't justify
renting a boat

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.890
and going out on the water,
and bringing the whole crew

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.410
and spending a day
just for one shot.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.200
So he invented the mafioso
scene sort of on the spot.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.810
And they just-- and I when
I watched the premiere

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.542
I hadn't seen the film.

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:06.000
I was watching at the beginning
of the movie thinking, what

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.860
the fuck is going on?

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.469
MALE SPEAKER: You're going to
edit that out in post, right?

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.010
THUNDER LEVIN: Oh,
you didn't tell me

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.134
I had to watch my language.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.580
MALE SPEAKER: So how did you
come to write "Sharknado"?

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.460
THUNDER LEVIN: You ask that
like it's an odd thing.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.420
It's funny, I had done a film
for the Asylum, the production

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.272
company, called "American
Warships," which

00:05:31.272 --> 00:05:32.230
they liked quite a bit.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.850
It was one of their more
successful productions.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.080
And so they asked me
what I wanted to do next.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.305
And I had a couple of things.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:40.180
I wasn't really sure.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.580
And they said we want you to do
this movie called Shark Storm.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.520
And I was like, why?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.450
Haven't we had
enough shark movies?

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.950
And so I turned it
down, especially

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.770
knowing that the Asylum has a
habit of playing their movies

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.300
completely straight.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.370
And I knew with
the budget that it

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.450
would have there was no way
it was not going to be cheesy,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.442
and people would laugh
at it instead of with it.

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.150
And so I was developing
some other ideas.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.790
And then like a month
later they came back to me

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.980
and they said, forget Shark
Storm, it's Sharknado.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.270
And I was like, what do sharks
have to do with the North

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.760
Atlantic Treaty Organization?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.860
Because I heard Shark NATO.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.420
And he said, no, no, no.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.980
Sharknado, a tornado
full of sharks.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.230
And I said, oh, well, that's
the most ridiculous thing

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.700
I've ever heard of.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.980
And as long as I can
do it that way, I'm in.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.190
And they recognized, despite
never doing tongue in cheek,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.260
that something called
Sharknado pretty much had

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.090
to be handled that way.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.570
And so then I just
had fun with it

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.252
and never expected
anything to come of it,

00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:49.710
or I would have
directed it myself,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.810
because I was originally
attached to direct it.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.410
And then something
strange happened.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.260
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so was the--
could I get the screen up here?

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.870
Was that response really
overwhelming for you?

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.910
Did you have any idea anything
like this could happen?

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.410
THUNDER LEVIN: It's
funny, because I

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.510
had I had joked with a friend--
after I wrote the script, I'd

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.300
finished the script like the
summer before, summer of 2012,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.190
and then went on to
do another project.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.560
Because I directed another film
in the jungles of Costa Rica

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.470
at the same time the Sharknado
was being shot in LA.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.110
But I remember joking to a
friend that someday, goddammit,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.420
I'm going to win an Oscar.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.160
And even then all
anyone will want

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.326
to talk to me about is this
crazy thing I've written

00:07:37.326 --> 00:07:38.544
called "Sharknado."

00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:39.960
MALE SPEAKER:
Little did you know.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.570
THUNDER LEVIN:
Little did I know.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.560
We had a hint that something
might be brewing about a week

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.130
beforehand.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.120
The commercials seemed to
be getting good response.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.950
And the press was
starting to pick up on it.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.510
I did a really fun
interview with io9

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.380
where they asked some
very serious questions

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.760
and I answered in the most
serious manner possible.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.060
And then July 4 came
around, and a couple

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.229
of friends who had gone to
different July 4 parties

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:14.770
called me up and
said that people had

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.760
been talking about "Sharknado."

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.280
And it hadn't aired yet.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.680
And I was like, they're
talking about "Sharknado"?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.080
How can that-- and then things
like this started happening.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.530
Yeah, but no, we
thought maybe it might

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.330
turn into a little cult hit.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.280
But when it blew up on Twitter
that night it was just surreal.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.030
We had-- nobody expected that.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.710
We went on Twitter
expecting 100 people.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.929
And 10 would be asking
us serious questions.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.370
And 90 would be telling
us how much we sucked.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.760
And that would be it.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.890
And then we tried to
get into the tweet,

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.420
and you just couldn't get
in, because there were just

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.510
so many tweets coming in.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.030
And then the celebrities
started getting in on it.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.040
And the most surreal
part of the night for me

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.750
was trading tweets
with Damon Lindelof,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:08.000
who was the producer of "Lost"
and also co-wrote "Prometheus."

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.240
He's the one who took
Prometheus from being

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.820
a true prequel to
"Alien" and turned it

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.050
into a not quite prequel.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.160
And so I ended up
trading tweets with him

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.640
because he said
that he was going

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.580
to write the sequel
to "Sharknado"

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:27.100
and have it done by the time
"Sharknado" was off the air.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:32.220
And so I countered that I hoped
he would let me be involved.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.990
But I thought the
rather than a sequel,

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.420
we should do a prequel,
only not quite.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.870
And he responded touche.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.100
And that just made my night.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.700
MALE SPEAKER: And since then
we've had the nado added--

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.520
THUNDER LEVIN: Nado is
added to everything.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.060
MALE SPEAKER: Did you ever
expect there to be a Twerknado?

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.730
THUNDER LEVIN: Is there?

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.830
MALE SPEAKER: There
is a Twerknado.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.300
THUNDER LEVIN: Well,
depending on who's doing it,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.174
I'd like to see that.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.660
MALE SPEAKER: So how do you
come up with this stuff?

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.069
I mean, do you wake up and
say, oh, yeah of course.

00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:07.360
I know how to fix that problem.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.375
A guy will jump into a flying
shark with a chainsaw, like--

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.750
THUNDER LEVIN: See, you say
that like it's something odd.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:18.260
It just makes
perfect sense to me.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.330
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
give us something--

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.538
THUNDER LEVIN: What do you
find illogical about that?

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.260
How would you handle
the situation?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.360
MALE SPEAKER: This is why
you're the interviewee

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.785
and I'm the interviewer.

00:10:28.785 --> 00:10:30.910
THUNDER LEVIN: You know,
people always ask me that.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.560
I don't know, I mean,
I don't do drugs.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.010
I wasn't drunk or
high when I wrote it.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.720
It's a matter of
taking a disaster

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.800
movie, a standard
disaster movie,

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.370
and following all the
rules of screenwriting.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.030
But when you get
to the point where

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.440
people say that's
not believable,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.990
you just keep going,
because it's "Sharknado."

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.710
And we could justify
just about anything.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.580
Now I should say that
in the first two films,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.210
and the first 80% of the third
film, everything that happens

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.220
is at least
theoretically possible.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.450
Highly unlikely, I'll
give you, but at least

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.690
theoretically possible.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.070
Once the sharks went into
space in the third one,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.465
we sort of lost that.

00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:20.340
MALE SPEAKER: You could
feel your credibility

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:21.400
kind of went out the window.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.316
THUNDER LEVIN: The thing
is that in the script

00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:26.460
for the third one, when the
sharks were blown into space,

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.040
they're blown up
with a lot of water.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.040
So when they get into
zero g, each shark

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.450
is in a globule of
water floating through.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.889
So it still made sense.

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:39.180
But when the director shot
it, he didn't-- I don't know

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:41.346
whether he made the choice
or the effects department

00:11:41.346 --> 00:11:42.920
couldn't do it,
but at some point,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.620
the globules of water were lost.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.550
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a loss for humanity.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.890
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah, so it
would have been scientifically--

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.660
MALE SPEAKER: But
it makes sense.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.500
THUNDER LEVIN: The
Jet Propulsion Lab,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.970
after the first movie,
the Jet Propulsion Lab

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.840
put out an article that was
supposed to debunk "Sharknado."

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.180
And all they really
did was end up saying,

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.700
well, yeah, it is
possible, we just

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.480
don't think it's
going to happen.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.230
MALE SPEAKER: You'd
think those guys would

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.944
be working on something else.

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:19.110
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, they
got to do important stuff.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.120
MALE SPEAKER: That's
true, that's true.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.530
Nothing could be more important.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.905
THUNDER LEVIN:
That's what I say.

00:12:22.905 --> 00:12:25.650
MALE SPEAKER: So with
this kind of fearless,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.650
over the topness, which is
what I love about the movies,

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.280
do you ever, before they
go on, are you ever worried

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.120
that the audience kind of
won't come for the ride.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.884
THUNDER LEVIN: Not anymore.

00:12:37.884 --> 00:12:40.050
MALE SPEAKER: Well, what
about before the first one?

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.508
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah, the first
one, I didn't expect anybody

00:12:42.508 --> 00:12:43.840
to watch it.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.060
And then when it blew
up, when we knew we'd

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.710
tapped into something, I guess.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.870
And the second one,
we just had fun with.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.620
And SyFy wanted it to take place
in New York, which was great,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.080
because I'm from New York.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.740
And so I got to sort of
play with the whole New York

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.490
versus LA thing.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.080
I'm very-- I live
in LA now, but I'm

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.610
very cynical about
life in Los Angeles.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.840
And I think that shows
in the first movie.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.310
And so when we
came to New York, I

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.340
wanted to make sure it
was the opposite of that.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.760
I wanted to show how the
whole city, you know,

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.590
would come together in
the event of a Sharknado.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.550
MALE SPEAKER: As
only New York can.

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.390
THUNDER LEVIN: As
only New York can.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.440
And that's kind of
a highbrow thing

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.410
to talk about for "Sharknado."

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:37.890
But there is real stuff
behind some of it.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.990
I'll tell you,
when we were first

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.950
talking about what
to do in the story,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.040
I had proposed that
we the Sharknado

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.590
be heading towards the
new World Trade Center.

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.050
And Finn would see this and go,
oh, hell no, not on my watch.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:55.800
And then the final,
the last stand

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.060
would have been
defending the new tower.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.120
And it was decided by
the powers that be,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.680
and I was willing to be
convinced on this, that that

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.010
might be a bit touchy.

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.010
And so we moved it to the
Empire State Building,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.770
which is more iconic anyhow.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.550
And I knew I wanted
the shark at the end

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.190
to be impaled on the spire.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.170
So it all worked out.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.710
MALE SPEAKER: Excellent.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.299
Now you're a huge
Yankee fan, I believe.

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:22.340
THUNDER LEVIN: Fuck yeah.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.160
Oh, you're going to have
to cut that out, too.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.060
MALE SPEAKER: Now, how
did the Mets come to--

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.540
THUNDER LEVIN: I
don't know how you're

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.890
going to do with the
product placement.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.056
We'll have to blur out the--

00:14:30.056 --> 00:14:33.030
MALE SPEAKER: We have
technology for that.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:37.100
THUNDER LEVIN: I mean, you
guys don't own Coke yet?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.772
MALE SPEAKER: We're focused.

00:14:38.772 --> 00:14:40.810
We're focused.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.880
So anyway, so how
did the Mets come

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.560
to be featured in "Sharknado 2"?

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.234
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah, that
was disappointing for me.

00:14:48.234 --> 00:14:49.650
It was supposed
to be the Yankees.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.230
It was written as the Yankees.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.170
The guy who hits the shark into
the bleachers for the home run

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.499
was supposed to be Derek Jeter.

00:14:58.499 --> 00:15:00.040
MALE SPEAKER: You
couldn't get Derek?

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.590
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, we couldn't
get any-- the Yankees said,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.334
oh, hell no.

00:15:03.334 --> 00:15:05.750
I mean, I think that's where
the title for the third movie

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.080
came from, was the Yankees'
reaction to "Sharknado."

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.630
And the Mets said,
yeah, come on.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.680
So what's funny is that
you'll notice there's actually

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.980
a little goof when they're
taking the train back

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.079
from-- it's not Shea
Stadium-- Citi Field.

00:15:25.079 --> 00:15:26.120
MALE SPEAKER: Citi Field.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.230
THUNDER LEVIN: On the 7 train,
it stops at 96th Street,

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.080
and that's because
the art department

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.080
had been working from
the original script

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.740
and had made the
96th Street signs.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.350
And there wasn't
time to change it

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.220
when we ended up going with
the Mets on the 7 train.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.440
So yeah, that was too bad.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.140
MALE SPEAKER: That is too bad.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.560
Well, it's Derek's loss.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.260
THUNDER LEVIN: I think so.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.719
MALE SPEAKER: So
I have to ask you.

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:52.884
THUNDER LEVIN: No you don't.

00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:55.730
MALE SPEAKER: What is the
origin of the name Levin, which

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:56.830
in Middle English means--

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.413
THUNDER LEVIN: No,
no, don't go there.

00:15:58.413 --> 00:15:59.070
Oh my god.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:15:59.600
Yeah.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.850
MALE SPEAKER: Means lightning.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.370
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes,
the dark secret

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.210
of my family, which
my parents swear

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.790
they didn't know when they
named me thunder is that Levin

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.810
actually means lightning.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.220
And I found that out to my great
dismay sometime in high school.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.749
Somebody had looked it up
and confronted me with it.

00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:17.540
And I was like, no.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.910
MALE SPEAKER:
Before the internet?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.695
THUNDER LEVIN:
Before the internet.

00:16:19.695 --> 00:16:22.100
Yeah, they found an
unabridged dictionary.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.130
And I was like,
no, that can't be.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.500
My parents wouldn't
do that to me.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.465
Well, as it turns out--

00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:31.970
MALE SPEAKER: So
other than that,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.980
how did your parents
influence your career?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.240
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, I
guess like any good parents

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.030
in the '60s and
'70s they told me

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.970
I could do whatever
I wanted to do.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.810
And there was no pressure
to go into something where

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.014
I might actually make a living.

00:16:50.014 --> 00:16:51.430
MALE SPEAKER: They
weren't looking

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.520
for a lawyer or a doctor.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.460
THUNDER LEVIN: No, no.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.470
Well, my father
was a journalist.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:59.280
And my mother was basically
a housewife and a homemaker.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.230
But she was a big
science fiction fan.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.105
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:03.770
THUNDER LEVIN: And
that influenced me.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.380
Her father, my grandfather
on my mother's side, which

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:13.619
would be my mother's father,
was one of the founding members

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:16.200
of the British
Interplanetary Society,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.550
along with Arthur C.
Clarke and some others.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.230
So science fiction runs
in the family, apparently.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.530
And so the one show
that she let me

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.190
stay up late to watch when
I was a very little kid

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.440
was the original Star Trek.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.390
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, good taste.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.181
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes.

00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:35.210
And so that's where
it started, I think.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.900
Somebody gave me a book called
"The Making of Star Trek".

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.630
And again, I was like
knee high to an ant.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.845
And it was way too dry
for a little kid to read.

00:17:44.845 --> 00:17:46.470
I'd probably only
just learned to read.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.011
So the first thing I did was I
turned to the picture section.

00:17:49.011 --> 00:17:51.660
And I was just old
enough to understand

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.380
that I wanted to be
Captain Kirk or Mr. Spock.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.490
And I was just old enough to
understand that I couldn't,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.340
because I was also
watching the Apollo

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.910
mission at the same
time, and it was

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.750
hopelessly crude and primitive.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.950
And I didn't want
anything to do with that.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.380
But then someone
gave me this book

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.610
and I opened it to the picture
section, the very first picture

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.068
in "The Making of
Star Trek", and I

00:18:12.068 --> 00:18:14.850
think it's still in
print, is a bunch

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.650
of studio technicians working
on the bridge of the Enterprise

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.720
in their 1960s shirts sleeves.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.850
And suddenly in my
little mind it clicked,

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.970
I can work on the enterprise.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.510
And that's where it all started.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.030
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.520
And so you--

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.830
THUNDER LEVIN: Are these
cards color coordinated?

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.464
MALE SPEAKER: They are
color coordinated by topic.

00:18:38.464 --> 00:18:39.380
THUNDER LEVIN: Really?

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:39.840
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.214
THUNDER LEVIN:
That's impressive.

00:18:41.214 --> 00:18:43.385
So you come to Google
for this kind of stuff.

00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:46.010
MALE SPEAKER: Actually, they're
not quite in the Google colors.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.440
I kind of goofed that.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.731
THUNDER LEVIN: Oh, well,
you're going to get fired now.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.180
MALE SPEAKER: So what was
the first film you really

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.640
fell in love with?

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.992
THUNDER LEVIN: First movie?

00:18:59.992 --> 00:19:00.950
That's a good question.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.326
I don't have a good
answer to that.

00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:08.450
MALE SPEAKER: You have a
good answer to everything.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:10.520
THUNDER LEVIN: Well,
I mean the first film

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:17.230
that really made an impression,
a life altering impression,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.330
was "Star Wars."

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:22.640
But that wasn't the first
movie I'd ever seen.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.530
It wasn't the first movie
that made me start thinking.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.600
There was a movie
called "Silent Running."

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.070
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.770
Bruce Dern?

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.770
THUNDER LEVIN: With Bruce
Dern and these robots.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.120
I'm convinced that's we're
Lucas got the idea for R2D2

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.140
was the drones in
"Silent Running."

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.040
And "2001."

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.681
Yeah, but I mean it
was "Star Trek" on TV,

00:19:48.681 --> 00:19:50.930
and then it was seeing "Star
Wars" for the first time.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.580
Because you know, in the '70s,
movies were dark and serious.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.350
Even the comedies were dark.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:58.820
And "Star Wars"
was the first movie

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.730
where you really got to have
fun in the theater, I think,

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.220
for a long time.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.275
It was all Scorsese and "Taxi
Driver" and "French Connection"

00:20:08.275 --> 00:20:09.470
and I don't know.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:15.770
And so "Star Wars" really kind
of turned things around for me.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:20.030
Made it seem-- also, the
publicity behind Star Wars

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.940
involved George Lucas so
much that suddenly here was

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.170
a guide for an actual career.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.510
Somebody had done this.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.011
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah.

00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:31.510
THUNDER LEVIN: And so it seemed
like a little more realistic

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.304
choice.

00:20:32.304 --> 00:20:34.970
MALE SPEAKER: Suddenly it seemed
like you could be George Lucas.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.594
THUNDER LEVIN: Well,
that was the plan.

00:20:36.594 --> 00:20:39.144
It didn't work out
quite that way.

00:20:39.144 --> 00:20:40.310
MALE SPEAKER: Well, not yet.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.910
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, not yet.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.970
But I mean, they keep making
all these new "Star Wars" movies

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.830
now and they're not hiring me.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.620
So, I mean, that
was my original plan

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.590
is I was going to
direct Episode Two.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.980
I figured Lucas would
want to do one himself

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.527
when he finally came back to it.

00:20:54.527 --> 00:20:56.110
But I was going to
direct Episode Two.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.190
That was the career plan.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.036
It didn't work out.

00:20:58.036 --> 00:21:00.660
But as it turns out, I probably
should have, because he kind of

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.704
screwed things up.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.305
MALE SPEAKER: I you're
watching, this is your man.

00:21:08.305 --> 00:21:08.930
So your first--

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.610
THUNDER LEVIN: Wait,
where are the cameras?

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:11.818
MALE SPEAKER: They're hidden.

00:21:11.818 --> 00:21:14.040
THUNDER LEVIN: They're hidden.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:19.210
MALE SPEAKER: Your first feature
was "Mutant Vampires Zombies

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.074
From the Hood," or--

00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.490
THUNDER LEVIN:
You've got to pause

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:23.782
before you say "from the hood".

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:25.239
MALE SPEAKER: From
the hood, sorry.

00:21:25.239 --> 00:21:27.120
THUNDER LEVIN: It's
"Mutant Vampires Zombies

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.830
From the Hood."

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.867
MALE SPEAKER: Or
MVZTH for short.

00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:33.200
THUNDER LEVIN: Exclamation mark.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.680
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.670
So how did that kind of
play into "Sharknado"?

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.270
What did you bring
from that experience?

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.935
What did you learn from that?

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.310
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, the main
thing about the zombie film

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.080
was that we knew we weren't
going to have a lot of money.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.190
And so first I didn't
want to do anything

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.860
that we couldn't pull off.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.460
But second, I
wanted to make sure

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.294
that if we did do anything
that we couldn't pull off,

00:21:58.294 --> 00:21:59.710
and it might look
cheesy, I wanted

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.300
to make sure the audience
was laughing with us instead

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.440
of at us.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.240
So I make sure to
incorporate humor throughout.

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.810
And obviously that was the
same plan for "Sharknado."

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.810
But nobody dived into a
zombie and cut their way out.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.734
MALE SPEAKER: There were some--

00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:21.900
THUNDER LEVIN: There were
some questionable elements

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.210
in that film, if that's
what you're getting at.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.251
MALE SPEAKER: No, no, I
wasn't going to say that.

00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:29.480
I was going to say it did
have some unique moments.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.790
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.045
Don't let your kids watch it.

00:22:34.045 --> 00:22:35.420
MALE SPEAKER: But
also, actually,

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.000
when I watched
the trailer again,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.430
it sort of resonated
the gang violence,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.520
and the police brutality
and everything.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.100
And the teaming up of
the police and the gangs.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.064
It kind of resonates with
things happening today.

00:22:52.064 --> 00:22:53.480
THUNDER LEVIN:
Yeah, I mean people

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.021
don't understand that I'm making
socially relevant commentary

00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:58.440
in my films.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.770
MALE SPEAKER: The best
commentary is disguised.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.095
So if you could go
back in time to--

00:23:06.095 --> 00:23:07.204
THUNDER LEVIN: I can.

00:23:07.204 --> 00:23:08.120
MALE SPEAKER: You can?

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.245
THUNDER LEVIN: That's how
I made "Sharknado" a hit.

00:23:10.245 --> 00:23:12.760
When it first came
out, nobody watched.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.979
So I went back in
time and fixed things.

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:17.270
MALE SPEAKER: That makes sense.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:20.200
Well, so maybe you've done this
already, but I'll ask anyway.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.537
So, if you could go back--

00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:24.870
THUNDER LEVIN: See now, if
we had planned this properly,

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.090
you would have told me
what you're about to say

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:29.550
and I would have started
saying it before you asked me.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.500
MALE SPEAKER: What
a lost opportunity.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.708
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah, oh well.

00:23:31.708 --> 00:23:33.450
I'm sorry, go ahead.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.950
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to try
again to ask my question now.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.015
THUNDER LEVIN: I'm sorry.

00:23:38.015 --> 00:23:40.640
MALE SPEAKER: So if you could go
back in time to when you first

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.989
arrived in LA, what career
advice would you give yourself?

00:23:44.989 --> 00:23:45.780
THUNDER LEVIN: Wow.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.720
You know, people now, film
students and wannabe writers

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.530
keep asking me for advice.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:01.330
And I'm really not sure what
the answer is because everything

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.650
I did seemed to make sense.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.540
It just took a lot
longer to get where

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.590
I wanted to be than I expected.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.040
I don't have any good advice.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.541
MALE SPEAKER: Well, at least
you got where you wanted to be.

00:24:15.541 --> 00:24:16.748
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, not yet.

00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:18.068
I haven't directed "Star Wars."

00:24:18.068 --> 00:24:20.730
MALE SPEAKER: OK, well, close.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.420
THUNDER LEVIN: Working on it.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.270
MALE SPEAKER: So what
other projects are brewing

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.280
in the moment of Thunder Levin?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.490
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, I'm
pitching two TV series.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:34.890
One is a serious,
post-apocalyptic-- not

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.810
post-apocalyptic, apocalyptic.

00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:38.400
It's the end of the
world is happening

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.920
sort of in slow motion.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.370
And my agent has
that out right now.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.200
I've got another series
that's more like "Sharknado."

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.560
It's sort of tongue in cheek.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.250
I've been describing
it as "Star Trek" meets

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.620
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest" in a submarine.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:03.310
Basically a group of escaped
US Navy mental patients

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:06.700
hijack an experimental
deep diving submarine

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.910
and are then the only
people in a position

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.260
to save the world
when mysteriously

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.290
the surface of the oceans
start freezing over.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.280
And they discover all
sorts of strange worlds

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.820
at the bottom of the sea.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.730
And eventually, they
discover that aliens

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.160
are terraforming our plan
and they have to save us.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.370
But that takes a while.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.670
MALE SPEAKER: So once again,
staying within the bounds

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.450
of the possible.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.940
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.930
MALE SPEAKER: And I've
heard there's been

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.120
talk of a "Sharknado" musical.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.030
THUNDER LEVIN:
Well, I'll tell you,

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.630
ever since the
first movie blew up

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.390
and we started talking
about a sequel, myself

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.520
and the director,
we've both been pushing

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.730
to do Sharknado the musical.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.130
My suggestion for the
title for the second one

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.810
was Sharknado 2,
The Great White Way.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:00.650
And they didn't go for it.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.210
And then like right around
when the third movie came out,

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:07.980
the powers that be started
talking about maybe

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.870
we should turn this
into a Broadway musical.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.140
And so the director and I
got very excited about that.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.200
And then nothing has
really come of that.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.770
And then about a
week or two ago I

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:25.030
was-- a fellow classmate,
Richard Tucksmith,

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.960
appeared out of
nowhere, and said hey,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.570
are you going to this
musical called Shark Attack?

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:34.650
It's the unauthorized
parody of "Sharknado."

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.340
And I had not heard about
it, but I got my tickets

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:39.150
and I went.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.450
And it was a staged reading.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.050
They were trying
to get investors.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.770
But this show was great.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:45.040
I mean, it was funny.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.100
It was well written.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.480
The songs were catchy.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.000
And so I emailed the
powers that be and said,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.197
look guys, if we don't do
our own musical very quickly,

00:26:57.197 --> 00:26:58.530
it's going to become irrelevant.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.480
Because if these
guys get to Broadway,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.530
there isn't going to be room
for a real Sharknado musical.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.830
And so we should-- if
we're not doing our own,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:10.450
we should just license
the title to them

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.080
and let them put the
real title on it.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.810
Yeah, so I'd love
to do a musical.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.430
I started in musical theater
in high school and college.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:19.750
MALE SPEAKER: I remember that.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.380
THUNDER LEVIN: And the material
just lends itself to song.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.729
MALE SPEAKER: To song, yes.

00:27:24.729 --> 00:27:27.020
I think that's what everybody
thought when they saw it.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.660
THUNDER LEVIN:
Obviously, and dancing.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:33.200
And background dancers dressed
up as sharks, spinning around.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.290
I mean, it would be great.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.390
Actually, the one thing I liked
about this shark attack musical

00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.040
is they took Tara
Reid's character

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.690
and made her touching
and sympathetic,

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.390
and gave her real
depth, which I had

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.770
done in the original script.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.289
Because it was actually kind
of a love letter to my ex-wife.

00:27:56.289 --> 00:27:58.080
And it was about how
these two people would

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.430
come together and find
out that they still

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:04.680
worked well together, and
they still had that chemistry.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.810
And then I guess when Tara got
cast, that kind of went out

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:10.440
the window.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.500
And suddenly she
became a lot bitchier

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.110
and Nova sort of
became the heroine--

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.820
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.444
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah, so I liked
seeing that in the musical.

00:28:23.444 --> 00:28:25.360
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I
hope we get to see that.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.651
THUNDER LEVIN: So anyhow, yeah.

00:28:26.651 --> 00:28:29.410
If you see Shark Attack
the musical come out,

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:31.830
it will still be
unauthorized, but go see it,

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.850
because it was really good.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.990
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:40.980
So were there any scenes,
anything that you really

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:45.190
regret winding up on
the cutting room floor,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.500
literally or metaphorically?

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.000
THUNDER LEVIN: There
was nothing that

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.250
got on the cutting room floor.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.320
There were scenes that
we couldn't shoot,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.470
that just were clearly
beyond our ability.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.120
In the first movie
there was a scene

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.600
where Beverly Hills
was completely flooded.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.660
And they were driving
their car through.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.620
And they ran into this
agent who was on his phone.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.880
And they yell at him, there
are sharks in the streets.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.860
And he's like, no kidding,
you wouldn't believe

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.800
this deal I just closed.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.180
And then he gets eaten.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:19.605
And in the second one,
there was a whole act,

00:29:19.605 --> 00:29:26.040
a whole set piece that got
cut, where the wave is washing

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.200
over Manhattan, and
Rockefeller Center skating rink

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.290
gets flooded.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.730
And they're all thrashing,
trying to get out of the water.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.080
And the sharks are coming in.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.160
And that's when Tara
Reid shows up and says,

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.710
hey guys, need a hand?

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.630
And helps rescue them.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.510
And then they're in
a boat going down

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.310
to the Empire State Building.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.050
And then the boat-- something
happens to the boat,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:56.270
so Finn finds a
hot dog stand car.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.530
And he turns it upside
down they climb in

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:02.710
and they surf down Fifth Avenue
in this upturned hot dog cart

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.211
umbrella.

00:30:03.211 --> 00:30:05.334
MALE SPEAKER: Once again,
staying within the bounds

00:30:05.334 --> 00:30:06.060
of the possible.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.851
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.240
Yes.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.040
It makes sense.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.870
MALE SPEAKER: So
speaking of cars,

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.360
this is a shared
passion of ours,

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.400
you wrote a film titled 200 MPH.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.490
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.740
MALE SPEAKER: How do you
feel about self-driving cars?

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.112
THUNDER LEVIN: I don't
care for the idea.

00:30:28.112 --> 00:30:30.070
MALE SPEAKER: I thought
that might be the case.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.600
THUNDER LEVIN: They can
drive my car when they pry it

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.710
from my cold, dead hands.

00:30:38.726 --> 00:30:40.100
MALE SPEAKER: And
finally I guess

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.800
I wanted to-- since you've
both written and directed

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.933
and both together--
which of those do

00:30:45.933 --> 00:30:48.570
you find more difficult to do?

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:50.359
Which comes easier?

00:30:50.359 --> 00:30:51.900
THUNDER LEVIN: Well,
I mean directing

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.660
is physically a lot harder.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.640
I mean, you're working
16 hours a day.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.090
The stress is extraordinary.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.870
I've described
directing a feature film

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.680
as the most intense
thing a human being can

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.180
do short of going to war.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.320
And in fact, a film crew
is organized very much

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.750
like an army.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:15.320
So it's a lot harder.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.590
Writing, you're sitting at home
in your pajamas at a computer.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.090
What's hard about that?

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.979
When people start
screwing with your work

00:31:22.979 --> 00:31:24.770
and giving you notes
that don't make sense,

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:27.940
that gets a bit challenging.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.690
Now, directing is a
lot harder, but I also

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.900
find a lot more fulfilling.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.470
I was supposed to
direct "Sharknado."

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:35.620
And in hindsight,
maybe I should have.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:46.720
But since it, I've sort
of become re-pigeonholed

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.760
as a writer.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.670
Whereas I was always a director
first and writer second.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.290
And so actually, that's
my plan for this year

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.050
is to get back in
the director chair.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.142
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:31:58.142 --> 00:32:04.070
Well, on that note, thank you
very, very much, Thunder Levin.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:08.070
And we'll turn it over to the
audience now for questions.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.686
THUNDER LEVIN: Raise your hands.

00:32:09.686 --> 00:32:11.185
MALE SPEAKER: I
think go to the mic.

00:32:11.185 --> 00:32:13.250
THUNDER LEVIN: Oh, we
have a mic, excellent.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.510
Oh, and a spotlight.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.550
Hey, you made the big time.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.270
AUDIENCE: For "Sharknado
3," who did you imagine

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.790
would play the president?

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:25.074
And how did you feel about
Mark Cuban's performance there?

00:32:25.074 --> 00:32:26.490
THUNDER LEVIN: I
loved Mark Cuban.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:27.600
I thought he was great.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:35.590
I wanted-- it was a pipe dream,
but I wanted Harrison Ford

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.050
to play the president.

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:40.970
That just seemed obvious to me.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:43.900
And then the director had an
idea that I thought was great.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:45.960
He wanted Bill Murray.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.000
And the idea was-- I
don't know if any of you

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.340
are old enough to remember
the "Saturday Night Live"

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.040
sketch where Lorne Michaels
comes on and holds up

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:01.110
a check for $3,000 and asks
the Beatles to reunite,

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.052
and he would pay them $3,000.

00:33:03.052 --> 00:33:05.010
And they could divide it
up anyway they wanted.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.570
They could give Ringo less.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.520
Whatever.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.420
And so he was trying to get
them to come down to the studio

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.730
because he knew they were
all in New York that night

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.460
and perform.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:19.130
And so we were going to
do a YouTube video making

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.089
the same pitch to Bill Murray.

00:33:21.089 --> 00:33:22.880
Because you know, he
doesn't have an agent.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.380
The only way you get
Bill Murray in your movie

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.370
is you call an 800 number.

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:28.730
You leave a message.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.370
And you try and intrigue him.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.530
And he's traveling around--

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:32.890
MALE SPEAKER: For real?

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:33.510
THUNDER LEVIN: Yeah.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:34.843
He's traveling around the world.

00:33:34.843 --> 00:33:37.510
He doesn't even have a
home address, apparently.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.940
And he checks his messages.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.090
And if something sounds
fun to him, he'll do it.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.980
So we thought if
we did this YouTube

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:47.170
video it might get to him and
he might be tickled by it.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:52.320
But then SyFy wouldn't
let us announce

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.900
that we were doing the film,
or that the director and I were

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.050
involved until they were--
until their PR machine was

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:03.220
ready to make the announcement.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.110
And by then it was too late.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.300
And so we just started
casting around.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.520
At one point they were
talking about Donald Trump.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.940
And I said, that's
not realistic at all.

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:19.270
And Mark Cuban was actually
cast at the very last minute.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.360
We were shooting in LA.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.179
He was in New York.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.560
They got to him
the night before,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.870
and he said I'd love to do it.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:28.000
And they said, well,
the only problem is

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.330
we need you tomorrow morning.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.621
And he said, that's no problem.

00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:31.840
I'll just get on my plane.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.480
And he was there
the next morning.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.810
And I thought he
did a great job.

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.969
I asked him at lunch if he ever
thought about running for real.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:42.010
And he said, no, there
are way too many skeletons

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.576
in my closet for that.

00:34:44.576 --> 00:34:45.409
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.242
THUNDER LEVIN: Sure.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.128
MALE SPEAKER: Oh come on,
someone else be brave.

00:34:52.128 --> 00:34:54.544
THUNDER LEVIN: Now what made
you choose to go to that mic?

00:34:54.544 --> 00:34:55.570
AUDIENCE: It's closer.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:57.340
THUNDER LEVIN: OK.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.732
But that was already broken in.

00:34:59.732 --> 00:35:00.940
AUDIENCE: It's true.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:05.306
Let's see, so with three
Sharknado movies now,

00:35:05.306 --> 00:35:06.680
and there's going
to be a fourth.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:07.740
THUNDER LEVIN: There is.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.320
AUDIENCE: Do you
ever wonder if maybe

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.760
with the space scene
in the third movie

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.240
that maybe you've
jumped the shark?

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.310
THUNDER LEVIN: OK, from
the beginning people

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.670
have been saying
sharks in space.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.710
So I felt like we had to do it.

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:29.860
And people have been saying, we
need sharks with frickin' laser

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.920
beams on their heads.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.090
So there's no telling
what might happen.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:43.440
No, I do I don't think we jumped
the shark for the simple reason

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:47.110
that this is a movie
about jumping the shark.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.870
I'm not convinced
there's anything

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:51.500
we can do that goes too far.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.940
On the first one, when I
was writing the script,

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.650
and I would get feedback
from the producer saying,

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.780
I think you might be
going a little too far,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.060
I would just respond with
the same one sentence reply,

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.580
it's Sharknado, we
can't go too far.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.260
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.740
Well, going once.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.100
THUNDER LEVIN: That's it?

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.090
I like your hat, by the way.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:19.160
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, come on.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.949
Don't be shy.

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:23.490
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask, going back

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.320
to your opening remarks,
if you think that-- this

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.589
is a serious question.

00:36:28.589 --> 00:36:29.380
If you think that--

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.670
THUNDER LEVIN: Sharknado
is a very serious business.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.360
AUDIENCE: I know, right?

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.860
I wanted to ask if you thought
that the low budget, made

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.330
for TV movie had
a permanent place.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:39.160
And if you sort of
thought that there

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.740
could be a cultural phenomenon
like around those again,

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.990
or if "Sharknado" was this
unique thing that can--

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.720
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, I think
now that it's happened,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.330
people have been trying to
figure out how to replicate it.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:54.069
And it's too late,
because it's happened.

00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:55.360
You've got to do something new.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.859
You've got to do
something different

00:36:56.859 --> 00:36:59.570
if you want to have
that kind of impact.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:06.880
You can't-- I mean, obviously
they've gotten behind it

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.230
for the sequels.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:12.230
But the first one had
almost no marketing.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.460
This was not a manufactured hit.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.300
In fact, one of the reasons that
I think "Sharknado" took off

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.600
summer of 2013 is that there
had been a series of big budget,

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.230
blockbuster flops
in the theaters.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.010
And people were getting tired
of being force fed these things

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.180
and told that this is
the event of the summer.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.550
You must go see this.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:34.700
I mean, that was the summer that
"Lone Ranger" with Johnny Depp

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.860
came out and failed
spectacularly.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.070
So I think the biggest threat
to "Sharknado's" continued

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:49.200
success is them trying
to manufacture it.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.080
And that's a concern,
because we're

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.360
trying to walk a
tight rope, I guess,

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.400
between getting the
word out and not

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.060
making it seem like this is
something you have to go do.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:07.214
But to recreate that, I think
you need to do something else.

00:38:07.214 --> 00:38:08.880
And I don't know what
the answer to that

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.670
is, although actually I'm
working on a transmedia

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.240
thing that is trying to
accomplish the same thing,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.940
but through a very
different route.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.610
I think it worked
because it was different

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:21.820
and it was unexpected.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:23.320
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.160
THUNDER LEVIN: And so
once the unexpected

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.420
becomes expected, you've got
to do something even more

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:29.122
unexpected.

00:38:29.122 --> 00:38:30.830
AUDIENCE: I guess part
of what I'm asking

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.840
is like the low budget horror
movie has become a genre now.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.374
So--

00:38:35.374 --> 00:38:37.290
THUNDER LEVIN: Well,
it's always been a genre.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:37.831
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:37.831 --> 00:38:40.660
THUNDER LEVIN: I mean,
going back to the 1950s

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.410
with Little Shop--
or '60s, I guess--

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.220
"Little Shop of Horrors."

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.870
And then Roger Corman,
you know, was churning out

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:47.535
these B movies.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:53.170
And of course, Rocky Horror--
I mean it's not really

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.210
a horror film-- but "Rocky
Horror Picture Show"

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.320
defined what a cult movie was.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.020
And that wasn't a
manufactured thing.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:06.010
That became a hit several
years after it was released.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.900
There have always
been low budget horror

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:12.770
films and low budget B movies.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.920
And actually, they're
kind of dying out,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.580
because you can't get them
in the theater anymore.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.540
You can't get them on the
shelf at blockbuster anymore.

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.750
It's very hard--

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.660
It's hard to get anything
on the shelf at Blockbuster.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.280
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, exactly.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.810
But that's sort of my point.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.760
Is it's hard for
something like this

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.870
to be found by the audience.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:39.560
And so SyFy channel has become
almost the only place for it.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.270
Maybe YouTube or
something like that is

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.760
going to become a place for it.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.371
But finding anything
on the internet

00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:50.370
is very difficult, breaking
through the clutter,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.450
because there's so much stuff.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.790
So the whole industry
is kind of in flux

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.440
right now as to how
smaller projects are

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.780
going to find an audience.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.840
So I don't know that we
invented anything new,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.590
or reignited-- we
just, I don't know,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.390
we just came along
at the right time.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:16.260
I mean, an interesting
side note-- actually this

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.010
is being recorded.

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.385
I'm not going to
talk about that.

00:40:18.385 --> 00:40:20.940
Never mind.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:21.440
Yeah.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:25.130
I don't know.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:31.240
I think the more they try
to duplicate the success,

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.406
the harder it will be and the
less successful they'll be.

00:40:34.406 --> 00:40:35.030
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.294
THUNDER LEVIN: So there's
got to be something new.

00:40:37.294 --> 00:40:39.710
AUDIENCE: Could you talk more
about the transmedia project

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:41.040
you're working on?

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.910
THUNDER LEVIN: Well, if I give
too much away, it won't work.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:50.720
It's something that's going to
start on Snapchat, probably.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.930
And then we hope it
will catch on and become

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:59.690
either a web series or an actual
TV series, or a feature film.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:03.660
And we're going back
to a classic radio

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.780
broadcasts for inspiration.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:07.760
And I think I should
leave it there.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.810
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:09.835
THUNDER LEVIN: Yep.

00:41:09.835 --> 00:41:11.210
MALE SPEAKER:
That's appropriate,

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.190
because I sort of
thought "Sharknado"

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:16.710
was kind of the "War of
the Worlds" of its era.

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:23.554
"War of the Worlds" had that
sudden onslaught of technology.

00:41:23.554 --> 00:41:24.970
THUNDER LEVIN: The
beautiful thing

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:29.720
that happened that night
was that it just happened.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.790
Nobody planned it.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.770
Nobody promoted it.

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.590
People just saw the
commercial or the trailer

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.650
and thought, how
ridiculous is this.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:41.440
And some of those
people tuned in.

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.400
I mean, I'm convinced,
we had millions

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.092
of people tweeting about it.

00:41:46.092 --> 00:41:48.300
I'm convinced that most of
them weren't even watching

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.710
the movie, they
were just responding

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.510
to what the few people who were
watching the movie were saying.

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:57.140
I mean, Mia Farrow
and Philip Roth

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:59.870
posted this photo of
them supposedly watching

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:00.920
"Sharknado."

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:06.530
And Mia Farrow tweeted,
OMG, OMG, OMG, "Sharknado."

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.520
And as it came out
later, this was actually

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.530
a photo they had taken
several days before,

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.900
watching something else, or
looking at their computer

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:14.830
or something.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.821
But they thought it was funny
to post it for "Sharknado."

00:42:17.821 --> 00:42:19.820
To this day, I don't know
if Mia Farrow actually

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.630
watched "Sharknado" or not.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.130
It was just something
that happened,

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.242
and that was what was
so great about it.

00:42:26.242 --> 00:42:27.450
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that was.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:29.345
OK, I think on that
note, we'll close.

00:42:29.345 --> 00:42:30.470
THUNDER LEVIN: Nobody else?

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.680
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very, very much.

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:33.620
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.382
Please.

00:42:35.382 --> 00:42:36.590
THUNDER LEVIN: I got all day.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.465
You're the ones that
have to go back to work.

00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:41.070
AUDIENCE: Talking about
how it kind of got

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:42.810
a lot of people
watching live shows,

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.634
do think that had any
push to the producers

00:42:45.634 --> 00:42:47.300
and the executive
saying that they would

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.686
do live musicals on TV, and kind
of the OJ Simpson miniseries

00:42:52.686 --> 00:42:54.060
seems to be
something that people

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.809
are talking about a
lot that have happened

00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:57.230
since your movie came out.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.771
THUNDER LEVIN: Yes, "Sharknado"
is responsible for everything

00:42:59.771 --> 00:43:01.930
that's happened since.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.740
I don't know, I mean the live
musical had been happening

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.540
before, but I think the
Twitter response to "Sharknado"

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.750
opened a lot of people's eyes.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.080
And they saw that maybe
there was another way

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.230
to make things happen other than
the traditional method they'd

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.450
been using for years.

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:23.781
And the industry is in a
remarkable state of flux

00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:24.280
right now.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.030
And nobody's quite
sure how anything

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.240
but the giant
blockbuster movie can

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.690
be made, because it costs so
much for marketing campaign

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.090
to open a movie and to
cut through the clutter.

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:41.030
How do small films
find an audience?

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:44.426
Medium size films, even,
they're not getting made.

00:43:44.426 --> 00:43:46.300
And so everybody's trying
to figure this out.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:52.470
I mean, I have meetings with
producers on a regular basis,

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.710
you know, where they'll
say yes, "Terminator,"

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:01.260
and "Predator," and the
original "Highlander,"

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.480
great modestly budgeted films.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.000
Can't make those anymore,
because there's no way

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.750
to get them to the market.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:14.640
If that cost $100 million
to market a feature film,

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.590
why would you make
a $5 million film?

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.882
It makes sense to make
$100 million film.

00:44:20.882 --> 00:44:22.340
And so the whole
industry is trying

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:25.550
to figure out a new
workflow, a new method,

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:29.300
for doing something
besides the blockbuster.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.520
Because we've lost the
shelves at blockbuster.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.810
And we've lost
the small theaters

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:38.430
that will show small movies.

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.780
And we've lost a way to
bring them to market.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:43.320
So I think in the
next 10 years there's

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.970
going to be a
revolution in how movies

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:48.320
are brought to the people.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.820
And I don't know
what the answer is,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:54.004
because if I had the
answer, I'd be rich.

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:56.420
MALE SPEAKER: If you had the
answer, we'd try to hire you.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.815
THUNDER LEVIN: OK,
I have the answer.

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.240
MALE SPEAKER: I've lined up
an interview slate for you

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.031
this afternoon, just
in case you said that.

00:45:05.031 --> 00:45:06.400
THUNDER LEVIN: Excellent.

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:09.470
Yeah, so I don't
know if we really

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:12.100
influenced those
live musicals or not,

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.840
but I think we did
open some people's eyes

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.740
to how to have that shared
communal experience,

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.290
because that's what
it's all about.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.150
And it is something that
resonates for people,

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:25.070
and has since the
beginning of time.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.240
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.730
THUNDER LEVIN: They're
coming to get us.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:32.140
MALE SPEAKER: I
think that's our cue.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.340
Thank you very, very much.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.381
THUNDER LEVIN: Thank you.

00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:35.190
