00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.429
What does it mean to be one in a million?

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.779
Not in the greeting card sense,

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.608
in the scientific sense,

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:17.990
where one part per million
is a unit of measurement.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.600
Parts per million counts the number
of units of one substance

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.260
per one million units of another.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.420
It can measure concentrations when
a small amount makes a big difference.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.849
For example, a concentration of just
35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:35.890
is poisonous to us.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.560
We encounter measurements like this
pretty often,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.610
but because it's hard to conceptualize
really large numbers,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.839
it's difficult to wrap our brain around
what one part per million really means.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.050
So here are nine helpful ways
to visualize it.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.482
If you had 11,363 pianos-worth 
of piano keys,

00:00:55.482 --> 00:01:00.611
one of those keys would be about
one part per million.

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:06.090
So would a single granule of sugar
among 273 sugar cubes,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.441
one second in eleven and a half days,

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:12.440
or four dots in the painting,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.322
"A Sunday Afternoon on 
the Island of La Grande Jatte."

00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:21.111
Your bath tub's capacity 
is about 60 gallons,

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:25.021
so seven drops of ink would be
one part per million.

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:32.041
The English version of the Harry Potter
series has 1,084,170 words,

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:37.102
which makes "hippogriff" on page 221
of "The Prisoner of Azkaban"

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:40.614
a little less than one part per million.

00:01:40.614 --> 00:01:44.832
A million kernels of corn 
is about 1,250 ears,

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:49.393
so one kernel in that truckload
would be one part per million.

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:52.583
There are 10 million bricks in
the Empire State Building,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:56.713
so one part per million 
would be a pile of just ten.

00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:01.803
And finally, 100 people worked together
to animate this video.

00:02:01.803 --> 00:02:06.393
Collectively, they have about 10 million
hairs on their heads.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:10.873
Pluck ten of those hairs,
and you have one in a million.
