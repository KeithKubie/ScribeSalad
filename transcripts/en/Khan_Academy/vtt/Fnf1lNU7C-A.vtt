00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.910
- [Instructor] In other
videos, we have talked

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.270
about how the other branches

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.120
of government can limit
Supreme Court powers.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.950
We're going to continue that
conversation in this video

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.720
by discussing how the
amendment process can

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.950
also limit or overrule a
Supreme Court decision,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.650
so let's go to 1875.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.070
Just for some context, the 14th Amendment,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.800
the United States, had
already been ratified,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.750
and in particular, you have the Privileges

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.620
or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.810
that says no state shall
make or enforce any law

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.610
which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.520
of citizens of the United States.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.670
Well, you could imagine a
lot of women at the time

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.217
who were citizens of the
United States said that,

00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:50.487
"Look, voting is a privilege
of being a citizen,

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:52.930
"but I am not allowed to vote,"

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.750
and so you have Virginia Minor,

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.850
who was a citizen in Missouri,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.550
decides to register to vote.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.340
She is denied and eventually
takes the registrar to court.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.420
It eventually gets appealed all the way

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.150
to the United States Supreme Court

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510
in Minor versus Happersett,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.830
where Happersett is the
registrar in Missouri,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.630
and the Supreme Court in this case rules

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.150
that voting is not a privilege
of citizenship for women,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.280
and it seems absurd to us right now,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.620
that voting seems to be one

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.270
of the main privileges of being a citizen,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.630
but that's the way the
Supreme Court ruled in 1875.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.130
Now, the folks who were
fighting for a women's right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.750
to vote weren't just women.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.910
They were also men, eventually started

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.530
to have victories in the
early 1900s at various states,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.750
especially states in the
West, started to allow women

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.760
to vote, but as we go into
the teens of the 1900s,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.660
the movement gets enough
steam to get Congress

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.420
and the state legislators to propose

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.310
and ratify the 19th Amendment,

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.400
which says the right of
citizens of the United States

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.530
to vote shall not be denied or abridged

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.130
by the United States or by
any state on account of sex.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.280
Congress shall have power

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.030
to enforce this article by
appropriate legislation.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.740
So what we have here is
the legislative branch,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.430
both the U.S. Congress and
the state legislatures,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.620
because it needs to be voted
for by 2/3 of both houses

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.610
of Congress and then ratified
by 3/4 of the states,

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.210
they essentially overruled the Minor

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.130
versus Happersett decision.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.667
They said, "All right, Supreme Court.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.390
"You might see some ambiguity
in the 14th Amendment,"

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.720
although today it's hard to say

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.320
that voting isn't a
privilege of citizenship,

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.570
but to make it very clear, they proposed

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.200
and ratified the 19th Amendment.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.280
So not only is this an interesting time

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.250
in American history.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.410
Not that long ago, less than
100 years before this video

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.840
that I'm making was made, women
did not have the full right

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.100
to vote most of the United States.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.500
We eventually get the 19th Amendment,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.820
but above and beyond
that, this is an example

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.500
of how other branches of
government can exercise some checks

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.763
on the Unites States Supreme Court.
