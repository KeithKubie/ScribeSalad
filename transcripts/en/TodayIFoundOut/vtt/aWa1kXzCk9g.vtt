00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.010
New York City struggled to meet its recruitment
goals during the spring of 1917.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.880
The United States had recently entered World
War I, which had been raging in Europe since

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:27.189
1914 (see: What Really Started WWI), and the
military needed volunteers.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.760
While New York City had a population of around
6.5 million at the time, it lagged behind

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.110
its goal of 2,000 recruits to the United States
Navy by under half.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
So New York City’s Mayor, John P. Mitchel,
decided that he needed a gimmick to spark

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.690
young men’s interest and convince them to
volunteer for the war.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.879
What better way to draw attention to the Navy
than to construct a battleship in the middle

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.830
of Union Square?

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.760
Teaming up with the Navy on the project, the
Mayor’s Committee on National Defense raised

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.530
approximately $10,000 (about $187,000 today)
to fund the ship and hired Jules Guerin and

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.220
Donn Barber to design the appropriately named
USS Recruit, basing the design loosely on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.820
the USS Maine.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.330
With work rapidly completed by the U.S. Navy,
the USS Recruit, also known as the Landship

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.350
Recruit, was built on the island of Manhattan.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.780
Construction finished for a “launch” on
May 30, 1917, with the ship being christened

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.540
by Olive Mitchel, the Mayor’s wife.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.540
(See: Why We Break A Bottle of Champagne Against
New Ships)

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.400
The wooden battleship mockup measured over
200 feet long and had a beam, or width, of

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.410
40 feet.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.060
While not actually armed for battle, the ship
featured wooden replicas of two cage masts,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.530
six 14-inch guns inside three twin turrets,
and ten 5-inch guns.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.270
It also had two 50-foot masts, an 18-foot
tall smokestack, a main bridge, and a conning

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.270
tower.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.280
recruitThe Landship Recruit contained ample
space for the job of recruiting and training

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.479
sailors, with multiple waiting rooms and physical
exam rooms, complete with full amenities.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.690
Doctors, officers, and sailors lived aboard
the ship in their separate quarters.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.201
As for the latter, the initial complement
was thirty-nine sailors-in-training from the

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:08.259
Newport Training Station and their commander,
Captain C.F. Pierce.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.140
The crew maintained a similar routine to the
one of a crew at sea.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.980
As reported by Popular Science Magazine in
August of 1917,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980
recruit3

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.010
The land sailors arise at six o’clock, scrub
the decks, wash their clothes, attend instruction

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.030
classes, and then stand guard and answer questions
for the remainder of the day.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.280
There is a night as well as a day guard.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.500
From sunup to eleven o’clock all lights
of the ship are turned on, including a series

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.280
of searchlight projectors.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
In addition to recruiting volunteers for the
Navy and training new sailors, the USS Recruit

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.040
served as a public relations tool.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.200
Citizens were invited onto the ship to learn
about then modern battleships, and the sailors

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.150
aboard routinely answered the public’s questions
during their guard duty.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.170
Both patriotic and social events were also
held on the battleship with the sailors acting

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.230
as hosts.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.040
One patriotic event, according to a contemporary
account from The New York Times, was the presentation

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.069
of a recreation of Betsy Ross’s American
flag.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.830
Other events were just social in nature, such
as dances held for New York’s social elite.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.890
There were reportedly even Vaudeville shows
held on board.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.000
recruit4World War I ended in November of 1918
when both Austria-Hungary and Germany agreed

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.150
to an armistice while the terms of peace could
be negotiated.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.430
However, the USS Recruit continued its recruitment
mission until March of 1920.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.300
It had helped the Navy recruit an astounding
25,000 new sailors (enough to man the USS

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.360
Maine, which the Recruit was loosely modeled
after, a whopping 45 times over) during its

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
three years of operation.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.110
At this time, the Navy announced that it would
move the wooden battleship from Union Square

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.430
to Luna Park on Coney Island and maintain
it as a recruitment site there.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.650
The New York Times described the “sailing”
of the Recruit in an article on March 17,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.650
1920:

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
Yesterday when 10 o’clock came around and
with it ‘sailing time’ all of the ceremonies

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
were put on.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.340
The crew of eighty men lined up on the quarterdeck
and the ship was formally abandoned while

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.840
the Stars and Stripes and the commissioned
pennant were hauled down.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.320
The ship’s band struck up ‘The Star-Spangled
Banner’ as the colors were lowered to the

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320
deck.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.879
recruit2The ship was then carefully dismantled
over the course of a few days, with the pieces

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.200
shipped off to Coney Island.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.950
Though The New York Times estimated that it
would take just two weeks for the Navy to

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.120
complete the move of the battleship, it was
never rebuilt.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750
Out of sight, out of mind, no contemporary
news source seems to have bothered to cover

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.050
why the ship, which was supposed to be immediately
rebuilt, was not.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.580
What happened to the pieces of the dismantled
ship is also a mystery to this day.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.210
A search through the Navy archives for the
period in question likewise turned up nothing

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.439
insightful concerning the ship’s demise.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:36.111
Presumably it was simply decided at the last
minute that rebuilding and maintaining the

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:43.990
ship was an unnecessary expense given the
Navy’s recruitment needs at the time.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.409
While this was the end of the Union Square
battleship, it would not be the end of the

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.800
name in the U.S. Navy.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.500
The USS Recruit (AM-285) was launched in 1943
and served during WWII before being decommissioned

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.909
in 1946 and ultimately sold to the Mexican
Navy in 1963.

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.479
Following this, another landlocked ship was
built, the USS Recruit (TDE-1), at the San

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.419
Diego Naval Training Center in 1949.

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.400
Built to scale at two-thirds the size of a
Dealey-class destroyer escort, the ship was

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.850
made of wood with sheet metal overlay and
was used to train tens of thousands of recruits

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.099
over the coming decades.

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.089
It was, however, decommissioned in 1967, funny
enough, because it could not be classified

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.430
in the Navy’s new computerized registry.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.550
However, commissioned or not, it was in continuous
service from 1949 to 1997 (with a complete

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.050
re-model in 1982) when the base it is on was
closed.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.830
While no longer being used, the ship still
stands, with some thought to perhaps turning

00:05:38.830 --> 00:06:04.060
it into a maritime museum at some point.
