00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.980
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:07.810
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.520
<v 1>ahhh</v>

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.080
<v 0>I'm just checking in on yet. What's going on? How's your week going?</v>

5
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.340
Are you having a good time with the people in your life?

6
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.100
If you not drink some booze,

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.420
go down to the pub. Oh, by yourself.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.470
Preferably during the day. There's nothing better than day drinking.

9
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.750
I'll tell you that right now. A lot of people think, oh,

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.220
holding my child fucked, cheering and disease.

11
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.780
I don't think so.

12
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.290
Sitting in a bar during the day,

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.910
you know one of those bars where you know the sun barely fucking comes in,

14
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:51.820
right? One of those fucking places don't meet a gay bar. All right,

15
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:52.654
let me tell you right now,

16
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.840
now I'm one of those gay bars were what's accepted now, right?

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.880
Don't gay bars have like fucking ceiling to floor windows, right?

18
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.290
We're here. We're queer.

19
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.440
We'd like some fucking beers and then what goes on there? I don't know.

20
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.880
I haven't got caught up on will and grace. I'm sorry.

21
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.120
I don't want to stupid mood. Dammit. Um, yeah.

22
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.150
Day drinking day, drinking bed.

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.980
It always had the beetle should've made that instead of day tripper.

24
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.380
She was a day drinker. Fucking boozin. Yeah.

25
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.510
It took us to get drunk.

26
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.240
Now she's drunk. [inaudible] Gudu Gudu Gudu um,

27
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.570
I've been writing all day. We got a table read tomorrow morning,

28
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:44.130
so it's actually Wednesday evening and I'm doing this, uh,

29
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.080
in my spotless home, my spotless home home. Home.

30
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:53.800
Home. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. My wife is on the road again.

31
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.730
Right. She's out visiting some fucking friends or whatever. Um,

32
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.940
or having an affair. I don't know. I can't keep tabs on her.

33
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.850
I only have an iPhone six, you know,

34
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.760
if I had one of those phones that they already have in Japan,

35
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:10.090
I could probably watch her from a satellite and then text her,

36
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.080
you know, while I played that creepy stinks on, I guess it's the police. Right.

37
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.820
I'll be watching you. I remember someone, that song came out, they said, uh,

38
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.930
you know, that song actually makes men beat women. It's like, no.

39
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.931
I would say a poor childhood would probably be bigger than stinks fucking song.

40
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.181
You know,

41
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.540
that was back when you really could try to blame musicians for fucking,

42
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.660
for your own bad parenting. You know what I mean? Oh,

43
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.610
there was devil in the music and you play it backwards and you sucked as a

44
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:47.890
mother. Well,

45
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.400
and then this song here reminds him of this and him dad. Yes.

46
00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:54.700
Smoked when it was in the womb. Just shut up already.

47
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.750
Remember that Tipper Gore and all of them slapping those stickers all over the

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.213
right.

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.450
Meanwhile the roll and the Illuminati dressing up like pheasants stick in their

50
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.420
fucking fists in each other's asses all that's what goes down.

51
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.440
That's what happens. That's the,

52
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600
that's the kind of thing that's CNN and Fox News are too afraid to talk about.

53
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.820
That's why they're always going after fucking comedians.

54
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.710
If we do a Bruce Jenner joke,

55
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.711
it's just a big misdirection cause they really don't want to know or let the

56
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.810
regular people know how much fisting is going on at the upper 1% of wealth.

57
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.020
But I'll get to that later. I'll get to that later. Um,

58
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.660
anyways, that was a big weekend spots.

59
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.730
This is how little soccer fucking matters in the United States when Lester city

60
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.450
did, which is basically the impossible,

61
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.410
they won the premier league. And I know there's a lot of yanks,

62
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.530
lot of Yankee Kunstler listening right now. Right. Um,

63
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.180
basically the premier league, in my mind, in my world,

64
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.190
in my pasty freckled, uh, lonely world,

65
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.880
I would say that the premier league, if you're gonna watch soccer,

66
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.020
that's what the fuck you watch. I would even say fuck the World Cup.

67
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.030
The World Cup is like the St Patrick's Day of fucking soccer where every

68
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.840
douchebag who barely even gives a fuck shows up and then they fucking somebody

69
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.040
somebody gets puked on, right? The premier league.

70
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.390
That's the real shit. That is the real shit. It just sounds real.

71
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.050
That looks real. Aim one leg one. I actually, if I put that shit on,

72
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.690
if it's fall a little bit cold out, you know,

73
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.390
it feels like dead Shitty fucking England, whether I'll actually watch it and,

74
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.560
which means a lot, you know what I mean?

75
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.530
Cause I know that fucking people over in England, they don't watch NFL football.

76
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:50.740
They think it's stupid, right? Everybody running around, you know,

77
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:55.690
in shape with good dentists dental work. I'm sorry.

78
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.710
Um, anyways, so what I love about the premier league,

79
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.920
and I'm going to fuck this up. It's been explained to me 50 times.

80
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.170
I just don't have enough time in my life to pay attention.

81
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:10.171
But the one thing that I do that I think is fucking hilarious is with all our

82
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.770
leagues over here, if you're in the NHL, you're in the NHL, you're in the NFL.

83
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.570
If you're in the NFL, you're just in there. No matter how bad you saw,

84
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.450
you're fucking in there. All right?

85
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.320
Like take the New York Yankees right now in the fucking

86
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.250
right. I watched a little baseball this week. Um, I just happened to catch it.

87
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.630
I even know the red sox are playing the Yankees. Did we sweep them?

88
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.290
I think we didn't. I think that made us go into first place. Oh, well,

89
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.730
my talking shit about a sport I never watch. I think I am. Um,

90
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.210
I actually liked it. The a, the panic guy. I don't wish this on anybody,

91
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:46.960
but he's out.

92
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.710
So now we kind of don't really have any big free agents and I'll feel like the

93
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:55.300
Yankees really do either. So I, I kinda like it. It seems like it's gone back.

94
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:58.310
It's settled down. The roids are out of the game.

95
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.550
All the big free agent fucking things. It's because she kind of settled down.

96
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.220
Um, and this might sound fucked up to a red sox fan,

97
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.040
but I don't want the Yankees to be in last place. I'm going to be right there,

98
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.040
right there with us, you know, slugging it out.

99
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.280
And then the last day of the year we give them the all right there Fred.

100
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:19.870
And then we go to fucking the playoffs. That's what I want. But I, I'm, I'm,

101
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.090
I'm, I'm going, I'm, I'm getting off the fucking highway here.

102
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.380
I need to get back on here. So in the premier league, this is a great that,

103
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:28.970
I think it's the last two teams,

104
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.440
the bottom two teams every year in the premier league, if you suck,

105
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.250
if you sucked a bag of Dicks, basically, if you just weren't,

106
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.340
everybody was kicking the shit out of you basically.

107
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.960
Meaning they scored like two goals on you. You know, it absent,

108
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.490
they got murdered, he lit up two goals and fucking nine hours.

109
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.710
Um, they get bounced right out of the fear out of the fucking leak.

110
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.260
You know what I mean? Like say a, I don't know,

111
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:00.230
I'm trying to think somebody in this, there's so much parody in the fucking NFL.

112
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.470
We'll say the Tampa Bay Buccaneers back back in the day, like when they went,

113
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.730
oh and 14, boom, you're out of the league, you know, and the Detroit lions,

114
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:08.900
you're out of the league. And then they give,

115
00:07:08.901 --> 00:07:12.710
they give some other clubs a chance. And um,

116
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.330
and that happens every year. And that's,

117
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.570
I guess that's the way it becomes a premier league. I don't know.

118
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.560
You'd think they'd just take all the best guys and stick them on 30 teams like

119
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:24.050
we do. But this is different. You know, you think they brushed their teeth,

120
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.160
there's a whole bunch of things that you'd think they,

121
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.740
that they would do over there, but they choose not to. You know, it's funny,

122
00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:34.910
I went over there, I didn't really notice any worse teeth. You know,

123
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.560
than they have over here, depending on where you're at. I Dunno,

124
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.170
I just like breaking their balls and plus I'm going to be coming over there in

125
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.940
August. It's looking like,

126
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:47.090
so I figured I might as well prime the pump by truck and shit about him.

127
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.860
God knows if I just said how much I enjoy going over there and traveling through

128
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:53.660
Europe, if I said that, that's boring.

129
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.990
So what you got to do to get people to come to shows as you get to shit on their

130
00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:01.400
country. Right? So anyways, um,

131
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.100
so after the end of the last last season,

132
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:09.950
two teams got kicked out and two new teams get brought in this little ass team

133
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.270
called Lester city, right? They weird way of spelling it.

134
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:15.530
Um,

135
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.530
God brought up and they were a 5,000 to one chance to win the whole fucking

136
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:23.090
thing. 5,000 to one.

137
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.480
Meaning if you put $1 on them at the beginning of the,

138
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.030
the thing you would a one $5,000, you get it.

139
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.810
If you put $2 down, all right,

140
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.820
you woulda got $10,000. If you put 50 cents on those fuckers,

141
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:45.380
you woulda got $2,500 is that right?

142
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.330
Yeah, yeah, Shane. Um, anyways,

143
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.550
I'm just trying to say that doesn't make sense to me.

144
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:56.460
You wouldn't do that or would you? Mathematically does,

145
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.810
but in my head I just keep thinking five times one. I'm seeing a five there.

146
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.010
I'll have to do it later, but I think it's 20. It's gotta be $2,504 5,000.

147
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.780
I mean, shit, that's only fair. All right. So anyways,

148
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:14.520
plumbing your head here. Those motherfuckers won the whole thing.

149
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.600
I know it was a lot of people thought [inaudible] too quickly. Um,

150
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.630
I guess the US Olympic team in 1980 was like thousand to one and I forget what

151
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:27.930
the mets were in 69. Um,

152
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.830
but basically those were the two biggest sports underdogs that anybody could

153
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:36.831
think of in the u s or at least a person I was talking to and Lester city was

154
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.590
five times that. And um,

155
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.480
that was such a big fucking deal.

156
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:47.481
I actually went on the internet to see reaction videos of fans of that club

157
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.480
losing their fucking shit. And I just sat there laughing in a good way,

158
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.460
seeing how happy people were. Um, that's always the grace.

159
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:57.900
I don't know why that is the greatest,

160
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:00.930
but it's always the greatest for somebody who just like out of fucking nowhere

161
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:04.500
comes along and wins it. You know, it's the whole rocky story. Right?

162
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.810
So congratulations to them. Um,

163
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.770
but I think as much as that's the greatest sports thing in recent memory,

164
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:17.640
I think, um, in the U s we're going to with clips that very quickly,

165
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.350
um, if we haven't already, because I have to,

166
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:26.910
I have to think what were the fucking odds that Donald Trump was going to secure

167
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.260
the Republican,

168
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.160
whatever the fuck the Republican National Convention Party,

169
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:36.750
whatever they call them there be the presidential nominee for that fucking

170
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:37.584
party.

171
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.210
<v 2>Okay.</v>

172
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.300
<v 0>Do you understand that Ted Cruz</v>

173
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.240
throwing in the towel and everybody said he elbowed his wife? He didn't.

174
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.860
Okay. She was third man in, I tweeted about this. If you look what happened,

175
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.440
he hugged her first, right?

176
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.910
And then he went in for the man hug and then she, they know,

177
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.570
according to the NHL rule of third man in, if there's,

178
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.040
if there's an altercation already happening and a third party entrust it,

179
00:11:08.041 --> 00:11:12.390
it's an on an automatic game misconduct. So she should've got a game as conduct,

180
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.190
right. If she's done that before in the past, you know,

181
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:21.300
maybe she should get a suspension. I'll tell you what was fucking hilarious.

182
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:22.620
She hung in there like a trooper.

183
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.680
She took knuckled and a couple of fucking elbows.

184
00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:29.370
She looked like she was trying to stop one of those little kitty merry go rounds

185
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:33.390
with their head, you know, just kept taking a fucking bar to the skull.

186
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.050
Um, he then did then did include her.

187
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.470
I thought it was weird that she wanted to hug with those two men. Um,

188
00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.340
I don't know much about Ted Cruz, but I think, uh, I don't know.

189
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:51.110
I felt a weird sorta Rotisserie vibe there from his wife that I think already

190
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:53.980
occurred. You know, they will probably saying, all right,

191
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:57.550
we're going to do this. Let's do it now. Okay. I told you I couldn't do it.

192
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.850
You know, I'm running for president. I don't need that ship.

193
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.820
And now it's over and I'm just a senator now, so yeah. You know,

194
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.120
I'll be on the other end where you fucking my wife.

195
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.580
I'll have her blow me a little bit. You know, I don't give a shit, you know,

196
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:14.110
just, just push this bill through. Isn't that how politics work? I have no idea.

197
00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.040
Let let, let's get back to us talking about, so fucking, what's his name?

198
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.960
They're fucking, uh, Willie wiffle.

199
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.520
They're the fucking guy with the to pay comes back and around again, right?

200
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.683
<v 3>Donald Trump.</v>

201
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:33.590
<v 0>I just want the American people to know that by giving him that fucking position</v>

202
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.640
in politics, you just cleared the way for Hillary Clinton to become president.

203
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.660
And I don't want to hear a fucking word out of Neu Republicans.

204
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.510
Not a fucking word. This is the guy you picked.

205
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.780
You got no one to blame but yourselves.

206
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.780
The only thing I do like about Donald Trump,

207
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.310
Trump actually being nominated is it makes me feel like it makes my conspiracy

208
00:12:56.311 --> 00:13:00.060
theory, like go down. Like,

209
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.690
there's no way. They don't count the votes. If that guy got in,

210
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.650
I used to think they just pretended to count the votes and then they just stuck

211
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:10.750
this like nobody wants that. Fuck the guy. Yet.

212
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:16.240
I know some of the most staunch Republicans you could possibly fucking run into

213
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.140
and they have their head in their hands going, how the fuck?

214
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.510
How the fuck did this guy become president? And I, that's, that's easy.

215
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.420
That's easy. All you have to do is look at pop music.

216
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:30.730
He just look at the shit that sells on TV.

217
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.490
But your horse screaming and yelling at each other. You know what I mean? It's,

218
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.960
it's inevitable. I had to be honest, you,

219
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.710
I cannot fucking believe that this guy,

220
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.100
he's a freaky to fucking star of a reality show.

221
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:46.630
This is worse than when Schwartzenegger ran fucking California. This is fucking

222
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.200
Africa. It's just unbelievable. Un-Fucking-Believable but anyways,

223
00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:58.280
congratulations to Leicester City. Um,

224
00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.040
that must've been insane. That's something that, you know,

225
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:04.490
that's one of those ones you're going to talk about until you're like fucking a,

226
00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:09.170
I still talk about the red sox coming back in 2004, um,

227
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.140
out of all the championships, um,

228
00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.403
<v 3>you know,</v>

229
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.290
<v 0>Boston is one in the last 10 years and I can't say that 10, 12 years. I mean,</v>

230
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:24.190
we won a bunch of them. Um, that was the one that was the fucking,

231
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.340
you know, it's a fucking Yankee. Say I had like 26 championships.

232
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:30.880
We had one in like fucking 86 years down. Oh three. I mean,

233
00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:34.870
that was like a fucking, it was like Jimmy Fallon Drew Barrymore,

234
00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:37.560
a fucking movie there. Right. They actually had to throw that.

235
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.290
They didn't even have that in the fucking script because they were in that movie

236
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.200
going on on a, this is gonna seem too unbelievable.

237
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:47.530
And then it fucking happened and they had to change the ending to the movie.

238
00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:50.080
That's, that's incredible. And, um,

239
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.100
<v 3>oh man,</v>

240
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.240
<v 0>I'll never forget that fucking cop at fucking New York City cop when we were</v>

241
00:14:56.241 --> 00:15:01.241
down oh three and I was still wearing my red sox hat walking down the street in

242
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.370
New York and he fucking laughed. He goes, look at this fucking guy, blah, blah,

243
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.290
blah, blah. Just laughing. And I remember we won the next game and the next,

244
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.620
next and every day I'd walk out of my apartment going right by the same place

245
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:16.190
looking for that fucker. And I never saw him again. I'm like,

246
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.210
what was I going to do? Point in my hat, you fucking pig and they get arrested.

247
00:15:20.211 --> 00:15:21.140
That wasn't going to do that.

248
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.420
I would've shot him a dirty look and he would have been like,

249
00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:27.440
what the fuck was that about? Because I never had the balls to talk shit.

250
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.940
You know what it was? Cause I knew he was right.

251
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:34.820
I agreed with them after game three when we lost like 19 to eight or some shit.

252
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.130
So anyways, I'm congratulations.

253
00:15:37.131 --> 00:15:41.330
I always love seeing shit like that when a team like that comes out of fucking

254
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:45.440
nowhere. So that's uh, that's awesome. And speaking of us sports,

255
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.890
believe it or not, with my busy schedule, I've actually, um,

256
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.430
because I live on the west coast, mercifully, um,

257
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.840
I've been able to watch most of the fucking games and with the lovely Nia out of

258
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:59.690
town, I've been just living like a fucking bachelor like this.

259
00:15:59.691 --> 00:16:03.980
You should see how much the Tivo or whatever the fuck you call it.

260
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:08.570
The record thing, how much it's changed. It was, she has her show her,

261
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:11.450
show her, show her, show her show, my show, her show, her show.

262
00:16:11.451 --> 00:16:13.130
She tapes fucking everything.

263
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.290
Every mother fucking real housewife fucking thing. She loves those shows.

264
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.650
Real housewives of Atlanta, real housewives of New Jersey.

265
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:26.060
Real housewives of fucking Orange County. Uh,

266
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.080
there's some hip hop love show, whatever the fuck that one's called.

267
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.330
And then she'll, you know, she'll have like fucking, I dunno, citizen Kane,

268
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.650
she's one way or the other. She'd see that's just absolute fucking unbelievable.

269
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:43.160
Or, or just like shit and there's no middle ground with her. Right.

270
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:45.350
And then every once in a while I'll have a game on there.

271
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.300
So now that she's been gone,

272
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.310
it's like I'm recording every fucking game, every fucking game.

273
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:57.320
Uh, although I'm missing the fucking capitols and penguins right now. Um,

274
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.280
but I've been watching the blues. I've been watching the sharks. Hey,

275
00:17:01.281 --> 00:17:04.940
I'm warming up to the shocks. I like those bearded fuckers. You know what?

276
00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:09.200
There's something scummy about him and I don't, I relate to it. Um,

277
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.840
I also liked the pride. I kinda like everybody who's left,

278
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.440
except for the penguins and I, I don't root against the penguins. I just,

279
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.510
every time I see him, it's like you stole our colors.

280
00:17:17.511 --> 00:17:19.820
You fucking have pieces of shit in your ring of honor.

281
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.020
There's just something about him, you know, I don't hate him. You know,

282
00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.510
the reason why I donate them is because I love Joe Bart and he loves the

283
00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:30.500
penguin. So I sorta fucking root for him. But I always just think like,

284
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:32.690
these are the guys with the knee breakers. So then wine,

285
00:17:32.691 --> 00:17:35.090
when people try and take their knees and I don't understand it,

286
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.490
they came into the league, they took our colors.

287
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:41.330
It's just like this like room for a joke. Thief. I know what they going to say.

288
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:45.050
Oh, you took him from your fucking Steelers. No, he didn't. No, he didn't.

289
00:17:45.051 --> 00:17:46.130
It was fucking hockey. We, we,

290
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.280
we've been around since the fucking 1920s was no fucking Pittsburgh Steelers in

291
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:54.450
1929. I'll get that. I'll tell you right now, I don't give a fuck if there was,

292
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.610
was that, let me actually check here. 1929

293
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.820
Pittsburgh Steelers. Let's see if they're around. Doo Doo, Doo, Doo,

294
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:12.020
Doo Doo Doo. Myron copes, Pittsburgh Steelers official. Terrible tower towel.

295
00:18:12.021 --> 00:18:15.600
No. Oh, wait a minute.

296
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.460
Pittsburgh Steelers and maybe let's go to Wikipedia here. It was funny by now,

297
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.540
like 99% of people in Pittsburgh know the answer to this question already.

298
00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.920
There's such maniac fans there. I mean that in a respectful way. Oh,

299
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:30.160
you know what? I don't give a fuck.

300
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.800
God knows they're all going to correct me anyways.

301
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:35.970
I don't need to look this shit up. Um, but anyways,

302
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.160
plowing ahead here. Uh, I've been watching all this stuff. Um,

303
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.540
I don't think I've, even though the blues are playing fucking great. Um,

304
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.800
I think when Tyler Sagan comes back, we'll see. We'll see what the fuck happens.

305
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.500
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say Dallas has a little bit of a, uh,

306
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.500
goaltender issue. Um, it was a bad game. It was a bad game for him.

307
00:18:58.501 --> 00:19:02.100
Whatever he fucking you. Yep. You plow ahead, you plow ahead. Um,

308
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:05.140
I believe in Jamie Ben though. That guy's got that fucking messy a vibe.

309
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:08.430
So I would never say that it's over until it is fucking over.

310
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:10.920
But it's looking good for the blues. My, uh,

311
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.600
my foster hockey parents since my Bruin shit, the bed towards the end,

312
00:19:15.601 --> 00:19:18.170
we didn't shit to bed. We actually had a great fucking year for, um,

313
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.530
everybody we got rid of.

314
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.280
It's just such that we thought we were gonna make the playoffs and we went out

315
00:19:23.281 --> 00:19:26.580
west and the whole thing fell apart. But I've talked about that before. Um,

316
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:31.570
hey bill, how's your ass? How's the fucking Sayada God,

317
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.020
I'm like, the candles are rock. He's fucking Dean says, um,

318
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.370
I'm actually almost a hundred percent. I open my 100% because, uh,

319
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.060
I got to get on a plane and I got a flight of flooded. That is,

320
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:48.540
I used to say as a kid, I'm doing a run at dates out there, Hollywood, Florida,

321
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.130
Orlando, Florida in Jacksonville, Florida. Um,

322
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:57.150
and uh, I think, am I right? These fucking stretches of the shit.

323
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.400
I actually tweeted a link, um, to,

324
00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.900
if you have any sort of psychotic nerve thing, it really helped me.

325
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:04.681
I hope it helps you.

326
00:20:04.681 --> 00:20:07.580
And actually the guy who made the videos actually tweeted back to me said, yeah,

327
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.000
she listens to the podcast or something, which is fucking crazy to me. Um,

328
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.290
and I guess the only other thing to tell you about is the, uh,

329
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.730
is the fucking weight room that I got to go. I haven't looked at it yet today,

330
00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:25.500
but, um, I finally had them show up. You know,

331
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.750
I told you when we opened up the fucking ceiling,

332
00:20:27.751 --> 00:20:31.560
if you saw the god Damn Weekend Warrior Horse Shit.

333
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:33.813
<v 2>Okay.</v>

334
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.180
<v 0>You know, what kills me is when I think about this house being like,</v>

335
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.580
<v 2>okay,</v>

336
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.900
<v 0>almost a hundred years old.</v>

337
00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:42.840
I just think of all the people that have walked through here in Shit,

338
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.080
you know what I mean? Like American horror story.

339
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.420
And I sit there and I pictured them and I'm not afraid of them.

340
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:52.660
I'm just sort of trying to picture them and I'm trying to picture what the

341
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:56.590
fucking douchebag. Who did that work down there in the garage look like?

342
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:00.400
Or his friend? I told you when we open the fucking ceiling up,

343
00:21:00.401 --> 00:21:02.920
I just looked at the contractor and I was just like, what do you,

344
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:05.290
what the guy who built this, what do you think he did for a living?

345
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.760
You'd think he was a mailman. Was he a,

346
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.910
did he usually fucking stand behind a team of oxen? I don't know what he did,

347
00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.460
but he sure as hell wasn't a fucking contractor.

348
00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:20.410
So they finally went up there and they, um, you know,

349
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.640
while I was at work, I came home and they had it all fucking framed properly.

350
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.910
So now you don't have to worry about, you know, how fucking funny would that be?

351
00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.430
Wouldn't be funny for me. Be Funny for you guys.

352
00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:34.180
If I finally had a gym built in my garage and I was down there in above,

353
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:36.310
it collapsed and killed me when I was trying to work out.

354
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.180
That's the kind of thing that Canadians, chick would say would be ironic. Right.

355
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.010
And then she's so don't you think

356
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.910
<v 4>it's like the sailing collapsing on you when you're working out?</v>

357
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.700
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

358
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:53.120
<v 4>it's getting your period and having no tampon.</v>

359
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.470
<v 0>Um, that's one of those fucking stupid songs.</v>

360
00:21:58.471 --> 00:22:02.770
She remember when she was singing that song going, hey, hey,

361
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.590
when she comes down and you went to theater,

362
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.830
I remember I liked the song cause I liked the drums and shit.

363
00:22:10.831 --> 00:22:13.890
And I remember listening to it in a fucking bar in this fucking chick just says,

364
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.790
do you like this science even not at the back. It's like, I, yeah,

365
00:22:17.791 --> 00:22:19.950
I know what it's about. I'd say she's not saying it about me.

366
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.390
You're fucking lunatic.

367
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.130
<v 4>Okay.</v>

368
00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.580
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Have a glass of lemonade there.</v>

369
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.110
Chase Jesus. Don't get me started with that fucking album. Holy Shit. Um,

370
00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:39.090
anyways, what the fuck was I talking about here? Oh Yeah, the gym. That gym.

371
00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.470
The gym is on fire.

372
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.180
This hose hopefully going to be done in the next couple of weeks because a,

373
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.060
as mentioned, I'm sitting in the fucking writers room and old Billy boy,

374
00:22:48.061 --> 00:22:50.340
I'm a maintain it. You know, it's funny,

375
00:22:50.341 --> 00:22:53.880
I'm actually eating great during the day and then I come home and it all falls

376
00:22:53.881 --> 00:22:58.170
apart because knee is not here to say bill fucking ease up on the fucking

377
00:22:58.171 --> 00:23:02.400
drinking and a, you know, I got those big ice cubes in the refrigerator.

378
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.260
I pour a couple of strong ones. I'm feeling good, you know,

379
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.670
next thing you know, I'm fucking sleeping like a Goddamn grizzly.

380
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.640
Wake up at three in the morning, sweating on the couch,

381
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:16.800
and then I go downstairs and I put on my pajamas.

382
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.010
That's basically what happens to me when my fucking, well my,

383
00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:25.200
why a wife leaves town, you know Christ, they fall apart. Hey, who the fuck is,

384
00:23:25.201 --> 00:23:28.350
I think I brought this guy up before, but Ryan Reeves on the blues,

385
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:29.430
Jesus Christ,

386
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.960
I don't believe they say he's six one two 30 something. When he's out there,

387
00:23:33.961 --> 00:23:36.240
he looks like he's six five to 60

388
00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.280
guys like the fucking hulk on skates.

389
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:44.290
He looks like an even bigger George La rock. I love,

390
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.810
he was like sort of backing into the boards and he just punches three different

391
00:23:47.811 --> 00:23:49.610
fucking stars right in the face.

392
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.520
Just sort of face wash this guy a little jab for you.

393
00:23:52.521 --> 00:23:56.840
A is a fucking Lee fucking, you know, shake you around like a ragdoll.

394
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.920
Then he blows a kiss to the bench devil shades of John Wenson,

395
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.820
way back in the day when he challenged the whole, um,

396
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:09.690
northstar's bench asked somebody to fucking step over, um,

397
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.430
Jesus, he looked like a fucking lunatic. You know what I mean?

398
00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:17.460
He looks like that guy like yet and it just doesn't, you know,

399
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.090
it goes to pick up a child and accidentally kills him.

400
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:24.300
There was a lot of guys that played in the NHL in the 70s.

401
00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:25.590
You just looked at him like, you know,

402
00:24:25.591 --> 00:24:29.370
Dave Schultz fucking looks on their faces sometimes when they went out there.

403
00:24:29.371 --> 00:24:33.180
Granted they had to do what they had to do. But a lot of those guys, you know,

404
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:36.690
who's they, they, they really should have been in jail. Um,

405
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.760
and I hate to say this, but that, that is what really attracted me to the sport.

406
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:49.380
It was always, it was the fighting first. And for the,

407
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.490
for the life of me, I don't understand why people have a problem with it.

408
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:55.523
You know what I mean?

409
00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:01.040
I hate when people talk about the purity of sport and the purity of competition

410
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.440
and all of that. It's just like, just shot. I mean,

411
00:25:04.441 --> 00:25:08.790
why don't you just fucking look up the chimney and wait for Santa Claus to come

412
00:25:08.791 --> 00:25:13.790
down? You know what I mean? Purely in sports, the whole fucking,

413
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.830
the whole, at least here in the United States, I mean, the whole fucking thing.

414
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:21.710
It's like that poor bastard who got caught. Was He smoking fucking dope?

415
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.100
He supposed to do that. He's in college, right? And then, you know,

416
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:26.780
he gets a couple of hundred bucks.

417
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.310
He's playing for a team that's selling like 80,000 to a hundred thousand tickets

418
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:34.190
a fucking week. And he doesn't got two fucking nickels to rub together.

419
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.360
And what are the odds that he's actually going to make it?

420
00:25:38.361 --> 00:25:41.030
Don't even fucking tell me, oh, he gets a free education.

421
00:25:41.031 --> 00:25:44.810
He doesn't have time to study. He's got to study the fucking playbook. Right?

422
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.700
<v 2>Okay.</v>

423
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.840
<v 0>That's slave labor, man. It's fucking, they're all getting,</v>

424
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.020
they're getting fucked over. I'll get some point.

425
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:56.430
They really got to do like the, a sort of like the college

426
00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:02.340
athlete behind the music and I'm not talking about the guys that made it then

427
00:26:02.341 --> 00:26:04.710
got fucked over, you know, with people's, you know,

428
00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:05.941
relatives stealing their money.

429
00:26:05.941 --> 00:26:09.300
Just about all those fucking people that you just, you went to school,

430
00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.610
you didn't have time to go to class.

431
00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.030
The team you were playing on was selling out the fucking arena.

432
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.890
It actually paid for the art, most of the buildings on the campus. And then,

433
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.770
uh, you didn't make it. And now guy and I'm,

434
00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.910
well now you're driving a fucking eight, some six foot 10 guy driving a bus,

435
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.810
you know, driving the fucking Ava's shuttle.

436
00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.650
<v 2>Okay.</v>

437
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.310
<v 0>They could have at least, you know, thrown up a little bit of money.</v>

438
00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.120
Do you understand me? Just as a performer, all I can say is, you know,

439
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.760
to go out there and fucking sell a thousand, 100,000,

440
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.010
I can't imagine how much fucking money that is.

441
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.490
Can't imagine it and forget about all the fucking merge, all of that shit.

442
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.770
They can't kick the, this guy's gonna,

443
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.480
they're gonna break this guy's balls over like 500 bucks. Um,

444
00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.020
I don't want to think it's bullshit, but I'm also, I'm also pretty jaded,

445
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.430
so maybe, maybe I'm, I can do this right now. Am I gonna fucking retract again?

446
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:09.240
Maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Donald Trump's a great,

447
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:10.680
you know, he's a great, uh,

448
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:13.980
that's a great choice out of all the Americans out there that you could have

449
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:15.000
picked, you know what I mean? Yeah.

450
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:19.280
Let's have Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton and fucking, uh,

451
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.260
Barry Sanders coming up around the outside. It's fuck sustainable.

452
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.330
Not Larry Sanders. Bernie Sanders. Um, oh.

453
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.130
What are you going to do? This is just going to be a brutal eight years.

454
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:35.510
<v 2>Okay.</v>

455
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:37.910
<v 0>Hey, I'll put a bomb of fucking killing it.</v>

456
00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.100
That's the second time he's done that he murdered at some other fucking banquet.

457
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.460
Um, that time. Yeah. Took the piss out of fucking Donald Trump.

458
00:27:48.461 --> 00:27:52.800
And some people are saying that's why Donald ended up running. But uh,

459
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.990
yeah, I have no idea.

460
00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:57.540
Maybe they're just trying to blame him for the fucking nightmare.

461
00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:58.560
That is Donald Trump.

462
00:27:58.561 --> 00:28:03.360
I cannot fucking believe that there wasn't anybody in the Republican Party that

463
00:28:03.361 --> 00:28:04.410
could defeat this guy.

464
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.890
My only fucking thing is I watch Hillary go to the White House.

465
00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.000
Then I'm going to with joy is watching him be a fucking asshole to her.

466
00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.153
Um,

467
00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.780
I just hope that he treats her the way he treated all the guys I want.

468
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:22.590
I want gloves off. I want to bring it up. Fuck it.

469
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:24.210
Every skeleton they have,

470
00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.370
that's going to be the only enjoyment that I'm going to get out of this cause

471
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:34.120
other than the, it's a fucking travesty. But Hey, at least, you know,

472
00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.780
you can't say now that they don't count the votes because there's no fucking way

473
00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.190
anybody have influence. Once that guy, there's no fucking way, you know,

474
00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.360
this is actually becoming personal,

475
00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.640
like the level with which then I'm fucking talking about this guy.

476
00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:49.870
So I guess I got to trash. I got trashed. Hillary. I've trashed her enough.

477
00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:54.010
Bernie Sanders, the old man on the lawn, right?

478
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.130
I Dunno. So anyways, um,

479
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.210
I'm going to do a little bit advertising here and uh,

480
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.050
you guys have a wonderful weekend. You conch a marine,

481
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.720

482
00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.660
we're gonna play some fucking music and then play a little bit of, uh,

484
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.230
I'm sure there'll be a couple of you bitching about the music.

I don't have the advertising right now.

488
00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:32.800
So this is going to be a weird thing where now you have to stop and then it's

489
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.671

<v 1>come back.</v>

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.913

590
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.120
<v 6>Hey, what's going on? This is bill bar.</v>

591
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.900
It's the Monday morning podcast that I'm going to be doing in my dented fucking

592
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:44.760
hybrid cause I got a ton of Shit to do today and oh look at me Carson,

593
00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:49.680
right out of the bat. You know, this is gonna be an edgy one. Excuse me,

594
00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.860
little pollen in my throat. Um,

595
00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.190
my car looks like shit. I'm getting it fixed this week.

596
00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:02.140
Getting a dent taken out and it cost me 800 bucks,

597
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.360
which a I my insurance company,

598
00:37:05.361 --> 00:37:07.250
but all they're going to do is charge me more money,

599
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.060
which really makes you wonder why the fuck he have insurance.

600
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.720
Insurance is one of the biggest scams out there. In fact,

601
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.490
I remember a long time ago buddy of mine was working in insurance when I first

602
00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:21.680
started realizing what a fucking scam it was.

603
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:26.540
I was living in Boston at the time and he said to me, he goes, Bill,

604
00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:30.550
what are the two tallest buildings in Boston? And I was like, ah,

605
00:37:30.551 --> 00:37:34.820
the John Hancock building and the Prudential Center. He goes,

606
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:37.640
exactly, exactly.

607
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.750
You think they're paying out fucking money to people than not, you know,

608
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:48.500
we meet, go watch that fucking spike Lee thing on New Orleans. Um, all right.

609
00:37:48.501 --> 00:37:51.620
Jesus Christ. Gonna be ordering people around. Um, anyways,

610
00:37:51.621 --> 00:37:55.190
I got a lot of questions and advice last week when I was waiting for that

611
00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:59.650
plumber to come. Six my stinky sink. And um,

612
00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.690
a lot of people, first of all, wants to know if the plumber ever showed up.

613
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.200
Well, first let me give you the backstory here.

614
00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:08.060
For those of you who didn't listen last week,

615
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.280
I'll give you a little bit of last week's episode.

616
00:38:10.281 --> 00:38:15.160
Like one of those old Batman TV shows from the 60s. Uh, last week, uh,

617
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.200
plumber was supposed to come at 9:00 AM to look at my sink because for some

618
00:38:20.511 --> 00:38:25.511
reason the water coming out of the spout of the Faucet,

619
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.070
um, smelled like swamp ass. I don't know why.

620
00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.770
Started vaguely smelling like shit. And as the weeks progressed,

621
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:37.660
all of a sudden it was just, it was disgusting.

622
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.130
It smelled like literally a slump smelt like an app that was dipped in a swamp

623
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.090
after somebody just, all right, let's not, let's not get too disgusting.

624
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:47.170
It's not terrible. Right?

625
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.520
So this mother fucker was supposed to show up at 9:00 AM

626
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:54.760
when I started doing my podcast,

627
00:38:54.761 --> 00:38:59.110
I believe it was about 10 oh three not to get anal. I tried to get anal here,

628
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.070
but uh, yeah, he still hadn't showed up. So basically, you know,

629
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:06.400
I was trashing him. I was trashing other plumbers,

630
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:09.850
the entire art of plumbing I was trashing. So a lot of people ask me,

631
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.600
because at the end of my podcast, uh, the guy had not shown up.

632
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.030
And a long story short,

633
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.260
about 20 minutes after my podcast, um,

634
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:22.810
I had to do something that people do in the bathroom.

635
00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:28.510
So I went in there and got damn, and I did because I'm a fucking American.

636
00:39:28.511 --> 00:39:30.100
Wouldn't you know, one, two,

637
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:34.240
three minutes after I finished doing what is my God given,

638
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:39.241
right as a fucking American with the bathroom that I pay to use the fucking

639
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:44.680
knock at the door. Who is it? The God damn plumber. And I'm like,

640
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:48.610
you gotta be shitting me. Okay. I didn't let a match. There was no incense.

641
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:53.050
I didn't burn a newspaper or a fucking, you know,

642
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:56.290
then let it trashcan on fire. You know,

643
00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.900
like I was going to sink some doo-wop with three of my other friends.

644
00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:04.660
It was just in there, all natural. And uh,

645
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.180
I don't know, I just, you know,

646
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.160
I'd panic for half a second then I just hit this moment of then like,

647
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:13.330
you know what, I don't give a fuck.

648
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.130
So he comes walking in after already finding out that a, you know,

649
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:21.220
reading this little report that I said my six smelt like swamp ass.

650
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.600
And he comes walking in there and I'm thinking maybe, maybe I'll be lucky.

651
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.550
Three minutes has gone by. I ate a pretty healthy diet, maybe a,

652
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.470
maybe the smell left and whatever. And he walked in, said, he goes,

653
00:40:34.471 --> 00:40:38.490
Jesus Christ, because is that the smell coming out of the sink?

654
00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.180
And a, the old me would've panicked at that point, but I didn't,

655
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.090
I just hit him with straight up honesty. Hey listen, I said, listen man,

656
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.620
I gotta be honest with you. You know,

657
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:49.810
you supposed to be here an hour and a half ago.

658
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:54.780
I didn't think he was showing up. So why a took a dump and a guy, he goes, ah,

659
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:59.320
no worries. No worries dude. Just shrugged it off.

660
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.710
You know, like somebody on the vice squad seeing a body,

661
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.880
you think smelling a little bit of shifts enough to scare a fucking plumber.

662
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.680
I've got news for you. It isn't cause I lived at last week and uh, anyways,

663
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.660
it turned out to be, um, I had this filter on my, uh, on my sink

664
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.680
and I guess some bacteria had built up and Yada, Yada Yada. What the fuck?

665
00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.490
It's all good. So, uh,

666
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.540
so the guy did show up and uh,

667
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.160
there was a potentially awkward moment that I dispute. Must be,

668
00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.520
he always got to go with honesty even when it's a,

669
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.740
a disgusting one and a wow. That was just one big shit joke story. It wasn't it.

670
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:43.010
But, um, I actually got a lot of advice, uh, one from my,

671
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:47.420
a particular plumber and he was saying, ah,

672
00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.460
here's some people out there in case your, uh,

673
00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.080
the water coming out of your faucet smells like swamp ass. Okay.

674
00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:55.310
If you have a filter on there,

675
00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.520
change that goddamn filter cause that might be it. And if not,

676
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.420
this plumber says sometimes it's easier to change the whole faucet when you're

677
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:06.530
dealing with that kind of smell. Stay away from the home depot faucets,

678
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:10.730
the plastic in them eventually cracks and leaks from somewhere.

679
00:42:10.731 --> 00:42:15.470
I like Wolverine Brass, but anything with breasts and turtles should be fine.

680
00:42:15.471 --> 00:42:20.270
So there you go. You liked that. You knew what my podcast, this is what I do.

681
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.500
I tell stories from my life that and it variably ended up being a big ship joke

682
00:42:24.501 --> 00:42:28.850
story and a, you know, people listened to them and then I get information,

683
00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:30.300
I try to pass it onto you. Then he goes,

684
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:35.330
that's from an actual plumber who was also upset that the plumber didn't show up

685
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.450
because I hate when people do shit like that. Right.

686
00:42:38.451 --> 00:42:41.870
I know why it gives him a bad reputation. Evidently,

687
00:42:41.871 --> 00:42:43.430
this is one of the good ones, you know,

688
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.990
kind of like one of those by the book cops that you see that 20 minutes into the

689
00:42:47.991 --> 00:42:51.860
movie have to turn in their badge yet they continue to work the case and then

690
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:56.180
they solve it using extreme force, you know,

691
00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:00.740
doing billion dollars worth of damage to the cities

692
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.490
fucking skyscape or whatever the hell you call it.

693
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:08.390
What the hell do you call that skyline?

694
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.590
Skyscape I really am an asshole. So there you go. Yes.

695
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:14.930
Every now and you want to use a, you want to use some breasts.

696
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.670
He said something about measuring the spread between the, the uh,

697
00:43:19.671 --> 00:43:23.810
the nozzles on the faucet. And that's some shit I'm going to,

698
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:26.660
I'm going to remember to say that next time I go into a hardware store cause he

699
00:43:26.661 --> 00:43:30.200
said I might get fucked over if I walk in there and look in the way I do like a

700
00:43:30.201 --> 00:43:34.640
squeaky clean comic who takes a dump in a bathroom five minutes before the

701
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:37.640
plumber shows up. It's not my fault. He was late. Alright, here we go.

702
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.040
So anyway, if you new to my podcast, like I said,

703
00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:44.870
I give information about upcoming gigs. Don't take a left in front of me.

704
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.730
Yeah, yeah. Welcome to America.

705
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:51.920
We wait for the other guy two weeks now, but there is a right away law. Okay.

706
00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.150
Um, Jesus Christ. Let me get through this part here.

707
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:59.000
I'm trying to navigate through traffic here.

708
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:03.200
I answer a people send me questions. Um,

709
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:07.940
they might have about anything from a when's your next kid to a,

710
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:11.810
how do you fix a sink, which I pass onto one of my 15 listeners.

711
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:16.370
I'm up to 1515 listeners, one evidently of whom is a plumber.

712
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.890
So if you have any questions, just email them to me.

713
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.340
Please tell people about this podcast so I can get the number up over 20 and uh,

714
00:44:24.761 --> 00:44:27.620
and that's it. So first off, let me hype what I got coming up

715
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.230
the next episode up. Uninformed with Joe de Rosa,

716
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:39.290
my radio show with Joe de Rosa on XM Two oh two is going to be a this Saturday

717
00:44:39.991 --> 00:44:44.310
night. Well, I think it's a Saturday, May 24th.

718
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.880
I don't have a calendar in front of me. Um, May 24th,

719
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.690
uh,

720
00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:54.690
it's going to be on XM two oh two from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM we have a,

721
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:58.920
a anger management therapist coming in and those of you who listen to our show

722
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:00.990
realize that me and Jo yell at each other a lot.

723
00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.610
We tend to call each other cuts and we're trying to do a little less of that on

724
00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:10.680
the show. So whatever the lady came on, it was a great show.

725
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.200
And Joe also recently split with his longtime girlfriend, so he had a lot of,

726
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.590
a lot of pain, a lot of tears shed. So anyways,

727
00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:22.830
listen to XM two oh two, the uninformed show,

728
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:28.020
May 24th 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM with bill burn Joe to Rosa. All right,

729
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:33.780
there you go. And as far as upcoming gigs go, um,

730
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.010
I'm actually coming back to New York for one day this week. Um, uh,

731
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:41.550
going to be one of the comics on a Jim Norton standup show on HBO,

732
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.560
going to be doing 10 minutes of comedy and a,

733
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.470
that's going to be showing in airing in September. I believe so. Uh,

734
00:45:49.471 --> 00:45:54.240
I'm actually this week trying to figure out what 10 minutes I'm going to do. Um,

735
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.620
and other than that,

736
00:45:55.621 --> 00:45:59.910
I'm going to be a Caroline's comedy club on May 29th and June 1st

737
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.800
Charlie Goodnight's June 5th through the eighth and June 19th through the 21st.

738
00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:08.790
There'll be at the punchline in Atlanta.

739
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.600
All of the dates I have up on my site except for the ones that I haven't put

740
00:46:12.601 --> 00:46:16.360
down yet because I'm disorganized. And then you go, um,

741
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:19.240
anyways, back to the podcast here. Uh,

742
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.250
I want to thank everybody who came out to see me at Zany and I Chicago.

743
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.920
I went to a cubs game on Thursday and fucking sucked one of the best ballpark

744
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.210
there ever was. And every time it's like a fourth time go into a game out there.

745
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.400
And every time I go out there,

746
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:41.610
I'm always out there in April and May because I'm either doing a college or for

747
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:43.760
some reason that's when I get booked at Zany.

748
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:49.200
And I always go out there and it's like fucking 40 degrees out. And, uh,

749
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:50.103
you know,

750
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:55.800
there's barely any ivy on the wall and I feel like I'm at a bare scape just

751
00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:58.530
freezing my fucking ass off in the collar up on my coat.

752
00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.410
Like I'm going to commit a crime and a God damn baseball game.

753
00:47:01.411 --> 00:47:03.780
I'm wearing my leather coat with the further inside.

754
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:06.840
Like I'm on Barney Miller and it goddamn baseball game.

755
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.260
I really feel bad for you.

756
00:47:08.261 --> 00:47:12.480
People out there and strategy have such a beautiful city. That was a school bus.

757
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:18.000
It was a school bus that just went by. It almost took my fucking arm off. Um,

758
00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.890
you know, such a beautiful goddamn city. But that, whether it's just that,

759
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.930
that Lake Michigan man, it's like this is giant fan.

760
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:30.640
It's just pointed at that city constantly. Um, all right.

761
00:47:30.641 --> 00:47:32.230
That went nowhere. Whatever.

762
00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.560
I went to a great baseball stadium and it fucking sucked because it was a,

763
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:40.950
you know, really sucks was where I was sitting there was just open a,

764
00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.560
what have you called? I away in the new ballpark.

765
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.400
They wait until a stop at you play before they let people walk by,

766
00:47:48.401 --> 00:47:52.240
which I've bitched about in the past because I've never had the seats right

767
00:47:52.241 --> 00:47:56.500
behind the aisle. They're fucking horrific. I've never seen so much food.

768
00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.800
There's so many food and beer vendors walk by every five fucking seconds.

769
00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:03.143
<v 3>Okay.</v>

770
00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:07.980
<v 6>I missed so many goddamn place because have to have cotton candy guy.</v>

771
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.910
It's like 40 degrees out. This guy's walking around with this big stick,

772
00:48:11.911 --> 00:48:14.270
you know, you only do it. They got like that, uh, you know,

773
00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.130
they don't want you to steal a shopping cart and they got that big long pole

774
00:48:17.131 --> 00:48:19.710
going out the top of it. He's got one of those that on the end of it,

775
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.790
he's got all this fucking cotton sandy. All right.

776
00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:28.380
It's like four feet across, walking around like a fucking Hobo,

777
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.940
a diabetic, Hobo, and he keeps walking bay cut and candy

778
00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.810
like two. Nobody's buying cotton candy. All right.

779
00:48:36.811 --> 00:48:39.600
A fucking four year old buys it after he gets off a Ferris wheel.

780
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:42.780
No one buys it at a fucking baseball game and it's 40 degrees out.

781
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.220
<v 3>Okay.</v>

782
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.360
<v 6>Go get some pretzels.</v>

783
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:47.830
<v 3>Okay.</v>

784
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:47.831
<v 6>Peanut,</v>

785
00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:51.930
some shit that puts you a waste that a walking around like we don't see it.

786
00:48:51.931 --> 00:48:53.790
It's fucking Tutti. Frutti we see it

787
00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:00.150
collect candy. All right, here we go. Podcast questions. Uh,

788
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:04.950
do you enjoy living in Los Angeles? Oh, do you regret moving? Well,

789
00:49:04.951 --> 00:49:07.380
as you can obviously hear from the joy of this podcast,

790
00:49:07.381 --> 00:49:11.520
I'm having the time of my life. I'm actually, no, I don't,

791
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.690
I don't regret moving out here. I actually, yeah, for the most part,

792
00:49:15.691 --> 00:49:16.800
I love living out here.

793
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:21.390
Up until yesterday where I started to feel the beginning of the summer desert

794
00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:25.090
heat and I got to admit I'm getting a little scared. It's a, uh,

795
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.920
like they say it's definitely a dry heat, but it's a,

796
00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.320
<v 3>yeah.</v>

797
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.080
<v 6>One way to describe desert heat is a oven NESC</v>

798
00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.440
as if to say like, you know, you haven't put like, I don't know,

799
00:49:38.441 --> 00:49:42.100
you're cooking something and you get your forearm too close to the oven and you

800
00:49:42.101 --> 00:49:45.820
just feel what it feels like to be a slowly roasted.

801
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:49.690
That's what it feels like. And I'm also one of the environment,

802
00:49:49.691 --> 00:49:51.730
so I very rarely use my air conditioner.

803
00:49:51.731 --> 00:49:55.180
So right now my victor Wooten tee shirt is stuck to my back,

804
00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.260
but I'm going to plow through this here. So no, I don't regret moving out here.

805
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:03.450
Uh, it's, it has been a great experience. Definitely was an adjustment and, uh,

806
00:50:03.451 --> 00:50:05.050
I fell on a place back in New York,

807
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:08.940
so I have that little Linus blanket in my back pocket. Anytime.

808
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:09.970
I don't want to be out here.

809
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.010
I'll fucking crush up my hybrid like an old tuna can and I'll recycle it and

810
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:19.540
I'll move back. All right, number two. Um,

811
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.980
I know you like conspiracy theory, so what's your take on John F.

812
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.930
Kennedy assassination? Who Do you think killed JFK?

813
00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.170
I watched the mythbusters show one time.

814
00:50:30.171 --> 00:50:33.200
They reenacted the magic bullet and were actually able to recreate it.

815
00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:35.130
<v 3>Okay.</v>

816
00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:39.030
<v 6>Where are they? Where are they really able to fucking recreate the magic bullet?</v>

817
00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:41.190
<v 3>Yep.</v>

818
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:44.220
<v 6>Kind of easy to do that when you've got a camera crew and fucking editing and</v>

819
00:50:44.221 --> 00:50:48.270
all that crap. Um, what do I think? Um,

820
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:51.270
I think what everybody thinks, I think, uh, you know,

821
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.070
I think a lot more people were involved. Um,

822
00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.100
I don't know what the, what do I know? I don't know. I think, uh,

823
00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.930
I think basically to become president, you, uh,

824
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:07.380
gotten gotta get in bed with a lot of shady people and if you go into office,

825
00:51:07.381 --> 00:51:10.410
you turn your back on him. Um,

826
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:16.050
you're going for a ride in a convertible. That's what I think. I Dunno.

827
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.890
Obviously Oswald didn't do it or they wouldn't, they, they, they made our,

828
00:51:19.891 --> 00:51:21.180
at least didn't do it by himself,

829
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:25.110
but they wouldn't have all that stuff inked out on the top secret. You know,

830
00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.560
paper's there. God that I just sound angry, ignorant, you know,

831
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.590
I couldn't even say ignorant. All right. I don't know.

832
00:51:31.591 --> 00:51:34.070
I don't know who the fuck did it, but you know, uh,

833
00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.420
Jesus Christ is fucking Bosco head. Go

834
00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:44.210
the hell are they advertising on the back? L Kooky Kui television.

835
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.180
So I learned how to speak Spanish, man. If it's the last fucking thing I do,

836
00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:52.340
I swear to God, some of that Spanish TV, the women that are honest,

837
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.300
I,

838
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.090
some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen in my life and they always got

839
00:51:56.091 --> 00:51:58.970
those fucking like

840
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.410
Fried Stiletto heels on and do.

841
00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:08.460
What I love about Latin women is like you trust an American girl up like that.

842
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.920
She looked like she was getting whored out and this somehow on those Telemundo

843
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:17.740
shows, those girls are dressed like whores,

844
00:52:17.741 --> 00:52:22.730
but somehow they own it. They own it. And their vibe is more like, yeah,

845
00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.070
I know I look good and you'll never get this.

846
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:30.550
It probably also helps that they always have some fat 45 year old sorta used car

847
00:52:31.641 --> 00:52:36.320
looking salesman host standing next to it and he's always giggling the way I'd

848
00:52:36.321 --> 00:52:39.080
be giggling if I was standing next to him, um,

849
00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:43.550
except I wouldn't have a jet black mustache. All right, next question.

850
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:48.170
Uh, Bill, there were some corn ball names for comedy clubs, giggles, bananas,

851
00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.220
loony Bin, the funny bone. If you owned a comedy club,

852
00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:58.010
what would you, what would you name it? A, I don't know. Slap happy.

853
00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:01.070
You know what? I tried to give it a dignified name.

854
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:08.730
<v 3>Uh, Winston's an elegant night</v>

855
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.640
<v 6>of comedy and Hilarious. I don't know what the fuck I would call it.</v>

856
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.330
You know what the reality is, is that there is no good name for comedy club.

857
00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:20.850
I'm trying to think of one punchline. Punchline is a good one. Giggles stinks.

858
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.960
It really takes out any sort of Krehlik credibility away from your,

859
00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.090
like people going to be putting their hands up.

860
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:32.400
Like I'm one of those bad Asian horror movies. Um, or maybe the porno,

861
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:37.170
not the horn on mood or no, not the horror movies. I can't even fucking talk.

862
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:42.330
Breathing in this goddamn buses. Gas Fumes.

863
00:53:42.331 --> 00:53:45.330
I think I just invented a new genre film. Cornell,

864
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.740
she's Hora and porn or not. That's a fucking smudge zone. All right.

865
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:52.770
Everything's been done. God Damn it. I can't come up with an original idea.

866
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:54.870
All right, completely unrelated question,

867
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:57.900
but I was wondering what your favorite music is. Uh,

868
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:03.260
what kinds of you listening to Jesus fucking Christ like I almost fucking slam

869
00:54:03.961 --> 00:54:08.220
right into me. Wow. Imagine that.

870
00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:10.350
And he like died on my podcast,

871
00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:13.140
but I had like the energy to hit pound right before I died.

872
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.530
And so actually, uh, you know what, that would suck.

873
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:23.520
And I'd actually finally sell out a fucking club. Um, Jesus Christ,

874
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:27.780
that was so scary as fuck. I forgot the question. What are some of my favorite,

875
00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:28.890
what am I listening to right now?

876
00:54:28.891 --> 00:54:33.420
I'm actually listening to a Jimmy Hendrix band of Gypsies,

877
00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:36.150
specifically that song machine gun,

878
00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:41.970
which a I really like Google it, Google it, uh, or whatever.

879
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:46.910
Youtube it. And I watched Jimmy play it. Please don't watch John Mayer. Okay.

880
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:50.970
As he runs through the halls of his high school going fucking Jimi Hendrix,

881
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.590
um, with his Dennis Miller mullet. All right. Christ.

882
00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.440
What the fuck am I lashing out at him? Do you know why?

883
00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.870
It's because I'm trying to make a right turn.

884
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.290
The wind is blowing through my hybrid and it's blowing my little fucking sheet

885
00:55:02.291 --> 00:55:06.250
music. But I like to call the podcast questions on my lap.

886
00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:11.380
Um, wow. I'm going to finish the rest of this podcast and my garage,

887
00:55:11.381 --> 00:55:12.640
like I'm going to commit suicide.

888
00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.920
It's one of the great things about the hybrid is it's going to switch over to

889
00:55:17.921 --> 00:55:20.950
electricity. So I don't have to worry about the fumes, which is actually,

890
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.360
I saw somebody do a bit about this. Alright.

891
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.970
And we hit the power button and it is off. That's a great thing about a hybrid.

892
00:55:30.971 --> 00:55:35.580
You literally shut it off like a fucking radio. Um, all right.

893
00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:39.580
We want it down there. People stay with me. All right, number six.

894
00:55:40.330 --> 00:55:44.020
Are you the same bill borough that was in the movie. Passionata if so,

895
00:55:44.021 --> 00:55:47.020
what kind of part did you have? I'd never seen the movie,

896
00:55:47.021 --> 00:55:50.890
but I saw that a bill bird was on the cast list. Yes, that is me.

897
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.640
I was in that movie and I had a quick scene.

898
00:55:55.540 --> 00:56:00.540
I played a guy at a black check blackjack table with actually the guy who was in

899
00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:03.430
the movie. The Patriot played the, uh,

900
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.940
the general there, I guess, which was,

901
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.630
it was really over the top bad version of a, uh,

902
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:16.770
I guess a red coat and people in England got upset about it because,

903
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.560
uh, because that's not who they are over in England. You know,

904
00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:22.990
I think if you've read a history book,

905
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.080
you look at the long wonderful line of diplomacy that has been England's foreign

906
00:56:28.631 --> 00:56:32.830
policy. Um, you can understand why they would get upset by the movie,

907
00:56:32.831 --> 00:56:36.850
the Patriot and why they're so upset with America and our foreign policy.

908
00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:42.810
Because I know if any country out there would be upset by another country going

909
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:45.850
in and invading a country and oppressing its people,

910
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:50.851
it would be England because God knows they don't fucking stand for that shit.

911
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:52.241
Yes,

912
00:56:52.241 --> 00:56:55.990
this is dripping with sarcasm and this is coming from all the youtube videos.

913
00:56:55.991 --> 00:56:56.560
I see.

914
00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:59.780
Will you sit there and you see all these English people who are on that Goddamn

915
00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:02.860
high horse now? Because England's like, you know,

916
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:07.050
fourth place around the world now they can act like a like that.

917
00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:10.230
Like there's like these fucking live aid people. All right,

918
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:14.260
we tell you something to my one listener who's from fucking England,

919
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.970
if you hate America right now,

920
00:57:15.971 --> 00:57:19.090
the reason why you should hate us is because of plagiarism.

921
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:24.870
Because we still your ideas and it's how we now have our world empire,

922
00:57:25.631 --> 00:57:30.130
which will eventually fall and take it off.

923
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:31.510
You fucking high horses. Okay.

924
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:34.630
You guys have created more goddamn evil out there and we're just,

925
00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:36.490
you just passed the baton to us.

926
00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.290
Now it's our turn to be evil and you guy's a fucking fat too. All right.

927
00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:43.690
I've seen that show. You are,

928
00:57:43.691 --> 00:57:48.190
when you eat motherfuckers over there having pork chops and fry ups for

929
00:57:48.191 --> 00:57:50.140
breakfast. You know,

930
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.780
to go fuck yourselves and uh, go fuck yourselves and fuck man,

931
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.960
United Gabion Yankees of soccer. All right, there you go. Wow.

932
00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:04.790
It's a little bit hanger there. Okay. Um, not that I even give a shit. Okay,

933
00:58:04.791 --> 00:58:07.660
so don't send me some bad message that ends with mate.

934
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.440
Um, alright, that's it.

935
00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:15.710
I'm now back in my apartment constantly like that.

936
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.920
You got to hear me walk up the fucking stairs. You heard the garage door closed.

937
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:22.940
You really get led into my life here. This is like my own reality show,

938
00:58:22.941 --> 00:58:27.310
except it's not on television and there's no advertising money. Other than

939
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.910
<v 7>that, I'm making a fortune. All right, so that's the deal.</v>
