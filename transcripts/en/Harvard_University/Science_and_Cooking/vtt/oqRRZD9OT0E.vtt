00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.970
MICHAEL: OK.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.460
We should start.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.670
So thank you all for coming.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.130
So this is, remarkably enough,
week 11 of this lecture series.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.740
And we're very happy this week to have
Daniel Humm from Eleven Madison Park.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.520
Who will get to speak in a minute.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.310
And he will give a lecture
called Where is the Acid?

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.830
But before he does that,
you have to put up with me.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.211
So we have a fun game here
in Science and Cooking.

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.960
We have a fun game in
Science and Cooking.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.490
We play this sometimes.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.640
It's a parlor game.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.860
We haven't marketed it yet.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.320
No one to my knowledge has done it.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.460
It's called Guess the Food.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.430
So would anyone like to guess the food?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.840
Yes.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.340
What?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.110
AUDIENCE: Peanut butter.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.068
MICHAEL: Peanut butter.

00:01:07.068 --> 00:01:08.980
Any other guesses?

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:09.870
Yes, in the back?

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.720
AUDIENCE: Chocolate.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.771
MICHAEL: Chocolate.

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:12.270
Yes?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.570
AUDIENCE: Bone marrow.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.660
MICHAEL: Bone marrow.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.560
Actually bone marrow is the closest.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.810
This is beef.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.310
OK.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.070
So guess the food.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.540
Here's another one.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.180
It's a good game, actually.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.790
Does anybody-- yes.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.849
AUDIENCE: Olive oil.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:30.640
MICHAEL: Say again?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.450
AUDIENCE: Vegetable oil.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.090
MICHAEL: Vegetable oil.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.825
That's very good.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:33.180
It's olive oil.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.400
OK.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.140
Very good.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.830
So I mean, of course the way
you play the game of Guess

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.405
the Food is that you all know that
there are major molecules of food.

00:01:40.405 --> 00:01:41.030
There are fats.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.520
There are carbohydrates.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.610
There are proteins.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.329
There's water, which is not
listed on the food label.

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.620
And if you look at those and you look at
the percentages of the various things,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.911
you can sort of guess the food.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.290
So you guessed the vegetable oil instead
of olive oil because it was all fats.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.580
So what do you think it is?

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.311
The question I want to raise is
what else is important for food?

00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:02.810
That is, what else is important
in a recipe other than this?

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.060
I mean, look, if you have
a jar of water, right?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.890
The number of molecules per liter
in that jar of water is enormous.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.300
More than 10 to the 23.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.460
There's about 10 to 25 molecules of
water that's in a liter of water.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.550
It's a huge number.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.120
But it turns out that--
and this is the idea

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.580
I want to leave you with before
I turn this over Daniel--

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.380
is that oftentimes there are
ingredients in a recipe which

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.690
are very, very low concentrations, but
yet are extremely important for taste.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.340
And just to demonstrate this, here
is a typical recipe for lemonade.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.900
And the question is, what
makes it taste like lemonade?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.400
Yes.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:48.275 --> 00:02:49.201
MICHAEL: The acid.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:49.700
Very good.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.283
That was in the title of the lectures.

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:53.550
And where is the acid?

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.020
The acid is in the lemons.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.520
OK.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.300
Very good.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.490
So in fact, the acid that's in
the lemons is called citric acid.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.270
Here is a picture of it.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.110
And the citric acid is this complicated
formula, this chemical formula.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.510
And the main point of it is
that acid is something that

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.130
more easily loses protons to water.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.520
So an acid releases protons, which
are H pluses, which go into water.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.280
So even water, there are
protons that are in water--

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.180
I mean in the form of hydronium ions.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.625
And the concentration of them
is one part in 10 to the seven

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:35.582
of the moles per liter, which
is more than 1 10 millionth.

00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:36.790
It's actually more than that.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.410
It's like, 1 over 550 millionth
of the molecules that are in water

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.890
are these protons.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.119
But yet they are critically
important for taste.

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.160
This is what I want to tell you, that
even though there's so few of them,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.420
they are critically important for taste.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.270
And when you see Chef Daniel do magical
things with acids, then in fact,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.960
he's adding so few protons
that if all of you in this room

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.480
were water molecules, there wouldn't
be one of you is a proton in the dish

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.080
that he makes.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.120
They're just so few.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.330
But yet they're critically
important for taste.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.079
And you can control them by playing with
things that Chef Daniel will play with.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.915
And I was going to turn
it over to Chef Daniel.

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:23.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:31.052 --> 00:04:31.760
DANIEL HUMM: Wow.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.880
Thank you, Michael.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.660
How are you guys?

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.285
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:39.405
DANIEL HUMM: Hey, thank
you so much for coming.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.120
Thank you for having me here.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.520
It means a lot.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.330
It's a great honor to
be part of this program.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.290
And I'm excited to talk a little
bit about myself, my story,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.440
the story of Eleven Madison Park.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.370
And a few things that I've learned
along the way in the kitchen.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.395
But before I start I have
a confession to make.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.860
Me, I never finished high school.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.150
In fact, I hated going to school.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.400
I hated going to classes
and studying things

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.220
I knew I probably never going to use.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.770
When I was 14 I left
school to be a cook.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.090
Obviously, that was not a very
popular decision with my parents.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.030
But it's been the best
thing I ever done.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:57.790
The things that the path of cooking has
opened me to-- it's been unbelievable.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.030
The people I've met along the way.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:09.520
I've traveled the world, learned about
different foods and different cultures.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.610
I learned languages.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.930
The opportunities just
have been unbelievable.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:24.890
Eight years ago I came to this
country with two suitcases mostly full

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.920
of chef clothes, cookbooks, some knives.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.380
I had a couple hundred dollars.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.120
I did not speak English.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.530
Now I'm here speaking in
front of you at Harvard.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.786
That's insane.

00:06:45.786 --> 00:06:48.744
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.600
DANIEL HUMM: This is one of the best
schools in the world, maybe the best

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.920
school in the world.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.580
This is the American dream.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.420
When they first asked
me to speak here, I

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.040
wasn't sure if I'm the right candidate
because I'm not a public speaker.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.730
This is totally out of my comfort zone.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.000
I'm nervous standing up here.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.350
I'm a cook.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.840
The place where I feel
comfortable is the kitchen.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.910
But as I thought a little bit
more about the opportunity,

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.840
I knew that there are definitely
things I have to share.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.600
It's amazing how food has
changed over the past few years.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.990
Now everyone in the world wants to know
about food, chefs, and restaurants.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.430
When I started 25 years ago,
there was no food and science

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.075
program at Harvard, or at any school.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.790
There was no Food Network.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:08.190
There weren't all of these TV
shows, all these magazines.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.000
For sure, there were no celebrity chefs.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.460
Back then it was just
about the craft of cooking.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.530
I fell in love with it because I
love the energy in the kitchen.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.090
I love to work with fresh ingredients.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.800
I love to work with my hands,
create something with my hands.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.450
Cooking is very tangible.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.289
Something my dad always
used to say, he said,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:48.670
it doesn't matter when you're passionate
about something how big or small it is.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.900
The only thing that
matters is how much effort

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.700
you're willing to put towards that.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.420
And that's what's
cooking has been for me.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.310
And that is what Eleven
Madison Park represents today.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:12.050
I have this clicker here in my hand,
been holding it really awkwardly.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.595
I've never used one of those.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:18.110
So I just gonna give it to Mike.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.880
To put something together like
this, or to do anything great,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.960
it always takes a team.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.250
And I want to say thank
you to a few people

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.410
that help have helped a lot with this.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.830
I want to say thank you to Mike Pyers.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.580
I want to say thank you to Connie Chung.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.880
Both of them are chefs
at our restaurant,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.540
and are in charge of all the
research and development.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.760
I want to say thank you
to Aaron Ginsberg, who is

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.090
our director for strategic development.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:08.710
And he has spent hours with me
practicing this, literally hours.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:17.270
I wanna say thank you to [? Ali ?]
[? Busari ?] who is a friend

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.860
and the scientist who
helped so much with this,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.160
and made sure we have
all the facts right.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:32.630
I also want to say thank you to
my business partner, Will Guidara,

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.780
and my best friend.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.600
I want to say thank you to a few things.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:42.090
On one side, I want to say thank you
to create the culture of hospitality

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:48.120
and service that has set new
standards in our industry,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:55.200
because we can talk about food
and work our time in the kitchen,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:01.370
but if the hospitality and the
service sucks, it all doesn't matter.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.630
So thank you for that.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:10.930
In addition, I want to say thank you for
supporting me, teaching me, pushing me

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:16.460
to do things I never thought I could.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.060
I also want to say thank
you to my girlfriend, Cara,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.110
and her mom, who are both here today.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:28.530
Because we can have all the
support professionally and at work,

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.350
but you also need the support at home.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.387
So please give a hand of
applause to all of them.

00:11:34.387 --> 00:11:37.866
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:49.640
So let me give you a little
context about the restaurant.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.230
Eleven Madison Park is in
the heart of Manhattan.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.080
It's on Madison Avenue and 24th Street.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.980
It's in a beautiful art deco building.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.930
The building is occupying
an entire city block.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.080
In fact, the building
was supposed to become

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.130
the tallest building in the
world, when it was built in 1928.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.930
But due to the Great Depression,
the build was halted.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:20.580
But what we ended up with is
this incredible dining room.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:25.690
30-foot tall ceilings,
huge windows overlooking

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.970
Madison Square Park, one of the
most beautiful parks in New York.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:35.420
You even can see the Flatiron Building.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:42.580
Imagine this dining room was supposed
to be the lobby of the tallest

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.810
building in the world.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:50.000
There is no other restaurant
with a better view than ours.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.700
It's such a New York space,
such a New York room.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:59.150
So it's important that through the
experience we pay homage to our food

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:05.510
and through the delivery of
the food to the place we're in.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:12.905
Our inspiration comes from fishermen,
farmers, artisans all around New York.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.850
What people don't
realize when they think

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:24.920
about New York-- all they think of is
Manhattan and this concrete jungle.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.710
But we're on the Atlantic
coast, which is one

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.710
of the most amazing waters for seafood.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.280
Also, when you drive just
a half an hour north,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.495
you reach farmland for hours
and hours and miles and miles.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:47.320
The Hudson Valley, the Finger Lakes
have some of the most amazing conditions

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.120
for agriculture, because of its
soil, the surrounding waters,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.490
and its amazing climate.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:59.040
But in addition what we
have, we have New York City.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.500
Hundreds of years of history.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.540
Immigrants from all over the
world came to settle this place.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.510
They all brought food traditions.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:15.120
These traditions have evolved, and
new traditions have been created.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.660
Eating at Eleven Madison
Park is the intersection--

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.110
I can hear my business partner,
Will, laugh through the [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:35.690
It's the intersection between, on one
side we have these amazing ingredients,

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.560
the amazing agriculture,
and on the other side

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:47.410
we have this rich history and culture
of New York, the place that is our home.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.940
But that's not why I am here today.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:56.790
I'm here to talk about
acid, and acids in food.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:59.870
Where is the acid?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.850
My staff hears me say this more
than they probably care to remember.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.990
But where is the acid is
really the central question

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.210
when we create a new dish.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.240
When seasoning foods,
everyone talks about salt.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:25.940
I believe acid is just as important--
maybe more important-- than salt.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:31.310
When I grew up in Switzerland, I
was always drawn to acidic foods.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.090
I love tomatoes.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.330
I love citrus fruits.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.410
I love pickles.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:42.450
My mom's cooking-- sauerkraut, roasted
chicken with lemon and rosemary.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:48.960
She made a braised rabbit with
olives, orange, and pickled onions.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.920
I never knew exactly why I
was drawn to these dishes

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.510
so much, why they were my favorite.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.680
But looking back it makes
sense, because there

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:05.560
was presence of acid, which gave it
balance, and it highlighted the food.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:13.760
At Eleven Madison Park, why
does this matter so much?

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.360
Well, I think acid
catches your attention.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.140
I think when you taste acid,
it kind of wakes you up.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.680
And it just makes food better.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.660
Acid just makes food better.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.520
At Eleven Madison we serve tasting
menus-- 14, 15, 16 courses.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.950
It's important that all
these dishes have acid.

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.650
We use acid from so
many different sources.

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:46.400
But it keeps the guest excited.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.290
It keeps the meal lighter.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:53.120
And it makes the guest want more.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.390
Our food is different than, let's
say, traditional French food,

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.155
where it relies heavily
on butter, cream, and fat.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.569
Until a few years ago, we
never really thought too much

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:10.319
about the amounts of acid we were using.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.770
But then we started kind
of digging into our food

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.740
and trying to understand
our food a little bit more.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:24.069
And we realized that the acid is
the foundation of our cuisine.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:30.180
And as we dug even deeper,
we realized that acid

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.050
was doing so many other things.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:38.050
And these three things I
want to tell you today about.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.300
Number one, acid affects
the flavor in food.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:48.300
Number two, acid affects
the structure in food.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.110
And number three, we use
acid to preserve food.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.300
Let's get into flavor.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.380
Obviously flavor comes first.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.690
It's the most important to us.

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.210
We want the food to be delicious.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:17.610
When we add acid to food, it changes
how you perceive the other basic tastes.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:24.360
It interacts with the saltiness, the
sweetness, with umami, and with bitter.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.840
A great example for this-- and
I'm sure you've all seen it--

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:34.310
but sometimes you get an
espresso with a slice of lemon.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:39.550
That lemon is there to squeeze
lemon juice in the espresso.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.620
What it does, you add
sour to the bitter.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:49.290
And it makes you perceive
the bitter as less bitter.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.130
Thankfully, coffee has gotten
a lot better over the years,

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.770
so you don't see that that much anymore.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.940
But that was the reason why.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.560
We also looked at some
manufactured foods.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.780
Coca-Cola, soy sauce, ketchup.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:15.210
All of these rely heavily on
acid for the same reason--

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.150
it balances the sugar, the saltiness.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:20.990
But here is something else.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:29.690
It also makes food have
a better shelf life.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:35.390
These ingredients sometimes sit
on the shelf for two, three years.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.010
Really, two, three years.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.860
And you taste it, and you still
sort of feel like they're fresh.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.300
Acid also affects the aroma in food.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.890
And that is really important
for us in the kitchen.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:54.610
We play with this all the time.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:20:00.100
Let's say we make a lemon sorbet.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.310
Let's say we make a lemon
sorbet just using lemon juice.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.920
That's like every lemon
sorbet that's out there.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.475
It's good.

00:20:11.475 --> 00:20:13.690
It's a good lemon sorbet.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.820
But let's say we also introduce
aroma to this lemon sorbet.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:24.460
And the way we do it, the sugar that
is required to make that sorbet,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:30.320
we take sugar cubes and we rub it on the
skin of those lemons, and then season

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.200
the sorbet with that.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.850
So now we're also introducing aroma.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.990
And now when you taste that lemon
sorbet, you smell that lemon sorbet,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.150
and it elevates the
flavor of that sorbet.

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.440
The same thing happens
when you peel a grapefruit.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.370
I'm sure you've all peeled
grapefruit before, before you eat it.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.920
When you peel it, the aromas,
the oils, they're on your hands.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.040
They hit your nose.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.090
And by the time you eat that
grapefruit, it tastes unbelievable.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:07.310
The best grapefruit you ever had.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.580
It tastes much better than a
grapefruit you would just get served

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.520
on a plate that's been pre-sliced.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.890
In cocktails we use it a lot.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.860
If you're at the bar,
and you're ordering

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.440
a Manhattan-- I don't know if you're
old enough, everyone in here--

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.380
but if you have a
Manhattan, the bartender,

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:41.590
at the very end of serving you
that drink, adds a twist of orange.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.460
That twist of orange,
that aroma hits your nose,

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:51.140
it elevates the flavor of that drink.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.660
All these things happen
because your brain

00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:01.665
is making a connection between
what it tastes and what it smells.

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.650
It elevates the experience.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.520
It's like going from
black and white to color.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:20.060
We have some bags here for you.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.300
And I'm sorry, Michael,
you know, we weren't

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.240
quite as prepared as I wanted to.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.690
But we disturbed your talk a
little bit to bring in these bags.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.080
But here you have it.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.670
Please grab in these bags.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.620
There are two small bottles.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:41.161
I want you just take out
the two small bottles.

00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:41.660
OK.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.790
And now put the bag back down.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.580
We're gonna taste these.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.430
I would like to taste these as well.

00:23:02.777 --> 00:23:03.743
Thank you.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.680
In these two bottles we have soda.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.180
We've made a lot of different
sodas over the years.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.570
Celery soda, cherry soda,
coffee soda, strawberry soda.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:26.020
But for here for you
today, we have maple soda.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:30.210
I want to taste the first one
without the sticker on it.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.730
It definitely tastes like maple syrup.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.630
But it tastes really sweet also.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:04.480
In fact, it's good, but I wouldn't
really want to drink this soda.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.660
It's too sweet.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.057
It's not balanced.

00:24:08.057 --> 00:24:09.140
Let's taste the other one.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.760
And it's pretty impressive, our
team filled all these small bottles

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.280
this afternoon.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:29.500
And even I don't know-- yeah.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.344
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.980
Even more impressive is
that they're still cold.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.120
Let's taste this one.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:53.830
These sodas are made
exactly the same way.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.210
It's the same recipe.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.750
There's one change.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:05.240
And this soda, for me, tastes a lot
less sweet, a lot more balanced,

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.710
a lot more delicious.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:12.120
Kind of like what you want soda to be.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:18.130
We added, in this case, apple
cider vinegar to balance this out.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.270
So this is an example
I wanted to give you,

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.490
because it kind of is a strong example.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:33.950
And the soda goes from really not
really drinkable to delicious.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:40.830
In food it's not always this extreme.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.195
It can be much more subtle.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.330
But it can elevate-- the
right amount of acid--

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.120
can elevate the experience of a dish.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.060
Let's talk about our first dish here.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.970
This dish is a seafood boil.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:06.860
It's inspired by seafood boil you would
have out by the water on the ocean.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.810
This seafood is extremely fresh.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.700
There's prawns, lobster, clams.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.870
It's amazing seafood.

00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.500
You could just steam that and eat
it, and it would be delicious.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:28.060
But what we do, we cook it in a
broth of lemon, beer, and tomato.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:34.560
We then bring it out to the dining room,
and we put a big wooden board right

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.420
in the middle of the table.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.150
We take that seafood and we
dump it right onto that board.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:49.450
We're asking our guests to eat
this dish with their hands.

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:55.950
But before they do, we're asking
them to squeeze some fresh lemon

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:57.700
over that seafood.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.040
So now we're introducing
aroma to already the acid

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.840
that we introduced during cooking.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:11.005
It elevates that seafood
and makes it a better dish.

00:27:11.005 --> 00:27:14.165
Our next dish is a roasted duck.

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:18.580
This dish is on the menu all the time.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:22.290
These are these amazing ducks
we get up from the Finger Lakes.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:26.840
We're really proud of the
product and the preparation.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.220
It's glazed with honey.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:36.500
On this picture we serve it with
rutabaga, whipped honey, some bee

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:47.490
pollen, and then a sauce that is made
with caramelized sugar, duck choux,

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:51.060
and there's four acids in this sauce.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:57.450
We have lemon juice, lime juice,
orange juice, and vinegar.

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.920
The duck is gamy,
meaty, fatty, and rich.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:10.350
Now we're also adding sugar in the
form of the honey and in the sauce.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:16.340
So it's really, really important that
we're playing with a lot of acids.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.800
And it's sort of like the
sensation of sweet and sour.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.380
Here we have oysters.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.350
We get these oysters from Long Island.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.430
They're two hours away
from our restaurant.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.200
We get them every day.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.180
And they're as fresh
as an oyster can be.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.980
You could just shuck them and
eat them right out of the shell.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.330
And it would be delicious.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:51.720
These oyster are served with
champagne grapes, a [? snow ?]

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:57.060
that we make with Concord grape
juice and red wine vinegar.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.950
And we also have sorrell.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:04.630
A lot of the guests come
up to me and say, wow.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.710
These are the freshest
oysters I ever had.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.580
Or they come to me and say, wow.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.650
The combination of oysters
and grapes is unbelievable.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.810
And that's cool.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:25.460
But what they're really responding
to is the high amounts of acid

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.800
that is in the [? snow ?].

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.600
And it makes them believe-- they've
had oysters this fresh before--

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.880
but the high amounts of acid
makes them believe that these

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.750
are the freshest oysters they ever had.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:48.090
It's the same thing that we
talked about manufactured foods.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.440
They add acid to make
shitty food taste better.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.950
But if we use that, and we
use the best ingredients

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:04.430
that we can get our hands on, and
we're adding acid in the right amount,

00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:09.160
we can make a great product
into an unbelievable product.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.276
Here we have the second one.

00:30:17.276 --> 00:30:17.775
Structure.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:31.270
Just like we did with this spoon,
acid changes the structure in food.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:36.330
We took this spoon, we bent it, it
changes the function of the spoon.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.330
Here we have milk.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.860
We're adding acid.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.800
We're changing the structure
of the molecules in that milk,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.140
and it turns it into curd.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.330
This is the basics of cheese-making.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.622
I want to show you this
in one of our dishes

00:30:58.622 --> 00:31:00.080
where we use that to our advantage.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:07.380
Here, are all the way on the left
side, you see a pot with milk.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.280
And there's some hay in it.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.900
And the hay is there to flavor the milk.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.650
And there's also lemon
juice in that milk.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.830
Now we're bringing that
milk up to temperature.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.470
And you can see how
it starts to separate.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.620
Then we're straining it.

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:31.150
So now we have the curd on one side,
and the whey on the other side.

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:35.870
The whey usually is a byproduct,
and it gets thrown out.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:42.010
But what I love about this dish is
how we bring these two ingredients

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.770
back together.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.710
We're making a gnocchi.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:49.560
We're taking the curd and
we roll it in semolina.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:55.320
We're taking the whey and make
it into a really flavorful broth.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.640
We serve the gnocchi with
some beautiful greens.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.650
And we pour the broth table side.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.440
This is a dish of scallops.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:15.610
And it's a raw scallop just marinated.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.200
We get these amazing scallops.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.080
We open them fresh out of the shell.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.370
They're still alive.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:28.430
We marinate them with green apple
juice so the scallop firms up.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:33.910
It changes the structure
in those scallops.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:39.780
And Michael was just flying through
this thing, but he touched on ceviche.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.160
But it's the same thing
that happens with ceviche.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.770
The lemon, lime, or pineapple juice.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.480
It changes the structure
in that seafood,

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.120
and it gives it a different texture.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:33:01.510
The apple juice that we use to marinate
this scallop is also affected by that.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:10.370
We're adding citric ascorbic
acid to this apple juice.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:16.170
And we use it because it's
close to flavor neutral.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:25.800
But the addition of ascorbic acid keeps
the apple juice from turning brown.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.410
This is the same thing that
happens when you make a guacamole.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:36.400
You add lemon to that avocado
so it doesn't turn brown.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:41.255
The same thing can happen with
mushrooms, or when you peel artichokes.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.140
Here we have egg yolks.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.956
I love eggs.

00:33:52.956 --> 00:33:58.900
Eggs Is probably one of the most
versatile ingredient that we work with.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:06.100
And all the way on the left side,
the top part is a raw egg yolk.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.190
On the bottom, we open it up
so we show you the consistency.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.666
Egg yolks are extremely creamy.

00:34:14.666 --> 00:34:20.780
But we try to find a way, how
can we make it even creamier?

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.050
In the middle, we took
the egg yolk on the top,

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:30.100
and we marinated it in white
balsamic vinegar for two days.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.929
On the bottom, in the
middle, we open it up

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.560
to show you the change in consistency.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.010
That egg yolk got thicker, creamier.

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.159
And then we took it even further.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.340
All the way on the
right is an yolk that's

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:50.159
been sitting in white balsamic
vinegar for seven days.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:54.040
And you can see on the bottom
picture, all the way on the right,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:58.900
that now the egg yolk is
barely liquid anymore.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.890
It's gotten a lot firmer.

00:35:01.890 --> 00:35:02.875
And that's pretty cool.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:14.030
Here, this is an experiment
that we did just for today.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.985
This is red cabbage.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:24.980
And red cabbage is functioning
like a natural pH meter.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.930
We added acids and we added alkalines.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:36.670
And just based on those colors,
you can see the change in pH.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:44.720
All the way on the left, we added white
wine vinegar, the most acidic things

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.520
we added off all of them.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.770
Then we added white wine.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:58.090
The third one, we actually just added
cabbage juice as being the neutral one.

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:05.760
And then we're adding alkalines,
which the blue one is baking soda.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.720
Then we added lye.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.905
And then we added bleach.

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.660
Obviously you don't want to eat this.

00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.470
But this is really cool.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.380
Just by the change of pH,
the color changes-- and these

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.700
are bright colors-- dramatically.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.920
This happens with other things, too.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.250
For example, a blueberry muffin.

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.320
You've all had blueberry muffins.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:44.970
When you look at a blueberry muffin,
sometimes you see around the blueberry

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:46.620
a small circle of green.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:50.480
The blueberry is starting to turn green.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.670
This happens because the
baking soda is interacting

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:00.020
with the acid in the blueberries.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:05.130
When you see that, it's
usually not a good sign.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.680
It's not the best blueberry
muffin you ever had,

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.760
because it means there's
too much baking soda in it.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.610
But that's what happens.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.100
And the same thing happens right now.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.760
You walk outside on the
streets, and you see

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.840
all the leaves changing on the trees.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.300
There's other things
that go on there, but one

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:28.290
of the biggest reasons that
these leaves are changing color

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.960
is because the pH level in
these leaves is changing.

00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:38.130
Preservation.

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:45.160
Acid is involved in two
types of preservations.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.912
On one side we have pickling.

00:37:47.912 --> 00:37:49.703
And on the other side
we have fermentation.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:01.800
If you take this cucumber
here, if you just let it sit,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.360
bad bacteria will grow.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.610
And I know the picture of this
bacteria is kind of ridiculous,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.950
but, somehow I wanted
to make this point.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:20.980
If you let this cucumber sit,
these bacterias will grow,

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.275
it will destroy the cucumber,
or it will destroy you.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:37.050
In the presence of
acid, bad bacteria dies.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:37.550
Come on.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:48.680
In pickling, we simply add
acid in form of vinegar.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:54.100
In fermentation, acid
is naturally produced,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.540
which will keep the bad
bacteria from growing.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.610
We use this all the time.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:07.220
Here on this picture we have
pickled purple egg plants.

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.430
The one on the right
is just the raw slice.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:13.410
The one on the left has been pickled.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:18.790
What's really cool here too is because
of the egg plant's purple skin,

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.881
it penetrates that color throughout.

00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:23.130
And it looks really beautiful.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:28.200
Here we have pickled plums.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.240
Sometimes we use the
sous-vide method for pickling.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:39.350
Pickling under pressure speeds
up the process of pickling.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:43.280
Here we have fermented mustard greens.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.430
We simply let these
mustard greens ferment

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:52.190
by adding salt, water,
onions, and ginger.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:58.000
And again, through the fermentation
process, acid is produced.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.590
And it will keep bad
bacteria from growing.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:07.790
Here we have a foie gras dish
that we serve in the restaurant.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.470
It's a foie gras dish with sunchokes.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:11.410
I love this dish.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:15.640
And it's a dish that we serve
during the winter months.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.330
And I love this dish so
much because preservation

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:27.400
allows us here to use ingredients
that are out of season.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.636
On this dish we have
fermented mustard greens.

00:40:32.636 --> 00:40:34.510
And they're a little
hard to see, and I think

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.390
we could have picked
maybe a better picture,

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:40.530
but I promise you they're there.

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:49.650
We have pickled sunchokes, and we have
a relish of onions and mustard seeds.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:55.340
I love how preservation is
helping us in this dish.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:58.570
We're using ingredients
that are out of season.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.420
But in addition, also
preservation is bringing acid

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:07.640
to the dish, which helps balance the
flavor of that the rich and creamy foie

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.140
gras.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.360
We could talk about this
an entire lecture and more.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.740
It's a really complex topic--
fermentation preservation.

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.190
And I know a week from
today Jody Adams will

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:29.310
give an entire class on fermentation.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.070
Let's get back to our original question.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.710
Where's the acid?

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:46.780
We use many different acids
from all kinds of places.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.075
So let's look into our pantry.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.770
This is a picture of our dry storage.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:03.450
We have bottled vinegars that we buy
from balsamic vinegars, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:08.180
vinegars, sherry vinegars,
red wine vinegars.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.070
We have all kinds of vinegar
powders that we're using.

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.030
Malic acid powders, lactic acid
powders, citric acid powders.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.350
We're also making our own vinegar.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:28.260
We have a vinegar machine, and
then we age the vinegar in barrels.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:36.300
Making our own vinegar allows us
to be very specific to our dishes.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.800
In our walk-in, we have
all the fresh dairy

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:47.820
that brings us the lactic acid from
creme fresh, yogurt, cream, and milk.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.930
And then of course we
have all the fruits.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:55.765
Citrus fruits, apples,
pineapples, they give us acid.

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:02.880
We're using a pH meter
at the restaurant.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:11.160
And we're using it as a measure to give
us more consistency, more accuracy.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.885
We're using it in a way we use a scale,
or in a way we measure temperature.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:25.210
I want to talk a little bit
about some of the pH levels

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:27.480
that we've learned about.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.720
And I want to start with water.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.810
And remember-- I'm sure
you probably all know this,

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:41.140
but I want to remind you-- that
the lower the number in pH,

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:43.890
the higher the acidity.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:50.350
So we took our still water-- and this
is the water we serve with our meal--

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:55.772
we took still water, and
we measured it at 7.5.

00:43:55.772 --> 00:43:59.680
7 Is neutral, so it's
very close to neutral.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.910
Then we measured our sparkling water.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:05.680
And our sparkling
water is highly acidic.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.520
And then we even ask ourselves,
is it just the bubbles?

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.270
Or when it goes flat,
will the acidity remain?

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.800
And it does.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.060
What's cool about here
is that we actually

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:24.490
learn that CO2 is a source of acid.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:33.910
So we can add CO2 to anything, and
the acidity in that will increase.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.840
But then there's something else.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:43.460
When you go have dinner, the most simple
question in the beginning of your meal,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.790
do you want still or sparkling water?

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:50.650
This question is not
that simple anymore,

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:53.500
because it changes the experience
of your meal dramatically.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:02.680
We also looked at the manufactured
foods that we talked earlier.

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.130
And we measured those.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.140
They're highly acidic, all of them.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:17.230
But the most surprising
here was Coca Cola.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:19.400
Everyone in the world drinks Coca-Cola.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:22.080
Everyone loves Coca-Cola.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.100
Coca-Cola is more acidic
then red wine vinegar.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:28.030
Just imagine that.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:29.230
Isn't that crazy?

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:30.470
You eat that with your meal.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:34.010
It's more acidic than red wine vinegar.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.690
That's unbelievable.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:41.125
And when you drink Coca-Cola, you
never think of it as being acidic.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:50.600
And that's because there's so much
sugar to balance all that acid,

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:56.300
it makes it a beverage
that everyone loves.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.700
I talked about this dish earlier.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.210
Our duck dish.

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:08.310
And I told you the sensation of sweet
and sour, and how crucial the sauce is.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:16.370
The perfect level in
this sauce of pH is 4.6.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:23.190
So I wanted to see if we take
our cooks, are line cooks,

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:27.180
and we have them make this sauce
over a period of three weeks.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:33.760
Make it blindly without a
pH meter, just by taste.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.830
And this is what they came in,
in those ranges they came in.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:41.990
Between 4.3 and 4.9.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.430
It's pretty close, don't you think?

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:48.890
It's really close.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.730
And it's just by taste.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.210
So then I wanted to see, OK.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.660
Let's take our more experienced
cooks, our sous chefs.

00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:02.880
And let's have them do the same thing,
and see if they could get it closer.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.360
And thankfully, They did.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:29.390
But hey, just to be clear, when I make
this sauce-- But so, that's great.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:30.820
We have pH levels.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.030
And it helps us to
make it more accurate.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.960
And it's a great tool.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.890
But even if that sauce
has the perfect pH level,

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.490
it doesn't mean the sauce is delicious.

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:47.250
It can taste totally off.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.120
And I think that is where the
magic of cooking comes in.

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:56.720
We can have all these scientific
tools, but it will never

00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:03.590
replace the palate or the talent of
the chefs who are in the kitchen.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:11.470
Talk about wine.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:26.990
And this is based on the
people I worked with on this.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:29.370
You might drink different
wines at Harvard, but--

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.770
We can't talk about acid
and not mentioning wine.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:44.090
Wine is such a big part of our
restaurant, of the dining experience.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.645
And acid in wine is
so, so, so important.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:55.160
We have the wines on the left
that we pair with our food.

00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:01.610
And then we have the wines that
you might drink in college.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.900
And we measured those.

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:11.220
And for our pairing, remember our food
is highly acidic, so what we need,

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:15.520
we need the wine to
be a perfect pairing.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:23.360
To pair food, you need a wine that is
just as acidic, maybe even more acidic.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:31.930
And what that does is it lets the
flavor of the wine come through.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:38.230
It lets the wine be wine, and
not be overpowered by the food.

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:46.170
Although the wines on the right,
that was a surprise to us,

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:49.450
because these wines,
they are highly acidic.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.540
When we drink these
wines, we think of them

00:49:52.540 --> 00:50:01.610
as extremely sweet, very high in
alcohol, and very low in acidity.

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:05.300
So we were surprised
to see these numbers.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:11.505
So again, the pH level is
not-- you can't taste the pH.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:19.520
In these wines of
lesser quality, there is

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:29.720
acid added artificially to balance
all that sweetness and that sugar.

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:33.270
And that's why when
you drink cheap wine,

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:38.645
you have a way worse hangover than
when you drink good quality wine.

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.580
There is a common theme.

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:52.050
Manufactured foods add acid
to make bad food taste better.

00:50:52.050 --> 00:51:02.710
The wine industry takes this really
sweet, high alcoholic, bad grape juice,

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:07.681
they add acid, and they can sell it.

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:16.750
If we take that knowledge and we add
it to the best ingredients we have,

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:23.805
and we use it carefully, we can make
food from great to unbelievable.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.360
It affects all levels of food.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.375
On every level, acid changes
and highlights the ingredients.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:42.000
So I've been talking a lot.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.570
But I want to talk about one more dish.

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.040
And this dish I'm really excited about.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.990
This is a dish that we
serve at the restaurant.

00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:57.820
We've been serving it for a long time.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:52:04.390
It's a dish that a lot of people
talk about, and people really love.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.730
It's a dish of carrot tartare.

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:12.840
This dish is inspired by a
classic New York steak tartare.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.360
And we worked on this idea for a while.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.330
This is what we came up with.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:23.990
Also, I think it's what
we talked about earlier,

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.730
the intersection between
great ingredients

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:29.650
and the history of New York.

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:33.330
I think it's demonstrated
in this dish really well.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.910
We have these amazing carrots
from upstate New York,

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:39.760
from the Hudson Valley.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:43.610
We get it from a farm, his
name is Alex [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:47.170
This guy's been growing
carrots for the last 40 years.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:50.220
He grows about 40
different types of carrots.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:55.000
These are the best carrots
I have ever tasted.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.310
We wanted to make them
the star of this dish.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:04.020
And the way we serve it, we bring out
this meat grinder into the dining room,

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.200
and we clamp it on to the table.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.530
At this point the guests don't
really know what to expect.

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.830
They expect to be meat.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:20.050
But then we come out with
these amazing carrots.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:23.920
And in this dish we
demonstrate all three things

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:25.870
that we talked about today.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:30.210
In this dish, acid affects
the flavor in food.

00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:35.670
In this dish, acid affects
the structure in the food.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:40.390
And also, we're using
acid to preserve food.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:47.160
So the cook comes out and grinds these
carrots table side into that board.

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:53.290
And on that pallet of ingredients, we
ask our guests to be their own chefs,

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:59.210
and add these ingredients to
their liking, and mix it together.

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:05.010
We have a marinated egg yolk--
what we talked about earlier.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.500
We have pickled mustard seeds.

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.360
We have compressed apples.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:15.940
We have a mustard of apple.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.840
And we have a carrot vinaigrette.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:25.760
And now, in your bag, there's a
jar with this dish already mixed.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.180
We also have a little
bag of some rye crackers.

00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:32.970
You can dip them in.

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:39.240
I would have loved to bring like,
300 meat grinders and make that dish

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.220
for you, but I couldn't.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.110
So this is already mixed.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:47.340
And please taste it.

00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.560
Acid is so important in this dish.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.580
You can taste it.

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:59.250
And acid in a way, it's such
a simple thing, adding acid.

00:54:59.250 --> 00:55:06.000
But then also acid does so many
complicated things that we didn't know,

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.575
and we simply took for granted.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.300
There is one more thing
in that bag for you.

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:21.490
And everyone, anyone who leaves
a restaurant at Eleven Madison

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:25.880
leaves with a jar of granola.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.175
The granola has nothing to do with acid.

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:34.650
But we're also in the
hospitality business.

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:41.800
And we just wanted you to
have a delicious breakfast.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.970
Thank you guys.
