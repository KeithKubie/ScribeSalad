00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.009
Here's the Ensemble Learning algorithm. We're done,

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.610
Michael, we're done with the entire lesson.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.800
We don't have to do anything else anymore. We know that we're supposed to

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.320
look over subset of data, pick up rules, and then combine them. So, what

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.120
else do you need to know in

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.400
order to write your first Ensemble Learning algorithm?

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.010
&gt;&gt; So, I'm already kind of uncomfortable with this notion of"

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.030
combine," right? So, like, I can think of lots of really dumb

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.700
ways to combine things. Like, choose one at random or, you

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.318
know, I don't know, add em all up and divide by pi

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:28.750
I mean so, so presumably there's gotta be

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.700
some intelligence in how this combination is taking place

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.970
&gt;&gt; Yes, you would think so, but your not

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.320
at all bothered about how you pick a subset?

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.800
&gt;&gt; Oh ,I was imaging you meant random subsets.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.650
&gt;&gt; Oh ,so you'd automated assumption about how we were going to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.252
pick a subset. You just [CROSSTALK] weren't sure how to combine them. Well

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:46.980
actually let's explore that for a minute. Here's kind of the dumbest

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
thing you can imagine doing. That turns out to work out pretty well.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.620
We're going to pick subsets, by, I'm going to say uniformly. Just to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.360
be specific about it. So ,we're going to do the dumbest thing

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.960
that we can think of, or one one of the dumbest

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.550
things you could think of. Or maybe ,we should say simplest and

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.180
not dumbest so as not to, to, to make a value

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.900
judgment. That you can think of doing which would be to just

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.640
uniformly randomly Choose among some of the data, and say that's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.110
the data I'm going to look at, and then I'm going to apply some

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.020
learning algorithm to it. Is that what you were thinking of Micheal?

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.340
&gt;&gt; Okay, so just pick a subset of the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.630
data, apply a learner to it. I'll get some

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.410
hypothesis out, I'll get some rule out. And now

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.740
I'm going to combine them, so since were being simple. Why

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.080
don't we try doing something simple for combining. Let's

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.210
imagine, Michael, that we're doing a regression. What's kind of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.250
the simplest thing you could do if you have

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.240
ten different rules which tell you, how you should be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.080
predicting some new data point? What's the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.490
simplest thing you could imagine doing with it?

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.390
&gt;&gt; So, okay, so each of them spits out a number. I guess if we kind

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.070
of equally believe in each of them, a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.530
reasonable thing to do would be to average.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.140
&gt;&gt; Great. So, a very simple way of combining, in the case of

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.720
regression, would be to average them. We'll simply take the mean. And by

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.350
the way, why wouldn't we equally believe in each of them. Each one

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.890
of them learned over a random subset of the data. You have no reason.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:06.280
&gt;&gt; Well.
&gt;&gt; To believe

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.008
one's better than the other.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:09.925
&gt;&gt; There's a couple of reasons. One ,it could be a

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:12.250
bad random subset. I don't know how I would measure that.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.640
&gt;&gt; I could be a good random subset.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then we'd want, we'd want that to count more in

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.220
the mean. But, but I guess what I was thinking more in terms

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.410
of maybe for some of the subsets you know, it gets more

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.650
error than others or it uses more complex rule than others or something.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.560
&gt;&gt; I could imagine that. Actually maybe we can explore how this sort of idea

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.310
might go wrong. Let's, let's do that. Maybe we can do that with the quiz.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.130
You like quizzes, right?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.370
&gt;&gt; They're important.
