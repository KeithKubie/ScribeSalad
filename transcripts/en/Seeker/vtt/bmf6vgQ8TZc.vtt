00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.970
You know why babies look so young?

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.679
They don’t smoke!

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:04.800
Also they’re babies!

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.200
Ok Jules wrote this joke didn't he?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.300
Hey puffy people, Julian here for Dnews!

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.119
We all know smoking can dramatically shorten
your lifespan and give you a whole host of

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.650
terrible diseases.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.439
But did you know it can also make you look
like you chose poorly when trying to figure

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.779
out which cup is the Holy Grail?

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.910
For non-fans of Indiana Jones, in which case…
why?, what I’m trying to say is that smoking

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.720
can make you look older than you are, and
not in a good way, like a beard might.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.950
And that’s not just anecdotal.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.870
In November 2013, a study in the Journal of
the American Society of Plastic Surgeons compared

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.610
79 pairs of twins at a Twins Day Festival
in Twinsburg, Ohio.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.260
That’s a lot of twins.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420
Anyway, they only chose pairs where one was
a smoker and the other a non-smoker, or, if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.050
they were both smokers, that one had smoked
for five years longer than the other.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.560
The researchers took photographs of the twins
to plastic surgeons, and asked them to point

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.100
out “specific components of facial aging”
related to smoking, and to figure out which

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.580
of the two was the smoker.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.609
57 percent of the time, the surgeons got it
right and pointed out parts of the face which

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.149
reflected smoke-related aging the most.

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.210
Specifically, smokers were more likely to
have redundant or saggy eyelid skin, bags

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.740
under the eyes, baggy skin on the cheekbones
(also called malar bags or festoons), nasolabial

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.740
folds (or laugh lines), upper and lower lip
wrinkles, and jowls.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.040
But, why?

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.710
Why does smoking make you look like Rip Van
Winkle?

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.109
Well, part of it has to do with nicotine’s
effect as a vasoconstrictor, meaning, it narrows

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.710
your blood vessels, allowing less blood through.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.990
Since oxygen is carried through the body by
blood, your skin receives less oxygen.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.880
Skin cells need oxygen to rebuild themselves,
and when it is restricted, they do a worse

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.049
job, causing noticeable changes in the condition
of your skin.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.299
In addition, smoking lowers the number of
red blood cells in your body.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.930
Too few red blood cells, a condition called
anemia, can cause a loss of color in the skin,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.999
making it appear grayer or lighter, also called
pallor.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.069
While smokers might not always be clinically
anemic, they do see similar effects.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.649
Additionally, smokers tend to have saggier
skin overall, but especially in the face.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.869
This is because skin firmness and suppleness
is dictated by how much collagen is produced

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.060
by the body.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.930
Collagen is a type of structural protein in
tissue, and a study from 2002 found that certain

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.239
types were synthesized about 20% less in smokers,
leading to premature facial wrinkling and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.610
poor wound healing.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.019
And don’t forget, poor wound healing also
means more scarring.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.560
With saggy, scarred, pale skin, it’s no
wonder smoking makes you look older.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.750
So, don’t start smoking kids.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.790
We can’t do episodes like this without our
sponsors.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.570

So what if you want to quit smoking.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.569
Well, we have a video about the best ways
to do that, here.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.739
Did you ever smoke and noticed, you know,
things weren't so great up here?
