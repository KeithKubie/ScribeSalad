DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.104
I'm Dan Galpin for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.270
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.530
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.320
The sixth international
Conference

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.032
on Learning Representations
is in Canada this week.

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:14.490
It's a conference
focused on how we

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.220
can learn meaningful and
useful representations of data

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.550
for machine learning.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.730
We've got over 130
researchers attending,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.300
but don't worry if
you can't make it.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.549
You can learn more about the
research we're presenting

00:00:24.549 --> 00:00:26.400
with the links on this post.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.620
You can now include variables
in the documentation

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.160
section of your
alerting policies

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.590
for Google Stackdriver.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.210
The contents of
this field are also

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.460
now included in Slack
and Webhook notifications

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.780
in addition to email.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.440
Take a look at the post for a
screenshot and example markup.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.230
To make it easier to connect to
Google Cloud Platform services

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.190
from either a GCP-hosted or
an on-prem Kubernetes cluster,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.130
we are releasing Kubernetes
Service Catalog, a collection

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.100
of services available to
Kubernetes running on GCP

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.780
and the Google Cloud
Platform Service

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.760
Broker, a hosted
service that connects

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.800
to a variety of GCP services.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.280
A screenshot and link to
the docs are on the post.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.220
We recently announced several
cloud database improvements,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.500
including commit timestamps
for Cloud Spanner,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.590
availability of Cloud
Bigtable replication in beta,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.650
and availability of Cloud
Memorystore for Redis in beta.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.080
More details are on the post.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.750
Partner Interconnect provides
high bandwidth connectivity

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.890
to the nearest Google
Cloud Platform region

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.320
through our many partners.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.660
Like Dedicated Interconnect,
Partner Interconnect

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.140
offers private
connectivity to GCP

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.310
to organizations that
don't require the full 10

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.890
gigabits per second of
a dedicated circuit.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.219
It also allows organizations
whose data centers are

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.260
geographically distant
from a Google Cloud region

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.150
or point of presence to connect
to GCP using our partners'

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.870
connections.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.490
You can learn more on the post.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.090
The Associate Cloud Engineer
Certification beta exam

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.800
is now open for registration.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.261
This certification
identifies you

00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:50.010
as someone who has the
foundational skills

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.310
necessary to use Google Cloud
console to deploy applications,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.100
monitor operations, and
manage enterprise solutions.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.010
A link to register
is on the post.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.500
Next week is Google I/O, and
the "Developer Show" team

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.110
will be on site broadcasting
live from the Shoreline

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.980
Amphitheater.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.840
Tune in for the
pre-show performance,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.910
the keynotes, special
guest interviews,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.889
play time in the
sandbox, summaries

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.800
of our favorite sessions,
and so much more.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.890
We'll skip the TL;DR next week,
and be back the week after with

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.570
highlights from I/O.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.220
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.040
I'm Dan Galpin for
"The Developer Show."

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.880
Thanks for watching.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.870
We'll see you at Google I/O.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.121
All right.

00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:32.370
SPEAKER 1: Feeling better now?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.744
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
feeling better.

00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:34.970
SPEAKER 1: OK.
