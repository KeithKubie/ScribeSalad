I'm sorry, um.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.982
- [Chris] What's wrong?

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:52.085
This isn't Fallon is it?

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.953
(audience laughs)

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.288
- No, did ping pong
balls fall on you?

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.356
Is someone singing Karaoke?

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:57.257
No this is.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:00:59.559
It's at midnight.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.894
- Okay, I'm sorry, it's just,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:03.730
like, crazy whirlwind
day and I just thought

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.432
this was Fallon and I was like

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.966 align:start size:84% position:16%
what the hell
happened to the roots?

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.268
(audience laughs)

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:10.403
- I'm not Questlove.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.005
I'm not Quest, I look like him.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.973 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But I'm sure you guys
are probably a great band.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.609
- No they're comedians actually,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.145
that's Jim Gaffigan and
Mike Black and Kyle.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.781
(audience laughs)

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.183 align:start size:84% position:16%
Have you not actually
seen the show?

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.384
Have you seen the program?

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:26.352
- What? What, no
I've seen the show.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.655
- [Chris] Okay, good.

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.123
- I love a midnight.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:30.957
- No.

00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.592
(audience laughs)

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.495 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's an at symbol, at
midnight, it's at midnight.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.263
- Yeah, yeah, yeah and
I love the whole thing

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.833 align:start size:94% position:6%
you do, every night, that
thing with the thing.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.034
- Yeah, yeah, I know,

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:42.268
you mean the hashtag war.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.871
- Yes, the hash bag
ward, I love it.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.272 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Good
- It's so good I never miss it

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.874
- Then great, since
you're here then,

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.443 align:start size:94% position:6%
would you please introduce
the hash bag ward?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.112
- Actually, you know what,

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:55.014
I've got a thing that
I gotta run to so,

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.816
sorry, I gotta.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.251
- Okay, wait

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.552
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.753
- Before you go, is
there something that

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.688
you wanted to at least promote

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.289
since you took the time to.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.592 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No
(audience laughs)

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was literally just walking
by and I thought this,

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:10.196
anyway, it's great
seeing you buddy.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:13.399
- Do you actually
even know my name?

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.401
- Yes, I know your name.

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:19.672
I know your name, I know
that you're who you are.

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:22.242
- [Chris] Uh huh, which is?

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.743
- Not Jimmy Fallon.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.712
- Not Jimmy, so that would
mean that logically I'm.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.213
- Yes, you're Seth.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Seth Myers, yeah,
I'm Seth Myers.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.818
(audience laughs)

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.154
- Let me tell you something man.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start size:97% position:3%
Honestly, I have not
watched SNL since you left.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:39.792
- Oh I appreciate
that, thank you.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.161
Ben Stiller everyone.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.164
