00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.590
On September 13, 1848, Gage was helping excavate
rocks to make way for a railroad track on

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.269
the Rutland and Burlington Railroad near Cavendish
in Vermont.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.740
Just prior to the accident, Gage was preparing
for an explosion by compacting a bore with

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
explosive powder using a tamping iron.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.860
A spark created from the tamping iron ignited
the powder, driving the iron straight through

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.180
Gage’s skull.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.440
It entered under the left cheek bone and exited
completely through the top of the head, and

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.080
was later recovered some 30 yards away, smeared
with blood and brain matter.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.190
To have an idea of extent of damage this iron
would have caused, you need to realize its

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.190
size.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.230
The tamping iron was 3 ft 8 in.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.149
(1.11 m) in length and 1.25 inches (3.18 cm)
in diameter at one end and tapered over a

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:03.829
distance of about 1 ft., to 0.25 inches (0.6
cm) in diameter, weighing approximately 13

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.290
pounds (6 kg).

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.929
After the rod passed through his head, it
is not known whether or not Gage ever lost

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:13.649
consciousness, but within minutes of his injury,
at the astonishment of the men on his crew,

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.549
he was walking and talking and he sat upright
in an oxcart for the 3/4 mile ride to his

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.360
house where he was attended to by Dr. Edward
H. Williams, who describes the situation when

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.360
he first saw Gage:

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.899
When I drove up he said, ‘Doctor, here is
business enough for you.’

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.670
I first noticed the wound upon the head before
I alighted from my carriage, the pulsations

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.539
of the brain being very distinct.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.340
The top of the head appeared somewhat like
an inverted funnel … as if some wedge-shaped

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.649
body had passed from below upward.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.869
Mr. Gage, during the time I was examining
this wound, was relating the manner in which

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.630
he was injured to the bystanders.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.939
I did not believe Mr. Gage’s statement at
that time, but thought he was deceived.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.509
Mr. Gage persisted in saying that the bar
went through his head …. Mr. G. got up and

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.679
vomited; the effort of vomiting pressed out
about half a teacupful of the brain, which

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.509
fell upon the floor.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.289
By evening, Dr. John Martyn Harlow had taken
over the case and it was his notes of observations

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.890
about Phineas’ injury, subsequent recovery
and personality changes that provided evidence

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.400
that the frontal cortex is involved in one’s
personality.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.290
The initial treatment of Phineas’ physical
injuries included cleaning the wound by removing

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.319
small fragments of bone and replacing some
of the larger fragments that were still attached

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.319
but displaced.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.650
The large wound at the top of his head was
closed with adhesive straps and covered with

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.959
a wet compress, to allow the wound to drain
into the dressings.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.319
Within days, his exposed brain became infected
and he fell into a semi-comatose state.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.189
To his family’s relief and surprise, he
recovered.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.230
Not long after that, Dr. Harlow had to release
8 fluid ounces of pus from an abscess under

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.430
George’s scalp.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.769
Despite all this, only three and a half months
after the accident, Phineas Gage was leading

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.599
a seemingly normal life, contrary to many
outlandish accounts that soon popped up, most

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.629
of which have been dismissed as myth, due
to complete lack of evidence.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.189
However, those closest to him did notice slight
changes in his personality and behavior.

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.110
In 1868, in a report published in the Bulletin
of the Massachusetts Medical Society , Dr.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.110
Harlow wrote,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.351
His contractors, who regarded him as the most
efficient and capable foreman in their employ

00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:17.980
previous to his injury, considered the change
in his mind so marked that they could not

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.159
give him his place again.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.310
He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times
in the grossest profanity (which was not previously

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.909
his custom), manifesting but little deference
for his fellows, impatient of restraint of

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.830
advice when it conflicts with his desires,
at times pertinaciously obstinent, yet capricious

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.599
and vacillating, devising many plans of future
operation, which are no sooner arranged than

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.499
they are abandoned in turn for others appearing
more feasible.

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:47.150
In this regard, his mind was radically changed,
so decidedly that his friends and acquaintances

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.670
said he was ‘no longer Gage’.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.500
Not the same man he used to be and denied
employment by the railroad company who used

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.920
to see him as an efficient and capable foreman,
he worked for a short time at a livery stable

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.209
in New Hampshire, among other odd jobs.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.209
He then spent seven years as a stagecoach
driver in Chile until his health began to

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.569
deteriorate.

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.290
Evidence uncovered very recently, in 2008,
seems to indicate that before his demise while

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.639
working in Chile, Gage had recovered most,
if not all, of his former social skills and

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.620
was otherwise a pretty normal guy at this
point.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.980
Once his health declined, he moved to San
Francisco with his mother where, after suffering

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.290
a series of epileptic seizures he died on
May 20, 1860 at the age of 36 – almost 12

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.850
years after his accident.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.380
It wasn’t until 1866 that Dr. Harlow, who
had thought he would never hear from Phineas

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.590
again, learned of his death.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.680
At his request to the family, Phineas’ skull
was removed from his grave and sent, along

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.680
with the tamping iron that had pierced Phineas’
skull, to Dr. Harlow in Massachusetts.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.820
Today, both can be seen at the Harvard University
School of Medicine in the Warren Anatomical

00:04:48.820 --> 00:05:07.500
Museum.
