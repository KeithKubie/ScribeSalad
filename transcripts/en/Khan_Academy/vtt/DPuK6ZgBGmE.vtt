00:00:00.445 --> 00:00:03.009
- This bar graph here tells us

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.487
bubbles blown by each gum-chewer.

00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:07.021
We have four different gum-chewers,

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:09.946
and they tell us how many
bubbles each of them blew.

00:00:09.946 --> 00:00:12.779
What I wanna do is, I
wanna figure out first

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.552
the mean of the number of bubbles blown,

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:18.892
and then also figure out
how dispersed is the data,

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:21.330
how much do these vary from the mean.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.361
I'm gonna do that by calculating

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:26.205
the mean absolute deviation.

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:27.830
Pause this video now.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.803
Try to calculate the mean of
the number of bubbles blown.

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:32.144
And then, after you do that, see if you

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:36.358
can calculate the mean absolute deviation.

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:39.358
Step one, let's figure out the mean.

00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:42.326
The mean is just going to be the sum

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:44.442
of the number of bubbles blown

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:45.991
divided by the number of datapoints.

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.717
Manueala blew four bubbles.

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:50.631
She blew four bubbles.

00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:52.714
Sophia blew five bubbles.

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:56.612
Jada blew six bubbles.

00:00:58.435 --> 00:01:00.185
Tara blew one bubble.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:04.442
We have one, two, three, four datapoints.

00:01:04.442 --> 00:01:06.598
So let's divided by four.

00:01:06.598 --> 00:01:10.661
And so, this is going to be
equal to four plus five is nine,

00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:13.457
plus six is 15, plus one is 16.

00:01:13.457 --> 00:01:16.258
So it's equal to 16 over four,

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:19.630
which is 16 divided by
four is equal to four.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.029
The mean number of bubbles blown is four.

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:25.225
Lemme actually do this with
a bold line right over here.

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.642
This is the mean number of bubbles blown.

00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:32.616
Now what I wanna do is I wanna figure out

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.949
the mean absolute deviation.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.823
Mean.

00:01:37.684 --> 00:01:40.101
MAD: Mean Absolute Deviation.

00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:45.199
What we wanna do is we wanna
take the mean of how much

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:48.363
do each of these datapoints
deviate from the mean.

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:51.656
I know I just used the word
mean twice in a sentence,

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:52.951
so it might be a little confusing,

00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:54.129
but as we work through it, hopefully,

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.879
it'll make a little bit of sense.

00:01:58.406 --> 00:02:01.740
How much does Manueala's, the
number of bubbles she blew,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.476
how much does that deviate from the mean?

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:07.464
Well, Manueala actually blew four bubbles,

00:02:07.464 --> 00:02:09.252
and four is the mean.

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:10.633
So her deviation,

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.370
her absolute deviation
from the mean is zero.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.203
Is zero.

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:18.988
Actually, lemme just write this over here.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.488
Absolute deviation, that's AD,

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.118
absolute deviation from the mean.

00:02:25.118 --> 00:02:28.087
Manueala didn't deviate
at all from the mean.

00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:30.120
Now let's think about Sophia.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.203
Sophia deviates by one from the mean.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.941
We see that right there, she's one above.

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:39.176
Now, we would say one whether
it's one above or below,

00:02:39.176 --> 00:02:41.458
'cause we're saying absolute deviation.

00:02:41.458 --> 00:02:43.816
Sophia deviates by one.

00:02:43.816 --> 00:02:47.111
Her absolute deviation is one.

00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:49.028
And then, we have Jada.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.555
How much does she deviate from the mean?

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:53.489
We see it right over here.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.885
She deviates by two.

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.920
She is two more than the mean.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.562
And then, how much does
Tara deviate from the mean?

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:04.829
She is at one, so that
is three below the mean.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.803
That is three below the mean.

00:03:07.803 --> 00:03:10.851
Once again, this is two, this is three.

00:03:10.851 --> 00:03:12.096
She deviates.

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:14.375
Her absolute deviation is three.

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:16.647
And then we wanna take the
mean of the absolute deviation.

00:03:16.647 --> 00:03:20.425
That's the M in MAD, in
Mean Absolute Deviation.

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:22.419
This is Manueala's absolute deviation,

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.937
Sophia's absolute deviation,
Jada's absolute deviation,

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.401
Tara's absolute deviation.

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:27.864
We want the mean of those,

00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:29.894
so we divide by the number of datapoints,

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:33.267
and we get zero plus one,
plus two, plus three,

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:34.970
is six over four.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.896
Six over four, which is
the same thing as 1 1/2.

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:40.770
Or, lemme just write it
in all the different ways.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.937
We could write it as three
halves, or 1 1/2, or 1.5.

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:48.943
Which gives us a measure of how much

00:03:48.943 --> 00:03:53.344
do these datapoints vary
from the mean of four.

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:54.525
I know what some of you are thinking.

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:55.988
"Wait, I thought there was a formula

00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:57.943
"associated with the
mean absolute deviation.

00:03:57.943 --> 00:03:59.205
"It seems really complex.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:01.034
"It has all of these absolute-value signs

00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:02.212
"and whatever else."

00:04:02.212 --> 00:04:04.018
That's all we did.

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:05.824
When we write all those
absolute-value signs,

00:04:05.824 --> 00:04:08.260
that's just a fancy way of
looking at each datapoint,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.430
and thinking about how much
does it deviate from the mean,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.815
whether it's above or below.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:14.277
That's what the absolute value does.

00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:17.616
It doesn't matter, if it's
three below, we just say three.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.117
If it's two above, we just say two.

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.635
We don't put a positive or negative on.

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:23.326
Just so you're comfortable seeing how this

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:26.050
is the exact same thing you
would've done with the formula,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.425
let's do it that way, as well.

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:32.697
So the mean absolute deviation
is going to be equal to.

00:04:32.697 --> 00:04:35.152
Well, we'll start with Manueala.

00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:36.776
How many bubbles did she blow?

00:04:36.776 --> 00:04:38.159
She blew four.

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.329
From that you subtract the mean of four,

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.768
take the absolute value.

00:04:42.768 --> 00:04:44.522
That's her absolute deviation.

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:48.344
Of course, this does evaluate
to this zero, to zero here.

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:49.772
Then you take the absolute value.

00:04:49.772 --> 00:04:53.689
Sophia blew five bubbles,
and the mean is four.

00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.099
Then you do that for Jada.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.556
Jada blew six bubbles; the mean is four.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.630
And then you do it for Tara.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.213
Tara blew one bubble,
and the mean is four.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:09.396
Then you divide it by the
number of datapoints you have.

00:05:09.396 --> 00:05:11.103
Lemme make it very clear.

00:05:11.103 --> 00:05:14.354
This right over here,
this four, is the mean.

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:15.532
This four is the mean.

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.359
You're taking each of the datapoints,

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:19.101
and you're seeing how far
it is away from the mean.

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:20.421
You're taking the absolute
value 'cause you just

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.039
wanna figure out the absolute distance.

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.152
Now you see, or maybe you see.

00:05:25.152 --> 00:05:28.011
Four minus four, this is.

00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:28.844
Different color.

00:05:28.844 --> 00:05:30.548
Four minus four, that is a zero.

00:05:30.548 --> 00:05:33.231
That is that zero right over there.

00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:36.522
Five minus four, absolute value of that?

00:05:36.522 --> 00:05:37.882
That's going to be.

00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:39.908
Lemme do this in a new color.

00:05:39.908 --> 00:05:41.701
This is just going to be one.

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.814
This thing is the same
thing as that over there.

00:05:43.814 --> 00:05:46.814
We were able to see
that just by inspecting

00:05:46.814 --> 00:05:48.833
this graph, or this chart.

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:51.926
And then, six minus four,
absolute value of that,

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:53.719
that's just going to be two.

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.711
That two is that two right over here,

00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:58.477
which is the same thing as
this two right over there.

00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:02.011
And then, finally, our one
minus four, this negative three,

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:04.687
but the absolute value of
that is just positive three,

00:06:04.687 --> 00:06:07.165
which is this positive
three right over there,

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:10.280
which is this distance right over here.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.846
You divide it by four, you get 1.5 again.

00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:18.200
Hopefully you found this mean
absolute deviation example

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.200
as interesting as I did.
