00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.900
&gt;&gt; My name is Lulu Garcia-Navarro.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.180 position:56%
I'm a host at National Public Radio.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.350
It is my pleasure to be here today.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.000
And I have a few words from
the National Book Festival

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720
that I have been asked to read.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.020
All day here at the Library

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050
of Congress National Book
Festival we are recognizing

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.910
and celebrating the importance
of reading, authors, and books.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.000
The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.600
but in truth the National Book
Festival is a huge undertaking.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.160
And I feel very comfortable
doing this because I am from NPR.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.960
We're now going to ask
you for some money.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.040
[ Laughter ]

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.920
This room has been made
possible by the generous support

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.620
of our sponsors, the
James Madison Council.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.660
So please consider making
a contribution right now

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.290
on your cell phone.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.680
You can send a text to make a
one-time gift that will be added

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.350
to your mobile phone bill.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.650
We should think about that at NPR.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.330
In fact, note to self.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.300
The details are on the screen
and on the back of your program.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.600
Please contribute.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.380
Obviously, books and these kinds of
events are expensive undertakings,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.640
so thank you for considering
making a donation right now.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.250
And on with our program, it is
my absolute pleasure and honor

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.090
to introduce you today to an
author who has done I think so much

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.280
for our understanding
of medicine and science

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.580
and all that goes into it.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.670 position:56%
He wrote the book the Emperor of all
Maladies, which was considered one

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.980
of the most notable
books when it came

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.820
out by the New York
Times, and so many others.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920
He is a cancer doctor, practicing.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.150
He is also a scientist and
researcher at Columbia University,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.010
and he's now written the book
The Gene: An Intimate History,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.980
which is an astonishing work.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.760
I can attest, having
just finished it.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.400
So I would like you to give
a very warm welcome right now

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.420
to Doctor Siddhartha Mukherjee.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.160
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.500
&gt;&gt; I'd like to start by saying --
and I did say this to him before --

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.510
that I am neither a
scientist nor a doctor.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.290 position:56%
I don't come with any particular
knowledge of the medical profession.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.850
I am actually a storyteller.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.860
And what was astonishing to me
about this book is the stories

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.540 position:56%
about the people who have made these
incredible discoveries and continue

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.270
to make these incredible
discoveries.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.390
But I wanted to start with you

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.600
and why you chose to
write this book now.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.700
You started with a book
about sort of illness,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.260
and this is about the
very essence of life.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:52.860
&gt;&gt; So the genesis of this
book is a little complicated.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.650
Really, the three things that
came together in this book --

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.670
when I finished Emperor of all
Maladies, I thought I was done.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.110
There's the English
who can specialize

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.720
in snippy comments, the reviewers.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.040
There was a review of
Emperor of all Maladies --

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.510
and that book won the
Guardian First Book prize.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.510
And one of the reviewers wrote
it should have been awarded the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.030
Guardian Only Book prize.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.040
[ Laughter ]

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.650
Because that was my book
and I was done with it.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.400
But then three things happened, and
those three things are relevant.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.070
Number one is that --
the question of cancer,

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.750
which is what I was
studying the laboratory --

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.760
the question of cancer demands
the question of normalcy.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.230
Of cancer is the altered
self, what is the self?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.820
How do we become ourselves, how do
we develop normalcy anatomically,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.370
physiologically, and where do the
boundaries of the definition lie?

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.120
We'll come to how astonishingly
contemporary this question has

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.930
become as of the last few weeks.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.450
But nonetheless.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.750
So there was that question.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.880
So it was inspired by the work that
I'd done for my book on cancer.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.730
In fact, when Ken Burns did
the Emperor of all Maladies,

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.900
the question that we
kept coming back to --

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.740
in the editing room while we were
conversing and trying to make

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.850
that film -- was, you
know, what is normalcy?

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.470
How do our bodies know to
become what they become?

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.410
So this question is
in my mind a lot.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.120
The second strand was something
was going on in the world

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.270
of science and technology.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.340
That is that we had begun to
read and write human genes,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.360
human genetics, in a way
that was truly unprecedented.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.060 position:56%
And by read, I mean the deciphering
of the human genome, the reading it,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.500
attributing meaning to it, and of
course technologies such as CRISPR,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.490
which began to allow us to
make directive interventions

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.310
into the human genome, change
our genomes sort of will.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.610
&gt;&gt; This is the gene
editing technology.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.910
&gt;&gt; This is the gene
editing technology.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.210
We'll talk about all of that.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.330
&gt;&gt; But these techniques, since
this book has come has come out,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.210
of course, have been very
widely now dispersed.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.910
But from the vantage
point of science sitting

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.800
in the laboratory you could
already sense bubblings of this.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.750
CRISPR was in our news
long before it was

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.470
of course in very public news.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.600
In The Gene, I made the prediction
that we would see the birth

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.870
of genetically altered human
embryos ten years from this book.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.030
In fact, it was less than
ten months from this book

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.600
that it actually occurred.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.560
So there was that.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.230
So in other words, there was a
kind of gas chamber, gas pressure,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:09.030
of technology that was pushing like
a piston against our understanding

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.110
of who we were; what are
we, what are we like,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.460
what happens when we change it?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.730
So it was that second arena,
second set of concerns.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.720
But the third, probably
the most important,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.210
was my father was dying while
I was writing this book.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.560
And I was having conversations with
him about our own family history

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.700
of mental illness, of schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder in particular.

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.220
And those conversations went
from very abstract conversations.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.280
You know, there was the story
of my brother and my nephew --

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.710
my cousin, his brother, his nephew.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.900
But then those became
very personal questions.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.860
Would I want to scan my own genes

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.650
to unveil potential
risks for mental illness?

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.950
What would that mean?

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.960
How would that change
the way I imagine,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:12.090 position:56%
how would it change the way -- let's
say, you had some illness, some --

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.330
with a small genetic component,
may be a large genetic component --

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.910 position:56%
tracking through your family and all
of a sudden the capacity to decipher

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.000
that prospectively became
available, would you do it?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.740
What would that mean
for us broadly speaking?

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.840
So these three strands, just to
remind ourselves again, number one,

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.960
a kind of leftover question
from the Emperor of all Maladies

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.520
about cancer; number two, the
bubblings of completely new science

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:48.710
and technological breakthroughs
that allowed us to intervene

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:58.670 position:56%
and understand our genes in a way
that we hadn't before; number three,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.580
a very personal history
of mental illness sort

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.050
of came together in this book.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.380
That's how this book was born.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.820
&gt;&gt; I want to get to the
last two specifically

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.320
of what you just mentioned.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.620
But first, one of the things that's
really wonderful about this book is

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.290
that you delve into the history.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.980
And I think that it is so important
to understand where we are now

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.860
to look back at what
has happened before.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.070
And in particular, as we were just
talking before we got to the stage,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.620
we were talking about the
history of eugenics in America.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.750
And there're so many
cautionary tales here.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:43.320
Let's talk a little bit about what
eugenics was and that history.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.300
&gt;&gt; So the history comes in
in three or four phases.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.120
And it's important to
recognize these phases

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.120
because each one is a
step toward something.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.420
The idea of eugenics, of
course, is an ancient idea.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.100
Plato writes about it.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.180
The idea that you can somehow make
better human beings by intervening

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.080
on heredity, through marriage

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.850
or through whatever other
means, is an ancient idea.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.860
It's a kind of -- it's an idea
that comes up over and over again.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.870
But the word really is
coined by Francis Galton.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:30.280
He was, as many of you know, a
cousin of Darwin's, a philosopher,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.080
a scientist, a mathematician,
a statistician.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:39.210
And when Galton thought about the
idea, it was quite widely embraced

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:44.200
by the intellectual
elite of Britain.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.050
This was thought to
be a progressive idea.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.350
This was thought to be -- you know,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.720
somehow if you did better
breeding you would get improvements

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.050
in human race.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.360
And it was projected as a
way to make us better faster,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:05.730
grasping the horns of selection and
thereby improving the human race.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.660
It was considered -- and many,
many progressives in Britain signed

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.230
onto it, and there were big
conferences held in fancy locations

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.450
like this one in, you know,
where the idea was strutted

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.060
out very proudly as a mechanism --

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:22.360
&gt;&gt; By famous authors.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.660
&gt;&gt; By famous -- exactly.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.960
&gt;&gt; You know, people [inaudible].

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.260
&gt;&gt; And there's a whole list
of people, doctors, authors --

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.880
&gt;&gt; H. G. Wells and all
sorts of other people.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, H. G. Wells.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.480
He was just one of --

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.780
&gt;&gt; Many.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.080
&gt;&gt; -- many.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.380
There we're dissenting voices, too.

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.800 position:56%
We'll come back to that in a second.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.680
Chesterton very famously
had a dissenting voice.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.980
But nonetheless.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.560
That's the first phase,
positive selection,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.210
positive breeding is eugenics.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.180
Then it moves to the United States.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.740
It's interesting that
the United States phase

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.800
of eugenics is often neglected.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.420
&gt;&gt; This is a surprise to me.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The adolescence of
eugenics occurs right here.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:09.550
It moves to society who are
very obsessed with a kind

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.630
of technological and, you know,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:18.040
a kind of reengineering
of social structures.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.350
And so it's in the United
States before Nazi Germany,

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.600
it's in the United States that
provides a kind of fertile soil

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.200
for the second phase of eugenics.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.590
And here, the emphasis moves from
just breeding to sterilization.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.200
And it is here that the idea of
sterilizing those that are people

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.390
that are considered
eugenically unfit is really born

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.470
and brought into the legal system.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.180
&gt;&gt; So it changes from trying to
make a better human to getting rid

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.500
of humans that are not good --

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.800
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.100
&gt;&gt; -- in that perception.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.850
&gt;&gt; Getting rid of humans
through sterilization.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.150
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:03.350
&gt;&gt; So the human beings that are
being eliminated in this second,

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:11.720 position:56%
obviously more compromised, phase of
eugenics is through sterilization.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:17.780
And the Nazis pick up this idea
as genetics itself moves on,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.820
and they then convert
this into extermination.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.350
So it moves from positive reading
to sterilization, to extermination.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.150
Exterminate the people
who are unfit.

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:35.470 position:56%
But it's impossible to -- it is
very convenient of the United States

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.650
to ignore this second phase, but
it's impossible to ignore it.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.780
Not far from here, there were
institutions, state institutions,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.410
sponsored by the state,
paid for by the state,

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.360
where the sterilized
were being sterilized,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.180
where the unfit were
being sterilized.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:59.540
The book is dedicated to Carrie
Buck as a reminder of that moment.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.690
&gt;&gt; Remind us briefly
who Carrie Buck was.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.380
&gt;&gt; Carrie Buck was one
of the first victims

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.110
of this sterilization effort.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:14.850
She was a woman who was
deemed to be mentally unfit.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:18.890
She was deemed to be imbecile.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.200
Based on what we know about
the historical record,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.190
it's very unlikely that
she was any of this.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:29.860
Nonetheless, she was brought
to the Virginia State Colony.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.570
And at first she was confined
as a mechanism of preventing her

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:40.230
from having any children,
and later the superintendent

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.530
of the colony applied to the
courts, first to the colony board

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:48.880
and then subsequently the case
climbed to the courts to ask

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:53.780
that she be involuntarily
sterilized, her ovaries removed,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.200
so that she would not have
any more imbecile children.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.890
This case climbed all the
way to the higher courts

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.860
and ultimately resulted in
the chilling observation made

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.990 position:56%
by Oliver Wendell Holmes that three
generations of imbeciles was enough.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:18.060
And with that judgment, Carrie
Buck was involuntarily sterilized

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.940
in Virginia, becoming one of
the first women to be sterilized

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:29.020
under the umbrella of eugenics.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.910
&gt;&gt; What is important about
the story in the context

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.300
of the book, taking us to today?

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:39.630
What is it that we need
to learn from that?

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.050
&gt;&gt; Well, the strange
back story about this --

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.100
and we were just talking
about it in the back --

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.340
I had expected this book
to be scientifically

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.310
and personally contemporary.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.590
I thought that I would
write about questions like,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:03.370 position:56%
what if you we're presented with the
prospect of sequencing your genome

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.620
and determining the
genetic propensities

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.160
of your child, would you do it?

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.020
What if there was mental illness?

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:15.890
What I had not expected was
how politically clamorous --

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:22.560
how this book would intersect with
the political climate of our times.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.230
It was just totally unexpected.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.650 position:56%
You know, the question of
supremacy, what does supremacy mean?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.180
A question of race.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.880 position:56%
How much do we know about race based

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:40.960
on what we know from
genes and science?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:48.200 position:56%
The confusion and clamor created
around questions of what is inherent

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.920
and what's not, what is intrinsic

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.830
and what's not intrinsic,
the IQ words.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:57.170
You know, as I said, the book
was called an intimate history.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:03.100 position:56%
I didn't call it the Genome
Political History, which may have --

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.190
[Laughter]

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.530
&gt;&gt; Possibly you should have.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.450
&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:13.610
But I just had not expected the
way that this would intersect --

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.680
the book would intersect
with very clamorous

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.290 position:56%
and I would say rather important
debates about what's going on today.

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.330
&gt;&gt; You wanted to -- I'd like you
at this point to read a section

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.220
of your book that I
think speaks to this.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:33.930
&gt;&gt; Actually, a funny story is I
suppose now I could sadly pick

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.800
up any section of the book and --

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.410
&gt;&gt; And make it relevant.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.710
&gt;&gt; -- and make it relevant.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.010
&gt;&gt; Sign of a good book.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.950
&gt;&gt; I thought I'd read
the section on race.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.730
So somewhere here.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.030
Let's start somewhere here.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:59.460
And this is about human migration.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.650
"From here, they went west and
north, as young men often do,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.910
and then traveled through the
gash of the rift valley or ducked

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:14.380
into the canopies of the rain
forest around the Congo basin

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.570
where the Bantu and
the Mbuti now live.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:21.390
The story is not geographically
contained or as neat as it sounds.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.860
Some populations of early
modern humans are known

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:27.180
to have wondered back
into the Sahara,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.750
a lush landscape then crisscrossed
with [inaudible] lakes and rivers,

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:34.680
and then heading back into local
pools of humanoids, coexisted

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.630
and even interbred with them
perhaps generating evolutionary

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.750
back crosses.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.940
As Christopher Stringer,
the Paleoanthropologist,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.950
described it in terms
of modern humans,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.530 position:56%
this meant that some modern humans
have more archaic genes than others.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.740 position:56%
That does seem to be so, leaving us
to ask, again, what is modern human?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.550
But the long march went on.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.690 position:56%
Some 75,000 years ago, a group of
humans arrived at the northeast edge

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:04.040
of Ethiopia or Egypt where the Red
Sea narrows into a slit-like strait

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.010
between the shrugged
shoulder of Africa

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:09.430
and the downward elbow
of the Yemeni Peninsula.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.440
There was no one to part the ocean.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.060
We don't know what drove the men
and women to fling themselves

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.120
across the water or how
they managed to cross it.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.890
The sea was perhaps shallower then,

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:21.910
and some geologists have
wondered whether the chains

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.690
of sandbar islands
span the straight along

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.580
which our ancestors hopscotched
their way to Asia and Europe."

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.980
This goes on for a while.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.770
But then it comes to a question
which gets to the meat of things.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:38.300
"What does this tell us
about race and jeans?

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.600
A great deal.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.190
First, it reminds us that
the racial categorization

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.890
of humans is an inherently
limited proposition.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.930
While it's there, the political
scientists like to quip

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.640
that academic disputes
are often the most vicious

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.010
because the stakes are
so overwhelmingly low.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.400
[ Laughter ]

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.770
By similar logic, perhaps our
increasingly shrewd debates

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.490
on race should begin with the
recognition that the actual range

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:05.170
of human genomic variation
is strikingly low,

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.040
lower than in many
other species, lower,

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.400
for instance, than in chimpanzees.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.030
Given our rather brief
tenure on earth as a species,

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.270
we're much more alike
than unlike each other.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:22.760
It is an inevitable consequence
of the bloom of our youth

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.910
that we haven't even had time
to taste the poisoned apple.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.250
Yet even a young species
possesses history.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.710
One of the most penetrating
powers of genetics is its ability

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:39.200 position:56%
to organize even closely related
genomes into classes and subclasses.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.990
If we go hunting for discriminatory
fake features and clusters,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.470
then we will indeed find features
and clusters to discriminate.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:51.570
Examined carefully, the variations
in the human genome will cluster,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.850
importantly, along geographic
regions and continents

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.710
and along traditional boundaries.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.600
Every genome bears the
mark of its ancestries.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.660
By studying the genetic
characteristics of an individual,

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.080 position:56%
you can pinpoint his or her origin
to a certain continent, nationality,

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:12.440
state, or even tribe with
relatively remarkable accuracy.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.170
It is to be sure an
[inaudible] of small differences.

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.890 position:56%
But if this is what we mean by race,

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.970
then the concept has not
survived the genomic era,

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.340
it has been amplified by it.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.620
But the central problem with racial
discrimination is not the inference

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.240
of a person's race from the
genetic characteristics --

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.350
this is the most important point
that's raised in this chapter --

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.180
it is quite the opposite;
it is the inference

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.870
of a person's characteristics
from their race.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:42.100
This is a central confusion
that runs through some

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.130
of these sort of clamorous debates.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.930
The question is not, can you,
given an individual's skin color,

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.520
hair texture, or language,
infer something

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.130
about their ancestry or origin?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:57.040 position:56%
That is a question of biological
systematics of lineage, of taxonomy,

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.520
of racial geography, of
biological discrimination.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.820
Of course you can.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:06.130
In the genome has vastly
refined that inference.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.340
You can scan any individual genome
and infer rather deep insights

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.610
about a person's ancestry
or place of origin.

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.670
But the vastly more controversial
question is precisely the converse.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:21.210
Given a racial identity,
African or Asian, say," --

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.810
those are in quotes --
"can you infer anything

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.310
about an individual's
characteristic?

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.170
Not just the skin or hair
color but complex features

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.650
such as intelligence, habits,
personality and aptitude?

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.430
In other words, genes can
tell us about racial origin,

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.230
but can race tell us
anything about genes?

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.530
To answer that question, we need

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.490
to measure how genetic
variation are distributed

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.980
across racial categories.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.850
Is there more diversity
within races or between races?

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.140
Is knowing that someone is of
African versus European descent,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.510
say, allow us to allow us
to define or understanding

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.160
of their genetic traits or
their personal, physical,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.970
or intellectual attributes
in a meaningful manner?

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.620
We know precise and quantitative
answers to these questions.

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:05.870
A number of studies have
tried to quantify the level

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.090
of genetic diversity
of the human genome.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.370
The most recent estimates
suggest that the vast proportion

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:14.130
of genetic diversity,
up to 85 to 90%,

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.150
occurs within so-called races --

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:19.980
that is, within Asians
or Africans --

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:24.920
and only about a minor proportion,
about 7%, between racial groups."

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.330
&gt;&gt; So these are the
questions still of our day,

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.920
which is what so striking.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:40.280
So when you read that, what is
the conclusion that you draw?

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.400
&gt;&gt; Well, the conclusion
that we draw is

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:48.010
that genomics should
have stuffed the genie

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.880
of racial discrimination
back into its model.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.720
The fact that it hasn't
is really a commentary

00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:01.120
about our society's new desire
to discriminate and a new desire

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.650
to categorize along
racial boundaries.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.120
These are Victorian ideas

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:15.830
that we inherited sub classifying
human beings into these categories.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.580
Genomics has belied this
Victorian idea that the difference

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:26.670 position:56%
between a man from Namibia and a man
from Ethiopia is greater genetically

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:32.060
than the difference between a man
from Ethiopia and a man from Yemen.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.240
We know this because of
the nature of migration.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.710
And yet, Victorian classifications
would put the first two

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.060
in the same category and the man
from Yemen in a different category.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.510
That's just false.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:45.230
It makes no sense.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.170
The fact that we hang onto these
ideas, the fact that we keep

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.560
with these categories, is
a reminder not of genetics

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.920
but of a certain biological, or a
certain desire whether biological

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.750
or not, cultural or
biological or not,

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.100
a desire to categorize people along
boundaries, which we sadly inherit

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.340
from time before science.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.090
&gt;&gt; What is striking to me
while reading this book and --

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:15.030
is that these recur but science
is often used by scientists

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.860
to make these distinctions.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:23.820 position:56%
There are people who use the science
to further these erroneous ideas.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.120
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.030
I mean, one of the purposes
of this book and the Emperor

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.590
of all Maladies is to remind
us that this, you know,

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.660
silence is not a hallowed activity.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:39.450
Human beings within the science as
within medicine are just as guilty

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:45.900
of the same desires to
categorize, to discriminate.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:51.280
But it's also a reminder
that there are truths.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.510
Science is not fake news.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:25:01.870
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.530
&gt;&gt; It bears reminding.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:12.170
&gt;&gt; And the confusion
caused in the clamor

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:19.530
of our times is a smokescreen
thrown up onto that idea.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:26.310
But if you look deeply, if you're
able to lift the smoke screen,

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.240
the truth is self-evident.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.900
I believe in truths.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.100
&gt;&gt; I'm going to actually
follow you down this road,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.260
because I'm interested in it.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.770 position:56%
What is the role of a book like this
and your coming out and speaking

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:47.510
in a moment when science
is questioned all the time?

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:53.230
[ Laughter ]

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:58.330
I'm going to put you on the spot
there because I'm a journalist.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.100
&gt;&gt; Well, look, as I
said to you before,

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.960
when I started writing this book,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.290
it was very self-consciously
calling into history.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.240
I wanted this book to be about
my family, an explanation,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.270
I wanted to try to understand what
it feels like to be in this moment

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.540
in time, what it feels
like when you can --

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.300
you know, if you think about your
genome as a massive encyclopedia --

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.420
actually that encyclopedia
with one genome written

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.350
in ACTG would cover
every wall of this room.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.850
One human being's genome,
3 billion letters.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.570
We are now learning to read

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.580
or ascribe meaning
to that encyclopedia.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.940
But it what was more
astonishing to me is

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.360
that we had invented technologies
that would allow you to go to,

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.840
you know, volume 16, page
347, erase the word CG

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.150
and make the word AG instead.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.890
That's the kind of --
I'm leaving the rest

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:53.410
of the encyclopedia untouched.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.500
I wanted to talk about
all of this and talk

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.710
about the ethical implications
of all of this.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:06.500 position:56%
But as I said to you, I had not
expected the political intersections

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:07.800
that occurred.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.520
I just hope people read the book.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.040
You know, what else can I say?

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.060
[ Laughter ]

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.530
We're going to take some questions
shortly, but I just want to ask you

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.630
about CRISPR because being the
deep investigative journalist

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:23.010
that I am, I did a Google search --

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.850
[ Laughter ]

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.150
-- before I came here.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:30.590
And I did it actually looking for
headlines, not because I wanted

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:34.940
to all the sudden give you
a dissertation on CRISPR.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.060
But briefly, it's gene editing
technology, it's been in the news.

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:39.830
And I did a Google search.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:42.960
These are the two headlines
that I came across.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.260
Could Gene Editing Tools

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.120
Such as CRISPR be Used
as a Biological Weapon?

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.630
Question mark, all in caps.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.010
And then the other one was,
Two-Thirds of Americans Approve

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.630
of Editing Human DNA
to Treat Disease.

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:55.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.430
&gt;&gt; These seem to be at odds with
each other, these two headlines.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:04.400 position:56%
And to me it spoke to the very real
concerns of the moment and the hopes

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.360
that people have about what
this technology can do for us.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.190
&gt;&gt; So the answer is
both of those are true.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:16.680
So could CRISPR technologies be
used to create biological weapons?

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:23.360
Sure. At any time you manipulate
the genomes of organisms,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.650
you can manipulate the genomes
of organisms and make them loaded

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.210
with toxins or capable of
introducing new disease

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.090
into human populations, so
the answer's absolutely.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:40.180
Just to remind us, CRISPR
belongs to a suite of technologies

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.760 position:56%
that allow us to intervene on the
genomes of organisms, and absolutely

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.490
when you intervene on the genomes
of organisms you have the capacity

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:51.350
to change the organism and make
it more pathogenic and, sure,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.090
you can make a biological
weapon out of it.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.390
The second question, also
important, we don't --

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.200
this is why we need to
have this conversation now.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:06.760
As I told you before, you if you'll
imagine an individual's genome,

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:12.460
3 billion letters of it, as an
encyclopedia lining every wall

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.230
of this auditorium, these
technologies now allow us to,

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:22.160
as I said, pick out
page 346 in volume 17

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.160
and alter one letter
to two letters in that.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:33.870
Not everything is that accurate,
but nonetheless close to that.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:35.170
But it's important.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.980
We are struggling to find
what the ethical realm

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.060
and the boundaries would be for
this kind of experimentation.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.200
I'm just going to finish by saying
-- if we're going to questions --

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.510
I'm going finish by saying
that there are three --

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:52.940
my book recommends three potential
boundaries, and they're important.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.980 position:56%
You can think of them as a triangle.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.120
One edge of the triangle
is that obviously we would

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:01.710
like to intervene genetically
on diseases

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:04.720
that cause extraordinary suffering.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.280
That should be a bright line.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.590
Number two, the second line of
the boundary is that the link

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.690
between what we're trying to change

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:16.110
and the disease should
be relatively tight.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:20.390
In other words, there are many
illnesses, many human illnesses,

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:24.020 position:56%
that are not linked to just one gene
but have multiple genetic links.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.710
Genes plus environmental links.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.300
But we have to establish that
when we intervene on the genes

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.360
that we're very confident
that the link between the gene

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.110
and the disease is tight.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.060
And the third one, going back to
the political history of eugenics

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.070
and the human history of
eugenics, is to remind ourselves

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.090
that this should only
occur with consent

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.550
and it should be justifiable.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.470
It we should be able
to justify it in terms

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.810
of the individual whose genomes
are being intervened upon,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.020
and they should have
freedom and consent.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.760
So these are the three triangles.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.500
You can imagine every angle of
these three triangles is its own

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.800
ethical debate.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.620
What is extraordinary suffering?

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.350
You know, who defines it?

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.720
Are you to define it,
am I to define it?

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.010
How tight do you want
this link to be?

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.330
What does freedom mean?

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.540
You know, if we create
a coercive society,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.920
do we tacitly violate the capacity
of individuals to give consent?

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:26.680 position:56%
So course these three are
complicated realms of this triangle,

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.780
but at least it defines
some boundaries.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.320
That's what I recommend.

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.970
&gt;&gt; Who would like to
ask some questions?

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.830
And while people are --
come up to the microphone --

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.320 position:56%
and while people are coming up, I
thought of this in your first answer

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.320
and I did want to ask you
before we go on to questions,

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.410
which is, did you scan your genes?

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.710
&gt;&gt; I did not.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:46.880
You know, I run a laboratory.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.620
We do genetic sequencing
day in and day out.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.540
It would take me no more than
drawing a pinprick of my own blood

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.380
or spitting into a
little tube to do it.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.680
I decided not to.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.110
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.410
Yes, sir?

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:00.710
&gt;&gt; OK, hi.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.010
Thank you for coming.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.310
It's very interesting.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.610
I love your book.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:05.910
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.210
&gt;&gt; I was involved

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.510
in the sociobiological
debates back in the '70s.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.810
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And I think one of the problems I
have is that on the one hand we want

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.950
to think of science as being
objective and looking at the truth,

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.480
but we also have to recognize

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.570
that science is an inherently
political activity in terms

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.850
of what questions get asked,
what science gets funded,

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.720
how it's interpreted,
how the results are used.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.560
So I think we have a dilemma
really between, you know,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.210
what we want to think
science is and --

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:35.360
but we have to at least
recognize the fact

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.760
that science is inherently
political.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.270
&gt;&gt; And to be honest --

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.490
&gt;&gt; -- both of my books
address the question of science

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.550
as a human and political activity.

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:51.770 position:56%
I have no doubt whatsoever that this
will continue way into the future.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:59.100
The way we interpret data
is ultimately altered,

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:03.610
we see it through the
lenses of culture.

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:10.560
That said, I don't believe
that it's a free-for-all.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.330
As I said, I do believe in truth.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.400
I don't think that, I
think the interpretations

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.050
of data are constantly changing.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.240
But we're becoming richer
and more knowledgeable

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.730
about what all this means, what
genetics means, what genes tell us

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:28.420
about ourselves, our history, etc.,

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:33.380
etc. I think that absolutely
we will continue to struggle

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.060
with the truth value of
science and our capacity

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.550
to interpret it and
to understand it.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.160
And this is an old struggle.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.390 position:56%
You know, we will continue to engage
with this through human history.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.200
I don't think that's going
to change in the near future.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.760
Over here.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.360 position:56%
First off, I love what you're doing.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.660
I love your research.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.690
You said when you wrote your book
you predicted in the next ten years

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:05.180
that we would see that the
human genome being edited,

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:08.520
but it was actually ten months,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.790
what are the next developments
you see in your field?

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:17.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, the next major milestone --

00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:23.250 position:56%
the next small milestone will be the
arrival of multiple, not just one,

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:26.120
CRISPR and CRISPR-edited organisms.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.480
And they will climb
higher and higher

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.840
into the complexities of organisms.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.190
So I suspect in the next
few odd months we will see a

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:39.910
CRISPR-edited monkeys.

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:41.270
&gt;&gt; Months?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.680
&gt;&gt; Months, I would say, yeah.

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.170
That would not surprise me.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.880
Certainly a CRISPR-edited animals

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:53.240
of various sorts genetically
modified in whatever way.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.410
And meanwhile, the human embryos --

00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:01.770
of course currently no such human
embryo has ever been re-implanted

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.070
or brought to term.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.370
We have no idea.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.670
There is in fact a
big debate going on --

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.970
&gt;&gt; It's illegal, actually,
isn't it --

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:08.270
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:09.910
&gt;&gt; -- in the United States?

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:16.540
&gt;&gt; So I would say it's illegal
beyond a certain place it becomes

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.990
illegal, but not so in
many other countries.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So I think within the next 20 odd
months, these embryonic experiments,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.380
human embryo experiments,
will continue to progress

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.140
until we're brought to that
precipice, and then we have

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.610
to make a big decision,
whether to allow

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.520
or not allow the first
genetic changes

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.990
in human beings directed
deliberately by human beings,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.950
should they be introduced
into human embryos are not?

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.500
I think that precipice
is probably coming

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.100
in 20 months, 20 to 24 months.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.700
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.000
&gt;&gt; I just wanted --

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.300
&gt;&gt; It is a big deal.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.310
[ Laughter ]

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.530
I just wanted to express
my gratitude.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.620
Because a couple of years
ago, I had breast cancer.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.770
And each day that I had
chemotherapy, I would come home

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.650
and I would watch the
Emperor of all Maladies.

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:08.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.920
&gt;&gt; And I'm not a scientist,
I'm a librarian and archivist.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.710
So watching the history
unfold allowed for context

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.630
that I just simply didn't have.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.790
And so as I was dealing with
this personally I was able

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:26.310
to see what had gone on before
me and what was going on,

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.120
you know, for future people.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.120
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks back to you
because your and archivist.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:31.420
It allowed the book to happen.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:32.720
&gt;&gt; Yet.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.020
[ Laughter ]

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.920
[ Applause ]

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.000
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.300
&gt;&gt; This is high enough?

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.600
So two things.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.240
Thank you how well-written
the book was.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.550
I am an art history major,
and not a science major,

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.390
and I think that you are the first
scientist I actually listened to --

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.770
[ Laughter ]

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.070
-- who wasn't a professor.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:59.430
The reason I picked up the
book, moving to my first point,

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:03.520
is that I struggle with
-- my mother has bipolar.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:04.820
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:08.650
&gt;&gt; My brother was categorized
as ADHD and severely medicated

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:12.870
in the '80s and it has led
him to amplified versions

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:15.930
of bipolar syndrome, which has
gotten him in much trouble.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.840
So it's something I struggle with.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.170
Being the youngest child is --
when will this come out for me?

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:27.150
So I really appreciate your
book and how it broke down --

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.680
how it really gave an
understanding of the history.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.110 position:56%
But what I found shocking to myself,
and I guess my question to you is,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:40.010
were you prepared for from Plato
and Aristotle to Mendel and peas

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.150
to Kelly Buck -- or
Carrie Buck, I'm sorry --

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.440
were you prepared for
the female role

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.180
in how this gene history
has been laid out?

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:57.500
It's so prevalent in one
generation to the next is --

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.510 position:56%
it amazes me that we have, you
know, Lady Justice and Lady Liberty,

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:03.160
but the female seems
to be blamed for a lot

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.100
of the discrepancies in the gene.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.900
&gt;&gt; I will add that
I noted that myself.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.290
[ Laughter ]

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:17.560 position:56%
Well, you know, as I wrote the book,
I personally became more aware.

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:24.730
You know, I thought myself
relatively well-versed

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:26.340
in American history.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.940
I'd never heard of Carrie Buck.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.970
I had to go back and try
to understand what it was

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:41.040
like to be labeled an
imbecile in 1910, 1920.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:49.210
I had not understood the role
that was ascribed to heredity

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:56.180 position:56%
and how much of it was
miss-ascribed because of a whole set

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.740
of political reasons,
some of them having to do

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.390
with our intersection with gender.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.270
So it was an awakening
for me as well.

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.720
And I'm intrigued by the fact
that you picked it up in the book.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.020
&gt;&gt; Yes. No.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.720
For me, it was also a bit of
history that I didn't know.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.220
And secondly, it struck
a chord with me as well

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:18.910
that frequently women
minorities are often the targets

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:24.020
of scientific experiments.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.320
&gt;&gt; Science, politics.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.480
In fact, the eugenics project
continued in the United States

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:37.470
on African-Americans way
into the 1950s and '60s,

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:41.930
long extending beyond the
-- what's known about it.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.230

&gt;&gt; I'm from Mumbai.

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:48.000
I'm on holiday here, and
I big and I'm a big fan.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.110
I hit the jackpot today when
I checked on the Internet

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.410
and saw you were speaking.

[ Laughter ]

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.460
So my question is on longevity.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:58.030
How soon before we have humans
living for 200 years or more?

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.050
[ Laughter ]

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That day's
always supposed to come,

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:04.140
apparently, so I'm curious myself.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.510
&gt;&gt; Well, the longevity
demands a long answer --

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.060
[ Laughter ]

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.360
-- but I'll try to be brief.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.110
&gt;&gt; We've got five minutes,
we're being told.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.910
&gt;&gt; There are two extreme ways
that I think about longevity.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:21.040 position:56%
I'll go from the least
provocative to the most provocative.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.750
The least provocative is removing
-- it's a double negative --

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:31.140
killing all the killers, removing
the diseases, the illnesses,

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:36.430
that place natural restrictions on
human age; cancer, heart disease,

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.360
and neurological illnesses would
be the highest on that list.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.970
So as we eliminate them, of course,
human lifespans will increase.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.950
So that's vision one.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:51.040
Vision two is more complicated.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.310
Vision two is not a negative
vision but a positive vision.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.610
Are there genes that we can --

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:00.280
or pathways or things that we
can intervene on that allow us

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:06.990
to increase longevity in a
way not by killing the killers

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.400
but by increasing the human
body's capacity to live longer?

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.700
And in fact there are.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:13.140
There are metabolic
properties, there are genes,

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.360
we're discovering more and
more of them in other animals

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.640
and extending those
data into human beings.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.680
The third one I'll give you
as a thought experiment.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.980
I'm writing a little bit about it.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.600
The third one I'll give you
as a thought experiment.

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:32.700
Another possibility is to clone
yourself and to then implant

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:39.590
through some kind of deep
learning techniques your voice,

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.020
some of your memories, including
the memories of your trauma, etc.,

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.910
to this genetic clone of yourself.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.340
We are edging -- we
won't come there --

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.550
but we're edging towards
technologies that will allow us

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.800
to achieve these technologically.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.120
I just pose this as
a thought experiment.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.580
What if I we're to think about
creating a clone of a self,

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:10.470
genetically identical, and then
passing on some of these memories,

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:13.560
traumas, histories, to that
clone, is that longevity?

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.860
I don't know.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:17.740
I think of that as a mind-bending
experiment for a second.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.540
&gt;&gt; That's a happy thought
to leave everyone with.

We have two minutes left.

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.240
I just want to come back
to the ethical implications

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.690
of all the things that you've
just said very briefly.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:33.250
Has the technology surpassed
our ability to regulate it,

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.530
to actually make sure
that some of these things

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.400
that we've only seen
in movies come to pass?

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.510
&gt;&gt; I think that the feeling
across the scientific community is

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:49.950
that it's getting time to hit the
pause button for a little bit.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:55.520
And it's getting time -- as I
said, this is not trivial stuff,

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.470
this is intervention on the
human genome deliberately.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.510
It's a conversation that
people in laboratories

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:08.120
with white coats cannot have in and
of themselves, within themselves.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.850
It's your genome.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.640
We have all of this in custody
across all human beings,

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.100
so you have to be able
to have this conversation

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.490
as widely and broadly as possible.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:22.400
And therefore, you need -- you, me,
we all need to know the vocabulary,

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.850
we need to understand the
technology, what's fantasy,

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.460
what's not fantasy, what's
possible, what's not possible,

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:31.460
where the lines are, what
nations draw what lines,

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.010
what we have allowed, what others
have allowed, what we're doing,

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:38.480
etc., etc., this has to be an
international conversation.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.290
So I think in the scientific
community there is every day

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:47.420
increasing cognizance that we sort
of need to hit the pause button

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.010
for a little bit before moving on.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:53.820
And I think again within
the next ten odd months,

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.200
we will begin to see -- I know many
of them already because they're

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.690
in draft form -- we will begin to
see a very public acknowledgments

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:05.750
that we need to have
stronger boundaries,

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:07.050
international boundaries.

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.210
You can't do something if
China's doing something else.

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.150
We can't do something if India
is going to have different rules.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.100
How to negotiate those boundaries
based on ethical precepts.

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.430
The conception of, you know,

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:24.840
what the life of an embryo is
is different between cultures.

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.880
So we have to respect
and understand that.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.860
But at the same time
because it's the human genome

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.040
that we're talking about, this
has to be a conversation that all

00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.690
of us need to have together.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:34.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.590
&gt;&gt; Please, round of applause.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.890
[ Applause ]

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:43.680
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
by the Library of Congress.
