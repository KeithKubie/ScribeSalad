NARRATOR: Socialism--
socialism--

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.342
Workers to power!

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.760
NARRATOR: Socialism?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.596
We are fighting to put
more power in the hands

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.640
of everyday working Americans.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.891
NARRATOR: Socialism--

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.561
[music playing]

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.399
Before it became a dirty
word, socialism was relatively

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.484
popular in the United States.

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:28.486
So what happened?

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.739
Socialism can refer
to a whole bunch

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.991
of economic and
political philosophies

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.076
based around the
idea that communities

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.204
should either own or regulate
the means of production.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.207
The means of production being
the facilities and resources

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.960
from raw materials to
tools and factories

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.879
used to create wealth.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.839
Principles of
socialist societies

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.549
had already been
adopted in America

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.427
by some religious communities,
like the Amish and Shakers

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.888
in the early 19th century.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:58.308
Socialism was eventually
championed by American labor

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.351
activists in the
late 19th century

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.812
as part of a new
political movement.

00:01:02.812 --> 00:01:06.149
That was largely thanks to
German economists and writers

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.818
Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels and their theories

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:12.155
about class struggle in the wake
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.992
They applied socialist theory to
a vision of communist society.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.161
The short version
of their vision is--

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:21.206
in rebellion against
industrial injustice and labor

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.959
exploitation, the working
class should have a revolution

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.129
taking property and money away
from wealthy greedy business

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.216
owners and sharing it
with the entire community.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:34.552
The long version
is, well, very long.

00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:37.514
But the point is it
caught on in America,

00:01:37.514 --> 00:01:40.141
sparking a long
tradition of socialism

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:41.684
and socialist thought.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:44.020
The first socialist
to hold public office

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.566
in the United States was elected
as a city councilman in 1897.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:51.653
The first socialist to serve
in Congress won in 1910.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.489
In 1912, Eugene Debs
ran for president

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:58.952
on the socialist party ticket
and won 6% of the popular vote.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.038
As socialism gained popularity
in the United States,

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:04.874
it was also gaining
popularity in Russia,

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.210
which was still an empire.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.337
The Marxist Russian
Social Democratic

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:13.925
Labor Party, a radical
socialist party formed in 1898.

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.720
In 1903, a faction called
the Bolsheviks split off

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.099
founded by Vladimir Lenin
and Alexander Bogdanov,

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.351
who considered themselves
leaders of Russia's

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:25.520
revolutionary working class.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.940
By 1912, the Bolsheviks
were their own party.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.736
There were a lot of parties in
Russia over the next few years.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.073
In 1917, the Russian
empire collapsed.

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:39.659
Emperor Nicholas II
abdicated the throne,

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.079
and by October, power was
given to the Soviets, groups

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.832
of grassroots workers
assemblies that identified

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.876
as socialists and communists.

00:02:47.876 --> 00:02:51.462
By January 1918,
Vladimir Lenin had seized

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:53.173
control of the government.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.801
By November, World War I had
ended, and back in America,

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:00.430
workers began to strike,
demanding the robust wages they

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.016
enjoyed during the war economy.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:06.019
Also, in 1919, a string
of bombs targeted

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.688
at high ranking US government
officials and notable

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.815
businessmen were discovered.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:13.192
Thus, began the
first Red Scare--

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.612
a heightened fear that
radicalism in the US

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.197
might lead to a violent
revolution like in Russia

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.492
and bring an end to democracy
and American values.

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.121
Paranoia surrounding the bombs
and the strike spurred attorney

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.083
general A. Mitchell Palmer to
coordinate a series of raids,

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.794
targeting thousands of people
he thought might be harboring

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:34.213
dangerous ideas and
who he suspected

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:37.050
might be communists
or anarchists.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.552
These would be known
as the Palmer raids.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.804
While fears of
communism lingered,

00:03:41.804 --> 00:03:45.016
many citizens became
wary of capitalism too.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:48.311
Because in 1929,
America had plummeted

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:50.146
into a Great Depression.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.399
In the mid-1930s, President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.069
was both criticized and
lauded for implementing

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.154
socialist leaning
policies and programs

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:00.490
to combat the economic crisis.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.533
Meanwhile, in
Russia, Joseph Stalin

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:06.371
had risen to power by 1928,
advocating his own version

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.874
of communism combining some
socialist economic policies

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:13.378
with executions, deportations,
a cult of personality,

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.171
and totalitarianism.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:19.342
In the 1940s, the capitalist
US and the communist USSR

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.804
maintained an alliance so
they could defeat the Nazis.

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.556
After World War II ended,
President Harry Truman

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.269
refocused his efforts on making
sure the Soviet Union did not

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.521
have too much influence abroad.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.941
Socialism became synonymous with
the Soviets, and their version

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:37.860
of communism, which was
seen as a direct threat

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.030
to America's free market
capitalist system.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.325
Worried again that a communist
revolution could happen

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:48.204
in the US, American leaders told
the public, again, that they

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:50.498
should be afraid of communism.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.667
And by the time
Eisenhower was in office,

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.004
Americans were pretty
afraid of communism.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:05:01.092
Between 1950 and 1954,
Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.177
who was also afraid
of communism,

00:05:03.177 --> 00:05:06.264
helped to make Americans
very afraid of communism

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.851
by launching a series of highly
publicized investigations

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.645
into potential communist
infiltration in the White

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:16.899
House, the treasury, the State
Department, and even the army.

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:19.444
This second Red Scare
shaped the attitudes

00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:22.280
of Americans towards
communism and socialism

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.157
for decades to follow.

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:27.326
Attitudes that would prevail
throughout the Cold War

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:30.038
and after the Cold War.
