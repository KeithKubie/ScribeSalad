00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.530
In the great Alaska
Range comes a moment

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.100
eight months in the making.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.430
Here's where the
opening is going to be

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.800
between the two structures.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.000
With just a few precision
cuts, Morgan's one room cabin--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.130
Here will be the first step.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.100
Will open up into
a two story home.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.270
I'm just going to look at
this carefully, because this

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.870
is a one shot deal, you know?

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.070
I can't do this twice.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.670
I can't mess it up.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.900
Here we go.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.730
I got the first half of
the hole opened up here,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.130
and getting ready to
saw down into the logs

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.470
to form the base of the cabin.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.000
If one of those logs has some
weird tension where it wants

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.870
to pop out of line
from the other ones,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.800
the whole wall could drop.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.470
And definitely, that
would be catastrophic.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.070
So Here, I just need to attach
some boards to all these logs

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.030
so those logs stay put
when I'm sawing them out.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.770
Here we go.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.700
Those are pretty well
locked in together.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
I think I've done all
the preparation I can do.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.600
And now I just got to go
ahead and cut the hole.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.970
I'm going to do
this block by block

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.230
so that I can kind
of monitor any shift

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.400
that might start to happen.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.730
So far so good.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.600
I'll get the rest of
this finished out here.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.000
Whoa.
[bleep]

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.070
I think there's a nail in there.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.170
Morgan's breakthrough
grinds to a halt.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.430
I can see it in
there, but it's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.700
not cut all the way through.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.230
Hitting a log screw
with a saw chain

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.570
would probably break the chain.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.030
I'll just hit it with a cold
chisel right out of the park.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.830
All right.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.530
I think I just got it there.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.370
Sheared it off.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.800
We need that chainsaw
to cut firewood,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.800
and it's a long way
to the hardware store.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.630
So I'm not going to risk blowing
it on cutting these logs when

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.630
we can do it with hand saws.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.500
All right, we're
free on this one.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.270
Take it off.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.200
Look at that nail.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.130
Hopefully, there's
not another one.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.030
Good job.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.370
Look it there.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.170
Oh god.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.370
There's a hole in my house.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.430
I know.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.730
And your house is
getting so much bigger.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.930
That's true.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.270
It's really cool
to see this doorway.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.570
Having this bigger
addition is really going

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.600
to improve our quality of life.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.800
But we have to leave the floor
unfinished until the ground

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.900
thaws enough that we
can dig out the cellar

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.630
area to store our root crops.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.930
A temporary gang
plank bridges that gap

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.100
while construction continues.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.870
When we get this screw down
and we can be in business.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.670
OK.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.130
This gangplank is
pretty sturdy here,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.530
and Margaret bucked
up firewood logs

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.830
and I'm going to bring
them in and we'll

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.070
get the fire going in the stove

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.730
It feels great to light the
stove for the first time,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.700
feel the heat coming off of it.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.030
This cookstove is going to be
kind of like the warm heart

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.100
of this entire homestead here.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.330
You know, producing
great food and heating

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.130
this nice big new
cabin we've got.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.170
First things first.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.730
Took a lot of work to get here.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.000
It definitely took
longer than expected,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.970
but we're building
our safe even more

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.470
and it's just very exciting.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.570
Oh, that's cool.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.970
There's still a long
way to go, but at least

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.700
we're sitting inside.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.030
Yeah, we got it to
a usable place here,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.430
and it'll be a bit more
work to get finished out.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.570
Kind of don't even want to
think about the whole list.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.730
Just one piece at a time.
- OK.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.130
Bite sized.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.170
Living out here is
challenging, to say the least.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.000
But these kind of
accomplishments really add up.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.400
Cool.
Let's see what else we can do.
