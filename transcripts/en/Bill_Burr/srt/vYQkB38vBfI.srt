1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,353
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,660
falls couple of years ago, I was
Raven about that John Fabro movie.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,680
I'm a chef. You haven't
seen the movie. It's,

4
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,570
it's phenomenal. It's just such
a great, great movie. And uh,

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,100
and just don't be hungry when
you watch it because you will,

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:28,150
you will consume like 12,000 calories
after watching it because some of the

7
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:31,600
food, basically, all of the food
that they make looks unbelievable.

8
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:34,060
So long story short, you know,

9
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:38,590
like whenever they have like end
credit stuff on like a movie, um,

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,660
you know,

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,340
it's usually like outtakes or something
from the actress screwing up or, or,

12
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:45,790
or whatever. Um,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
okay.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,270
John had to learn how to basically,
I guess, you know, they had data,

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,930
you had to take cooking classes and stuff.

16
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,430
So he looked like he was an actual chef.

17
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,460
So though the movie movies
character would ring true, you know,

18
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,480
all that actory stuff.

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,040
So there was a guy showing them how to
make a grilled cheese sandwich. This guy,

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,890
a chef, Roy Choi, who, uh,

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,760
had the Koji trucks started the whole
food truck movement out here in la and

22
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:09,590
everything. And

23
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,010
it all started with the
Kogi Barbecue Taco truck.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,490
There's nothing else in life they could
have brought me this far to feed so many

25
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,870
people yet there's so many
people I haven't fed yet
and as his restaurant empire

26
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:21,770
continues to grow,

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,660
Choy is determined to feed people in
underserved communities with nutritious

28
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:31,661
fast food at his restaurant chain called
local and Roy Choi isn't amused by

29
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,970
critics who he says want him to fail.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,720
He was showing them how to do it and
John just decided to film it when he,

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,230
when he,

32
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:46,180
when he was making this cheeseburger and
it was like so fucking intense when the

33
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,300
guy was doing like all
crunched down looking at it
and he was moving the grilled

34
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,660
cheese grilled cheese sandwich.

35
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,220
You just thinking like this is something
like a fucking 12 year old can make,

36
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,890
but watching this guy do it
and the level of intensity,

37
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,820
the game seven fucking intensity
that this guy had when he made it,

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,130
I was just like, what? They'd
like blew me away. It was like,

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,120
I've never been that into fucking
cook consulting ever. You know?

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,330
Ah, it doesn't make sense
with my brains and your speed.

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,180
We should be destined
for greatness, right?

42
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,270
We need to think big little Amigo.
I'm talking commercials. Talk shows,

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,700
Connie fairs. Got It. We can
have our very own Telanovela

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,190
[inaudible].
