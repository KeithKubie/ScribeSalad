00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:04.804
KEVIN: Yeah.

00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.472
-Yo, dude, you
gotta come out, man.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.240
KEVIN: Why?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.240
-Hey man, we gotta talk
to you about something.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.309
KEVIN: About what?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.355
-Yo man, just come
out the goddamn door.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.480
-I really don't
understand y'all.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.582
Like y'all know how I am.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.868
I like my space, man.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.515
That's my alone time right now.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.389
-Dude, Joey's been
acting weird, man.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.302
-Ever since "Real
Husbands," or "Hollywood,"

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
whatever that thing called,
y'all won an Image Award.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.120
-Weird how?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520
What are you talking about?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.988
-You know how we used to make
fun of his vests all the time?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.960
-Yeah.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.596
-Yeah, well he made
a complete 180.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.040
And I don't mean in a good way.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.840
-OK.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.242
You know what?

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:49.440
You guys sound like haters.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.440
-Hm.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.475
-I'm being honest with you.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.915
Right now, you both
sound like haters.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.480
And I, I thought that
we were all friends.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.116
I thought that we were
all on the same page

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.422
as far as keeping
each other afloat,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.142
being uplifting gentlemen.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.589
If that man wants to enjoy
the fruits of his labor,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.669
you let him.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.440
He's good.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.308
Leave Joey alone.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.221
OK?
-He good.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.000
He good.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.600
-I know he's good.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.360
-OK.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.120
Wait till you see this.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.880
-See what?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.714
-Uh, Joey?

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.267
-Hey, whoa, Spank-a-dank,
slide it, slide it, slide it,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.348
turned it out!

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.120
Turn out!

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.080
-Turn, turn up.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.280
-Turn up too.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.715
That's it.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.356
-Yo Kev, got 'em up.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.461
Two for you.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.581
Two for my [bleep].

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.920
-Shake your hands?

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.556
What is that?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.080
-Ooh, ooh.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.115
-OK.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.440
-Brought my thoughts.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.200
-Your what?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.234
OK.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.078
-Ladies, turn it out.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.400
-What the?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760
KEVIN: OK.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.160
-Here we go.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.160
KEVIN: Joey-- did Joey just make
white girls twerk on command?

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.995
-Yeah, yeah.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.360
They just twerked on command.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
-Joey, you got a gold tooth now?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.662
-Just take one these out
and get it on your tooth.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.783
-You're spending your
money on the wrong thing.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.560
-Fruits of labor.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.861
Fruits of labor.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.200
-No, this, this, this is--
I forgot how much this cost,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.302
but it's a lot.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.154
-Stop.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.360
-Sorry?

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.395
-Joey, when, when, I'm
talking to you, can you--

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.468
-Turn out.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.400
-Can you get the [bleep]
hair out your eye?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.200
Can you look at
me, please, Joey?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.920
Dude, what are you doing?
-No, I'm ready for the special.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.621
-No, no, Joey.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.508
Look at me.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.320
You're not about
to embarrass me.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.221
Get this off your damn head.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.741
-Hey!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.995
Hey, hey!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.668
-Get your ass in here.
-Hey, you can't go take my--

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.840
-Let me talk to you.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
-Hey, y'all take the
wig, and the white women,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.235
and you get them outta here.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.862
-Oh no!
Not my white women!

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.547
-Joey, you going to
lose the white women!

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.455
-Not my white women!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.360
-All right.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.261
That's my Joey right there.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.040
You look good.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.840
-No white women.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.600
-No white women.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.701
Go get 'em, Joey.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.956
-All right.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.929
-Leave me the [bleep]
alone, please.
