00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.629
It’s pretty mind boggling that we spend
a third of our lives asleep, but scientists

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.190
still aren’t sure why we do it.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.179
They know it’s important for resetting neural
activity, memory storage, rejuvenating our

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.839
bodies, all sorts of positive benefits.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.710
We all do it, but we just don’t have any
conclusive answers on why it happens.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.570
But thanks to genetic research we’re really
starting to figure things out on a molecular

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.570
level.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.669
For instance, do you have a hard time getting
a good night's sleep?

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.359
According to scientists it’s all in your
genes.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.900
Or, one gene in particular.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.149
Researchers in Washington state were looking
for genes that changed expression throughout

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.770
your sleep-wake cycle.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.160
And they found one in mouse brains: FABP7
- or fatty acid binding protein.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.090
They found that mice who had a mutated or
“knocked out” FABP7 genes slept more fitfully,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.250
compared to mice with normal genes.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.660
The mutant sleepers were more likely to wake
up during the night.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.420
Worst X-Men ever.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.250
That suggests that this gene is required for
normal sleep ... it’s a sleep gene!

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.900
Now, testing in mice isn’t enough, so they
tested this in humans too -- and found the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
same thing.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.320
The U.S. researchers teamed up with scientists
in Japan and looked at data of 294 Japanese

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.710
men who underwent a sleep study.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.330
It turns out that 29 of these dudes slept
fitfully AND had a mutation on FABP7.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.013
They also tested this in fruit flies.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:25.860
This is the first time researchers have gained
this level of insight into something as complicated

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.240
and mysterious as sleep across different species.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.960
Plus, FABP7 is found in astrocytes, which
are star-shaped glial cells located in the

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.800
brain and spinal cord.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.490
Astrocytes are total rock stars in the sleep
world.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.750
They’re potentially responsible for creating
that sleepy feeling we all get when our brains

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.310
feel tired or overworked, astrocytes secrete
adenosine, which triggers sleep mode to protect

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.310
our brains.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.450
So it’s no wonder that a mutated FABP7 found
in astrocytes can mess with our sleep.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.170
But not all sleep gene mutations are created
equal!

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.870
Some can be to your advantage.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.350
Are you the kind of person who can work for
long hours into the night, sleep six hours,

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.320
and wake up feeling refreshed?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.569
LIKE ME?

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.959
A study published by researchers in California,
found that “low-sleep but high functioning”

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.659
people can do this because they have a mutation
in a gene called DEC2.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.739
And according to the researchers, people with
this gene mutation were born to need less

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.739
sleep.

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.349
Whatever most brains need to do in 8 hours,
DEC2 brains can do in 6.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.209
This class of “efficient sleepers” are
truly elite, only 5% of the population have

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.739
this mutation.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.379
Scientists are even thinking of designing
a whole new class of drugs based on this mutation.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.439
So, even though we’re getting close to deciphering
the molecular mechanisms behind sleep, it’s

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.760
still one of the biggest mysteries in our
shared experience.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.689
And hopefully you’re not watching this before
you go to sleep because thinking about all

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.640
the millions of synapses functioning and eventually
powering down in your brain could keep you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.640
up at night.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.120
Plus, blue light on your phone.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
That’s bad.
