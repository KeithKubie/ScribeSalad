hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.350
hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team
at Google I work on graphics and

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
at Google I work on graphics and
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.060
at Google I work on graphics and
animation stuff here and today I wanted

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
animation stuff here and today I wanted
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.499
animation stuff here and today I wanted
to talk about some animation stuff

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
to talk about some animation stuff
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180
to talk about some animation stuff
surprise surprise

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190

specifically I wanted to talk about view

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
specifically I wanted to talk about view
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750
specifically I wanted to talk about view
animations which is the set of animation

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
animations which is the set of animation
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880
animations which is the set of animation
API is that are available prior to the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
API is that are available prior to the
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279
API is that are available prior to the
3.0 release so there's some more modern

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
3.0 release so there's some more modern
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.099
3.0 release so there's some more modern
api's that we'll talk about in future

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
api's that we'll talk about in future
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109
api's that we'll talk about in future
episodes but for now we'll talk about

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
episodes but for now we'll talk about
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.910
episodes but for now we'll talk about
the API is that you might want to use if

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920
the API is that you might want to use if
 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.230
the API is that you might want to use if
you're running on devices that are

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
you're running on devices that are
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080
you're running on devices that are
running platforms prior to the 3.0

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
running platforms prior to the 3.0
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120
running platforms prior to the 3.0
release so view animations were created

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
release so view animations were created
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920
release so view animations were created
specifically for animating the visual

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
specifically for animating the visual
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.270
specifically for animating the visual
properties of views it's not a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
properties of views it's not a
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250
properties of views it's not a
general-purpose animation engine but a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
general-purpose animation engine but a
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500
general-purpose animation engine but a
way to achieve specific visual effects

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
way to achieve specific visual effects
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.959
way to achieve specific visual effects
for your user interface so let's take a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
for your user interface so let's take a
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330
for your user interface so let's take a
look at a demo which I called view

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
look at a demo which I called view
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.400
look at a demo which I called view
animations we have a few buttons on the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
animations we have a few buttons on the
 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590
animations we have a few buttons on the
screen that's are named after the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
screen that's are named after the
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.000
screen that's are named after the
animations that are going to be run when

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
animations that are going to be run when
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.290
animations that are going to be run when
you click on them so we have an alpha

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
you click on them so we have an alpha
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569
you click on them so we have an alpha
animation a translating animation that

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
animation a translating animation that
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700
animation a translating animation that
moves the button around rotate animation

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
moves the button around rotate animation
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.490
moves the button around rotate animation
scale animation and then a set animation

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
scale animation and then a set animation
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.070
scale animation and then a set animation
is basically a way to choreograph

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080
is basically a way to choreograph
 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.479
is basically a way to choreograph
several animations on the same object so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489
several animations on the same object so
 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.219
several animations on the same object so
we run all of those types of animations

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
we run all of those types of animations
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590
we run all of those types of animations
on that one button to really to give it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
on that one button to really to give it
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.620
on that one button to really to give it
a really horrible effect which I expect

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
a really horrible effect which I expect
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570
a really horrible effect which I expect
to not see in any of your applications

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
to not see in any of your applications
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730
to not see in any of your applications
now all of these animations that we're

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
now all of these animations that we're
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.530
now all of these animations that we're
running here were created and run in

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
running here were created and run in
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030
running here were created and run in
code but you can also load them from

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
code but you can also load them from
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590
code but you can also load them from
animation resources which we'll see in

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
animation resources which we'll see in
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.390
animation resources which we'll see in
the code in a minute so we can get

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
the code in a minute so we can get
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.950
the code in a minute so we can get
exactly the same types of effects

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
exactly the same types of effects
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560
exactly the same types of effects
loading from XML resources instead so

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
loading from XML resources instead so
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230
loading from XML resources instead so
now let's take a look at the code so we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
now let's take a look at the code so we
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910
now let's take a look at the code so we
have this class called view animations

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
have this class called view animations
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069
have this class called view animations
it's an activity we have a checkbox that

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
it's an activity we have a checkbox that
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.630
it's an activity we have a checkbox that
controls whether we load from resources

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
controls whether we load from resources
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.399
controls whether we load from resources
or create these on the fly in code we

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
or create these on the fly in code we
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.280
or create these on the fly in code we
have the buttons that are created here

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290
have the buttons that are created here
 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.929
have the buttons that are created here
we have alpha translate rotate scale

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
we have alpha translate rotate scale
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760
we have alpha translate rotate scale
sets and then we listen for clicks on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
sets and then we listen for clicks on
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.710
sets and then we listen for clicks on
those buttons and run the animations

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
those buttons and run the animations
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359
those buttons and run the animations
appropriately this is the interesting

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
appropriately this is the interesting
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550
appropriately this is the interesting
part about how the animations are

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
part about how the animations are
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.810
part about how the animations are
actually created so this is how you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
actually created so this is how you
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609
actually created so this is how you
create some of these animations in code

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
create some of these animations in code
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740
create some of these animations in code
so here's an alpha animation we say we

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
so here's an alpha animation we say we
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.060
so here's an alpha animation we say we
want an alpha animation that's going to

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
want an alpha animation that's going to
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920
want an alpha animation that's going to
go from 1 to 0 that's basically saying

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
go from 1 to 0 that's basically saying
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.139
go from 1 to 0 that's basically saying
from fully opaque to fully transparent

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
from fully opaque to fully transparent
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270
from fully opaque to fully transparent
and we're going to set the duration note

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
and we're going to set the duration note
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.620
and we're going to set the duration note
that view animations don't have a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
that view animations don't have a
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.660
that view animations don't have a
default duration so you need to set a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
default duration so you need to set a
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.930
default duration so you need to set a
duration to have any animation at all

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
duration to have any animation at all
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.410
duration to have any animation at all
otherwise they'll just happen atomically

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420
otherwise they'll just happen atomically
 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.940
otherwise they'll just happen atomically
and immediately which is probably not

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950
and immediately which is probably not
 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.350
and immediately which is probably not
the kind of animation effect you're

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360
the kind of animation effect you're
 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.880
the kind of animation effect you're
looking for we have a translate

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890
looking for we have a translate
 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.460
looking for we have a translate
animation that's going to be moving in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
animation that's going to be moving in
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.530
animation that's going to be moving in
both x and y and you have the ability to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
both x and y and you have the ability to
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.870
both x and y and you have the ability to
move in absolute coordinates or relative

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
move in absolute coordinates or relative
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.360
move in absolute coordinates or relative
to self or relative to parents you can

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370
to self or relative to parents you can
 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.729
to self or relative to parents you can
basically say I want to move for half of

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739
basically say I want to move for half of
 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.340
basically say I want to move for half of
my parents wit for example again we set

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
my parents wit for example again we set
 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.020
my parents wit for example again we set
the duration and that animation is done

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
the duration and that animation is done
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.059
the duration and that animation is done
rotate animation again we have the

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069
rotate animation again we have the
 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.710
rotate animation again we have the
concept of being relative to self

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
concept of being relative to self
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.300
concept of being relative to self
relative to parent we have a pivot point

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
relative to parent we have a pivot point
 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.699
relative to parent we have a pivot point
that we're rotating around here we're

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709
that we're rotating around here we're
 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.520
that we're rotating around here we're
pivoting around the center point of the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530
pivoting around the center point of the
 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.960
pivoting around the center point of the
button itself so it's just going to

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970
button itself so it's just going to
 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.670
button itself so it's just going to
rotate around its center set the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
rotate around its center set the
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.630
rotate around its center set the
duration and we're done

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640
duration and we're done
 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.699
duration and we're done
scale animation we're going to scale it

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
scale animation we're going to scale it
 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.340
scale animation we're going to scale it
in both x and y from 1 to 2 which is

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350
in both x and y from 1 to 2 which is
 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.650
in both x and y from 1 to 2 which is
saying from my normal 100% size to a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660
saying from my normal 100% size to a
 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.150
saying from my normal 100% size to a
200% size and the set animation is a way

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
200% size and the set animation is a way
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.190
200% size and the set animation is a way
of combining all of these animations to

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200
of combining all of these animations to
 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.320
of combining all of these animations to
run all on the same button to give that

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330
run all on the same button to give that
 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.960
run all on the same button to give that
really horrible effect that we saw we

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970
really horrible effect that we saw we
 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.059
really horrible effect that we saw we
set up each of these animations which is

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069
set up each of these animations which is
 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.550
set up each of these animations which is
just a method that I created to say you

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560
just a method that I created to say you
 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.170
just a method that I created to say you
know either using animations we created

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180
know either using animations we created
 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.050
know either using animations we created
above or create them from resources

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
above or create them from resources
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.789
above or create them from resources
which we'll see in a minute and then we

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799
which we'll see in a minute and then we
 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.710
which we'll see in a minute and then we
listen in on the button when the button

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
listen in on the button when the button
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.030
listen in on the button when the button
is clicked then we run the animation

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040
is clicked then we run the animation
 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.910
is clicked then we run the animation
appropriately so that's the code side of

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
appropriately so that's the code side of
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.560
appropriately so that's the code side of
this the resource side we can take a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570
this the resource side we can take a
 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.920
this the resource side we can take a
look at and it should be fairly

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930
look at and it should be fairly
 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.090
look at and it should be fairly
straightforward if you understand how to

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100
straightforward if you understand how to
 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.500
straightforward if you understand how to
create these in code you'll understand

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510
create these in code you'll understand
 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.840
create these in code you'll understand
what the attribute names are in the XML

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
what the attribute names are in the XML
 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.610
what the attribute names are in the XML
resource so here's the Alpha animation

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620
resource so here's the Alpha animation
 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.250
resource so here's the Alpha animation
we say from an alpha of 1 to an alpha of

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260
we say from an alpha of 1 to an alpha of
 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.229
we say from an alpha of 1 to an alpha of
0 duration we're going to make this a

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
0 duration we're going to make this a
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.170
0 duration we're going to make this a
little bit faster in XML resources

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180
little bit faster in XML resources
 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.410
little bit faster in XML resources
rotate we've got 2 degrees 360 so it's

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420
rotate we've got 2 degrees 360 so it's
 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.970
rotate we've got 2 degrees 360 so it's
basically going to spend an entire cycle

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980
basically going to spend an entire cycle
 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.770
basically going to spend an entire cycle
and it's going to pivot around half of

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780
and it's going to pivot around half of
 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.530
and it's going to pivot around half of
its own width so it's got a center point

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540
its own width so it's got a center point
 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.289
its own width so it's got a center point
right in its center for the rotation

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299
right in its center for the rotation
 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.280
right in its center for the rotation
scale animation here from X&amp;Y of 1 so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
scale animation here from X&amp;Y of 1 so
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.920
scale animation here from X&amp;Y of 1 so
that's from its normal 100% size to an x

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
that's from its normal 100% size to an x
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.550
that's from its normal 100% size to an x
and y scale of 2 so going to 200%

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560
and y scale of 2 so going to 200%
 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.130
and y scale of 2 so going to 200%
duration of thousand and here's this set

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140
duration of thousand and here's this set
 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.229
duration of thousand and here's this set
so this is how we choreograph animations

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239
so this is how we choreograph animations
 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.569
so this is how we choreograph animations
and do several things either in parallel

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579
and do several things either in parallel
 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.340
and do several things either in parallel
or in sequence we're actually doing all

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350
or in sequence we're actually doing all
 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.470
or in sequence we're actually doing all
of these all together so they're going

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480
of these all together so they're going
 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.479
of these all together so they're going
to happen all at the same time to give

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489
to happen all at the same time to give
 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.789
to happen all at the same time to give
the the most egregious effect possible

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
the the most egregious effect possible
 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.710
the the most egregious effect possible
but you can stagger these in time as

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720
but you can stagger these in time as
 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.250
but you can stagger these in time as
well by using a start

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260
well by using a start
 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.160
well by using a start
set here we have an alpha animation

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170
set here we have an alpha animation
 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.300
set here we have an alpha animation
that's going to kick off at the same

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310
that's going to kick off at the same
 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.310
that's going to kick off at the same
time as a rotate animation same times at

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320
time as a rotate animation same times at
 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.230
time as a rotate animation same times at
scale animation and at the same time as

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240
scale animation and at the same time as
 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.840
scale animation and at the same time as
a translate animation so to load these

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850
a translate animation so to load these
 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.370
a translate animation so to load these
we can go back and look at the codes and

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380
we can go back and look at the codes and
 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.270
we can go back and look at the codes and
instead of just running the animation

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
instead of just running the animation
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.050
instead of just running the animation
that we created in code above we do a

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060
that we created in code above we do a
 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.030
that we created in code above we do a
animation utils load animation and load

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040
animation utils load animation and load
 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.440
animation utils load animation and load
it from the resource ID that we

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450
it from the resource ID that we
 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.650
it from the resource ID that we
specified so the takeaway from this

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
specified so the takeaway from this
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.390
specified so the takeaway from this
today is it's fairly easy to create

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400
today is it's fairly easy to create
 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.310
today is it's fairly easy to create
these things and to run these animations

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320
these things and to run these animations
 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.780
these things and to run these animations
and get some simple effects basically

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790
and get some simple effects basically
 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.550
and get some simple effects basically
moving things around on the screen and

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560
moving things around on the screen and
 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.140
moving things around on the screen and
and fading them in and out which can be

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
and fading them in and out which can be
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.090
and fading them in and out which can be
a very powerful tool to help your users

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100
a very powerful tool to help your users
 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.070
a very powerful tool to help your users
understand what's going on in your UI

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
understand what's going on in your UI
 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.750
understand what's going on in your UI
fade the things in that are coming into

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760
fade the things in that are coming into
 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.580
fade the things in that are coming into
view fade them out if they're going away

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
view fade them out if they're going away
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.520
view fade them out if they're going away
move things into position and basically

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530
move things into position and basically
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.640
move things into position and basically
give a more immersive and intuitive

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
give a more immersive and intuitive
 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.890
give a more immersive and intuitive
experience to your users in future
