00:00:00.577 --> 00:00:01.869
- [Voiceover] Now we're going to cover

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.740
a really important circuit in electronics,

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.205
it's the resistor capacitor
circuit, or RC circuit.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.236
And in particular, in this
video, we're going to talk about

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:14.403
the natural response of an RC circuit.

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:17.080
The natural response is what happens

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.850
when you put some initial
energy into the circuit.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.751
And in the case of an RC circuit,

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.683
it represents charge that's
stored on the capacitor

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:28.813
at the beginning of the analysis.

00:00:28.813 --> 00:00:30.551
We're going to go through
an intuitive description

00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:33.764
of what happens in this
circuit when this switch

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:36.813
is changed from this position,

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:40.636
where we're connecting a
battery to the RC combination,

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:42.041
and then we're going to basically move

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.559
the switch over to here,
and watch what happens

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.726
as that capacitor discharges
back through the resistor.

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:55.663
And that discharge pattern is
called the natural response.

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:58.491
So let's look at the circuit
as it's sitting here right now.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.280
Let's say that the switch has been

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.430
in this position for a really long time.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.644
Now sometime in the
past, there was some sort

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:08.727
of a current that flowed out of here.

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:12.302
That current flowed through the resistor,

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:15.385
and on to this capacitor, right here,

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.989
and that left us with some charge.

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:20.338
There's some charge here.

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.380
What that looks like,
let's do a close up picture

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.797
of the capacitor.

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:33.024
As charge flowed in here, it piled up

00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:35.524
on this side of the capacitor,

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:40.211
and there's a corresponding
negative charge

00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:43.061
that collected on the other side.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.686
This amount of charge matches
this amount of charge.

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:48.901
So that's what we mean when
we say that q, or charge,

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.291
is collecting on a capacitor.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:52.909
And for a capacitor structure,

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.306
we know that the amount of charge here,

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:59.893
is equal to the capacitance
value times the voltage.

00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:04.289
So as more and more
charge accumulates here,

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.403
the voltage goes up.

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:09.901
C is fixed, it's a
property of the capacitor.

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.545
If charge goes up, then v goes up.

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:15.010
So let's go back over
here and see what happens

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.079
as this current flows onto the capacitor,

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.718
charge accumulates, and eventually,

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:23.396
this voltage here will rise up

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.896
to be plus and minus v naught.

00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:30.451
And that that point, when
this point is at v naught,

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.386
and this point is at v naught,

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:35.544
the current through the resistor stops,

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:38.470
so the current here will
be zero, and the voltage

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.656
at this point will be v naught.

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:42.166
So I want to plot that right now.

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:46.333
We'll begin our sketch of
what this response looks like.

00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:53.091
So this will be our time axis.

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.758
This will be v of t.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:02:59.443
Which is this voltage here.

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:08.042
And this will be i of t.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.667
And we're going to label i
of t to be this current here.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.389
And you'll see why I picked
that direction in a minute.

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:28.532
So, at the beginning,
before I throw the switch.

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:29.871
We're going to throw the switch

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:32.174
in this direction right here in a minute.

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:35.328
But before we do that, we have
v naught on the capacitor,

00:03:35.328 --> 00:03:38.161
and we have i of t equals to zero,

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.252
so let me fill those in.

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:46.849
Before time equals zero.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.016
This is equal to v naught.

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.912
And this current down here is zero.

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:56.798
So now we're ready to throw the switch.

00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:58.729
Let me do that.

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:00.146
We'll erase this.

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:06.017
And then put the switch
in this position here.

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:09.290
And now let me clean this up.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.136
I'm going to erase the battery here.

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.816
The battery's done it's job for us,

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:16.093
which was to initially put
some charge on our capacitor,

00:04:16.093 --> 00:04:18.593
so we don't need this anymore.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:29.604
So here's our simplified circuit.

00:04:29.604 --> 00:04:31.263
And what we have here, there's a bunch

00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:33.928
of charge stored up on C,
and what's going to happen?

00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:36.743
It's going to start rushing
out of the capacitor,

00:04:36.743 --> 00:04:38.814
and going back through the resistor,

00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:41.716
to basically come over here
and neutralize the charge

00:04:41.716 --> 00:04:43.733
on the bottom plate.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:45.885
What's going to happen is over here,

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.459
the charge is going to leave,

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:50.122
it's going to go over
through the resistor,

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.832
it's going to come back in here,

00:04:51.832 --> 00:04:56.512
and these pluses and minuses
will then be neutralized.

00:04:56.512 --> 00:05:00.336
And that means if there's no net charge,

00:05:00.336 --> 00:05:03.729
the voltage is going to go to zero.

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.080
So we can draw that.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.237
What we're going to say

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:08.408
is after all this charge
rushes out of here,

00:05:08.408 --> 00:05:10.081
goes through the resistor,

00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:12.545
and ends up on the back
side of the capacitor,

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:15.309
neutralizing the charge in the circuit,

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:17.829
that means the voltage in the
circuit is going to be zero.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:19.511
So we can draw that.

00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.639
We draw the long time from now out here.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.511
It's going to sketch
into something like that.

00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:26.005
It's going to be low.

00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:29.252
Likewise, the current is
going to end up at zero,

00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:30.575
when we're finished here.

00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:33.455
And that's what happens
with every natural response.

00:05:33.455 --> 00:05:35.443
It basically, the energy
in the circuit is allowed

00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:36.693
to die to zero.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:40.598
So let's see if we can
fill in what's going

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:42.524
to happen in between.

00:05:42.524 --> 00:05:46.601
While this voltage here
started at v naught,

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.053
and it's going to end up at zero.

00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:50.416
The amount of current flowing out of here

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.180
is going to be proportional to the voltage

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.513
across this resistor, right?

00:05:55.357 --> 00:05:57.861
The amount of current flowing out

00:05:57.861 --> 00:05:59.694
is one over r times v.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.322
So if v is high, then
i is going to be high.

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:09.165
And as v goes down, as
we use up our charge,

00:06:09.165 --> 00:06:10.477
the current is going to go down.

00:06:10.477 --> 00:06:13.088
So I can sort of guess
what's going to happen here,

00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:15.925
it's going to basically come down,

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:18.175
and end up somehow at zero,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.952
after a while.

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:23.285
Now we don't know how long
it's going to take yet,

00:06:23.285 --> 00:06:26.971
but it's going to have
some shape like this.

00:06:26.971 --> 00:06:29.086
So let's look at what the
current is going to do.

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:30.840
The current right now,
when the switch was thrown,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.513
is at zero.

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:34.140
As soon as that switch is thrown,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.121
as soon as we connect it
right here, all of a sudden,

00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:40.063
we have v naught on this
side of the resistor,

00:06:40.063 --> 00:06:43.125
and zero on this side of the resistor.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.147
And so there's going to be
a sharp current increase

00:06:45.147 --> 00:06:47.199
going through this resistor here.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:49.871
So we expect this to go up like that.

00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:51.954
To jump up to some value.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:54.704
What we think the current
is going to look like,

00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:56.396
the current is actually over here.

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:58.761
It's directly proportional to the voltage,

00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.957
so as the voltage goes down,

00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:02.982
the current is going to go down.

00:07:02.982 --> 00:07:04.020
And we can take a guess,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.340
it'll have the same shape as the voltage,

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.806
so it's going to go down
something like that.

00:07:09.806 --> 00:07:11.973
Until it dies out to zero.

00:07:13.344 --> 00:07:17.106
So this is our forecast for
what the natural response

00:07:17.106 --> 00:07:20.166
of an RC circuit looks
like, and in the next video,

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:23.784
we will actually derive
really precise expressions

00:07:23.784 --> 00:07:25.866
for what those two curves look like.
