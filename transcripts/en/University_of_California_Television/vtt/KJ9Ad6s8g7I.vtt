(uptempo synthesizer music)

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.510
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.490
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.760
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240
Our guest today is Steven Pinker,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.470
who is the Johnstone Family Professor

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.670
in the Department of Psychology
at Harvard University.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.350
He's the author of eight books,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.510
including The Language Instinct,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.600
How the Mind Works, Words and Rules,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.300
The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.070
and most recently, The
Better Angels of Our Nature:

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.260
Why Violence Has Declined.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.330
Professor Pinker, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.163
- Thank you.

00:01:21.163 --> 00:01:22.840
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.220
- Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.700
- And looking back,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.970
what was the impact of family life on you?

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.000
A lot of discussion
around the dinner table?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.573
- There certainly was.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.210
It was a part of the Jewish minority

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.060
within the English minority
within the French minority

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.793
within the Canadian-English majority.

00:01:47.904 --> 00:01:49.380
As with a lot of Jewish families,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.650
there's a lot of conversation
over the dinner table

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.820
and with friends and family.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.113
There's an old saying,
10 Jews, 11 opinions.

00:02:00.377 --> 00:02:03.660
Also, it was a time as well as a place

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.080
that was right for
speculations on human nature

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.620
'cause it was the '60s.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.600
I'm a baby boomer.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.500
I was born in the peak
of the baby boom, 1954.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.480
And although I was too
young to be a participant

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.010
in the protests of the 1960s,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.270
it was certainly on everyone's lips.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.600
And questions arose like:
What kind of species are we?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.660
And what kind of political
arrangement best suits us?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.870
Should we all be anarchists?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.810
Are people naturally cooperative

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.600
unless the state forces them
to declare their property?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.420
Or do we need a police
force and a government

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.840
to keep us from each other's throats?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.980
Or should we all be communists?

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.730
Should we all be Ayn Rand libertarians?

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.690
These were topics that
were on everyone's lips

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.360
and certainly got me
thinking from an early age.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.750
- Was there anything distinctive

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.960
about the '60s in Montreal
that was different

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.140
than what was happening
here in the United States?

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.330
- Well, there was a...

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.870
I think it was even
more intensely political

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.780
because the question of
the separation of Quebec

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.720
into its own sovereign state
was always on the agenda,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.110
and so it was a bit like
Israel and South Africa,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.040
in that every conversation
had a political dimension.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.610
It was just on everyone's minds

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.030
because the government was becoming

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.600
increasingly nationalistic,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.220
was imposing various laws to preserve

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.000
and promote the French language.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.570
And that also raised the question

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.570
of whether nationalism,
ethnic pride was a good thing,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.640
especially when it was
occurring simultaneously

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.160
with questions of Zionism.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.730
Should there be a Jewish state?

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.130
Should Jews move to Israel
as part of a destiny

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.360
of the Jewish people?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.270
To what extent is the
identity of a person aligned

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.410
with the ethnic group
to which they belong?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.760
- So it sounds like ethnicity,
political questions,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.650
questions of identity were really

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.305
something you were hearing a lot of.

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:08.550
- That is true.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.000
And in Montreal, I had
the additional experience

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.223
that one of these debates, namely:

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.140
Is anarchism the best political system?

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.700
Which in the 1960s was a live issue,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.940
was kind of put to an empirical test.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.780
I remember arguing with
my parents, saying,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.480
Well, we don't really need
police, money, government.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.800
People will naturally cooperate.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.800
And they say, what do
you think would happen

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.670
if the police disappeared?

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.520
And I say, well, nothing!

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.480
I mean, it's just irrational
to steal and rape and kill,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.570
and people would realize that.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.980
And one of the things about living

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.700
in a kind of Gallic political
system like Quebec is

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.652
that sooner or later, every
public sector goes on strike.

00:04:54.652 --> 00:04:55.780
(Harry chuckling)

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.480
One week it's the garbage collectors

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.450
and then the nurses and
then the postal workers.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.540
Anyway, in 1969, it was the
police who went on strike,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.610
and within a few hours,
all hell broke loose.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.690
There was looting and riots.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.120
Not one but two people were shot to death

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.910
until the Mounties were
brought in to restore order.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.560
So that was a kind of a
empirical disconfirmation

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.960
of my 14-year-old self's
favorite political theory,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.030
namely anarchism,

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.730
and I realized that Mom
and Dad might have a point.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.970
- So are you suggesting
that, even at this young age,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.150
you were already something of a thinker

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.150
and that this shock of
recognition led you to think,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.310
have an inkling that you wanted
to think about human nature?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.740
- Yeah, I don't think
it was that event alone,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.840
but the whole set of events
coming from different directions

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.620
from the '60s, from Sunday school,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.830
where I was first a student then a teacher

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.330
and debating moral dilemmas,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.330
from the issues in Quebec,
the issues in the news,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.780
all of them combined,

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.420
and I think in combination
with my own temperament.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.570
We know that people vary

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.690
in terms of their thirst
for abstract ideas.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.910
There are people whose
cognitive energy is focused

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.050
on people, other's on things,
other's on practical issues.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.990
But then there're some people

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.920
who just like ideas for their own sake,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.920
and I think that's the kind
of genetic hand I inherited.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.650
- And what is the impact, in
your view, of the Jewish milieu

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.103
on your evolution, so to speak?

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.650
- It certainly didn't imbue me

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.780
with any long-lasting religious feelings

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.780
because I am a very clearcut atheist

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.320
and secularist and cosmopolitan.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.850
I don't believe that people's
identities have to be bound up

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.060
with that of some tribe or ethnic group.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.230
I mean, it's a background and a tradition

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.884
that I have a great deal of affection for.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:02.100
I think it's only human to be interested

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.330
in your tribal roots,

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.121
as long as you don't
take them too seriously

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:08.970
as having any political importance.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.970
I think that the tradition of debate

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.910
and kind of Tom Mudik
rabbinical back and forth

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:21.553
was something that I thrived in.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.990
I was not Orthodox.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.980
I was brought up in a Reform movement,

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.210
which was pretty secular,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.250
tried to preserve some of the traditions,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.870
largely for aesthetic grounds,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.230
had a strong historical component,

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.490
remember the Holocaust,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.470
had a strong Zionist component.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.053
But it wasn't hugely theological.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.890
- And bringing the Pinker analyst

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.350
and linguist psychologist

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.293
to the table to look
back at your background,

00:07:56.688 --> 00:08:00.233
is most of it sort of secondary

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.620
to the genes and the makeup here

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.620
that account for your journey?

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.340
- I suspect the genes
had a lot to do with it,

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.000
that there'd be a wide variety of families

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.850
I could've grown up with, grown up in

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.110
and still had the same kinds of interests.

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.110
I think the, as far as
non-genetic influences go,

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.090
the culture and the times
are enormously important.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.950
I may have gone in a
very different direction

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.950
had I come of age in the '50s
instead of the '60s and '70s.

00:08:34.456 --> 00:08:37.030
And of course, I had
to have the stimulation

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.250
of a information-rich
society with magazines

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.803
and books and newspapers
and electronic media.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:46.470
But I think we do tend

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.270
to underestimate the genetic component

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.560
just 'cause we never see it operating

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.090
because very few of us are adopted.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.800
So we have this enormous confound

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.860
in our autobiographical memories

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.080
between the way we were
brought up by our parents

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.560
and the genetic hand they dealt us.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.510
Only when you do studies with adoptees

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.333
do you actually see the
effects of genetics in action.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.010
- So, where did you do
your undergraduate work?

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:15.060
- At McGill University in
Montreal, kind of the default.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.670
My parents went to McGill,
and it's just kind of,

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.170
there was a natural conveyor belt

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.330
that led most kids to
the local university.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.840
- And what did you major in,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.850
and why did you major in that?

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.380
- I majored in psychology.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.800
I started off college prior
to going to McGill I went to,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.710
through the Province of
Quebec's junior college system,

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.720
I sent to Dawson College for two years.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.360
And I tried a variety of social sciences,

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.140
anthropology, sociology, also philosophy,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.913
various humanities courses, biology.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.790
Psychology seemed to me
to combine an interest

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.900
in big questions: What
are human beings like?

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.500
What's the nature, how do we communicate?

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.493
How do we think?

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.420
What is our emotional repertoire?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.040
But with a methodology that held out hope

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.480
of resolving those questions,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.280
namely laboratory studies.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.590
And so the combination of it
being an empirical science

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.690
and asking cosmic questions
was what appealed to me.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.370
- And did you do much humanities
work as an undergraduate?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.160
- Yeah, I took English course,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.820
an English pretty much every semester.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.260
I took, certainly took a fair
number of history courses

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:33.100
and a lot of philosophy, so yeah.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.857
- So, we're gonna talk
a little about your work

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.810
as a linguist, as a psychologist,

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.120
as a scientist really, in a way.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.540
But I always like to ask my guests

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.150
what you see as the skill set

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.870
and the temperament involved
in the kind of work you do,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.770
which is actually
comprehending many fields.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.170
- Yeah, I think it's trying
to see the simplicity

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:03.673
underneath the complexity,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:09.550
that it's not being satisfied
with some abstract fancy

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.710
overarching summary statement,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.600
but trying to think

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.813
about the nitty-gritty
mechanisms underneath it.

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:22.450
What concretely does language mean?

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.050
What goes on in a person's mind,
millisecond by millisecond,

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.110
as they retrieve a noun with
which to begin a sentence

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.700
and then a verb with which to continue it?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.020
Each step of which is very simple,

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.310
but in combination generate
the full complexity

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:41.430
of the phenomenon.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.500
So I think of myself as having
a very narrow bottleneck

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.970
in my mind through which
everything must pass.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.920
So I've got to dismantle everything

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.110
and put it thought that little ring

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.840
and then reassemble it on the other side

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.480
before I feel I really understand it.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.710
- So it's really zeroing in.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.213
It's almost an engineer skill,

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.660
thinking about how this works
by breaking up its parts.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.920
- Yeah, and I think of psychology

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.760
as a kind of reverse engineering.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.823
We've got this complex
artifact, the human brain.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.360
How does it work, and in particular,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.160
what was it designed to do?

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.730
Now of course, not literally designed

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.690
because I am not a creationist.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.230
But as with other products of evolution,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.470
there is a kind of simulacrum of design

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.200
that is the result of natural selection.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.420
Just as we understand physical organs,

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.580
like the liver or the eye,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.880
as having a biological function,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.360
so the mind and its various parts,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.110
I think, are most insightfully understood

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.640
by trying to figure out
what their function is.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.010
Why do we fall in love?

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.510
Why do we speak and understand?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.475
Why do we see in depth?

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.410
Why are we disgusted?

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.330
Why do we fight?

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.570
Why don't we fight at other times?

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.150
And I think that the ultimate answers

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.180
to a lot of those questions
come from the process

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.300
that gave rise to the
complexity of the brain,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.330
and that has to be the
process of natural selection.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:06.700
- There must be a lot of
patience involved in what you do.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.923
I know some of your early work
was with children and so on.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.810
So is that another element here
that becomes very important?

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.773
- It sure is, and there has to be,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.610
especially in the field of psychology

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.707
and any empirical science,

00:13:23.707 --> 00:13:25.340
there has to be a certain love of data,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.980
of just getting your hands dirty,

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.420
sifting through it, looking
for, trying to puzzle solve.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.850
What are the patterns?

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.933
Where are the misleading
patterns that you should ignore

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.670
at the end of the day?

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.850
In fact, when people,
like students, ask me:

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.920
What field should I go into?

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.220
I'm interested in the human mind.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.730
Should I go into artificial intelligence?

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.860
Should I go into psychology?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:49.960
Should I go into linguistics?

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.730
Philosophy of the mind, neuroscience?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:57.110
I say the choice of the actual field

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.940
as opposed to the topic depends

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:00.420
on how you like to spend your day.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.850
What do you concretely like to do?

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.870
If you like to write code,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.730
go into artificial intelligence.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:11.730
If you are content to
analyze sentences on a page,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.920
linguistics is how you
should spend your time.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.000
If you like lab work and
you don't mind wet stuff,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.100
go into neuroscience.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.510
But if you like the idea of
experimenting with people,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.330
if you like going through lots of numbers

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.860
and seeing their patterns,
then go into psychology.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.240
And they're often very surprised

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.490
because people think of their career

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:34.800
in terms of the content
that interests them,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.820
and obviously that's the starting point,

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.763
but just as important is:

00:14:38.763 --> 00:14:40.750
What are the actual activities

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.370
that occupy your waking hours?

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.020
- Let's go back now to your education.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:46.930
So where did you do your graduate work?

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.620
- I went to the psychology
department at Harvard,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.970
and I got my Ph.D. at Harvard.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.700
Then I got a postdoctorate fellowship

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.023
at the Center for Cognitive
Science at MIT down the river.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.030
- What led you to particular...

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.980
The many fields that
you've actually entered?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.930
Was it one research
project led to another?

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.140
Or was it more what you
just said about your advice?

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.107
- Yeah, it's one research,

00:15:16.107 --> 00:15:16.940
one thing leads to another.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.060
And I think when people
reconstruct their autobiographies,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.570
they're much too apt

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.410
to impose a satisfying narrative arc on it

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.540
and to have everything
foreshadowed by early events,

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.810
whereas I suspect any
honest biographer looking

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.017
at anyone's trajectory would see

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:35.480
that there's a lot of happenstance

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.790
and opportunities and what
was around at the time

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.840
and people just followed a path,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.330
making a choice at every point.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.690
This seems like the right
thing to do at the time.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.550
And that was certainly the case with me.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.073
I went into graduate school,

00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.880
not interested in language per se.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.890
I was interested in cognitive psychology,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.250
so that's really anything having to do

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.180
with intelligent processes in the mind.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.570
My Ph.D. thesis was on visual imagery,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.580
how people imagine objects and scenes

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.830
and manipulate them in their mind's eye.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:10.830
But I first started to work
in language in large part

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.090
because Harvard, at the time,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.660
it just denied tenure to
every cognitive psychologist

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.140
except one who'd studied
language development in children.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.450
I took a stimulating
graduate seminar with her.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.260
That was kind of all that
was around (chuckles)

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.740
and wrote a paper for a course

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.050
that she and other
professors said could be

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.650
of interest to the field as a whole.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.603
Why didn't I polish it for publication?

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.290
I was worried about being unemployed.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.620
This was the era

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.410
in which Ph.D.s were first
reported driving taxis

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.415
and unemployed and I--

00:16:46.415 --> 00:16:47.248
- This would be the '70s?

00:16:47.248 --> 00:16:48.570
- The '70s, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.610
- We hear about it now,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.870
but it was the first
wave of that worry was

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.170
when I was a grad student.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.770
So I kinda pursued the opening.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.000
I developed this theoretical
paper into a publication.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.150
I was then hired back at
Harvard a couple of years later

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.110
to teach courses in language acquisition.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.240
And because I had to teach it,

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.240
and because I had to
supervise students in it,

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.940
my interest in it deepened.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.190
All the while,

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.670
I continued to pursue
research in visual attention,

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.610
recognition of three-dimensional shapes,

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.360
mental transformations.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.463
Then I kind of responded to feedback

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.530
from the world.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.690
What the field was telling me,

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.700
that it found my writings

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.980
on language acquisition more interesting

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.210
than my work in visual cognition.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:39.750
I got more invitations,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.100
my publications were more easily accepted,

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.050
and I kind of got feedback from the field

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.490
as to what everyone else
thought was most interesting

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:50.770
among in my portfolio.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.230
- Before we talk a little more

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.573
about particular aspects of your research,

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:00.250
capture for us the intellectual excitement

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.455
that was there in the beginning--

00:18:03.455 --> 00:18:04.288
- [Steven] Yeah.

00:18:04.288 --> 00:18:05.723
- When you started graduate school,

00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:11.120
but also over the life of
your career, there must...

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.680
The amazing intellectual
(chuckling) excitement

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.370
about the way the brain is opening up,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.160
not just in the research,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.700
but also, the research of the brain,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.910
but visually with all
the technology and so on.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.580
- Yeah, I usually pursue a topic

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:33.520
when I find some source
of tremendous excitement,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.880
when it just feels like

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.350
there are whole vistas to be explored.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.230
And I felt that way as an
undergraduate just learning

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.243
about what was then a new field
called cognitive psychology.

00:18:43.469 --> 00:18:44.760
Psychology had been dominated

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.670
for many decades by behaviorism,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.670
the philosophy of psychology
advocated by B.F. Skinner,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.890
that mental entities,
like beliefs, desires,

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.650
wishes, images, rules, were suspect.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.550
They were unmeasurable,
hence, unscientific

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.020
and should be banished from
a science of psychology,

00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.580
which should only be about behavior.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.920
This was a dominant
school for a long time,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.890
but for obvious reasons,
it was quite constricting.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.660
Starting in the '50s and '60s,

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:20.660
with the importing of
ideas from other fields,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.890
like computer science,
cybernetics, information theory,

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.170
psychologists started to realize

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.640
you could study
intelligence scientifically

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.420
without banishing the
contents of the mind,

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.140
that thinking could be thought of

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.160
as a kind of information
processing or computation,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.560
that motives and desires and
emotions could be understood

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.120
in the language of
cybernetics and feedback,

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.300
that knowledge and belief
could be thought of

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.310
as a kind of information representation.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.580
And so you could be rigorous
and study these abstract,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:57.050
ethereal, airy-fairy concepts,
like beliefs and desires.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.320
That was a tremendously
exciting opportunity,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.120
and there was the cognitive revolution

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.240
that pursued this
starting in the late '50s,

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:04.830
and it was the momentum from that,

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.100
with a bit of a time lag,
that as an undergraduate,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.780
got me interested in cognitive psychology.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.040
Then when I got to MIT as a post-doc,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.430
this is many years later, this is 1979,

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.350
there was a lot of things
that were happening

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.180
that were advancing this agenda
of understanding the mind

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.400
as a kind of information processing.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.280
There were theories of
grammar from Noam Chomsky

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.933
and my post-doctoral
advisor, Joan Bresnan,

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.890
who I learned linguistics from.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.560
There were ideas from the
computational analysis of vision

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.290
from the great computational
neuroscientist David Marr,

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:43.773
who was at MIT at the time.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.830
Philosophy of mind had
kind of joined forces

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.510
with experimental scientist
to try to make sense

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:56.510
of questions like imagery,
innateness, will-following,

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.240
which had also been
banned from philosophy,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.390
but now philosophers were
exploring this landscape.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.500
And so all of those ideas
combined into the field

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.290
then became called cognitive science,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:10.470
not just psychology,

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.683
but also philosophy,
linguistics, computer science,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.740
led to an enormous amount
of energy and enthusiasm.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.100
Later, that got kinda,
started to bleed away

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.430
under the new developments
in neuroscience.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:29.300
The first wave had not given
a whole lot of attention

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.470
to the physical structure of the brain.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.680
And then that became the next wave

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.343
and starting in the late '80s and '90s.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.500
But, and then, at other
times, I found other ideas.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.300
It seemed to be there was
a world to be explored

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.800
in the particular areas
within cognitive science

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.803
that I then pursued.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.680
- It sounds to me like
you're saying in a way

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.680
that it's not just other
disciplines seeping in

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.570
to one's discipline,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.570
but rather to be truly
interdisciplinary is the road

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:10.040
to dealing with some very
interesting problems.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.040
So you're really a man who
transcends any one discipline

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:18.550
in the different kinds of work.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.573
You've kind of--
- Yeah.

00:22:19.573 --> 00:22:20.406
- Is that fair?

00:22:20.406 --> 00:22:21.239
- I think so.

00:22:21.239 --> 00:22:24.080
So even though I do
advise students to live

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.640
with the reality of academic disciplines

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.950
and to choose their career based

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.670
on concert activities they like to do,

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:32.640
in terms of understanding things,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.240
the disciplines are
something of a nuisance,

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.280
of kind of a historical legacy

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.260
that we should try to surmount.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.830
If you're understanding language,

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.850
it is, I think, folly to study it only

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:47.750
from the perspective of linguistics

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.550
or of psychology or computer science.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.980
It's all phenomena are connected,

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.510
all knowledge is connected,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.100
and we need all the tools we can get.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.660
It's hard to understand anything.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.880
To restrict yourself to one discipline

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.640
really means putting on blinkers

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.423
and not getting a full picture.

00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:11.160
- What do you see,
having studied the brain,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.650
and your own experiences in life,

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.000
what is the key to creativity?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.760
I mean, you've been dealing with ideas,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.480
back in Montreal at the dinner table.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.530
- Yeah.
- Sounds like.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.530
And sort of experiencing
the events of the '60s.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.693
Talk a little about that because:

00:23:33.235 --> 00:23:36.550
Is it interdisciplinary
work that exposes you

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:40.050
to all of these new ideas
in the various fields

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:41.963
you've dealt with?

00:23:41.963 --> 00:23:44.610
- Yeah, certainly, and
studies of creativity show

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.960
that it doesn't consist
of just lightning bolts

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.440
of inspiration out of the blue,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.850
that creative people
always immerse themselves

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.560
in vast amounts of material from the field

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.600
that they're interested in.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.580
Novelists read lots of novels,

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.880
and musicians have huge
record collections.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.120
And someone interested in ideas
has to absorb a vast number

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.620
of ideas that have been
thought of by others.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.450
No one is smart enough, or at
least I'm not smart enough,

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.520
to come up with anything truly original

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.370
and useful on my own.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.620
It always involves getting inspiration

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.620
from a vast kind of
feedstock of other ideas.

00:24:27.797 --> 00:24:29.860
And this consists not of,

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.780
partly of absorbing
ideas from other fields

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.570
that might be directly relevant,

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.990
and they can come from
all kinds of sources,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:41.403
from game theory, from
theoretical computer science.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.670
But also being able to combine ideas

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.310
from diverse fields
into a new conglomerate

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.370
that where the newness is
putting things together

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.930
that had never been put together,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.430
and from a kind of process of analogy

00:24:58.349 --> 00:25:01.349
that I'm actually interested
in as a cognitive psychologist.

00:25:06.691 --> 00:25:08.980
There's a kind of mental,
analogical reminding process

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.930
where one idea reminds you of another

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.210
that doesn't really have
anything in common on the surface

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.480
but has a deep commonality in terms

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.740
of their underlying structure.

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.770
So an example, I'm working on Photoshop,

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.380
and I'm darken one part of the image,

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.620
and I darken it too much so it stands out,

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.880
so I gotta darken another one.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.370
And, oh, now I darkened that too much.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.880
And now I, and before I know
it, the whole image is dark.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.080
And I'm immediately
thinking of a wobbly table,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.700
and how you cut off a
little bit of one leg,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.533
and, oh, now it wobbles.

00:25:36.533 --> 00:25:39.623
You gotta cut off another
part of another leg.

00:25:42.031 --> 00:25:42.960
I'm jogging

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.960
and have music set to shuffle on my iPod,

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.580
and some of the songs are the wrong tempo,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.180
but I can't sort of
stop and pick the songs.

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.360
So I just fast forward
through song after song

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.700
until I get the one that's
suitable for running.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.520
It reminds me of how, in baseball,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.010
a pitcher can't signal the
catcher what he's gonna pitch,

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.200
and so he shakes off or
nods to the various pitches

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.210
selected by the catcher,

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.120
and that's how they communicate.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.810
These are very different domains,

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.210
but they have an abstract
underlying structure.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:20.480
In one case, adjusting something
to a desired criterion,

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.330
but overshooting in one local area

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.380
and having to compensate in others.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.530
In another case, selecting something

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.460
by going through a set of alternatives

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.250
and rejecting each one

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.650
until the desired one comes up in the set.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:38.170
That process, which I'm
interested in as a psychologist,

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:41.580
I think also can apply to coming up

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.000
with new ideas as a scientist.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.560
So trying to understand, for example,

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.173
why violence is so prevalent
throughout human history.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.223
What's the common thread

00:26:53.223 --> 00:26:55.230
across so many different times and places?

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:56.650
Well, there's a problem

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.610
in game theory called the
prisoner's dilemma on how

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:04.400
what can be advantageous
for each rational player

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.940
in isolation works to the disadvantage

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:08.563
of two of them in combination.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.320
That's usually described in terms

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.880
of two partner in crime
who are being bribed

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.970
by the D.A. with different
prison sentences.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:23.470
But it also applies to the dilemma

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.035
of whether you should attack someone

00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:27.900
at the risk of being attacked by them

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.780
or both should lay down your arms.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.470
And that reminding led me to work out

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.470
a prisoner's dilemma-like matrix
for the dilemma of violence

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:43.060
and, conversely, how one can escape it

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:44.980
and strive toward peace.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.350
So I think that creativity
depends on deep analogies.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:53.350
- And what is involved in
going down one of these paths?

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:58.430
To what extent do you navigate
between mastery of a subject

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:03.280
and being superficial about a subject

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.970
that's not your main subject?
- Yeah.

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.400
I think you do have to immerse
yourself in another field.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.660
I don't believe...

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.440
There's some scientists who think,

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.440
I wanna approach a problem fresh,

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.870
and I don't wanna read about that field.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.930
I don't wanna be contaminated.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.890
I want my creativity to be unsullied.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.220
And I think that's a big mistake.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:28.360
My approach has always been,
read deeply in the other field.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.110
There are other people who
know a lot more than you do.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.920
Respect what they have done.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.740
You can see what blunders
they might have made

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.190
or other people have made.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.930
You can learn from their mistakes.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.770
And so I always try to
become an honorary member

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.500
of whatever field I'm writing in.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.420
Go to the conferences,
find out the gossip,

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.220
find out the standards of
status and competition,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.180
and what generates them.

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.320
It gives you more insight when
you actually read the field.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.490
So, yeah, I always...

00:28:56.751 --> 00:28:59.886
I think there is a big
danger in being a dilettante,

00:28:59.886 --> 00:29:01.380
and it should be resisted.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.990
- There's a, what shall we say?

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.030
A conflict, a dilemma, a
dilemma's the word I wanna use,

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:13.910
in your work in the sense that working

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.910
on particular problems in a
narrow field, say linguistics,

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.400
but then also moving to
address general topics.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.553
So you begin with language,

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.470
and dealing with irregular verbs.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.820
- Yes, right.
- And children.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.820
And you most recently write
a major tome on violence.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:47.670
So I'm curious about how
you've navigated this movement

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.330
from one end of the spectrum to the other,

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.980
and I believe you think both
works are very important

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.820
at getting at the problem
that you see as central,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.140
which is understanding human nature.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.360
- Yes, and human nature
is the common thread

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.320
between irregular verbs
and genocide. (chuckles)

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.770
At first glance wouldn't seem
to have a whole lot in common,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.810
but both of them are
products of the human mind.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.410
I spent a lot of my career
studying irregular verbs,

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.980
not just because of fascination
with linguistic detail,

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.350
but because I thought they were a good way

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.053
to get at cognitive architecture.

00:30:24.455 --> 00:30:26.980
What are the elementary
mental steps that go on

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.180
in the brain when you understand
and produce a sentence?

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.030
And my argument was that, if
you compare irregular verbs,

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.860
like bring brought, come came, make made,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.023
which don't follow a rule and
have to be just memorized,

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.500
compare them with regular forms,

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.243
like blog blogged, mosh moshed,

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:54.010
google googled, where they do
follow a rule and, moreover,

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.610
when a new word comes into
the language, like to google,

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.040
you don't have to go to the dictionary

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.480
to look up its past tense form.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.230
You just generate it by
a mental rule, add E-D.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.870
You're getting the two
components of language,

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.060
and you can argue two components
of mental life in general,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.060
that drive intelligence,

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.910
namely memory lookup
and online combination,

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.470
and they're equated for meaning,

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.040
two ways of talking about something

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.180
that happened in the past.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.980
They're almost the same
in terms of complexity,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.870
but they tap different, or so I argue,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.010
different cognitive systems.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.380
So it's a very particular phenomenon

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.490
that can be studied in a
lot of depth and richness,

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:38.210
but it has implications
for fundamental issues.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:40.140
Now the common denominator
between that and, say,

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:43.480
genocide is just that, is human nature,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.370
and the trajectory that took
me along there was as follows.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:49.530
I argued that, to understand language,

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:53.070
one of the things you have to
understand is the innate basis

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.340
that makes language acquisition possible,

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.260
an idea associated with Noam Chomsky,

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.000
although I wouldn't put
it the same way he does.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.660
But just learning requires
a learning mechanism.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.200
The learning mechanism has to be innate.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.110
To understand learning,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.440
you gotta understand the innate part.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.420
They're not dichotomous.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.760
The question, if we have a specialization

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.160
for acquiring language,

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.870
what other specializations
does the brain come with,

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.450
led me to how the mind works

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.090
and where I talked about
other components of the mind,

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.820
like the emotions, fear, disgust, love,

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.800
perception, depth, color, motion, shading,

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.970
reasoning, number, probability, shape,

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:36.090
other people's minds,
physical objects, and so on.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.600
And I tried to give a
kind of inventory of the,

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.473
or an anatomy of cognition.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.860
Well, then that led to
the question, a lot of:

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.660
Is there something dangerous or retrograde

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.710
or reactionary about
positing human nature?

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.830
If evolution gave the
mind a certain structure,

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.700
does that mean that it's hopeless to try

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.940
to make the world a better place

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.890
because people are wired

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:06.890
with ugly motives like jealousy
and greed and dominance?

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.080
And so hope for progress is futile

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.180
because people just screw
it up no matter what you do.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.860
It's human nature, we're built that way.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.710
And I got a lot of political pushback

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.370
at the idea of human
nature along those lines.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.580
Or, and that's kind of a
left wing kind of objection.

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.100
The right wing objection is: Well,

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.120
if you're saying that it's all machinery,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.360
it's all evolved neural circuitry,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.580
where does that leave the soul

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.320
and free will and responsibility?

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.460
And isn't it giving
people an excuse to act

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.601
in accord with Darwinian instincts?

00:33:42.601 --> 00:33:45.610
My adaptations made me do it,
my amygdala made me do it.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.620
And are you undercutting
all morality and decency

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.973
by pushing a biological
understanding of the mind?

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.820
So I dealt with that in a
book called The Blank Slate:

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.920
The Modern Denial of Human Nature,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.470
denying the premise that a belief

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.690
in human nature somehow
undercuts hopes for progress

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:06.980
or meaning or morality,

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.560
that, on the contrary, I
think a robust understanding

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.450
of human nature is a prerequisite

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:14.200
to making the world a better place.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:17.020
You've gotta look at what humans are like

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.743
in order to figure out what
could make them behave better.

00:34:19.743 --> 00:34:21.620
- And in that book, The Blank Slate,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:24.730
you really argue against people saying,

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:25.790
there's a blank slate,

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.380
and you can undertake all these programs

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.850
that will make them better.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.150
- That's right, so the
title, The Blank Slate,

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.630
was the title of the idea
I was arguing against,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.340
the idea that the mind has no structure,

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.840
that we are simply programmed
by parents, society,

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.113
culture, media images, and so on.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.650
And in The Blank Slate, I pointed out

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.170
that it's not just a question of

00:34:50.143 --> 00:34:52.440
kind of philosophical analysis

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.850
that human nature does not
logically imply fatalism

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.640
about the human condition,

00:34:58.640 --> 00:34:59.950
but you just open your eyes,

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.150
and you look at the human condition,

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.300
and you see that it
obviously has improved.

00:35:04.536 --> 00:35:07.950
We aren't involved in
constant tribal warfare

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.070
where women from one band
are abducted by another.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:14.530
We don't burn heretics at the stake

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.720
or break people on the wheel.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.250
We don't have legalized slavery.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.400
And I made that point in The Blank Slate,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.640
and then I reiterated it as
the answer to a question posed

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.580
on an online forum, edge.org,

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.500
where one year John Brockman
asked 100 scientists:

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:32.940
What are you optimistic about?

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.220
And I listed some of these observations.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:39.877
The Soviet empire vanished
without hardly any violence.

00:35:39.877 --> 00:35:41.840
Apartheid was dismantled,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.680
slavery abolished, human
sacrifice, and so on.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.970
Then I started to get when,
as soon as it was posted,

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.630
I got a flood of mail from scholars

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.760
in fields I was barely aware of,

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.790
saying, you know, there's
much more of an evidence

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.650
for a decline of violence
than you even realized.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.960
I got letters from people in your field,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.190
international studies, saying,

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.060
Well, you may not be aware that people

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.350
in international studies
have been shaking their heads

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.340
in disbelief over the
decline of great power war,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.930
that since World War II,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.320
the world's 800 pound
gorillas have stopped fighting

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.400
with each other, which they did

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.130
for half a simillimum before.

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.710
Another group that keeps track of war

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.220
on a year by year basis said,

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.000
Well, we plot war deaths,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.710
and here our curves go like that.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.950
I had a colleague in
psychology at Harvard who said,

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:32.280
Oh, you could have added that
rates of child abuse are down,

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.030
rates of spousal abuse are down,

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:36.713
approval of spanking is down.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:39.240
Historical criminologists said,

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.030
in every European country
for which data exist,

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:44.890
rates of homicide have gone
down over the centuries.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.270
I started thinking, this is amazing.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.750
There are all of these
curves that plot violence,

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.160
and they all look like that,

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.633
and no one knows about
it, and this matter!

00:36:57.322 --> 00:36:58.780
Is this such a thing as progress?

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.710
Is there such a thing as enlightenment?

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.550
Have the strivings of the human race

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.930
for the last few thousand
years made us better off

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:06.763
or worse off?

00:37:06.763 --> 00:37:08.600
It's hard to think of a more
fundamental question than that.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.710
And everyone has the wrong answer.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:12.370
Wrong in the sense that,

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:15.130
whenever you try to test it empirically,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.150
you see things are
getting better, not worse.

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.240
And contrary to the image
of the world projected

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.130
by journalism, which is there
are crisis after crisis,

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:26.600
and the world is going
to hell in a handcart.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.030
So I thought, first of all,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.730
having been privy to all of these data,

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.810
I should try to make them known.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:36.053
But more interestingly, as
a student of human nature,

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.650
how could I try to make sense

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.840
of all of these trends
going in the same direction?

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.700
First of all, why were
our ancestors so violent?

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.620
Why is the default in human life, I think,

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:51.040
some rate of violence that
today we would not accept?

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.610
And what did our ancestors
do to drive it down?

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.300
What are the degrees of freedom?

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.060
What's the plasticity in human behavior

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.020
that would allow a rate
of homicide to fall

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.850
by a factor of 50 over 800 years?

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:08.020
Or that would suddenly allow
people to stop going to war?

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.030
And so there was a
meaty scientific problem

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.670
as well as a phenomenon

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:15.170
that I thought should be better known.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:18.590
- Before we talk about some
of you conclusions there,

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.170
let's go back a minute 'cause I wanna cut

00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:24.860
into two insights that
come from your work,

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:29.480
which I gathered just reading your stuff,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.660
not doing it justice in
preparation for this interview.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.420
One is that neuroscience

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.110
and all the scanning
technology now enable us

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:45.640
to really see the physiological basis

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.230
or come to an understanding
of the physiological basis

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.240
behind the activity of the brain,

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.070
which begins to answer the question

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.740
of the mind/body dichotomy.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.340
That's a very important insight.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.270
- I think at the most global level

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.750
of understanding what the mind is,

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.700
certainly the fact that it's
implemented in brain tissue is

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.890
a indispensable part of the story.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:17.550
There's no, I don't think there's a soul.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.990
There's no free-floating
entity called the mind

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:24.920
that is anything other than
activity of in neural networks.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.640
On the other hand, in order
to understand human affairs,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.270
the level of brain physiology

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.790
and anatomy may not be
the most perspicuous one.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.570
It may not give you the
insight that you want,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.530
even though, ultimately,
that's where it all is.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.070
Sometimes you have to look at
a higher level of analysis,

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.413
at the content of ideas,

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:45.890
at the social networks
that propagate ideas,

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.850
and your answer may not be uncovered

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:50.000
by studies of neural networks,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.563
just as if you're criticizing a movie.

00:39:54.822 --> 00:39:55.830
You get your DVD,

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.660
and the movie is nothing but
the little pits in the DVD.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.907
But on the other hand, if I ask you,

00:40:00.907 --> 00:40:02.057
"Is this an original film?

00:40:02.057 --> 00:40:05.100
"Is it a witty film, is
it a hackneyed film?"

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.540
Putting the DVD under a microscope

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.024
and looking at the pits is
not gonna give you the answer.

00:40:09.024 --> 00:40:09.857
(Harry chuckling)

00:40:09.857 --> 00:40:12.130
Even though there's nothing
that isn't in those pits,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.423
but it's just not the most
enlightening way to study it.

00:40:16.423 --> 00:40:20.540
And so I think that brains
imaging experiments,

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.900
functional neuroimaging
are part of the story,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.750
but they make sense only to the extent

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.720
that you have an idea of
what the different systems

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.830
of the brain are designed to do

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.570
and what content they're processing,

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.050
not just whether they're on or off.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:40.050
- And when we look at a theme
that runs through your work,

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.200
in addition to the particulars,
which we just discussed,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.470
it's really about how the mind works

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.050
to really engage reality

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:54.050
and to preserve social
relations as they develop.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.260
That's sort of key.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.794
Is it not?
- Yeah.

00:40:57.794 --> 00:40:59.670
- In you're moving from language

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.120
to the study of violence, for example.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.373
- Right, so if I were
to step back and say,

00:41:05.691 --> 00:41:06.937
"What's the deal with homo sapiens?

00:41:06.937 --> 00:41:08.417
"What makes us what we are?

00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:11.340
"Why are we such a weird primate?"

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.830
I think it's a combination
of three major things,

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.070
one of them being, no how,

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:18.200
that we figure out how the world works

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.586
and we manipulate it to
our advantage with tools

00:41:20.586 --> 00:41:23.540
and other things to a much greater extent

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:25.450
than any other animal.

00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:26.386
We have language,

00:41:26.386 --> 00:41:29.170
so we can share the
fruits of our discoveries,

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.760
and we can coordinate our
behavior in large ensembles

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.210
by striking deals with each other.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.840
And we are social, we
cooperate with non-relatives,

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.920
very unusual in the animal kingdom.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.180
But we have that triad,

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.040
each one of which supports the other two,

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.740
and that's the starting point

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:50.560
for understanding our very odd species.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:54.420
From that, question like: How do we learn?

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.350
What is education for?

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.220
When do we get along,
when do we not get along?

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.110
What would allow us to get along better?

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:03.660
I think has to refer back
to our nature as a species,

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.710
including that triad.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.090
And by the way, it's because
of our capacity for no how,

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:11.050
for coming up with new ideas,

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:14.440
that believing in human nature
does not make you a fatalist.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.120
You aren't just stuck with the
way we've always done things,

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.310
not because of any magic,

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:21.800
not because any soul transcends
our biological limitations,

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.610
but because one of the bits

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.720
of our biology can crank out new ideas

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:31.120
by combining old ideas through
analogy and composition.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.210
And so the reason we're not stuck

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:34.500
with the way we've always done things is

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.420
that we can come up with new ideas,

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.890
and we can share them through language,

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.790
we can keep the ones that
work, tinker with them,

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.940
and that is kind of an avenue
towards improving our lot,

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.376
given the materials we have to work with.

00:42:47.376 --> 00:42:52.376
- As you've moved from language
to a study of violence,

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:56.680
one of your tools has been the extent

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.680
to which your writing is
so clear and lucid, I mean,

00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:05.530
especially the book on
violence is just a great read.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.040
Talk a little about that,

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.430
how writing has been an important tool,

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.330
and what you've learned about the brain

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:16.350
that helps you understand it's importance.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:20.290
- Yeah, so writing is itself
a topic that interests me

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:22.933
both because that's
one of the things I do,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.040
and I try to increase my readership

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.090
by writing in a clear and engaging way.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:30.130
But of course, it's
also part of the content

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.960
of what I study, namely
how language works.

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.090
And so I've always been interested in:

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.510
What are the processes
that I, as a writer,

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.210
and I, as a reader, go through

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:44.460
that make me resonate to
a well-crafted sentence

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.390
or stumble at a bloated
and turgid or opaque one?

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.780
In fact, I've combined those interests

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.380
in my next book called The Sense of Style,

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.730
which is a writing manual
but one that is based

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:01.450
in findings from cognitive
science and linguistics.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:02.640
Most style manuals...

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.620
By the way, one of my
favorite genres of literature.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.300
I love reading style manuals,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.870
and I have for many decades.
(Harry laughing)

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.820
But they are based
generally on the intuitions

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.440
and personal experience of
journalists and writers,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:18.263
and they have tended not to be systematic.

00:44:19.645 --> 00:44:21.180
The writers kind of have hunches,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.573
they have feelings, they have intuitions,

00:44:22.573 --> 00:44:25.150
they have the writerly ear.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.793
But can we do better and say,

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.920
what are the steps that take place

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.220
as a person reads a sentence,

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.060
such that some kinds of
sentences allow the whole process

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.063
to go smoothly and others gum it up?

00:44:40.393 --> 00:44:42.670
- And what are some of your findings?

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:44.530
Do you wanna share any
of those with you that?

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.900
- Sure.
- What in particular, yeah?

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.110
- Some of them are that,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.730
because writing is an unnatural act,

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:53.280
we evolved to speak, but
we didn't evolve to write.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.250
Therefore, one of the
first things you have

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.180
to do as a writer is imagine what kind

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.820
of situation you're pretending to be in,

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:05.620
that you're simulating as you write.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.670
Your reader is not physically present.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.490
They can't react with facial expressions.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.750
They can't furrow their brows.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:13.927
They can't interrupt you and say,

00:45:13.927 --> 00:45:15.400
"What the hell does that mean?"

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.060
So how do you, what social
situation should you simulate

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.320
in order to write clearly?

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.340
That's the first step,

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:25.063
and I think that the answer to that is,

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.980
you are pointing to something in the world

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.770
that you want your reader to see,

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.040
and you're giving them
an unobstructed view.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:34.980
Now that's an image

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.900
of what you're pretending
to do as you write,

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.960
the conversation you're
pretending to have.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.390
And a lot of concrete bits of
writerly advice all fall out

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.200
of that central image of:

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.950
What are you pretending to simulate?

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.900
Things like avoiding
a lot of slang posting

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:52.870
and metadiscourse.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.050
Now that we've analyzed this,

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.120
I'm gonna discuss the following 17 points.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.010
Academics do that, it bogs
down academic writing.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.220
It's not what you would do

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:02.440
if you were having a conversation

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:03.800
about something in the world.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.200
And so referring back to
that central image allows you

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.490
to deduce one of these guidelines

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:12.193
for writing as a consequence.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.080
A second bit is to overcome
the curse of knowledge.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.810
The curse of knowledge is the inability

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.160
that we all have to imagine

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.290
what it's like not to know
something that we do know.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.010
Once you know something, it
just seems second nature.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.370
You just magically project your
knowledge to everyone else,

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.010
and you don't realize that other people,

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.060
what's obvious to you
isn't obvious to them.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:41.060
And an enormous amount of
opaque writing is that way

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.510
because the writer didn't stop
to think: What does someone

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.190
who doesn't know my
field start out thinking?

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.100
Third is to understand
the mechanics of syntax,

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.750
that these are the tools that
writers have to work with,

00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:59.960
and in any craft, you've
gotta understand your tools.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.950
So just knowing what is English syntax.

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:05.270
What does it do, how does it work?

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:06.230
How can it work poorly?

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.490
So that's another dimension.

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.260
And finally: What do you do about rules

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.290
of correct and incorrect usage?

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.980
Don't dangle your participles.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.160
Don't split your infinitives.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.630
No prepositions at the end of a sentence.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.313
Don't use, confuse mitigate and militate.

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:25.310
The vast majority of commentary

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.140
about writing focuses on correct usage,

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:31.200
which I actually think is
the least important part

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.033
of good writing,

00:47:32.033 --> 00:47:35.210
but it is something that
writer's have to keep in mind.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:38.770
And it turns out that,
if you do the scholarship

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.130
on where these rules came from,

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:42.920
you realize that a lot of
them are really pointless

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:44.000
and can be blown off.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.700
We'll get splitting infinitives,

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.480
ending a sentence with a
preposition, it's nonsense.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:50.010
It doesn't mean you
should flaunt all rules.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.870
Some of them really do enhance clarity.

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:54.330
Some of them mesh with the expectations

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.080
of the literate reader and
they ought to be followed.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.010
But one should, instead of taking rules

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:02.280
of correct usage as the 10 Commandments,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.880
they're just inerrant,

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.010
you can subject them to
criticism and scholarship

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:07.867
and say, "Well, does
this rule really help,

00:48:07.867 --> 00:48:10.797
"or should we just blow it off?"

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.550
- Let's talk a little
about the violence book.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:17.330
I mean, it's a massive undertaking.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:22.330
But what's interesting in
your conclusion, in a way,

00:48:25.036 --> 00:48:29.730
the struggle is about the
better angels within us,

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.997
and the darker, what is the term you use?

00:48:33.997 --> 00:48:35.110
- And the inner demons?

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.050
- [Harry] The inner demons.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.940
- Just keeping, not
mixing metaphors, yeah.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.960
- Which are not a...

00:48:43.384 --> 00:48:46.920
It's not a surprising analysis
coming from a psychologist.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.350
But what is really interesting is,

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:53.840
in this book, you move to
the more general phenomena

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.083
that determines the
influences which wins out,

00:48:58.083 --> 00:49:01.840
that that is the inner
demons or the inner angels.

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.477
Talk a little about that--
- Yeah.

00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:04.800
- And what you conclude

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.900
because for a reader who's
looked at all of your work,

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.305
is that something of a surprise,

00:49:12.305 --> 00:49:15.263
that you're looking at
the big picture there?

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:18.663
- Well, I hope not,
'cause indeed, I think,

00:49:19.938 --> 00:49:22.360
in trying to understand
the decline of violence,

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.020
there are two parts of the phenomenon

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.270
that need to be explained.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:28.980
One of them is the violence,
and the other is the decline.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.240
So both are facts, at least so I argue.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.030
I spend many pages in
the book and many graphs,

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.800
first persuading the
reader that it is a fact,

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.450
that violence really has gone down,

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.890
and then turn to the question of why.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:42.180
Well, why?

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:47.180
It can't be that we just have
this inner thirst for blood

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.340
that periodically has to be slaked.

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:53.400
Violence is not like hunger or thirst

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.763
or the need for sex or the need for sleep.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:00.310
Clearly, it is adjusted by circumstances,

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:01.620
and the reason it can be adjusted is

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:03.720
that whatever violent urges we have,

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:05.310
what I call the inner demons,

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:07.980
things like urge for dominance,

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.640
thirst for revenge,
tendency towards sadism,

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.853
sheer exploitation, using
someone as a means to an end,

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.540
that's not all there is in human nature.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:19.990
Human nature is complex.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:24.560
And together with these various
temptations toward violence,

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.400
we have a number of things
that inhibit us from violence.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.910
We've got self-control,
these massive circuits

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:31.600
in the frontal lobe of the brain

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:36.070
that can count to 10, hold your horses,

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:38.180
save your money for a rainy day,

00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:42.530
and make us think twice before
lashing out in violence.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.600
There's empathy.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.930
Under certain circumstance,

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.250
we feel other people's pain.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.890
We don't wanna hurt them.

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:50.600
We wanna prevent them from suffering.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.040
There are norms, moral norms.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.430
There are certain things you just don't do

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.970
if you wanna be considered
a decent person.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:58.150
There's reason.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.500
Can we treat violence as
a problem to be solved,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:05.030
the same way we solve problems
like disease and hunger?

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:07.770
And what changes over
the balance of history,

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:10.810
what allows, over the course
of history, is the balance

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.340
between the inner demons
and the better angels,

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:16.470
and that's where societal, historical,

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:18.700
institutional changes can come in.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.690
You can have institutions like government

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:24.690
that penalize impulsive
violence or predatory violence,

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:28.220
and since we do take in
information about the environment,

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.530
if we think that the police
are gonna haul us off to jail

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.060
if we stab someone over a parking space,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.880
maybe we'll think twice
about stabbing someone

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.430
over a parking space.

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:41.950
If norms change so that lashing out

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.330
when you're insulted is no
longer a sign of manliness

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:46.470
but now is a sign of boorishness,

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:51.050
then people will, are more
likely to adhere to that norm.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.700
If we, in general, are more
enlightened and educated,

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.410
and we, no matter how much we are fired up

00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.850
by patriotism and jingoism, we think,

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.820
well, gee, the other side is, too,

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:02.960
and our ancestors were,

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.270
and it got them into
a whole lot a trouble,

00:52:04.270 --> 00:52:05.250
like in World War I.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.480
Maybe we should think
twice, stand back, reflect,

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:10.230
and figure out how to
get out of this pickle

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:12.790
instead of pushing it
through to the bitter end.

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:14.140
Then our cognitive processes

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:17.780
of reason can pull us away from violence.

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.730
So the three components,
what makes us violent,

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:25.090
what makes us nonviolent,
what changes in our society

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.340
to favor the latter over the former,

00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.667
that's the way I tell the story.

00:52:29.667 --> 00:52:32.100
- A couple of final questions.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:37.100
One is, where do you see
the big breakthrough coming

00:52:37.588 --> 00:52:39.363
in our understanding of the brain?

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:42.110
- I don't know if there'll
be one big breakthrough,

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:42.943
or at least if there is,

00:52:42.943 --> 00:52:45.730
I'm probably the last one
who'll be able to predict it.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:49.853
I think that ideas from many
sources have to be combined.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.030
What I find most exciting
is the breaking down

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.960
of the barriers between
traditional domains

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.860
of humanistic scholarship, like history,

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:01.920
like jurisprudence, like philosophy,

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.590
like linguistics and philology,

00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:08.440
even music and literature and art,

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.860
and bringing it together

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:13.583
with our increasing
understanding of human nature.

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.410
What can our knowledge of motives,

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.790
like dominance and revenge,

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.910
tell us about the conduct
of international relations?

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:25.170
How can our understanding
of visual cognition

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.710
lead to insight about
sculpture and painting?

00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:33.490
How does auditory analysis mesh

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.200
with our understanding of music?

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.180
Can there be understandings of poetics

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.930
and literary style that are
informed by linguistics?

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.730
Now many scholars in the
humanities just have a hissy fit

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:45.630
when they hear about this.

00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:47.800
They think it's a
reductionist, scientistic,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.340
determinist, positivist, atavist,

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:53.760
and I think that attitude
is sealing the doom

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.770
of the humanities.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.670
I think there're tremendous opportunities

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.160
for mutual benefit on each side,

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.060
and I hope that the
universities will be a place

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.590
in which these opportunities
for insight are explored.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.620
- And one final question.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:12.620
If students watching this interview were

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:17.403
to find insight from your
intellectual journey,

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.210
what should they learn from your journey?

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:25.780
And how would you advise them
to prepare for the future?

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.020
- Certainty to...

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.380
I'm giving some somewhat
contradictory advice.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.730
One of them, one piece
dealing with the realities

00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:36.680
of the academic scene as it exists,

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.120
the other of holding out
hope for changing it.

00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.350
So the reality is disciplines are here.

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.870
You wanna get employed,
you wanna get tenure,

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.099
respect the disciplines.

00:54:48.099 --> 00:54:48.932
On the other hand,

00:54:48.932 --> 00:54:50.470
I think that's a deplorable
state of affairs,

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:51.630
though it is the reality,

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:53.640
and is if you wanna play your part

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.350
in trying to overcome
this unfortunate legacy,

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.010
immerse yourself in other disciplines,

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:03.950
Be interested in topics, ideas, problems,

00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:07.493
phenomena not in academic guilds.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.450
Negotiating those two, I mean,

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.100
that's one of the great
things about tenure.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.450
Once you have tenure, it
does give you the freedom

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:18.473
to peer into what's going on
in the next guy's discipline.

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:22.080
- Well, on that note,
Steven, I wanna thank you

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.240
for taking time to be on our program.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.270
It was a very insightful discussion,

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:31.430
and I think it's gonna lead
a lot a people to go out

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:33.657
and read some of your
books if they haven't.

00:55:33.657 --> 00:55:35.410
- (chuckles softly) Well,
thanks very much, Harry.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:37.210
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.975
for this conversation with history.

00:55:39.975 --> 00:55:43.642
(uptempo synthesizer music)
