REBECCA REIZNER: Hi, I'm
Rebecca Reizner with Google

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:10.014
from the Mountain View office.

00:00:10.014 --> 00:00:11.772
I'm here at Epcot
in Orlando, Florida,

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:14.350
to show Tech Sassy Girlz
some interesting things

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.084
about coding.

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:17.250
ASHLEY SMITH: We wanted to
bring in a group of girls

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.047
and really teach them the
beginning of the app experience

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:21.880
all the way to this is
how you build an app,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.255
and here's how
you begin to code.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:24.930
JACKIE LAU: You're
going to help Pegman

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.440
navigate to different
parts of the world.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.690
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We had to
program this little person

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.090
to go to different
destinations, and you

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.557
had to put things on a loop.

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:34.545
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Now he has
to get to his destination,

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:35.042
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: OK.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:35.540
OK.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.498
FEMALE SPEAKER 4: Oh, I
forgot to move forward.

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:39.400
JAMES MCGILL: At Google,
we love creativity,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.920
and we love passion.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.850
My Disney Experience
app is a great example

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.080
of what you can do with a
little bit of creativity

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.280
to make sure that the
visitors to the parks

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.971
have all the information that
they need at their fingertips.

00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:52.720
DAN SOTO: On the My
Disney Experience app,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.150
you have the ability to
plan all types of things

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.320
with your vacation.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.850
You could make
FastPass+ selections.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.724
MALE SPEAKER 1: The
MagicBand, think about it

00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:04.780
as kind of like a license plate
on a car-- context awareness,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.364
knowing a guest
as an individual.

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:08.030
ASHLEY SMITH: Women
are underrepresented

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.540
in engineering, science,
math, and technology,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.650
so we want to teach them
that technology is cool.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.369
It's fun.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.910
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: I think it's
good because when I get older,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.632
it can become a good career.

00:01:17.632 --> 00:01:19.090
FEMALE SPEAKER 6:
When I get older,

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.180
I plan on being an engineer.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.890
I'm leaning towards aerospace
because that's my passion.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.460
DAN SOTO: Here at Disney, we
love to celebrate moments,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.220
and today we're also
here to celebrate

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.246
your passion for science,
technology, engineering, math.

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:35.620
FEMALE SPEAKER 7:
Not many people

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.160
get to experience what
we experienced today.
