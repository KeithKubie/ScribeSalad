&gt;&gt;Hi, I'm Chris O'Neal, and we're
going to do a brief tour of YouTube.

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:08.376
I think of YouTube as, like,
a giant video flea market.

00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:11.756
So lots of cool finds mixed
in with a lot of crazy junk.

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:14.976
From a teacher's standpoint,
it's a treasure trove of videos,

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.986
so let's take a quick tour.

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:23.056
We're going to start off by going to
YouTube.com, and on the main page,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.756
what you'll find is just a variety
of most popular clips of the day,

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:28.356
the most talked about
clip of the week.

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:31.986
Just like you wouldn't set your
students free on a field trip,

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:34.066
though, without giving them
some guidance ahead of time,

00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:37.286
you probably shouldn't sit
students down in front of YouTube,

00:00:37.286 --> 00:00:38.946
and have them search
aimlessly, either.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.026
Whatever your thoughts on YouTube
may be, it makes the most sense

00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:43.946
to give age appropriate
guidance to your kids.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:46.796
There's certainly a lot to learn
from watching YouTube videos.

00:00:47.156 --> 00:00:49.846
Some of the content is just
not appropriate for all ages.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.346
I'm going to start off by doing
the most common thing on YouTube,

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:54.786
which is just a basic search.

00:00:55.016 --> 00:00:57.146
I'm going to click here,
and type, life cycle,

00:00:57.146 --> 00:00:59.636
since that's something a
lot of teachers look for.

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.666
What you'll find are
thousands of video returns.

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.316
It tells me right here, 9,400 videos
have been uploaded to YouTube,

00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:08.766
that use the words, life cycle.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:12.966
I got lucky, in that the first
clip I click on right here,

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:15.276
will start playing automatically.

00:01:15.276 --> 00:01:18.256
I'm going to pause it, is
actually about the life cycle

00:01:18.256 --> 00:01:20.836
of the lunar moth, so that's
perfect for what I'm looking for.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.586
You'll find that searching
ahead of time is the key

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:25.896
to making efficient use of
YouTube in the classroom.

00:01:26.756 --> 00:01:28.876
So now that I've found a
great video I'd like to use,

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:31.316
I can either show it right away--
I'm just going to click play,

00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:33.556
to show the video, or I
can embed it to show it

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:35.256
in my own website, blog or wiki.

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.956
If you look to the right of the
video, you'll see a brief description

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:42.386
of the video, which is provided by
the person who uploaded this video.

00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:46.586
Directly beneath the description
is the URL for this video,

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:49.816
so I can e-mail this URL to someone
else, and let them watch the video.

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.056
Directly beneath that
is an embed section.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:58.006
If I click in that white
horizontal bar, I get embed code,

00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:01.466
which means I can copy that text,
and paste it into a wiki or a blog,

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:06.646
or website, and actually embed the
video directly into my own website.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:10.366
Beneath this embed code section
are a few options you'll want

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:11.166
to pay attention to.

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:14.746
The first box that says,
include related videos,

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.846
I always uncheck that box.

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:21.236
If you don't uncheck that box, and
you embed your video, you'll find,

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:25.286
to the side, some extra videos
that YouTube suggests, which may,

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:27.846
or may not be appropriate for what
you want to share with your children.

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:29.936
So I uncheck this box.

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.466
I choose a size that I
like, and then I click back

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:37.236
up in the embed code section,
right click, and copy.

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:43.416
Now I simply go to my wiki or
blog, and paste in that text.

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:45.326
You can create your
own account on YouTube

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:46.936
which allows you to save favorites.

00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:48.436
I'm logged in right now.

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:52.106
I can look at my videos, my
favorites, I can even make playlists.

00:02:52.236 --> 00:02:55.136
I can subscribe to specific
sections of YouTube,

00:02:55.906 --> 00:02:59.736
specific users or even
tag or keywords.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.496
I can also be alerted when
users I like upload new videos.

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.046
The newest section to YouTube

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:11.326
that I think teachers
like, is YouTube.com/edu.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.926
That's an education
section of YouTube,

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.826
built specifically for educators.

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:18.106
The videos uploaded
in the section are

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.036
from universities and school systems.

00:03:21.126 --> 00:03:24.516
Each of these videos is provided
with the notion that they can be

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:25.666
of some help to teachers.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:29.766
So the users who create these videos
agree that all videos uploaded

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:32.526
to this specific section,
have education in mind.

00:03:34.086 --> 00:03:36.146
Last, but most certainly not least,

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:38.166
you can upload your
own videos to YouTube.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.216
Whether you've shot
vacation video footage,

00:03:41.216 --> 00:03:43.966
or you've even staged a video,
because you know it will be helpful

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:46.466
to other teachers, it's a
great place to share video.

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.936
Not only do you get to
catalogue your own video

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:51.876
for your specific classrooms, but
other people around the world get

00:03:51.876 --> 00:03:53.296
to make use of your video as well.

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:58.976
