00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's the second one--minus the partial derivative of pressure with respect to x.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
If you look closely into what we've got here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(p₁ - p₂) / Δx--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
if this was (p₂ - p₁) / Δx, we would get the derivative,

00:00:16.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but it's the negative of it.
