This episode of "Shots
of Awe" is brought to you

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.010
by the Toyota Prius.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.494
Let's lead the way.

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:09.976
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.840
People talk a lot these
days about our increasingly

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.580
fragmented lives.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.350
You know we're living
our lives online.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.310
And somehow, it's not real.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.440
It's not accurate.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.390
We're not really exchanging
intimacies on Facebook

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.452
and Twitter is
what people argue.

00:00:36.452 --> 00:00:37.910
But there's a term
out there that I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.618
found much more
interesting that actually

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.330
says, "look, our
exchanges may not

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.720
be the same as in
the meet space,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.310
but they're still
real exchanges."

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.730
And I think the term used
was "ambient intimacy."

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.090
That seeing bits and pieces
of your friends' and family's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.230
digital lives, seeing
snippets of a photograph,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.120
seeing an announcement of a
birthday, seeing the stuff

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.077
that they're posting
does give you

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:04.569
a sort of perspective, a sort
of taste of where they're at.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.960
You are getting an accurate
picture, an accurate snapshot,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.710
an accurate exchange
of where this person is

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.590
at in their lives.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.490
There's nothing
inauthentic about

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.610
this interpersonal exchange
that's occurring all the time.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.990
In other words, it's
just another space

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.990
for communication.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.110
It's not better or worse,
except for the fact

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.440
that it does collapse geography.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.680
It gets rid of the limitations
of time, space, and distance,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.810
and allows us to expand
the parameters of what

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.970
we can sample.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.560
Right.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.120
The internet is an
infinite tapas bar.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.994
And so maybe we're not having
the full meal of just one

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:43.410
thing anymore, but
we're certainly

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.120
expanding our horizons and
expanding our possibility

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.854
space, and expanding the mind
spaces where we can travel to.

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.770
This indictment of
technology, this indictment

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.090
of transformation of social
media I think a lot of times

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.780
comes from a place of fear
rather than a place of actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.040
appreciating transformation,
and evolution,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.180
and how we communicate.
