00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.410
Pulling down all the data
will reduce latency

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.990
and maximize
the battery efficiency.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.960
But it's unlikely the user
is going to read every article,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.040
so you'd just be wasting
a lot of bandwidth.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.156
Downloading all the articles
without pictures,

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.047
actually doesn't
improve our efficiency

00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:15.058
if you're just downloading
the front page,

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.119
because you'll still need
to activate the radio

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.193
to download those pictures 
whenever an article is selected.

00:00:20.193 --> 00:00:22.546
The right answer is to get
the headlines and the articles

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.150
linked to from that front page, 
because they're the most likely

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.030
to be read as the user starts
browsing through the app.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.330
You can then incrementally
download more articles

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.340
each time the user moves into an area
you haven't prefetched for yet.
