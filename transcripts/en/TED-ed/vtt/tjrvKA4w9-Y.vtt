00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.250
His face is recognized all over the world.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.500
The young medical student
who became a revolutionary icon.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.647
But was Che Guevara 
a heroic champion of the poor

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:21.622
or a ruthless warlord 
who left a legacy of repression?

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:22.745
Order, order.

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:25.108
Hey, where have I seen that guy before?

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:29.251
Ahem, your Honor, this is Ernesto Che Guevara.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:30.757
In the early 1950s,

00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:35.063
he left behind a privileged life 
as a medical student in Argentina

00:00:35.063 --> 00:00:38.223
to travel through rural Latin America.

00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:41.573
The poverty and misery he witnessed
convinced him that saving lives

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:44.123
required more than medicine.

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:45.494
So he became a terrorist

00:00:45.494 --> 00:00:48.814
seeking to violently overthrow 
the region's governments.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.113
What?

00:00:50.113 --> 00:00:52.807
The region's governments 
were brutal oligarchies.

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:54.982
Colonialism may have formally ended,

00:00:54.982 --> 00:00:57.713
but elites still controlled 
all the wealth.

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:02.500
American corporations bought up land
originally seized from indigenous people

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.975
and used it for profit and export,

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:09.623
even keeping most of it uncultivated
while locals starved.

00:01:09.623 --> 00:01:11.044
Couldn't they vote to change that?

00:01:11.044 --> 00:01:12.413
Oh, they tried, your Honor.

00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:15.362
In 1953, Che came to Guatemala

00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:19.142
under the democratically-elected 
government of President Árbenz.

00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:22.034
Árbenz passed reforms to redistribute

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:25.312
some of this uncultivated 
land back to the people

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:27.635
while compensating the landowners.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.125
But he was overthrown 
in a CIA-sponsored coup.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.475
The military was protecting against
the seizure of private property

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.437
and communist takeover.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:38.786
They were protecting corporate profits

00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:41.544
and Che saw that they would use
the fear of communism

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:45.046
to overthrow any government
that threatened those profits.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:48.366
So he took the lessons of Guatemala
with him to Mexico.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.235
There, he met exiled Cuban revolutionaries

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:53.893
and decided to help them 
liberate their country.

00:01:53.893 --> 00:01:58.414
You mean help Fidel Castro 
turn a vibrant Cuba into a dictatorship.

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:01.586
Dictatorship was what Cuba 
had before the revolution.

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:05.716
Fulgencio Batista was a tyrant
who came to power in a military coup.

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:09.266
He turned Havana into a luxury playground
for foreigners

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:15.346
while keeping Cubans mired in poverty and
killing thousands in police crackdowns.

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:17.854
Even President Kennedy called it
the worst example

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:23.566
of "economic colonization, humiliation,
and exploitation in the world."

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.556
Whatever Batista's faults,

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:29.867
it can't compare to the totalitarian
nightmare Castro would create.

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:35.037
Forced labor camps, torture of prisoners,
no freedom to speak or to leave.

00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:38.178
But this isn't the trial 
of Fidel Castro, is it?

00:02:38.178 --> 00:02:42.337
Che Guevara was instrumental in helping
Castro seize power.

00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:44.255
As a commander in his guerilla army,

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:48.407
he unleashed a reign of terror
across the countryside,

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:51.807
killing any suspected spies or dissenters.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:55.017
He also helped peasants build
health clinics and schools,

00:02:55.017 --> 00:02:56.208
taught them to read,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.318
and even recited poetry to them.

00:02:58.318 --> 00:03:01.848
His harsh discipline was necessary
against a much stronger enemy

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:06.838
who didn't hesitate to burn entire
villages suspected of aiding the rebels.

00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:09.983
Let's not forget that the new regime
held mass executions

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.849
and killed hundreds 
of people without trial

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.919
as soon as they took power in 1959.

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.689
The executed were officials
and collaborators

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.489
who had tormented 
the masses under Batista.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.259
The people supported 
this revolutionary justice.

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.438
Which people?

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:29.949
An angry mob crying for blood
does not a democracy make.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.789
And that's not even mentioning
the forced labor camps,

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:34.339
arbitrary arrests,

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:39.591
and repression of LGBT people
that continued long after the revolution.

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.760
There's a reason people kept
risking their lives to flee,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.470
often with nothing but the clothes
on their backs.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.530
So was that all this Che brought to Cuba?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.399
Just another violent dictatorship?

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:50.670
Not at all.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.592
He oversaw land redistribution,

00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:54.747
helped established universal education,

00:03:54.747 --> 00:04:01.020
and organized volunteer literacy brigades
that raised Cuba's literacy rate to 96%,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.291
still one of the highest in the world.

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:07.341
Which allowed the government to control
what information everyone received.

00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:10.760
Guevara's idealistic incompetence
as Finance Minister

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.091
caused massive drops in productivity

00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:18.022
when he replaced worker pay raises
with moral certificates.

00:04:18.022 --> 00:04:19.600
He suppressed all press freedom,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.142
declaring that newspapers 
were instruments of the oligarchy.

00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:27.902
And it was he who urged Castro
to host Soviet nuclear weapons,

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.230
leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.152
that brought the world
to the brink of destruction.

00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:35.762
He was a leader, not a bureaucrat.

00:04:35.762 --> 00:04:38.983
That's why he eventually left to spread
the revolution abroad.

00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:40.532
Which didn't go well.

00:04:40.532 --> 00:04:42.793
He failed to rally rebels in the Congo

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:45.872
and went to Bolivia 
even when the Soviets disapproved.

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:48.287
The Bolivian Government, 
with the help of the CIA,

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:53.123
was able to capture and neutralize
this terrorist in 1967,

00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:55.012
before he could do much damage.

00:04:55.012 --> 00:04:58.343
While doing plenty of damage themselves
in the process.

00:04:58.343 --> 00:04:59.651
So that was the end of it?

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:03.074
Not at all. As Che said, 
the revolution is immortal.

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:06.188
He was publicly mourned in cities
all over the world.

00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:08.536
Not by the Cubans who managed to escape.

00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:12.663
And his story would inspire 
young activists for generations to come.

00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:18.123
Ha. A trendy symbol of rebellion for those
who never had to live under his regime.

00:05:18.123 --> 00:05:20.774
Symbols of revolution 
may become commodified,

00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:24.045
but the idea of a more just world remains.

00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.204
Maybe, but I'm not sharing my coffee.

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:32.104
Che Guevara was captured and
executed by government forces in Bolivia.

00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:35.264
His remains would not be found
for another 30 years.

00:05:35.264 --> 00:05:39.692
But did he die a hero 
or had he already become a villain?

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:44.315
And should revolutions be judged
by their ideals or their outcomes?

00:05:44.315 --> 00:05:49.134
These are the questions we face
when we put history on trial.
