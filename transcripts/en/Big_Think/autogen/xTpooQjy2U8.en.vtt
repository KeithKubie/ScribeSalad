00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879
symmetrical features because what
 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.210
symmetrical features because what
happens is that if you have an

happens is that if you have an
 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.579
happens is that if you have an

infectious disease when you're young it
 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.640
infectious disease when you're young it
can derail development and that's part

of the reason why people's features may
 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.899
of the reason why people's features may
be a little bit more asymmetric if

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909
be a little bit more asymmetric if
 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.560

they have very different immune systems
from ourselves and the way it works is

correlates with how your immune system
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.950
correlates with how your immune system
functions and we all very individually

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960
functions and we all very individually

you might lose one child but you're not
going to lose all your children because

extension of parasitic manipulation even

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509
extension of parasitic manipulation even
 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.510
extension of parasitic manipulation even
though I don't think that most gut

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520
though I don't think that most gut
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.550
though I don't think that most gut
bacteria are parasite so in fact I would

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560
bacteria are parasite so in fact I would
 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.119
bacteria are parasite so in fact I would
call them symbiotic manipulators and the

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129
call them symbiotic manipulators and the
 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.309
call them symbiotic manipulators and the
reason I'm so interested in them is

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
reason I'm so interested in them is
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.270
reason I'm so interested in them is
because

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280
because
 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.150
because
they do manipulate behavior you know in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160
they do manipulate behavior you know in
 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.720
they do manipulate behavior you know in
fashion not totally unlike parasitic

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
fashion not totally unlike parasitic
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.250
fashion not totally unlike parasitic
manipulators and the way they're able to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
manipulators and the way they're able to
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.130
manipulators and the way they're able to
do this is there's over a thousand

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140
do this is there's over a thousand
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.350
do this is there's over a thousand
different species of bacteria that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360
different species of bacteria that
 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.699
different species of bacteria that
inhabit our guts and there are species

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709
inhabit our guts and there are species
 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.420
inhabit our guts and there are species
that turn out basically every single

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
that turn out basically every single
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.350
that turn out basically every single
neurotransmitter that you have in your

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
neurotransmitter that you have in your
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.130
neurotransmitter that you have in your
brain and they churn out hormones so

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140
brain and they churn out hormones so
 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.190
brain and they churn out hormones so
stress hormones and hormones that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200
stress hormones and hormones that
 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.870
stress hormones and hormones that
regulate our appetite and energy levels

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880
regulate our appetite and energy levels
 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.080
regulate our appetite and energy levels
so the research suggests that the the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
so the research suggests that the the
 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.270
so the research suggests that the the
bacteria in our gut influence everything

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
bacteria in our gut influence everything
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.009
bacteria in our gut influence everything

look exploring what fecal implants if if

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
look exploring what fecal implants if if
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.430
look exploring what fecal implants if if
you transplant feces from one person to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440
you transplant feces from one person to
 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.819
you transplant feces from one person to
another

there's looking to see what some of the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
there's looking to see what some of the
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.590
there's looking to see what some of the
effects are some examples would be there

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600
effects are some examples would be there
 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.240
effects are some examples would be there
been efforts to show that by

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250
been efforts to show that by
 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.569
been efforts to show that by
transplanting feces from one person to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579
transplanting feces from one person to
 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.690
transplanting feces from one person to
another that you may even be able to

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
another that you may even be able to
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.650
another that you may even be able to
influence their appetite so far I don't

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
influence their appetite so far I don't
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.410
influence their appetite so far I don't
think they've had too much success there

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420
think they've had too much success there
 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.050
think they've had too much success there
are one or two examples though of for

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
are one or two examples though of for
 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.660
are one or two examples though of for
example a woman who was getting the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670
example a woman who was getting the
 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.039
example a woman who was getting the
fecal transplant actually to treat a

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049
fecal transplant actually to treat a
 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.550
fecal transplant actually to treat a
digestive disease and it's called

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560
digestive disease and it's called
 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.880
digestive disease and it's called
Clostridium difficile so they have shown

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890
Clostridium difficile so they have shown
 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.440
Clostridium difficile so they have shown
by the way the fecal transplant is very

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450
by the way the fecal transplant is very
 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.030
by the way the fecal transplant is very
effective in treating some of these

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040
effective in treating some of these
 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.849
effective in treating some of these
digestive disorders and this particular

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859
digestive disorders and this particular
 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.180
digestive disorders and this particular
woman wanted to get the the fecal donor

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190
woman wanted to get the the fecal donor
 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.039
woman wanted to get the the fecal donor
she wanted to be her daughter who was

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049
she wanted to be her daughter who was
 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.080
she wanted to be her daughter who was
then around 15 or 16 years of age and

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090
then around 15 or 16 years of age and
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.880
then around 15 or 16 years of age and
within a short period of time after

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890
within a short period of time after
 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.190
within a short period of time after
getting the fecal transplant the mother

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200
getting the fecal transplant the mother
 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.630
getting the fecal transplant the mother
suddenly for the first time in her life

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640
suddenly for the first time in her life
 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.300
suddenly for the first time in her life
was starting to become overweight and

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310
was starting to become overweight and
 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.490
was starting to become overweight and
she actually started ventually became

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500
she actually started ventually became
 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.620
she actually started ventually became
obese and she was convinced it was

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630
obese and she was convinced it was
 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.540
obese and she was convinced it was
related to the transplant and within

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
related to the transplant and within
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.180
related to the transplant and within
just a year two of her daughter being

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190
just a year two of her daughter being
 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.080
just a year two of her daughter being
the donor the daughter became obese so

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090
the donor the daughter became obese so
 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.980
the donor the daughter became obese so
there is the findings like that

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990
there is the findings like that
 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.130

then concentrate them in a capsule they

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010
then concentrate them in a capsule they
 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.160

call them crap stools so they're hoping
 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.870
call them crap stools so they're hoping
that they'll be able to use these

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880
that they'll be able to use these
 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.890
that they'll be able to use these
capsules in instead of you know getting

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900
capsules in instead of you know getting
 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.680
capsules in instead of you know getting
an actual you know fecal transplant

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690
an actual you know fecal transplant
 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.690
an actual you know fecal transplant
which they do that using that instrument

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700
which they do that using that instrument
 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.520
which they do that using that instrument
like that they used to do a colonoscopy

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530
like that they used to do a colonoscopy
