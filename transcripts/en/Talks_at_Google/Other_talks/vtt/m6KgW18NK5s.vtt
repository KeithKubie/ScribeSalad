FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello everyone
and thank you for coming.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.650
I'm excited to introduce Jeanne
Sauvage of "Gluten-Free Baking

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.587
for the Holidays."

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:10.920
And thank you Jeanne for coming.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.850
JEANNE SAUVAGE: So, thank
you very much for having me.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm honored to be here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me get a sense of who here
is gluten free themselves.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.626
OK it looks like
a good majority.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:27.000
And how many people
are here just

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.060
because either their friends
and family are gluten free,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.409
or they're just
interested in the topic?

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.050
OK.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.180
Great, thank you for coming.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.900
So I wrote a book
on-- or a cookbook--

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.180
on gluten-free baking.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.120
Specifically, gluten free
baking for the holidays.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.780
And I call my journey to getting
to this point of the road

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.630
to deliciousness.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.155
So because one of
my goals with gluten

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.900
free baking is to make things
that taste and feel good.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.800
There's no point in baking
if it's gross, really.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.787
So I wanted to give you
a little taste of why

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:05.370
wrote a book about
gluten free baking.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.890
How I got here.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.550
And so to give you a
little bit of my history

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.110
I was diagnosed as
gluten intolerant

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.400
after the birth of
my daughter in 2000.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.330
And apparently
that's very common.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.410
Autoimmune disorders are often
triggered by a body trauma.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.450
And a body trauma can be
something like pregnancy,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.040
childbirth, a very bad
cold, a car accident.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.942
And so the more I
talked to people

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:34.400
who are gluten
intolerant, the more

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.040
I realized that
this trigger point

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.880
is very common with
a lot of people.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.220
Now with me, I was completely
shocked by the entire thing.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.402
I had no idea that
this was possible.

00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:50.110
But the more I thought
about it, the more

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.050
I realized that my funny
tummy my whole life

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.510
made a lot of sense actually.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.460
And so I'm one of those people
that my entire life, even

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.900
before my diagnosis, I always
felt bad when I ate something.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.699
So I had stomach ache, diarrhea,
bloating, the whole nine yards.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.900
And this happens
every time I ate.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.150
And every time I went to a
doctor they would just say,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.760
oh well I guess you just
have a funny stomach

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.830
so just be careful with it.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.790
And that really
wasn't that helpful.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.300
And also I spent a whole lot
of my life just feeling bad,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.450
which isn't great.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.860
Does this story sound
familiar to anybody?

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.400
OK so this is
actually something.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.020
There is some
statistic out there

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.870
that once you start on the
road to trying to figure out

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.900
what's wrong with your system
when you're reacting to gluten

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.130
it's something like
12 years from starting

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.120
the search for the reason
to the actual diagnosis.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.070
And I think the reason for
this is a lot of doctors

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.240
up until now have been trained
that gluten intolerance is

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.390
so rare that there's no
point in even looking for it.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.230
It's so rare it doesn't exist.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.470
So they didn't even
think of it as an option.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.020
So my whole life I've never
had a doctor talk about gluten.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.040
I don't even think
I knew what gluten

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.200
was until I was diagnosed.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.870
So my first question
of my doctor,

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.390
and it may be your
first question as well,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.620
is what is gluten?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.016
Because they kind
of say, oh, hey,

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:24.180
you can't eat gluten, bye bye.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.140
And I thought, OK but I
don't know what that is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.770
and you need to
help me with this.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.710
So after my diagnosis
I realized I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.950
had to know what
gluten was and I also

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.595
had to know where it
resided in our food system.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.680
So I wanted to tell you a
little bit about what gluten is.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.375
You may or may not know this.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:50.350
Gluten is a protein--
actually it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.180
a combination of
two proteins that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.510
is found-- the two proteins
are gliadin and glutenin.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.580
And these two together make
up the thing we call gluten.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.460
They are found in all
forms of wheat and that

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.129
includes spelt, kamut, farro,
durum, emmer, and einkorn.

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:09.920
So I don't know if you
guys have experience

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.430
what I've experienced
but I often go places

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.820
and they say oh here's a
gluten free thing it's spelt.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.329
And I have to say, no
that's a form of wheat.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.430
So you have to be really careful
about the lack of knowledge

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.110
on the part of
the food industry.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.889
It's also found in rye
and it's found in barley.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.430
And then it's also
found in something

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.100
called triticale, which is a
combination of rye and wheat.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.890
There's a lot of
question about oats,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.200
and if you haven't been gluten
free for any amount of time

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.690
you know about the
concept that you

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.240
need to eat gluten free oats.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.790
And oats themselves can
be problematic for people

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.700
who can't tolerate gluten.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.850
So there's a
prolamin in oats that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.840
mimics the prolamin
in gluten, which

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.730
is called gliadin, the prolamin
in oats is called avenin.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.810
And avenin is
something that people

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.500
who are gluten intolerance
often are intolerant to as well.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.840
So if you don't tolerate
gluten, there is a good chance

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.260
that you actually don't
tolerate avenin or oats.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.560
If you do tolerate oats, if
you're a gluten free person

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.160
you need to make sure that
you buy gluten free oats.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.135
As you may know, oats are often
processed and grown with wheat

00:05:25.135 --> 00:05:26.760
so you need to make
sure that you don't

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.220
get the cross contaminated oats.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.430
OK, so another question
I get a lot is,

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.190
what are the forms of gluten
intolerance, sensitivity,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.990
allergy, there are
all sorts of words

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.660
that are floating
around out there.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.570
The main thing that people
seem to know about is celiac.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.760
Celiac is an autoimmune
disorder and it

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.800
is caused by-- what happens
is your body-- if you're

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.270
prone to it, your body
will attack itself

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.700
once you eat gluten.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.810
How many people here are
actually diagnosed celiac?

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.210
OK so we have a few folks.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.540
There's also a non-celiac
gluten intolerance.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.810
This is where you're not
celiac but you're still

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.500
reacting to gluten.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.150
This category
encompasses a few things

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.020
because they're not entirely
clear what the mechanism is.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.630
So if you're not celiac
but you react to gluten

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.380
they call it non-celiac gluten
intolerance or sensitivity.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.660
Different doctors call
it different things.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.940
There's not a whole lot of
information out there on this

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.760
but it's kind of
just the category

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.000
that they lump people into if
you're not actually celiac.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.090
And what non-celiac
gluten intolerance

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.370
is, is you are not
autoimmune to gluten,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.990
you're just reacting to it.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.740
There's also a thing
called wheat allergy,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.310
which is a little bit different.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.340
It is when your body mounts a
histamine reaction in to wheat.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.745
And you can actually go into
anaphylaxis if you eat wheat.

00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:59.984
It can range from mild to
very strong of a reaction.

00:06:59.984 --> 00:07:01.650
Like I said, you can
go into anaphylaxis

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.230
and you can die if you have
a really strong allergy.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.237
There is no such thing really
is a gluten allergy they don't

00:07:07.237 --> 00:07:08.820
think, but there is
the wheat allergy.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.069
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:13.860
So I just wanted to
give you a sense of who

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.470
reacts to gluten in
the United States.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.130
So you probably have heard the
1 in 133 people in the United

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.200
States they think have
celiac, which is about 1%

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.580
of the population, and that's
about 3 million people.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:33.120
Now celiac is a genetically
predetermined disease.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.780
So you need to have
the genes for celiac

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.620
in order to develop celiac.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.970
And they think about
30% of the population,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.300
or 94 million people in the
US, have the genes for celiac.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.870
Which is kind of intense.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.920
And you don't necessarily
develop celiac

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.410
if you have the gene.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:53.910
That's the strange thing.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.170
It needs to be
triggered on some level.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.680
So since I am celiac, we test
our daughter, who is now 13,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.270
we test her every few years
for the gliadin antibodies

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.910
just to make sure she
hasn't been triggered

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.320
and is now full blown celiac.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.486
Because we don't know if
you've got the gene or not,

00:08:12.486 --> 00:08:14.220
but there's a good
chance you did

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.630
Then there's another
5% of people,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.990
which is 18+ million people
who have the gluten intolerance

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.720
that's non-celiac.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.430
And they think it's
way more than that.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.930
They think this is a very
conservative estimate.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.850
And then there's a 0.5%, which
is about 1.5 million people

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.580
in the US, that a wheat allergy.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.559
So that just gives you
a sense of the amount

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:39.909
of people that are out
there reacting to gluten.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.299
And it's a lot.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.980
They think these numbers
are very conservative

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.970
and that we will see
more and more and more

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:51.700
people that are statistically
diagnosed with these things.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.840
So when I was first
diagnosed, I went

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.940
through a pretty huge
mourning process.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:04.840
I imagine this is pretty
familiar to folks in this room.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.290
I ate gluten all the time
before I was diagnosed.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.030
I had toast and
cereal for breakfast,

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.580
I had sandwiches for lunch,
I had pasta for dinner.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.200
I had scones and cookies and
treats throughout the day.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.000
And all of a sudden I was told
you can eat any of those things

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.300
and I was just devastated.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.270
And I had a new baby
so I didn't quite

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.550
know what to do because
I was used to just making

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.600
a quick sandwich
and all our friends

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.170
were dropping off meals for us.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.370
And of course all
those meals had gluten

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.240
and the hospital
even sent us home

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.200
with a meal which was
lasagna and I couldn't that.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.005
So it was kind of
a disaster for me.

00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:45.380
And I've talked to a lot of
people who feel the same way.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.120
It's just very hard to get
diagnosed with such a huge food

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.460
allergy or
intolerance, especially

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.600
if it's something that is part
of your diet all the time.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.790
And this is very common.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:00.530
Most people are diagnosed with
the food intolerance or allergy

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.230
to something that
they eat a lot.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.420
That's how the
body works, it gets

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.760
triggered by
constant repetition.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.837
So one thing that
happened to me is

00:10:10.837 --> 00:10:12.920
I didn't know how to eat
so I just stopped eating.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.850
So I lost all my
pregnancy weight

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.680
in about three weeks, which
is kind of an intense thing.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.890
And then you've got
a baby and it just

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.246
was in a very fun situation
for me or my husband.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.620
He didn't know
what was happening

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.380
because he had a wife
is sick all the time

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.430
and we had a new
baby to deal with.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:34.210
And so I just went
into mourning.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.930
I just thought well
every good again

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.820
and that's just the
way it is and I'm just

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.070
going to have to deal with it.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.990
And that actually wasn't
all that satisfying

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.650
but that's what I did
for a little while.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:49.120
Even worse was it that
I had to stop baking,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.630
or I felt like I
had to stop baking.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.760
I'm someone who's
a lifelong baker.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.050
I baked from the
time I was tiny and I

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.310
could climb up onto a stool and
get onto the kitchen counter

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.070
and access the
cupboards in order

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.600
to get the ingredients to bake.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.160
I mean literally I baked
throughout childhood,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.250
I baked throughout college, I
baked throughout grad school.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.050
I also baked as an adult.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:13.690
And I realized
through this diagnosis

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.970
actually that baking is kind
of the through line to my life.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.000
It's my passion, it's my
joy, it's my stress reliever.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.620
And so the concept that
I couldn't bake anymore

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.630
was even worse than not being
able to eat gluten anymore.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.430
And I thought I
couldn't bake anymore.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.890
I realized later that I
could but in the beginning

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.320
it just felt horrible.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.480
So you go through
a mourning period

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.630
where you just feel
like gluten has died

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.040
and you can never
talk to it again.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.540
And then you have to pick
yourself up by the bootstraps

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.540
eventually and
relearn how to eat.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.890
And I had to relearn
also how to bake

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.470
and then you get on with life.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.110
And I know in several people who
tend to get stuck in the fact

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.260
that they can't eat
the thing anymore.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.730
And I just realized for me that
wasn't that helpful because it

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.640
just made me feel bad all
the time, emotionally bad.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.364
So I just thought you know what?

00:12:06.364 --> 00:12:08.030
I'm going to figure
out how to eat again

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.560
and also how to bake again.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.770
And that actually has
turned into something

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:13.990
that's very satisfying for me.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.790
So one thing, gluten
as you may know,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.600
comes from the
Latin word for glue.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.960
And that's a really good
description of gluten

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.620
because when all else fails
gluten is very sticky.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.960
Now gluten performs a lot
of functions in baking.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.160
In fact, modern baking is based
on how to manipulate gluten

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.230
to do what you want it to do.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.700
So you take gluten away you have
a really tough time actually

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.130
baking anything.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.580
So one thing I had to do
was learn what gluten did.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.390
And what it turns out gluten
performs several functions

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:52.990
in baking.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:58.630
It's a binder, it holds things
together, hence the glue name.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.770
And a lot of gluten
free things are

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.290
crumbly because they don't
have the appropriate binder.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.710
It's a structure builder.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.520
And what I mean
by that is gluten

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.340
serves as like the
tent pole structure

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.440
that the starches adhere to
that create a covering that then

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.900
the leaveners can work on
to raise the big thing.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.590
So if you don't have gluten,
or a replacer for gluten,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.669
you now have a very flat thing.

00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:26.210
And I don't know
about you but I have

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:29.590
run into a zillion gluten
free baked things, like scones

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.630
and muffins, that are
kind of hockey pucks.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:36.290
They're very dense,
they're very heavy,

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.177
and they're very crumbly.

00:13:38.177 --> 00:13:40.760
And that is due to the binding
and then the structure building

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.790
being not there.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.970
The other thing that gluten
does is it's elastic.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.030
So it allows you
to manipulate it.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.900
So when you make a
loaf of artisan bread,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.060
you can form it
on a cookie sheet

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.250
and it'll keep it-- you can
stretch it to its shape,

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.590
but then you can let it stay
there and it'll keep its shape.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.330
Without gluten things
don't keep their shape.

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.280
First of all, stretching
it doesn't really

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.020
factor into it because you're
just basically spreading it

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.830
around.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.976
And then it just blobs out.

00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:12.350
So I don't know
if anyone's tried

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.450
to make a bread with
the gluten free dough,

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.240
but it's very difficult.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.160
You need a structure like a
loaf pan in order to do that.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.800
Then gluten also is
a moisture retainer.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:28.280
If helps things retain moisture.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.154
This is why a lot of gluten
free things are very dry.

00:14:32.154 --> 00:14:33.570
I don't know if
you've experienced

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.620
that but a lot of gluten
free things are dry.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.440
Like again I just
think of hockey pucks,

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.810
they're flat and
dry and crumbly.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.990
And it's because there's no
moisture retainer in there,

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.150
which is what gluten does.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.370
And then gluten also
extends the shelf life,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.330
so that's related to the
moisture retaining properties.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:58.600
So when you bake gluten free
you need to find something that

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.850
serves all of these functions,
that does all of these things,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:06.520
and this is the challenge
for gluten free baking.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.550
So in gluten free
baking, we have

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.240
to choose what I call
a gluten replacer.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.180
And a gluten
replacer is the thing

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.850
that hopefully does all of
those things I talked about.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.620
There are several that
people use nowadays.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.730
There's a thing
called xanthan gum.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.090
There's guar gum.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:29.230
There's also seeds, ground
seeds, psyllium, flax, chia,

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.590
there's pectin, and
there's also gelatin.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.500
There's a lot of controversy
in the gluten free baking world

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.640
about which one you should use,
and which one's easier to use,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.360
and which one works the best.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:45.820
And my experience has shown
me that xanthan gum actually

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.670
performs most of the
functions pretty well.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.650
The one function that it
doesn't perform that well,

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.520
and but none of them really
do, is in the elasticity part.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.900
It's still hard to
get things that--

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.810
to mold things without
them being dry.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.310
And that's something
I'm still working on.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.900
But what all of
these things are,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.470
they fall into a class of
things called hydrocolloids.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.710
And what that means is
they're moisture retainers.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:19.970
So they can retain hundreds
of times their own weight

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.890
in water, which is interesting.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.730
And so each one of these
things you can use in a gluten

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:30.500
free baking product to serve
as the gluten replacer.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.290
And what I mean is you
mix this with the flours

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.005
and now you've got a thing
that will mimic gluten,

00:16:38.005 --> 00:16:41.540
a gluten flour.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.860
Now in terms of
choosing flours I

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.090
thought initially that
all I needed to do

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.850
was choose a flour,
add some xanthan gum,

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:51.490
and I'd be good to go.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.840
That would be easy.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.000
And it turns that it's
not that straightforward.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.560
It turns out there's no
one gluten free flour that

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.640
behaves like wheat flour, which
is what I wanted to mimic.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.650
So I had to ask some
questions of myself,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.930
and I think all
baker's need to ask

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.470
these questions of themselves,
which is what kind of baking

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.359
do you want to do?

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.280
Do you want to do
whole grain baking?

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.869
Do you wanna do
grain free baking?

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.930
Do want to do paleo,
which is grain free, sugar

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.500
free, sometimes dairy free.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.839
Do you want to do healthy
baking, whatever that means?

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.540
Or you want to
experiment with flours?

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.180
Do you think the
flours tastes good

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:31.940
and you want to experiment
with different things.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.870
I came down to--
what I wanted to do

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.210
was create items that
were indistinguishable

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.860
from their wheat counterparts.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.880
And this I think is
what distinguishes me

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:49.280
from a lot of gluten free bakers
in that I work on making things

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.270
that everyone is going to want
to eat, gluten free and gluten

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.220
full, because they taste
so good and they're

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.340
indistinguishable from the
things that they normally get.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.710
So again I thought OK,
I figured this out,

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.060
now I need to figure
out how to do the flours

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:08.970
and it turns out with
gluten free baking you

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:10.460
need to mix flours.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.880
No one flour will really
do what you need it to do.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.970
And so you need to
mix flours in order

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:21.310
to mimic the
performance of wheat.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:27.950
And what I did was I chose a
flour mix that I thought that I

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:34.500
liked and spent several years
tweaking it to perform the way

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.820
I wanted it to perform.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.430
So what I did was I
looked at the things

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.990
that I wanted it to do.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:50.540
So first of all I found that
all purpose wheat flour consists

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.750
of 80 percent starches and 20
percent gums and protein, which

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.710
is kind of a weird combo.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.460
Wheat flour does
have gums in it.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.890
And so I wanted to
mimic that chemistry,

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:04.960
I wanted it to taste
good, so I didn't

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.480
want it to taste like bean.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.070
I don't know about you
guys, but a lot of people

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.400
use bean flour and that has a
very strong taste that I didn't

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.830
want to put into my baked goods.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.830
I wanted it to have
a good mouth feel,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.620
I wanted it to be allergen free,
so the mix that I came up with

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.660
doesn't have any of
the common allergies.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:28.090
That doesn't have soy,
corn, night shades,

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.000
which are all-- nuts.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.820
And these are all things that
people in my world reacted to

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.720
and I wanted to be
sure to have a mix that

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.390
didn't exclude other
people in my life.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.700
And then again I wanted
things to be easy to obtain.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.240
If it was an esoteric
flour that you could only

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.070
get from a yak in Kathmandu,
it wasn't helpful for anybody.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.430
So I came up with,
ta-da, Jeanne's gluten

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.130
free all purpose flour.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.870
And the recipe for this is
in my book, it's on my site.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.990
And you can make yourself, I
don't sell it as a product.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.070
But what it has in it is brown
rice flour, white rice flour,

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.980
sweet rice flour, tapioca
flour, and xanthan gum.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.320
And these are the things--
what I did is I mix this up

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.940
and then I use it cup
for cup in my baking.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.040
And I found this to
be pretty satisfying.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.720
So people ask me about
recipe development,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.300
like how do I go about
doing, creating my recipes?

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:30.510
And one thing I found is that
gluten free baking is actually

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:32.500
still a pretty new field.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.690
And so it's very exciting
and you can be innovative.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.700
And what I really like is
I get to investigate things

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.680
and figure out what
is actually going

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.390
on with the flours and
the other ingredients.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.530
And how do I mix all
of these together

00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:48.620
to create a thing
that I want to eat

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.510
and that I want to
share with other people.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.190
What I found that
I like to do is

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.870
I like to start
with the classics.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:21:00.440
So I like to start with
cookies and bread and cakes

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.610
and all of these things.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.440
But I also start with
classic techniques.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.240
So I went back to basic,
good classical baking.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.770
One thing I found over
the course of time

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.070
is even if you
adapt the recipes,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.240
so you take your flour
in use it on some recipes

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.200
you found in another
book, sometimes

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.465
you need to adjust
certain ingredients.

00:21:22.465 --> 00:21:25.740
So I found that, for example,
mostly gluten free things

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.770
need a leavener, so like baking
soda, baking powder, yeast.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:36.240
I found that classic
techniques are really helpful.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.819
So for example beating
the fat and the sugar,

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:40.360
so the butter and
the sugar, together

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.490
to create the air pockets that
allow the leavener to work.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.970
That works really well
for gluten free baking.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.900
We've kind of forgotten
that as wheat bakers.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.190
Often I have found that my
readers need extra information.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.980
I get a lot of
people who are coming

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.240
to baking never
having baked before.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.470
So when I write recipes
I need to make sure

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:02.330
that someone who really doesn't
know the kitchen very well

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.600
is able to use
them and bake well.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.600
And then I also have to be
aware of other substitutions.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.060
How many people here are
not only gluten intolerance

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.740
but are intolerant
to other things?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.680
Dairy, eggs, nuts.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.700
So, wow, that's unusual.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.850
Usually I get a lot
of folks who are also

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.620
intolerant other things.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.860
And so in my book
and my recipes I'm

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.620
always trying to give people
different substitutions

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:30.630
for the common things.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.180
So for the dairy and
the eggs in particular.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.130
And then often I try
to make my recipes

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.080
so they don't hinge
on nuts, so they

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.600
can keep the nuts in
or out if they want to.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.440
OK so I have a blog.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.140
I don't know if anyone goes
to my blog, but on my blog

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.680
it's called "Art of Gluten Free
Baking" and I share recipes.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.280
I share baking tips.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.330
I share, I interact
with my readers

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:59.120
and I get feedback from
them about what they want.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.460
I answer questions, and I
also teach folks a little bit

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.570
about baking, how to
maneuver this world

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.100
called gluten free living.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.470
I try to make it a place
that is helpful and friendly

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.510
and that people feel like
they can come to and get

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.100
some information from.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.240
And it's been really
satisfying for me.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.430
One thing that I
have in my past is

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.810
I have a Ph.D. in
theater history.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.660
And so this really
touches my teaching side.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.840
I haven't been a
professor for a long time,

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.890
but it's very helpful
to have this venue

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.820
that I can interact
with people and teach.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.029
So I have recipe principles.

00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:46.320
I don't know if these are
interesting to people or not.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.120
But one thing I've learned
is that it's important for me

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.150
to follow a list of
things that help ground me

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.430
when I'm developing recipes.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.220
So I like to learn
from the past.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.350
And one thing I
always keep in mind

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.890
is, even though everyone
today, I don't know,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.620
buys puff pastry
from the supermarket,

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.270
I can't buy puff pastry.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:10.690
So I have to make it myself.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.680
And I keep realizing that
a long time ago, there

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.720
was no such thing as a
supermarket or the frozen food

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.130
section so they had
to make everything.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.110
So whenever something
feels almost

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.880
impossible to make I think
no, at one point in history

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.700
that was made by human
beings and I can do that.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.070
So there's nothing I found
that I can't mimic, other

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.850
than San Francisco sourdough.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.150
I do have a sourdough
recipe on my site

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.290
but I don't have San Francisco
sourdough because, as you know,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.540
that needs a particular
yeast, and on and on.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.870
The other thing again I use
classic baking techniques.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.360
I always try to go
back to the basics

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.350
if things aren't working out.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.440
I try to think
outside of the box.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.010
This is really important
because sometimes people

00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.760
get stuck in doing things the
way they've always been done.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.000
So for example, I make a
gluten free potato gnocchi,

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.090
you know, the little dumplings,
and they were not behaving well

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.340
when I tried to
boil them in water.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.300
And after several
tries I realized,

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.520
OK I need to cook these
in a different way.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.930
Now you can pan fry them
and they're delicious

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.600
but I still wanted to
do the water cooking.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.270
And I realized that steaming
them worked very well.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.710
So instead of putting them
all the way in the water,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:29.490
I allowed the water to
come to them to cook them.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:32.590
So that was very
helpful for me to really

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.810
to remember think
outside the box.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.550
Don't do the things you
always did necessarily.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.680
I also call pasta
making humid baking.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.120
I don't know, that's goofy.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.610
But a lot of the same
principles apply to pasta

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:48.000
making as applied to baking.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.340
I'm also opened a new paradigms.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.640
So this it straddles two worlds.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:59.070
It's in classic baking but
it's also its own thing.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.860
And so you have to be open to
completely new ways of doing

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.730
things.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.211
And I found this with bread.

00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:06.960
I don't know if any--
has anyone here made

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.310
gluten free bread before?

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.130
So one thing about
gluten free bread

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.380
is that you don't
really knead it

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.290
because there's no gluten
to develop in it, right?

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:22.720
And my bread is more like
a very thick cake batter.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.620
Now a lot of people
are getting stuck

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.960
on the concept of kneading
their gluten free bread.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.450
But if you can get out
of that and realize

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.160
that you don't need
to knead bread,

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.570
it's more of a
need to mix bread,

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.660
then you have a lot more
you can do with your bread.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:43.530
And so that's one thing--
that's an example of I

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:49.220
always try to keep things
in perspective in that I

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.690
need to not get
stuck in old ways.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.930
And old ways are
good if they work

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.630
but if they don't work
you need to move on.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.760
And I always refine my recipes.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.800
I mean I'm not
constantly changing them

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.860
but if I find different
methods or different techniques

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.230
or even different
ingredients sometimes I

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.050
think OK I will refine this
recipe make it even better.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.040
And then my core idea if
it's not delicious then

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.420
it's not ready.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.750
I try not to put recipes up
on my site until they're done

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.550
and until they're delicious.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:24.390
And one thing, just
because I lost my ability

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:27.090
to digest gluten, doesn't
mean I lost my ability

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.440
to taste things.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.120
And I think a lot
of people forget

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.900
that about gluten free people.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.340
So I don't settle.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.320
I want things to be
just as excellent

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:39.090
as they used to be for me.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:41.270
So I wrote a cookbook here.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.320
Some of you have it.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.060
It's called "Gluten-Free
Baking For The Holidays;

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.590
60 Recipes for Traditional
Festive Treats."

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.260
Its for the winter holiday
season so Thanksgiving,

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:58.070
Hanukkah, Christmas,
Kwanzaa, and New Year's.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:28:01.090
It has recipes but it
also includes baking tips

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:03.850
and it includes ingredient
and equipment info.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.040
So where to find ingredients,
how to choose ingredients,

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.160
how to choose equipment
and where to find it.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.160
I really had a lot of
fun writing this book.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.550
Here's the cover.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.310
I was very lucky, I'm
with Chronicle Books

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.030
and they do just
beautiful books.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:27.220
And so I'm just thrilled
with how my book came out.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.950
One thing about
the holiday time is

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:40.310
that it's a time of community
and it's a time of traditions.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.980
And I have found
that one thing gluten

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.560
free people need
during the holidays is

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:49.110
to be able to partake
in the traditions

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.970
and the festivities
with everybody else.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.630
It's not that nice
to go to Thanksgiving

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.100
and be served like your
own little plate that

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.800
has a piece of Turkey on it,
may be some steamed green beans,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.300
and to be told,
well everything else

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.760
has gluten so that's
your special plate.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:06.764
I want to be part of it.

00:29:06.764 --> 00:29:08.930
I want to have the stuffing,
I want to have the pie,

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.780
I want to have the cookies, I
want to have the dinner rolls,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.570
and I want to have them
with everybody else.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.330
I don't want to have my yucky
old dinner roll on the side.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.100
I want everyone to have
delicious dinner rolls.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.910
And so gluten free
people feel this

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.340
need to be part of the
community pretty keenly.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.620
And so I found that
as a society we

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.210
use food to bring
people together,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.340
so Thanksgiving is a
really clear example,

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.970
but yeah just things
like potlucks,

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:46.320
and PTA bake sales, and cocktail
parties, and birthday parties.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.550
We use the food in
all of these things

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:50.360
to bring the people together.

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.690
And if you're leaving
members of the community

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:55.780
out you're telling they're
not part of the community.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.920
And it's very important to
me to bring people back in.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.560
Food reflects and
reinforces traditions,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.241
and the holidays are full
of traditions as you know.

00:30:08.241 --> 00:30:14.010
So when I was first
diagnosed in 2000 I thought,

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.070
well I'll just educate
everyone about what I can eat,

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.940
and how to accommodate
me, and then

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.530
everyone will be happy
having Thanksgiving

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:26.710
without all the stuff that they
are used to because they'll

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:28.940
include me and every
one will be happy.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.100
And I realized that's not
that great of a strategy

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.130
because people want to have
the things they're used

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.240
and that are traditional
especially during the holidays.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.080
And so I have altered the
way I approach gluten free

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.260
living, and cooking,
and sharing, and baking.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.670
And I just want to make things
that are so good nobody cares.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.750
That includes everybody,
everyone actually wants

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.560
these things, they look forward
to them during the year,

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.500
and that my friends and family
aren't sitting around thinking,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.940
oh god, we got to share
with Jeanne again.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.470
So that was a guiding
tenet of my book.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:10.250
So my cookbook, the
theory is every one--

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.060
it provides recipes for all
the traditional elements

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.050
of the holidays that everyone
likes and everyone wants

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.150
and that everyone can now
eat because they're now

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.400
gluten free.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.170
Going forward I am still
doing a lot of development.

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.840
I'm working on more ideas.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.800
There's a lot of
uncharted territory

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.980
to cover with gluten
free baking, which

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.580
I think is really interesting.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.910
Again, it's baking
but you've got

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:44.560
to figure it out all over again,
which is fascinating to me.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.710
And I really enjoy
the challenge of it.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:49.210
I have a lot more to learn.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.910
I think everyone does.

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.470
I'm trying to work on
more difficult recipes.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.970
So things like croissants,
artisan breads,

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:00.000
like I said some pastas,
because a lot of pastas

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.480
it's hard to make
them at home because

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.480
of the cooking limitations.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.040
I'm also trying to learn more
about my own intolerances.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.825
As I get older and finding that
I react not so great to dairy

00:32:11.825 --> 00:32:13.280
and not so great to eggs.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.040
I can still eat them,
but I can't eat them

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.230
the way I used to.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:19.880
So I'm trying-- even though
I've always done this,

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.120
I am re-upping my
commitment to looking

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:26.610
for excellent substitutions
to give us options.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.800
Not as the only thing but to
give us options in my books

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.110
and on my site.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.880
And then I'm always
trying to listen and learn

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.080
from my readers, to listen
to them and learn from them.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.300
Because I get so
much information

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.080
from my readers
in terms of what's

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.290
available out there, what's
not available out there,

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.540
what people want,
what people like.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.840
And so that's something
I'm trying to always do.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.070
Where to find me.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.130
You can find me on my blog
"Art of Gluten-Free Baking."

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:00.720
I'm also on Twitter
as "Four Chickens."

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.760
My first blog was
"Four Chickens"

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.840
because I have chickens
in my backyard,

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.550
and it was like a
knitting blog, and nobody

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.590
read it, but whatever.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.770
So I switched it over to baking.

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.920
I'm also on Facebook as
Art of Gluten free Baking

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.860
and then I have my email there.

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.380
So you can find me in
many different places.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.740
So what I would like
to do is open it up

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.130
for questions from
folks or comments

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.759
or ideas whatever you
guys have on your minds.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:31.300
AUDIENCE: I have an
aunt who has been

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.310
diagnosed with celiac disease.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:35.070
We think we're
trying to figure out

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.510
if there's any genetic link to
my sister, who is starting--

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.320
has always displayed
symptoms that you mentioned.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.520
I'm wondering do you feel first
that your flour mixture is

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.820
good for pizza dough?

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.114
That's one thing that we
have yet to find a good one.

00:33:49.114 --> 00:33:50.030
JEANNE SAUVAGE: It is.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.790
I have a recipe on my
site for pizza dough

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.360
and it's actually
just naturally vegan.

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.630
You don't need
dairy or eggs in it,

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.690
so it works for a lot of people.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.280
And I've also-- I have
it for the regular baked

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:03.990
in the oven and
also grilled pizza,

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.080
so if that's interesting.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.220
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.580
My other question is
kind of along the lines

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.889
of the beginning of your talk.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.399
I mentioned my sister's been
displaying some symptoms

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:14.690
and has pretty much cut it out.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.310
And we've learned that in order
to get the official diagnosis,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.310
she actually would have
to reintroduce it and go

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.100
through the hell that is
bringing it back into her life.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:24.909
Do you have any suggestions
for somebody who's facing that?

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.210
Is it best to just cut it
out and say what the heck?

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:30.888
Or do you suggest going through
the process to really know?

00:34:30.888 --> 00:34:32.679
JEANNE SAUVAGE: If you
don't know, in order

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.670
to be diagnosed as
celiac, you need

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.120
to-- it's a double
diagnosis process.

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.290
You have to test positive
to a blood test, the gliadin

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:44.210
antibodies test,
and then you also

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:46.080
have to have a bowel biopsy.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.870
Because one thing
that the gluten is

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.679
doing if you have celiac
is it's flattening

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.750
the villi in your
lower intestine.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.710
And that causes people
to not absorb things.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.790
So people who are
celiac are often

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:04.530
anaemic, they have osteoporosis,
they are more inclined

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.000
to different cancers, on top of
the fact that they feel gross.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.610
So the question is do you go
through the entire process

00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:17.720
and in order to test well,
to do accurately test,

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.430
you need to be eating gluten.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.300
Now if you figured out
gluten makes you feel gross,

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.042
and you stop eating gluten, and
then a while later someone says

00:35:25.042 --> 00:35:26.500
oh would you like
to test for that?

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.124
You say yes and they
say, oh by the way

00:35:28.124 --> 00:35:31.310
you need to do three weeks
of eating whole wheat bread.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.680
Now for me that
wasn't an option.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.190
So here's the deal.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:39.540
When I was tested-- and this
may be helpful for your sister--

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.650
I tested positive
to the blood tests.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.820
And there are very few
false positives for celiac.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.880
There are a lot of
false negatives,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.530
but there are very
few false negatives.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.120
And then the next
step was I needed

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:55.870
to undergo the bowel biopsy and
I declined the bowel biopsy.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.680
First of all, the test was
positive, that was fine.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.890
But even more important, I
didn't react well to gluten.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.930
I felt horrible
when I ate gluten.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.870
So my answer is it depends on
if your sister will avoid gluten

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.120
if a doctor doesn't
tell her to do so.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.350
Does that make sense?

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.080
So some people won't
go off of gluten

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.960
even though they feel horrible
every single time they eat it.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.960
But they will not
go off gluten often

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.830
if they are not given a
diagnosis with these tests.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.940
So do you think your
sister would officially

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:32.780
go off of it if she
didn't have the test?

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:37.550
Then I would say no,
she knows the deal.

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:39.560
You have it, you were
diagnosed with it?

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.060
No.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.820
Who was diagnosed?

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:41.510
Nobody was?

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.930
AUDIENCE: My aunt.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.305
JEANNE SAUVAGE:
Oh your aunt, OK.

00:36:43.305 --> 00:36:45.750
So there is a huge
percentage rise.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.130
So if you have a
close family member

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.290
who has been
diagnosed with celiac,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:56.350
there is some huge percentage
of increased possibility

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.900
that you will be diagnosed
with gluten intolerance.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.840
So that's why we always
test our daughter.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.490
Because right now she's not
showing any symptoms of celiac

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:08.460
but you want to be sure
that she never does.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.550
One thing I want to
clarify is I technically,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.730
I guess in some
medical circles, am not

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.440
celiac because I didn't
undergo the bowel biopsy,

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.780
which is interesting.

00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:20.480
So I tell people
most of the time

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.900
that I'm gluten intolerance.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.250
But I did test positive
to the blood test

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.660
but I declined the
biopsy, which is a thing.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.205
Now on top of it,
I think I shared--

00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:33.580
I don't know if I shared with
you-- about four years ago,

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.770
I was diagnosed with
a wheat allergy,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.720
and I am anaphylaxis to wheat.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.890
So it doesn't really
matter if I'm celiac

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.760
or not because if I
eat wheat I can die.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:48.150
The last time accidentally ate
it I landed in the hospital

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.480
because I was
undergoing anaphylaxis

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.820
and I had to get there quickly
in order to be able to breathe.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.870
So that's a long
answer to the thing.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.180
I don't know that
other people, but I

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.590
feel like if I feel gross
when I eat something

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.150
I don't eat it anymore.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.750
But our society really
isn't built like that.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.160
I know so many
people who continue

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.720
to eat the thing that makes
them feel bad because they're so

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:14.400
used to it and they like it.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.430
Or I have a friend
that says, well

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.280
gluten makes me
feel bad so I only

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.410
eat it on special occasions.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.410
And I think so you
go to the party

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.020
and you eat it and
you feel gross?

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.360
That doesn't make a
ton of sense to me.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.110
Like for them that's a fun time.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.340
For me, that's not a fun time.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:36.530
But our society has such
strong connections to food

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.390
that have nothing to do with
what it does to our bodies

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.010
that people will
do stuff like this.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.910
And this may even sound
familiar to you or the people

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.670
in your life.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.810
AUDIENCE: Just another
question about using your mix.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.571
Do you use it for thickening,
like in soups or things

00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:53.070
like that?

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:53.390
JEANNE SAUVAGE: I do.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.090
AUDIENCE: Any modifications
you would make to it?

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.215
JEANNE SAUVAGE: No, huh-uh.

00:38:56.215 --> 00:38:58.110
I use it tablespoon
for tablespoon

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.410
and I use it for roux, I
use it for the chenille,

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.850
I use it for gravy.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.740
So use it for all
sorts of things.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.300
It seems to work really well
for all of those things.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:14.944
I make a New Orleans gumbo
and I make the roux first

00:39:14.944 --> 00:39:16.110
and it performs beautifully.

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:18.770
It turns that nice chocolate
brown and it's really nice.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.510
So yeah.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.590
AUDIENCE: Super.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.500
Have you have tried some of
the other baking mixes that

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.110
are flour mixes
that are out there

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:24.850
and do anything to compare?

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:26.250
JEANNE SAUVAGE:
You know, I have.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.730
I highly recommend
the King Arthur mix.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.420
I don't know if
anyone's used that one.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.360
That's a nice one.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.730
It's pretty
reasonable, it has many

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.510
of the same ingredients
that my mix says.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.980
I'm not sure if it
have xanthan gum

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.510
so if it doesn't
have xanthan gum be

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.900
sure to add about a
quarter teaspoon per cup

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:46.730
for your regular baking.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.970
Not for yeast breads, that's
a whole different thing,

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.390
but for regular baking.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.150
We were talking
earlier about cup

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.760
for cup, which is the one that
Thomas Keller has developed.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.980
I think you can buy
it in Williams Sonoma.

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.540
And cup for cup I
don't recommend.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:05.380
First of all I haven't used
it so I can't tell you how

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:06.810
if I like how it works.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.720
But it's got milk
powder in it and so

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.270
many people I know who
are gluten intolerant

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.810
also don't do that
well with dairy

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:18.627
so I figure why even add
that into the situation.

00:40:18.627 --> 00:40:20.960
AUDIENCE: It sounds like you
have a lot of great recipes

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.049
that aren't just baking.

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:24.340
Are you going to write another
cookbook with your pizza

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.798
and gnocchi and
other great things?

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:27.890
JEANNE SAUVAGE: You
know, I hope to.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:29.720
That is something
that's in the works.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.810
So yeah, I hope to do that.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.335
And I have all of these
things on my site as well.

00:40:34.335 --> 00:40:35.710
So I've got the
pizza on my site,

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.150
I've got puff pastry
on my site, I've

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.620
got pasta dough on my site.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:45.660
And I guess the
end, there you go.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.310
But yeah, I have a ton
of stuff on my site

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.450
that are-- it's all free.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.220
And I also answer
questions so people often

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.450
will write me and say, this
is my family's special recipe

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.360
for German coffee cake and would
you be willing to adapt it?

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.520
And if I have the
time and I want to I

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.030
will do that for folks.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.341
I mean if I become
super duper popular

00:41:08.341 --> 00:41:09.840
I don't know how
much I can do that.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.810
But that's part of what
I-- Earlier this year I

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:17.380
wanted to define for myself what
my goal was with all of this.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.600
I mean my first goal,
of course, was for me.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.090
I wanted to be able
to eat these things.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.690
But my second goal
is to serve people,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.780
to help folks be
able to eat again.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.650
And to be able to bake again
and be able to enjoy this again.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.430
And so I wanna
really continue that,

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.680
and that's why I try to
be as successful as I

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.630
can on social media
and on my site.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.720
Because I really want
to help out folks.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.570
AUDIENCE: More of a
curiosity, I noticed

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.680
that in your recipe for the
flour, one of the ingredients

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.619
is glutenous rice flour, which
I assume does not have gluten.

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:51.410
JEANNE SAUVAGE: No.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:54.980
AUDIENCE: But is it just a lot
of starch, or what makes it

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.690
glutenous?

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.540
JEANNE SAUVAGE: Yeah
it has a lot of starch.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.080
It's also known as sticky rice
flour and the glutenous part,

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.750
as you picked up, it
just means it's sticky.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.760
It's called sweet rice
flour most of the time.

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.850
You can buy it in
the supermarket

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.310
often in the ethics section
in a little white box that's

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.750
labeled mochiko.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.380
And it's used a lot
in Asian baking.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:18.420
But it is confusing.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.157
I get tons of questions
about, you're gluten free

00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:22.865
and you use glutenous
rice flour and so I

00:42:22.865 --> 00:42:25.950
have to explain that the rice is
not a gluten containing grain.

00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.050
So it's just a weird
thing, I don't know why.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:33.270
But it actually is a really
good part of the mix.

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.870
In addition to the xanthan gun,
it helps bring things together,

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:39.200
which I think is nice.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.070
Another thing, just
talking about my mix,

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:44.860
I recommend to folks so
you see this in my book

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.190
and I have it on my
site but I recommend

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:50.350
that if you are
sensitive to graininess--

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:52.360
this is one of the
issues that often happens

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.350
with gluten free
flour, always look

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.930
for the finely ground flours.

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.350
So like there's extra
fine grind brown rice

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:02.810
flour that you can find.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.320
Now if you can't find it and
you're just using brown rice

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.400
flour-- like I use the
flours from Bob's Red Mill,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.930
I use flours from
Authentic Foods.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:16.580
Authentic Foods has the extra
fine grind but Bob's doesn't.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.617
And if it bothers you
enough you can just

00:43:18.617 --> 00:43:20.575
stick it in your blender
or your food processor

00:43:20.575 --> 00:43:23.800
and grind it up a little more
and make it a little more fine.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.970
So that works too.

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:31.430
The one I would not recommend
in terms of the mix,

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:35.740
you asked about mix, the Bob's
Red Mill Mix, is not so good.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.430
Do you guys have
Bob's Red Mill here?

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:38.790
Yeah OK.

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:40.390
It has a lot of
bean flour in it.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:43.250
And it's just very
strong tasting.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.180
And I don't know why
they keep having it.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.740
But when you make things--
so part of when I bake,

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.584
like I bake cookies.

00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:52.000
I eat some of
cookie dough, that's

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.440
just kind of part of what I do.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.970
You cannot do that when
there's a bean flour involved

00:43:55.970 --> 00:44:00.450
because it's so strong and
it's so yucky, basically.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.930
That's why I recommend stay
away from the bean flours.

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.970
Also the bean flours
are very high in protein

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:07.970
and they go rancid very quickly.

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.950
So you need to store those
in the freezer usually.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:13.740
And I have that in my book
and on my site but something

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.770
to keep in mind.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.770
Did that answer your question
about the glutenous rice?

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:19.952
So more questions?

00:44:19.952 --> 00:44:21.410
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned you have

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:24.520
people ask you to
adapt lots of recipes.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.680
When you're doing
that adaptation,

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.470
what would you say is the most
common change you're making?

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.480
JEANNE SAUVAGE: Well
the flour, of course.

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.690
The other, probably the two
most common changes I make

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.710
is in terms of the leaveners.

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.810
So often things don't
have enough leavening.

00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:44.570
And when I say leavener, I mean
the thing that makes it rise,

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.540
so baking powder,
baking soda, yeast.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.990
So most gluten free recipes I
found need more of those things

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:53.120
often.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.060
Now using classic
baking techniques

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.920
actually sometimes
makes it so you

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:00.550
don't have to because
you're creating the air

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.840
pockets that the
leaveners can work on.

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:08.100
For example, you beat the
fat and the sugar together.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.890
So it's the leaveners
that I often do.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.090
Sometimes eggs.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.370
I find that there's
not enough eggs

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.620
in baking to create
the moisture and also

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:20.040
to create some of the structure.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.440
And then with yeast, you
need to have much more yeast

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:25.650
than you would normally have.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:32.120
Those are probably the most
common changes that I make.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.330
And the other thing is
gluten free things seem

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.630
to take a little bit
longer to cook, to bake.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.900
So I often either increase
the temperature or at least

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.410
I increase the time.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:45.290
And I think part of that
is-- Do you guys know

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.860
the concept of hydration?

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:51.620
So in baking parlance
the hydration of a dough

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.850
is the percentage of the
water or liquid in a dough.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.500
And I have found that
gluten free things

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:01.260
do well with more liquid
in it, more water,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.650
because they dry out
much more quickly.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.360
And I think that then leads
to a longer baking time

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:11.870
because you need to
bake some of that out.

00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:13.080
Is that helpful?

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.040
There's one thing
that's hard, is

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.042
I try to tell
people, for example

00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:19.500
if you have a cookie
recipe and you

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.260
want to adapt it, I just
tell people use my mix.

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.490
Use the cup for cup for the
wheat flour in your recipe,

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:26.890
see what happens.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:30.250
And for something like a
cookie that usually suffices.

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:32.140
Then you get a little
more complicated,

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.792
you get into muffins and scones.

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:36.750
Sometimes you need tweaks,
sometimes you don't.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.140
Get into cakes, that's
more complicated.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:42.650
But I always tell people to
try and see what happens.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.800
And then once they
see what happens,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.680
if it's not to their
liking they can kind of

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.380
reverse engineer what happened.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.390
So was it too dry?

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.980
OK it's too dry, add more
eggs or add more liquid.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:55.890
Didn't rise.

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:59.431
OK did you beat the eggs,
the fat, and the sugar?

00:46:59.431 --> 00:46:59.930
Yes.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.075
OK you need more leavener.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.790
Did it come out kind of
wet after you've baked it?

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:09.290
Yes.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.100
OK you need to raise
baking temperature.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.740
You need to put it in longer.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:16.100
So I think I ultimately would
like to get to the point

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.440
where I can teach people
to do this themselves.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.210
But each recipe seems
to be its own bird.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.840
And so, so far I haven't
been able to say,

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:32.190
for all muffins you need to
make this adaptation, that kind

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:32.690
of thing.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.190
So that's what makes
it complicated.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.510
But I tell people to try
and see what happens.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:39.670
But one thing you can't
adapt cup for cup at all

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.240
is a yeasted recipe.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:44.560
Yeasted recipes are
their whole other bird.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.720
You need more yeast,
you need more liquid,

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.460
often you need more
eggs, you need more time.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:53.550
And so when people tried
to do, for example,

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.610
they try to do their
moms bread with my flour

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:59.180
mixture it doesn't work so well.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.100
Because there's so many
different variables

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.580
that go into a yeasted thing.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.720
So that's a challenge.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.490
Although like I said
I do have a sourdough

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.870
on my site, which is fun because
you develop your own sourdough

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:10.930
starter.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:12.660
And then from there
you make the bread

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:14.790
which is a fun-- if you
like that kind of thing--

00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:16.250
it's a fun process.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.340
And I harvest the wild yeast.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.870
I don't use commercial
yeast, I harvest wild yeast

00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:23.270
and I show you how to do that.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.340
So that's kind of fun.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.230
AUDIENCE: So a lot of
the gluten free baking

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.950
I do is for somebody who
is also rice intolerant

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.214
and I encounter that a lot
in the recipes in your--

00:48:33.214 --> 00:48:34.130
JEANNE SAUVAGE: Right.

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:35.620
AUDIENCE: --mix.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.160
So any suggestions
for direction to go

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.270
if rice flour is not
really an option?

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.490
JEANNE SAUVAGE: Yes.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.660
In my book, if you've
got the book I've got,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:48.600
some substitutions--
like for, with for the--

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.000
so I don't think I can
remember all of them.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.100
I have it on my site but I
think it's for the-- now this

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.530
will alter my mix and
things will behave and taste

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:58.350
a little different.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:00.920
But for the brown
rice flour it'll

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.430
tell you substitute sorghum.

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:05.680
For the white rice flour, tell
you just substitute millet

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.180
flour.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:11.910
For the sweet rice flour, I tell
you to substitute potato flour.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:15.570
For the tapioca flour you
substitute potato starch,

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.810
two different things.

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:18.630
And then you use
the xanthan gum.

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.369
So you're going to have
a different tasting mix,

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:23.660
it's going to be a little
more flavorful because millet

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:25.850
and sorghum taste has a taste.

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:27.950
Also you may want to
grind the sorghum cause

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:29.840
sorghum tends to
be kinda gritty.

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:33.230
And the millet too,
kind of depends.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:37.720
Also be aware that the starch
is weirdly enough-- even

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.540
tapioca starch will go bad-- way
quicker than you think they do.

00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.990
And I don't really
understand why.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:47.820
A lot of people tell me they
don't like tapioca starch.

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.380
Now the weird thing, tapioca
starch and tapioca flour,

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.680
same thing.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.460
Potato starch and potato
flour, not the same thing.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.980
So it's really complicated.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.940
But what I found
is starches tend

00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:00.420
to go very rancid very quickly.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:03.190
And people would tell me they
don't like tapioca flour often

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.620
its they don't like
rancid tapioca flour.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:11.060
If it tastes metallic and
disgusting, it's gone bad.

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.160
I think what I want to tell
you is if the potato starch is

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:18.350
tasting funky, then
to switch that out.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.910
So any of these flours, if
you're not using them quickly,

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:23.680
I recommend you store
them in the fridge

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:25.680
or you store them
in the freezer just

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.155
to make your not running
into the going bad thing.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:37.890
I had a fabulous photographer
and she made things-- well they

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.410
look like this--
but she also just

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.480
brought out how good they taste.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.160
So I am quite lucky to have her.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.990
I really enjoyed the whole
process of writing this book.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:51.480
It was fun and delicious.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.970
I spend most of 2011
in Christmas land,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:59.000
which is not a bad
place to be really.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.470
One thing I have in my book,
just as a little teaser,

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.130
I've got fortune
cookies in the book.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.490
So if you're gluten
free and you haven't

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:07.040
had a fortune cookie
in a long time,

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.460
you can have fortune cookies.

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.210
That's always fun.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:14.900
I have fruitcake, plum pudding,
pies, dinner rolls, cookies.

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.090
So thank you very
much for having me.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.550
It's been an honor and
it's been a lot of fun.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.210
I appreciate it.
