00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.405
IT'S TIME FOR OUR NEXT GAME.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:06.907
PHOTOBOMBS: CREEPY OR CUTE?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.110
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
AND IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:12.946
IT WILL SOON BE ONE OF YOUR
FAVORITES. PHOTOBOMBS CAN GO

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.414
ONE OF TWO WAYS: THEY CAN GO
CREEPY OR CUTE.

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:20.721
WELL I GUESS THEY CAN GO CREEPY,
CUTE OR KEANU.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.958
"CAN ONE OF YOU NINJA TURTLES
GIVE ME A RIDE?"

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:29.029
I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A
PHOTOBOMB THAT, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.331
DOES NOT INCLUDE KEANU. AND FOR
250 POINTS, YOU ARE GOING TO

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.567
GUESS IF IT'S CREEPY OR CUTE.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.401
FIRST ONE.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.602
THESE FUN SUMMER LADIES.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:36.670
WHAT IS BACK THERE? IT'S
PROBABLY GREAT. JADE.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.174
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY
CREEPY.

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:41.241
&gt;&gt; Chris: LET'S FIND OUT.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:42.209
&gt;&gt; NO PANTS?

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:43.844
Chris: YA, IT IS.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:45.512
&gt;&gt; IT WAS CREEPY.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.550
&gt;&gt; HE'S ACTUALLY MARRIED TO ALL
OF THOSE WOMEN.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:50.851
&gt;&gt; Chris: NEXT ONE.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.921
THIS STERN SCULPTURE, CREEPY OR
CUTE?

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:57.991
&gt;&gt; GOT TO BE CREEPY. HE'S
SITTING IN A SITTING POSITION.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.193
I'M NERVOUS WHERE THIS IS GOING.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:00.627
&gt;&gt; CUTE.

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.695
Chris: LET'S SEE.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:02.629
OH.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:03.964
&gt;&gt; WAIT A MINUTE.

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.700
&gt;&gt; IT'S BOTH.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.836
&gt;&gt; THAT'S CREEPY.

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.072
Chris: WHY IS IT CREEPY? BECAUSE
THEY'RE TWO BOY RABBITS?

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.841
&gt;&gt; IT'S JUST LOVE.

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:17.578
Chris: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.446
WHAT'S WRONG WITH GAY RABBITS?
WHY DO YOU HATE GAY RABBITS?

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.714
&gt;&gt; THIS IS AMERICA.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:24.318
&gt;&gt; I WAS LOOKING AT THE STATUE.

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.286
&gt;&gt; LEAVE HER ALONE.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.588
Chris: ASHLEY, THIS IS
BEAUTIFUL.

00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:29.890
&gt;&gt; IT'S BEAUTIFUL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.827
&gt;&gt; THAT CHICKEN IS SO LONELY IN
THE BACKGROUND.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.729
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T SEE THE CHICKEN.

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.364
Chris: I DIDN'T SEE THE
CHICKEN.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:38.065
AMAZING.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt; HE KEEPS TURNING UP HIS NOSE.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.169
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Chris: ALRIGHT.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:42.803
NEXT ONE.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.204
THIS PROM COUPLE.

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:45.272
CREEPY OR CUTE?

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:48.542
&gt;&gt; THIS HAS TO BE A CREEPY OLD
DAD OR SOMETHING.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.142
&gt;&gt; Chris: SOMETHING?

00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:50.377
&gt;&gt; A MIRROR.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.746
Chris: THESE TWO KIDS TOGETHER
READY FOR THEIR FIRST DATE.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.983
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING CREEPY.

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:58.252
Chris: WHAT COULD BE WEIRD
ABOUT THIS? OH, YES.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.788
&gt;&gt; CREEPY.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:07.127
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE LOSING YOUR VIRGINITY
IS KIND OF LIKE GOING TO WAR.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.330
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; Chris: I CAN'T TELL WHO HE'S

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.431
RELATED TO.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.635
I CAN'T TELL IF IT'S --
&gt;&gt; THE TWO ON THE ENDS ARE

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:15.469
TOGETHER?

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:20.807
[LAUGHING]
&gt;&gt; HE HAS BEEN HIRED FOR THE

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:21.808
NIGHT.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:22.943
&gt;&gt; Chris: THIS MOM AND TOT:
CREEPY OR CUTE?

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:28.615
&gt;&gt; THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY
CREEPY I FEEL IT.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.150
THE BABY FEELS IT.

00:02:30.184 --> 00:02:30.751
&gt;&gt; Chris: I THINK BOTH.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.487
&gt;&gt; OH.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.255
LOOK AT THAT SIDE BOOB.

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.291
LOOK AT THE SIDE BOOB!

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.125
OH!

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.594
&gt;&gt; WE SHOULD PUT SIDE BOOB IN
PICTURE.

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:43.263
&gt;&gt; SIDE BOOB OR SIDE HANDLE.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:44.665
&gt;&gt; SIDE HANDLE.

00:02:44.698 --> 00:02:49.803
WHAT'S HE HAVING? A MARGARITA?

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:49.903
&gt;&gt; SOMETHING BITTER, I'M SURE.
