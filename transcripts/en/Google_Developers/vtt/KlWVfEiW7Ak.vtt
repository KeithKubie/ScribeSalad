UTTAM KUMAR TRIPATHI:
Google Developer Groups

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.669
is a global program active
in over 130 countries.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.710
These committees work with
hundreds and thousands

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.020
of developers in
over 130 countries,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.070
working on activities and
events like Dev Fest, Study Jam,

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.687
hackathons, code labs.

00:00:17.687 --> 00:00:19.395
It's a great challenge
and avenue for you

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.440
if you want to have access
to innovators and makers.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.057

RALPH VINCENT REGALADO: What
drives me to be a community

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.970
organizer is really
to help developers

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.380
be better developers.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.140
We want to create an avenue
for them to learn new skills.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.176
We want them to collaborate
with other developers.

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:39.800
RAYAN AL ZAHAB: We
have a lot of events

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.560
in which we get the
trainings on technical stuff

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.400
and even on life
experience stuff.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.900
NITYA NARASIMHAN:
What the community

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.640
does is it doesn't matter
where you're from, your gender,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.796
ethnicity, none of it.

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:50.670
You walk in the door.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.624
You find someone like
you, and you connect.

00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:54.540
KATE HENDERSON: It's
just access to resources.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.960
And it is the
like-minded people,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.820
where you feel so much more
motivated and so much more

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.310
encouraged if you can
talk to people like that.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.018
DIEGO DE GRANDA: What
we are trying to do

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:06.200
is to create more like
content, documentation,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.014
code labs, videos about
different technologies.

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.180
SUYASH DIXIT: Our committee
focuses on local people,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.120
local developers.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.560
But bringing the more diverse
ideas from all around the globe

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.190
can help us reshape our
vision for the better way.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.960
SAM RAMJI:
Communities are places

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.390
where people find meaning,
where they find support,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.205
where they find the real value
in using any kind of tools.

00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.580
NITYA NARASIMHAN:
What Google has

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.770
done in helping GDG's growth
is basically giving them

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.530
the umbrella of here are things
that could help you coordinate.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.710
But they don't necessarily
try to tell us what to do.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.550
ROINA OCHIENG: We
do have resources

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.510
that are facilitated by Google.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.240
And what we try to do as
communities is make sure

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.520
that the content is relevant
to our individual communities.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.370
JENNIFER KOHL: If you
want to join a GDG,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.120
you can find us at
developers.google.com/groups.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.700
You can join thousands of
developers around the world

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760
just like you, doing
really amazing things.
