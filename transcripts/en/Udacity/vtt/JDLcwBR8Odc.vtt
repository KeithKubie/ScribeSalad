00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.569
You've got your answers. Let me tell you what

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.019
we think the answers are. Now the nice thing

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.320
about a decision tree sort of conceptually and intuitively,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.670
is that it really is asking a series of

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.100
questions. So, we can simply look at these rows

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.200
over here and the values that our features have

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.500
and we can just follow down the path of

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.840
the tree. So, in the first case. We have true.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
We have true for occupied, which means we want to go

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.470
down the right side of the tree. And check on the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.600
type. So in the first case, the type is pizza.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.329
And so we go down the first branch and that means.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.280
We do not go down the tree. So, the output is no go.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.610
&gt;&gt; So, okay, so now, I got a different answer. So, I looked at this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.020
and I said happiness is true. And, the bottom box says happiness true, you go.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.482
&gt;&gt; Right. So, you got the wrong, you got what I'm

00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:03.150
going to tell you is the wrong answer by going from the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.970
bottom of the tree up. The way decision trees work is

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.170
you always start at the root of the tree. That is

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
the very top of the tree. And you ask the questions in tho, in that order.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.600
&gt;&gt; It just seems like it would be faster to start at the bottom.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah but then you would never look at anything else in the tree.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.890
&gt;&gt; Good point. All right so.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.090
&gt;&gt; If you start at the bottom, you can't go up. Alright. So, okay, so let

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.100
me see if I get this straight. So I'll, I'll do the, the second instance. The

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.180
second instance, you say that we need to start at the top of the tree where

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.220
it says occupied. And so now I look

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.600
at the instance and the instance says that it's

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.170
false for occupied, so we go down that left branch and we hit no

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.140
go. Oh wait but now I haven't look at any of the other nodes.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.350
&gt;&gt; You don't have to look at any of the other

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.920
nodes because it turns out that if it's not occupied you

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.710
just don't go into a restaurant. So you're the type of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.870
person who doesn't like to be the only person in a restaurant.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.000
&gt;&gt; Got it, all right, so that's a no go. So

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.760
that's a no-go. That's an important point, Michael. Actually, you might also

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.690
notice that this whole tree, even if you look at every single feature in the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.518
tree, only has three of the attributes. It only

00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:15.860
looks at occupied. Type. And happiness.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.930
&gt;&gt; I see. So hot date is sort of irrelevant which is good,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.460
because in this case it's not really changing from instance to instance anyway.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.930
&gt;&gt; True. And neither is hungry you might notice.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, I am kind of hungry.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.270
&gt;&gt; Although, I'm always hungry. Although raining does in fact change

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.550
a little bit here and there. But it apparently it doesn't matter.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.320
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.890
&gt;&gt; Because you always take an umbrella.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.820
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, so let's quickly do the other three

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.090
and see if we we come to the same conclusion.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.120
&gt;&gt; Alright. Well all the instances that have occupied

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.410
false we know those are no go, right away.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.130
&gt;&gt; Oh, good point.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.010
&gt;&gt; So we can do it kind of out of order. And

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.450
the other ones are both occupied. One is tie and one is other.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.310
For the tie one we go.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.870
The other one, oh I see, for the other

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.830
one we have to look at whether there's happiness

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.860
or not, and in this instance happiness is true.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.220
So we get on the right branch and we go.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.600
&gt;&gt; And we go. Exactly it. So we notice hot date doesn't matter,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.640
hungry doesn't matter and rainy doesn't matter. And the only thing that matters

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.790
are whether you're occupied, what type

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:17.840
of restaurant you're at and whether you're

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.020
happy or not. Or whether the, the patrons in the restaurants are restaurant is,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.340
are happy or not. But, here's the other thing

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.290
about this. It's not just about the features. Let's tie

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.160
it back in to the other things, that we

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.980
mentioned in the beginning. This, in our case, this table

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.730
actually represents our testing set. It's the thing that

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.420
we're going to look at to determine whether we were

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.370
right or wrong. These are the examples that we're going to

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.210
do to see whether we generalize or not. And this

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.798
particular tree here is our candidate concept. So there's lots

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.722
and lots and lots of other trees that we might

00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:57.820
have used. We might have used a tree that also

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.960
took, asked questions about whether it was rainy or not

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.190
or asked questions about whether you were on a hot

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.970
date or not. But we didn't. We picked a specific

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.390
tree that had only these three features and only asked

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.830
in this particular way. So what we're going to talk about next.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.269
Is how we might decide whether to choose this tree over any

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.100
of the other possible number of trees that we might have chosen instead.
