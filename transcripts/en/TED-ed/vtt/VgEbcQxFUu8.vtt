00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:11.072
During the warmer months,
especially at night during the full moon,

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:15.223
horseshoe crabs emerge 
from the sea to spawn.

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:18.402
Waiting for them are teams
of lab workers

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:21.704
who capture the horseshoe crabs
by the hundreds of thousands,

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:22.993
take them to labs,

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:25.204
harvest their cerulean blood,

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.203
then return them to the sea.

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:31.823
Oddly enough, we capture horseshoe crabs
on the beach

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:35.623
because that's the only place
we know we can find them.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:40.945
A female horseshoe crab lays as many
as 20 batches of up to 4,000 eggs

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.663
on her annual visit to the beach.

00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:44.824
When the eggs hatch,

00:00:44.824 --> 00:00:47.864
the juvenile horseshoe crabs
often stay near shore,

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:51.393
periodically shedding their shells
as they grow.

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:53.365
Once they leave 
these shallow waters,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:58.193
they don't return until they
reach sexual maturity ten years later.

00:00:58.193 --> 00:01:03.236
Despite our best efforts, we don't
know where they spend those years.

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.756
Though we've spotted the occasional 
horseshoe crab

00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:09.006
as deep as 200 meters below
the ocean's surface,

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:14.566
we only see large groups of adults
when they come ashore to spawn.

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.066
Horseshoe crab blood contains
cells called amebocytes

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.595
that protect them 
from infection by viruses,

00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:21.456
fungi,

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.217
and bacteria.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:26.016
Amebocytes form gels around
these invaders

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:29.257
to prevent them from spreading infections.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.937
This isn't unusual.

00:01:30.937 --> 00:01:33.824
All animals have protective 
immune systems.

00:01:33.824 --> 00:01:37.686
But horseshoe crab amebocytes
are exceptionally sensitive

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:39.908
to bacterial endotoxins.

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:45.117
Endotoxins are molecules
from the cell walls of certain bacteria,

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:46.847
including E. coli.

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:51.068
Large amounts of them are released
when bacterial cells die,

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:54.137
and they can make us sick
if they enter the blood stream.

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:58.897
Many of the medicines and medical devices
we rely on can become contaminated,

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:02.399
so we have to test them
before they touch our blood.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.268
We do have tests called Gram stains
that detect bacteria,

00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:09.058
but they can't recognize endotoxins

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:13.749
which can be there even when
bacteria aren't present.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.257
So scientists use an extract called LAL

00:02:17.257 --> 00:02:20.238
produced from harvested 
horseshoe crab blood

00:02:20.238 --> 00:02:22.518
to test for endotoxins.

00:02:22.518 --> 00:02:26.280
They add LAL to a medicine sample,
and if gels form,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.560
bacterial endotoxins are present.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.539
Today, the LAL test is used so widely

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.787
that millions of people who've
never seen a horseshoe crab

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:38.231
have been protected by their blood.

00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:44.040
If you've ever had an injection,
that probably includes you.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.770
How did horseshoe crabs end up
with such special blood?

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.091
Like other invertebrates,

00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:52.231
the horseshoe crab has an open
circulatory system.

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:57.390
This means their blood isn't contained
in blood vessels, like ours.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.690
Instead, horseshoe crab blood
flows freely through the body cavity

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.990
and comes in direct contact with tissues.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:10.342
If bacteria enters their blood,
it can quickly spread over a large area.

00:03:10.342 --> 00:03:11.732
Pair this vulnerability

00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:16.641
with the horseshoe crab's bacteria-filled 
ocean and shoreline habitats,

00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:21.711
and it's easy to see why they need
such a sensitive immune response.

00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:24.402
Horseshoe crabs survived 
mass extinction events

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:29.752
that wiped out over 90% of life on Earth
and killed off the dinosaurs,

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:31.462
but they're not invincible.

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:36.482
And the biggest disruptions they've faced
in millions of years come from us.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.752
Studies have shown that up to
15% of horseshoe crabs

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:43.283
die in the process of having
their blood harvested.

00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:48.002
And recent research suggests
this number may be even higher.

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:51.782
Researchers have also observed
fewer females returning to spawn

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:54.763
at some of the most harvested areas.

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:59.294
Our impact on horseshoe crabs extends
beyond the biomedical industry, too.

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:02.134
Coastal development 
destroys spawning sites,

00:04:02.134 --> 00:04:06.314
and horseshoe crabs are also
killed for fishing bait.

00:04:06.314 --> 00:04:10.113
There's ample evidence that
their populations are shrinking.

00:04:10.113 --> 00:04:11.944
Some researchers have started working

00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:15.263
to synthesize horseshoe crab 
blood in the lab.

00:04:15.263 --> 00:04:18.973
For now, we're unlikely to stop
our beach trips,

00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:23.924
but hopefully, a synthetic alternative
will someday eliminate our reliance

00:04:23.924 --> 00:04:26.493
on the blood of these ancient creatures.
