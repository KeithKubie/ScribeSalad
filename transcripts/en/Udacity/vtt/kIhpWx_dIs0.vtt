Here are the three equations. Great work if you found each of these. We'll

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:10.058
start by making this base be the base for our exponent. So 3 is written down

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:15.343
here. The answer of a logarithm is an exponent. So, we know this 2 is going to

00:00:15.343 --> 00:00:20.310
be the exponent for our base 3. And this should make perfect sense since 3

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.940
squared equals 9. This is that number. For the second one, we'll repeat the

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.843
same process. The base of our logarithm is 5, so 5 will be the base for our

00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:36.158
exponent. The answer of a logarithm is an exponent. So this 3 is the exponent

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:43.545
for our base of 5. And of course 5 to the third equals 125. And finally we'll

00:00:43.545 --> 00:00:49.435
have a base of one fifth here, an exponent of negative 2 which equals 25.

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:53.341
Remember that this negative exponent will flip over or do the reciprocal of

00:00:53.341 --> 00:01:00.178
this base. So, one fifth will become 5 and then we'll square it to get 25. Nice

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:03.860
work if you got each of these right. Even if you got two of them right,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.800
fantastic.
