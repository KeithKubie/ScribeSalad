00:00:00.051 --> 00:00:03.150
- [Voiceover] How do we count the flowers?

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.150
So, this first choice,
they go one, two, three,

00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:11.117
and then they don't count
this one and then they skip it

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:14.017
and they go four, five, six,

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:15.617
and then they skip this one again,

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:17.317
and then they say seven, eight.

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:18.883
That's not how you count flowers!

00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:21.283
You'd say this is four, this is five, six,

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:23.884
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:23.884 --> 00:00:26.217
So, this first choice is not right.

00:00:26.217 --> 00:00:27.850
Now, the second one looks better.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.783
One, two, three, four,
they didn't skip this one,

00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:35.450
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.497
That one looks good so
I'll click right over here

00:00:38.497 --> 00:00:40.367
and check my answer.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.484
How do we count the mice?

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:47.484
Let's see, one, two, this
isn't the third mouse!

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:49.050
This is the second mouse!

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020
This is crazy, this isn't right.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.417
All right, this one over here.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:56.050
One, two, three, four, five,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.550
six, seven, this is right.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.117
Up here they skipped the number two,

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:03.050
this should be the second
mouse, not the third mouse!

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.060
All right.

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:06.150
Let's keep going.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.517
Type the missing numbers.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.250
It says count the ladybugs.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.617
Type the missing numbers in the boxes.

00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:15.550
All right, this is ladybug number one.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.550
Two, then let me type three,
then let me type four.

00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:23.423
It's a lot of fun.

00:01:23.423 --> 00:01:25.217
Count the flowers.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.583
Type the missing numbers in the boxes.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:31.184
This is flower number
one, flower number two.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:33.150
Just gonna type that right in there.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.217
Check it, lemme do one more.

00:01:35.217 --> 00:01:37.283
How do we count the flowers?

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.883
So, we saw one like this
a few questions ago.

00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:43.684
One, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.450
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.084
That one looks good.

00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:50.350
This one, just like the
last time, they skipped,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.850
actually they skipped the same ones.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.017
This wouldn't be the right way to do it.

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:56.100
So, we select this one right
here, and then we're done.
