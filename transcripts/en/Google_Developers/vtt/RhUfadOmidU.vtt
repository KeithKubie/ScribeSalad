MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Thanks for tuning

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.710
into this special edition
of Google Developers Live.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.790
Today, we're
featuring Hadi Partovi

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.329
from code.org in celebration
of computer science education

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:16.860
week.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.640
You can find out more about
computer science education week

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.126
and the Hour of Code
campaign at csedweek.org.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.600
Hi, my name is Mamie
Rheingold, and I'm

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.280
your host for this special
edition of Google Developers

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.229
Live.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.050
Our guest today is Hadi Partovi.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.230
And after getting his Bachelor's
and Master's in computer

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.290
science from Harvard, he
went on to Microsoft in 1994,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.230
where he joined a small team
to grow Internet Explorer.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.340
He has since advised and
invested in multiple start-ups,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.990
including Dropbox and
Facebook, and he also

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.110
founded many companies of his
own, the most recent of which

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.580
is code.org.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.650
So Hadi, I'd love to start by
hearing more from you about why

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.560
should we all care
about computer science?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.820
What is your vision
with code.org?

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.474
And tell us more about this
week's Hour of Code events.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:10.265
HADI PARTOVI: Sure.

00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:13.980
Well, code.org was a realization
that computers are now

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.570
everywhere.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.500
They're not just on your desktop
and in your laptops or at work.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.920
They're in your pockets,
they're in your cars,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.880
they're in your appliances.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.900
They're literally are
all over the place,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.980
and every industry in the
world depends on software.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.140
Whether it's transportation,
agriculture, food,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.970
and yet the vast
majority of Americans

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.320
have no idea how
these things work,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410
and the vast majority
of schools don't even

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.220
offer courses in introducing
these things to you.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.530
And a lot of people think
that code.org or other sites

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.510
like this are designed to
basically produce more software

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.860
engineers to get jobs at
companies like Google.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.940
And that's a side effect of
people learning how to code.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.270
My main vision is that every
student in every school

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.430
should have an opportunity
to learn not because they

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.030
want to get a job at Google.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.550
And computer science,
it is a class

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.479
that you can take
and get a great job,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.211
but more importantly,
it's a class

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:11.960
that you should take
if you want to become

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.790
a doctor in the 21st century or
if you want to become a lawyer,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.860
or a journalist, or
even the president.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.620
Every career that you can think
of in the modern day world

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.940
should have some
background in this.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.700
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Great, and so what

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.204
are these Hour of Code events?

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:31.370
HADI PARTOVI: The Hour of
Code was a coming together

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.661
of a number of ideas we had
for how to promote computer

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:37.210
science, not just to students,
but to parents and to teachers,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.870
to help remove the veil
of mystery that separates

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.110
the average person from
the Mark Zuckerbergs

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.770
or the genius
coders of the world,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.296
and to help everybody
learn that not only this

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:49.420
is important to learn, but
that it's easy to learn,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.197
that a seven-year-old can start
basic computer programing.

00:02:52.197 --> 00:02:54.030
And starting with that
idea, we thought what

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.780
if we could get millions
of students in schools

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.800
and communities worldwide
to try to learn just one

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.850
hour of computer
science and how could we

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.300
bring the best companies,
organizations, celebrities,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.900
governments to come to
bear to basically grow this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.450
into a real movement?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.460
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: And
since this is about

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.232
learning to code, when did
you first learn to code?

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.690
HADI PARTOVI: The very, very
first computer program I wrote

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.330
was on a programmable
calculator,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.460
I think, when I was
around eight years old.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.440
And my first computer I got
when I was about 10 years old

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.230
was a Commodore 64.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.010
And my dad gave
me this computer,

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.640
yet there was no
games on it out--

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.810
we were living in Iran,
where you couldn't even

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.460
buy a computer in
that country there.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.156
It was sort of
imported from Italy.

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:43.280
And they said, if you want
to play any games on it,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.729
you have to write them yourself.

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.270
And my twin brother
and I immediately

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.290
started finding magazines that
had sort of basic programs

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.930
that you could type
into the computer

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.074
to create your own game.

00:03:53.074 --> 00:03:55.740
And then starting from there, we
learned how to change the games

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.594
and write our own.

00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:57.510
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.730
I just took two months
off to learn how to code.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.030
And like learning anything
new, it can be hard.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.850
And for me it was like
learning to see and think

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.160
in a whole new way.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.170
And sometimes I could
take just an hour

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.450
to understand the problem
I was trying to solve.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.460
So tell me more
about what you're

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.529
envisioning kids doing
in an hour of code.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.610
HADI PARTOVI: So as you've
learned yourself in doing it,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.630
coding and writing
computer programs

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.570
isn't about learning
a new language.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.370
And the average
computer language

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.340
has just about 50 words in it.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.270
And I compare it a
lot more to LEGOs.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.880
When you use LEGOs,
it's not like there's

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.470
10,000 different LEGO blocks.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.910
There's about 50
different major blocks.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.370
But the art is in how you
build something complicated

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.700
using that limited
set of commands.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.260
And the most
important thing a kid

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.880
can learn in one
hour of writing code

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.160
is to realize that there's not
a lot to memorize and it it's

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.780
more about solving problems
and creating whatever you want.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.230
And unleashing the creativity
and empowering a kid

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.410
to realize, well, I can
actually do this stuff.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.966
That's our number one goal
at the end of one hour.

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:05.920
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.540
Yeah, and for those
kids that know

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.292
they don't want to
be engineers, they

00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:12.250
don't want to grow up to
be a computer science,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.245
why should they participate?

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:16.230
HADI PARTOVI: At
least 95 people don't

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.480
want to grow up and become
a software engineer.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.310
And our goal is to get all
of them to learn the basics.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.200
And the basics of
computer science

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.100
mean not just
learning how to code,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.940
but also learning how does
the internet work, what's

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.420
a software virus.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.640
When I went to high
school, every single school

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.320
and every single student
taught and learned

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.610
how electricity works
or how to dissect a frog

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.420
to see the digestive system.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.080
And in this century,
schools should

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.920
teach how do you effectively
dissect an app to learn

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.466
the insides [INAUDIBLE] to that.

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:50.590
And that's relevant if you
want to become a doctor,

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.350
health care is dominated
now by technology.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.670
If you want to become
a lawyer, understanding

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.790
IP law or understanding
how you're

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.440
going to regulate
things like the NSA.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.680
We see our government stumbling
with efforts in technology,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.640
and it's not because they need
to become software engineers,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.320
but they need to have at least
more of a basic understanding

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.272
than the absolute zero that
our schools currently offer.

00:06:12.272 --> 00:06:13.980
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: So
it's like the physics

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.154
or the biology of
the digital world?

00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:17.070
HADI PARTOVI: Exactly.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.850
This year's Nobel Prize
winners in chemistry

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.570
were computer scientists.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.570
That's the best way
of realizing this

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.862
is a field that
impacts everything.

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:31.070
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: I love that.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.630
And since this is
Google Developers Live,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.020
we have a lot of developers
out there tuning in.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.790
And so what can
people who are already

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.300
developers, what
can they do to help

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.750
your mission with code.org?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.380
HADI PARTOVI: So most
developers automatically jump

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.880
to think this is awesome.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.100
If you're already a
developer, you already

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.680
realize that you have a special
power that most people don't

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.560
and that you can harness
thousands of computers

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.450
to do your bidding, which
is an unusual thing.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.730
There's no other skill
that helps amplify

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.980
the creativity of the human
mind that the way computer

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.770
programming does.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.270
And sharing that is something
that developers very naturally

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.480
want to do.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.980
The best ways to do that
are to basically get

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.350
people in your community,
especially your local school,

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.840
but if not a local school,
an after school club,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.440
like a Boy Scouts
or Girl Scouts,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.417
or so on, to add
computer science.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:30.000
It's harder to get
schools to do this,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.325
because they are
government organizations.

00:07:32.325 --> 00:07:34.700
But Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts,
and boys and girls clubs,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.790
and so on readily can
engage in this stuff.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.810
To make it easier
for developers,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.440
we've got a sign-up page,
where engineers can sign up

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.790
as volunteers to say I
want to get involved,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.435
which will then actually
help local communities who

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:52.100
want a software engineer as a
mentor come and pull them in.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.850
We've also released a
20-hour online course

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:59.370
that's something that comes
after the first hour of code

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.250
to teach you 20 hours
worth of more computer

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.430
programming and also
learning about things

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.710
like how the internet works.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.168
And that's an online
course you can

00:08:07.168 --> 00:08:10.560
teach to your kids
and family members,

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.034
or bring to a local
school or club.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:13.950
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.540
And also our developer
community is global.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.680
And I noticed that for
an hour of code, it says,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.200
you don't even need a
computer to participate.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.990
So I want to learn
more about that.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.450
How can people participate,
if they don't have access

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:29.157
to computers or the internet?

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:31.240
HADI PARTOVI: Yeah, so
there's both you can do it,

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.419
if you don't have
a computer, you

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.210
could do it if you
don't have the internet.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.299
We've tried to solve for all
the versions of this stuff.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:41.200
If you have absolutely
nothing, there's

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.270
paper and pen exercises, where
somebody can write programs

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.690
on a piece of paper.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.810
And it's more like sort
of social exercise,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.820
where one kid pretends like
they're the computer managing

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.239
a robotic arm, doing what
another kid's program is

00:08:56.239 --> 00:08:57.030
telling them to do.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.190
And we have a bunch of puzzles
like how does a robotic arm

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.720
take a stack of cups and
then build a Christmas tree

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.226
pattern out of them?

00:09:04.226 --> 00:09:05.850
And one kid needs to
write the program,

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.110
but the other kid to
execute to do that.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.840
Now, in a lot of the modern
world people have computers,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.840
but they don't have great
internet connectivity,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.250
or they don't have
lots of computers.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.760
But our tutorials,
we have tutorials

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.960
that work on an offline
computer or on a smartphone,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.050
or a tablet.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.800
Smartphones are pretty
popular these days.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.490
And you can learn
to code on one.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.180
And that's a great way to start.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.679
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Yeah, it's actually

00:09:30.679 --> 00:09:32.841
when I was learning to
code, writing things out

00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:34.340
and white boarding
has been actually

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.530
like the first step
for anything just

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.280
to understand what is it
that we're trying to do

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.775
and map out how to
break code to do that.

00:09:43.775 --> 00:09:44.670
So like that.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.140
HADI PARTOVI: Yeah, it's
all about problem solving.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.056
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Yeah.

00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:50.330
HADI PARTOVI: It forces you to
organize your thoughts better

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.300
than most other
things you learn.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.070
And it's interesting
that the ability

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.500
to organize your thoughts and
to break a big problem down

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.050
into smaller problems
is really useful,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.620
even if you want to become
a lawyer or a manager.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.120
Learning how to
break down a problem

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.290
is really valuable for
learning how to build a team

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.044
and manage who does what.

00:10:10.044 --> 00:10:11.210
They're very related skills.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.085
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Yeah,
applies to everything.

00:10:13.085 --> 00:10:15.790
It's like essential life skill.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:21.190
And so what happens if 10
million kids all learn to code.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.269
What does that future
look like to you?

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:26.310
HADI PARTOVI: First of
all, hopefully our servers

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.260
will hold up.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.629
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Yeah.

00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:30.420
HADI PARTOVI: We don't
know how many people

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.110
are going to hit our site
for the Hour of Code,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.832
but it's a little frightening.

00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:40.260
But if 10 million kids
learn at least the basics

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.550
of computer science, I think,
a number of things will happen.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.530
First of all, we'll
hit an inflection

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.190
point of effectively, whether
the school system wants it

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.220
or not, the world
audience is going

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.350
to start learning coding and
computer science at a larger

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.150
scale than they have been.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.860
A large percentage
of the population

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.150
has some familiarity
with this stuff.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:07.250
I think, you'll
see more innovation

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.220
in every field software
can create innovation.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.770
We just heard about Amazon using
drones to deliver packages.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.980
We hear about nanobots being
used in your bloodstream

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.130
to cure illnesses by having
a little robotic thing

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.960
in your blood
doing stuff to you.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.080
The hardest challenges
in most of these things

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.540
are actually in the
software and the code.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.980
Building a drone is easy.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.980
Programming that drone so
it doesn't run into a tree,

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.690
that's actually
where it's harder

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.390
or how it communicates
with other drones

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.820
so they don't hit each other.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.600
So what do you think about
transportation, communication,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.760
medicine, agriculture, food.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.820
All over in every
industry, it's the software

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.760
that actually is
driving the innovation.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.300
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: And so
after this week, then what?

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.070
Where do you want to see
code.org go from here?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.270
HADI PARTOVI: So code.org
is a surprisingly small

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.360
organization.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.990
We have about, I think,
16 full-time employees.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.500
But we have a lot of
ambition, a lot of big ideas.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.120
There's, at least,
four different things

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.000
we're going to be doing
after the Hour of Code.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.250
One, we have curriculum at
the elementary school level

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.310
that we built in partnership
with Google and Microsoft,

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.832
and Facebook, and
Twitter employees.

00:12:25.832 --> 00:12:28.040
So we want to extend that
to out to curriculum tools.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.581
They go all the way
from kindergarten

00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:30.720
through 12th grade.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.550
That's point one.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.020
Point two is actually getting
this into public schools.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.990
By fall of next year, we should,
basically, put computer science

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.730
into about 400 schools.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.930
We want to get to 4,000
schools and 40,000 schools.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.030
So that's a multi-year effort
bringing computer science

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.480
into schools.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.670
And then the third
thing we're working on

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.720
is changing policies.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.990
In 36 states in the
country, computer science

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.890
doesn't count towards high
school graduation requirements

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.125
in math or science.

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:02.875
And that's actually a
great way developers

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:05.359
can help petition their
school board saying,

00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:07.900
why don't you fix the graduation
rules so computer science is

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.191
treated as a matter of science.

00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:10.257
So we're lobbying.

00:13:10.257 --> 00:13:12.590
And then lastly, we're going
to continue doing marketing

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.940
to help get
underrepresented groups

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.340
to engage in computer science
more, especially girls

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.724
and minorities.

00:13:18.724 --> 00:13:19.640
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.042
These are big, big problems
you are trying to solve.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.590
Have there been any
obstacles along the way?

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.690
I mean, education
policy, those are

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.225
big systems you're changing.

00:13:32.225 --> 00:13:34.250
HADI PARTOVI: Yeah, it's
funny, on the policy

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.270
side, any time you want to
try to change the system,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.180
you expect obstacles.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.170
I've never worked on
anything, where there's

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:48.124
been such an engagement of
people embracing what we're

00:13:48.124 --> 00:13:49.290
doing and getting behind it.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.010
At the policy
level, we've changed

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.560
on the order of six
states in six months,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.480
which is unheard of.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.720
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Whoa, that's fast.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.660
HADI PARTOVI: Yeah that's
really, really fast,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.760
because the opposition
is nonexistent.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.734
Nobody says, oh no, we
shouldn't be doing this.

00:14:02.734 --> 00:14:04.150
The hardest
opposition, though, we

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.400
have is in changing the public
schools to offer a new class.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.329
And because their
mindset is literally,

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:13.370
if we add this, what are
we going to need to cut?

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.450
And I've had conversations with
districts' heads of curriculum,

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:19.050
when they say, I guess
this is an elective,

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.140
so we need to probably
cut another elective.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.870
What if we cut ceramics?

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.780
What are those kids who want
to do ceramics are going to do?

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.750
I'm just overwhelmed just
thinking, well, first of all,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.630
they can learn ceramics
in an after-school class.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.120
Let's teach computer
science in the real school.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.250
There's no jobs in
ceramics, there's

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.330
a million jobs in computer
science over the next 10 years.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.270
And then, lastly, why don't
we let the kids decide.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:47.800
Why is the school deciding
that isn't available,

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.010
but ceramics is.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.640
If you have to make
a choice, choose

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.950
the one that's going to be more
popular, let the kids decide,

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.070
rather than you deciding.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.770
But either way, that's by
far the hardest obstacle

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.830
is finding school districts who
are willing to create change.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.950
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: And
so just to recap,

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.320
what are the things that folks
can do after they watch this

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.700
if they're inspired to
help you and your mission.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.384
How can they help?

00:15:12.384 --> 00:15:13.800
HADI PARTOVI: How
people can help?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.710
The easiest way is sign
the petition at code.org.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.340
The next easiest way is
doing Hour of Code yourself.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.900
Or if you know it already, do
it with a brother or sister,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.440
or daughter, or
son, or your mother.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.700
Harder ways, you
can spend some money

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.730
and buy one of our teachers to
help promote code, especially,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.730
if you're a girl.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.310
And the best way you help
if you're an engineer

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.527
is get your local school
to teach computer science.

00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:42.110
[INAUDIBLE] on our
website to help you

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.740
do that, to help you
advocate for that.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.240
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
That's great, Hadi.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.430
Thank you for joining us and
thank you all for tuning in.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.960
Make sure to join in on the
fun at code.org during Computer

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.580
Science Education Week.
