of really happy people as soon as we did

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300
of really happy people as soon as we did
 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.120
of really happy people as soon as we did
that but it wasn't on previously and

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130
that but it wasn't on previously and
 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.160
that but it wasn't on previously and
it's worth mentioning that we did turn

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.170
it's worth mentioning that we did turn
 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.820
it's worth mentioning that we did turn
it on so a new wind for our efforts and

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830
it on so a new wind for our efforts and
 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.140
it on so a new wind for our efforts and
what we were trying to do starting in

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.150
what we were trying to do starting in
 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.810
what we were trying to do starting in
2009 to make the site faster 2009 was a

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820
2009 to make the site faster 2009 was a
 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.340
2009 to make the site faster 2009 was a
year we were focusing on tools and

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350
year we were focusing on tools and
 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.100
year we were focusing on tools and
libraries we basically built a new build

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110
libraries we basically built a new build
 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.470
libraries we basically built a new build
system for front-end files and this was

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:11.480
system for front-end files and this was
 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.970
system for front-end files and this was
our first foray into doing automatic

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:12.980
our first foray into doing automatic
 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.660
our first foray into doing automatic
builds we used to manually on tar

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:16.670
builds we used to manually on tar
 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.810
builds we used to manually on tar
uncompressed files in production and and

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:19.820
uncompressed files in production and and
 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.310
uncompressed files in production and and
we were actually pulling changes from

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320
we were actually pulling changes from
 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.530
we were actually pulling changes from
version control as opposed to somebody's

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540
version control as opposed to somebody's
 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.060
version control as opposed to somebody's
home directory they would arrange the

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070
home directory they would arrange the
 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.620
home directory they would arrange the
files the way they wanted them to appear

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.630
files the way they wanted them to appear
 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.330
files the way they wanted them to appear
we would package them up and someone

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340
we would package them up and someone
 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.940
we would package them up and someone
would manually unpackage it now it's

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:30.950
would manually unpackage it now it's
 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.380
would manually unpackage it now it's
coming from version control directly

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390
coming from version control directly
 

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.630
coming from version control directly
there were semi stateful rollbacks there

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.640
there were semi stateful rollbacks there
 

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.130
there were semi stateful rollbacks there
was a rollback mechanism but you could

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140
was a rollback mechanism but you could
 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.340
was a rollback mechanism but you could
really only rollback the latest one if

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350
really only rollback the latest one if
 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.200
really only rollback the latest one if
you try to roll back any before that you

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.210
you try to roll back any before that you
 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.760
you try to roll back any before that you
would end up in an unknown state and

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:42.770
would end up in an unknown state and
 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.070
would end up in an unknown state and
that was really bad but the really

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080
that was really bad but the really
 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.240
that was really bad but the really
exciting bit of it was that the other

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.250
exciting bit of it was that the other
 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.430
exciting bit of it was that the other
that there were hooks for build scripts

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440
that there were hooks for build scripts
 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.160
that there were hooks for build scripts
and we could expand on this process

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.170
and we could expand on this process
 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.950
and we could expand on this process
basically dynamically so we did just

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960
basically dynamically so we did just
 

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.620
basically dynamically so we did just
that for our CSS it was the first system

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:56.630
that for our CSS it was the first system
 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.690
that for our CSS it was the first system
to use those new hooks and we wrote a

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:58.700
to use those new hooks and we wrote a
 

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.640
to use those new hooks and we wrote a
bunch of proprietary scripts to not only

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:00.650
bunch of proprietary scripts to not only
 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.500
bunch of proprietary scripts to not only
unravel the add import directives to

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.510
unravel the add import directives to
 

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.380
unravel the add import directives to
make one concatenated file we wrote a

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:05.390
make one concatenated file we wrote a
 

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.850
make one concatenated file we wrote a
script to also try and remove some of

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860
script to also try and remove some of
 

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.790
script to also try and remove some of
the whitespace and the comments this is

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800
the whitespace and the comments this is
 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.140
the whitespace and the comments this is
all downstream from development work

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.150
all downstream from development work
 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.060
all downstream from development work
which is also a really good point we

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:13.070
which is also a really good point we
 

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.280
which is also a really good point we
didn't want our developers to feel that

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.290
didn't want our developers to feel that
 

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.390
didn't want our developers to feel that
they couldn't comment their work

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400
they couldn't comment their work
 

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.840
they couldn't comment their work
adequately while we were doing this we

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:19.850
adequately while we were doing this we
 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.150
adequately while we were doing this we
were working on our CSS framework we we

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160
were working on our CSS framework we we
 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.130
were working on our CSS framework we we
took the concepts from our design and we

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.140
took the concepts from our design and we
 

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.050
took the concepts from our design and we
turned them into these base files that

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.060
turned them into these base files that
 

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.880
turned them into these base files that
can be used across the site we split

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:27.890
can be used across the site we split
 

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.710
can be used across the site we split
code into reusable modules and actually

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720
code into reusable modules and actually
 

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.200
code into reusable modules and actually
tried to reuse them in a sane way we aim

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.210
tried to reuse them in a sane way we aim
 

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.940
tried to reuse them in a sane way we aim
to have a single entry point at the top

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:33.950
to have a single entry point at the top
 

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.610
to have a single entry point at the top
of the page while we were doing this we

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:36.620
of the page while we were doing this we
 

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.050
of the page while we were doing this we
were also trying to lock down rjs

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:38.060
were also trying to lock down rjs
 

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.720
were also trying to lock down rjs
development we introduced a new

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:39.730
development we introduced a new
 

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.880
development we introduced a new
top-level namespace called nytd and the

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:42.890
top-level namespace called nytd and the
 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.110
top-level namespace called nytd and the
module pattern also called the

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:44.120
module pattern also called the
 

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.480
module pattern also called the
immediately invoked function expression

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:46.490
immediately invoked function expression
 

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.300
immediately invoked function expression
this is a great way to to wrap all your

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.310
this is a great way to to wrap all your
 

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.220
this is a great way to to wrap all your
variables in a closure although thanks

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:51.230
variables in a closure although thanks

variables in a closure although thanks
to Colt I'm now afraid of closures we

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:55.400
to Colt I'm now afraid of closures we
 

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.890
to Colt I'm now afraid of closures we
introduced prototype j/s as a Dom

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:56.900
introduced prototype j/s as a Dom
 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.680
introduced prototype j/s as a Dom

really reflect

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440
really reflect

really reflect
the amount of meetings and discussions

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:01.970
the amount of meetings and discussions
 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.790
the amount of meetings and discussions
and debates and fights we had over this

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800
and debates and fights we had over this

decision but prototype.js

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:05.750
decision but prototype.js
 

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.080

went out in the end we also tried to

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.090
went out in the end we also tried to
 

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.790
went out in the end we also tried to
write our own proprietary asynchronous

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800
write our own proprietary asynchronous
 

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.230
write our own proprietary asynchronous
JavaScript loader in the days before

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:11.240
JavaScript loader in the days before
 

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.010
JavaScript loader in the days before
required Jas any of these these lab Jas

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.020
required Jas any of these these lab Jas
 

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.210
required Jas any of these these lab Jas
any of these loaders they didn't exist

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.220
any of these loaders they didn't exist
 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.830
any of these loaders they didn't exist
we try to write our own didn't really

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:17.840
we try to write our own didn't really
 

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.360
we try to write our own didn't really
work it became a synchronous JavaScript

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.370
work it became a synchronous JavaScript
 

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.740
work it became a synchronous JavaScript
loader so we started with our homepage

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:23.750
loader so we started with our homepage
 

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.660
loader so we started with our homepage
and there's a number of reasons why it's

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:25.670
and there's a number of reasons why it's
 

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.340
and there's a number of reasons why it's
a it's published very frequently so this

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.350
a it's published very frequently so this
 

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.720
a it's published very frequently so this
problem with legacy markup really

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:28.730
problem with legacy markup really
 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.670
problem with legacy markup really
doesn't become an issue it gets the most

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680
doesn't become an issue it gets the most
 

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.440
doesn't become an issue it gets the most
traffic so it has the potential to save

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:32.450
traffic so it has the potential to save
 

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.170
traffic so it has the potential to save
people the most amount of time it has an

people the most amount of time it has an
 

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.900
people the most amount of time it has an
isolated implementation basically it's

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:37.910
isolated implementation basically it's
 

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.700
isolated implementation basically it's
if something went wrong nothing would go

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:39.710
if something went wrong nothing would go
 

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.170
if something went wrong nothing would go
wrong on other parts of the site and

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.180
wrong on other parts of the site and

something were really bad it'd get

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360
something were really bad it'd get

something were really bad it'd get
noticed before it got out into

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:46.220
noticed before it got out into
 

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.300
noticed before it got out into
production so in November 2009 we put

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.310
production so in November 2009 we put
 

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.370
production so in November 2009 we put
our CSS optimizations on the home page

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:51.380
our CSS optimizations on the home page
 

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.430
our CSS optimizations on the home page
it saved 25 HTTP connections to what are

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440
it saved 25 HTTP connections to what are
 

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.950
it saved 25 HTTP connections to what are
very small CSS files the first paint

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:56.960
very small CSS files the first paint
 

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.480
very small CSS files the first paint
occurred a whole second earlier and the

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.490
occurred a whole second earlier and the
 

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.970
occurred a whole second earlier and the
home page really felt faster and we were

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:00.980
home page really felt faster and we were
 

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.240
home page really felt faster and we were
very happy by this so in 2010 we wanted

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.250
very happy by this so in 2010 we wanted
 

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.000
very happy by this so in 2010 we wanted
to continue this this these efforts the

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.010
to continue this this these efforts the
 

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.740
to continue this this these efforts the
CSS framework basically rolled out to

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:08.750
CSS framework basically rolled out to
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.050
CSS framework basically rolled out to
our section and article pages again we

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.060
our section and article pages again we
 

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.370
our section and article pages again we
were focusing on the single entry point

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:12.380
were focusing on the single entry point
 

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.970
were focusing on the single entry point
but we never we never optimized them

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:14.980
but we never we never optimized them
 

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.990
but we never we never optimized them
there were some concerns with these

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000
there were some concerns with these
 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.670
there were some concerns with these
proprietary scripts and it turns out

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680
proprietary scripts and it turns out
 

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.230
proprietary scripts and it turns out
later when we did an audit that we were

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240
later when we did an audit that we were
 

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.850
later when we did an audit that we were
right to be concerned there were

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:21.860
right to be concerned there were
 

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.410
right to be concerned there were
references to missing files there were

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:23.420
references to missing files there were
 

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.540
references to missing files there were
at import cycles it would include be

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:25.550
at import cycles it would include be
 

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.310
at import cycles it would include be
include see include a and if you're ever

curious about what the browser does to

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000
curious about what the browser does to
 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.030
curious about what the browser does to
get out of that I still don't know the

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040
get out of that I still don't know the
 

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.550
get out of that I still don't know the
answer and there were syntax errors that

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560
answer and there were syntax errors that
 

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.990
answer and there were syntax errors that
there were Styles not getting applied

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000
there were Styles not getting applied
 

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.380
there were Styles not getting applied
because they were typed improperly so we

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.390
because they were typed improperly so we
 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.090
because they were typed improperly so we
decided to build a new Jas build system

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:40.100
decided to build a new Jas build system
 

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.910
decided to build a new Jas build system
in 2010 we forked the code base we

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920
in 2010 we forked the code base we
 

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.920
in 2010 we forked the code base we
wanted to create a clean build and only

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:44.930
wanted to create a clean build and only
 

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.850
wanted to create a clean build and only
only code that was modular and

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:47.860
only code that was modular and
 

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.170
only code that was modular and
namespaced would be able to be in this

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.180
namespaced would be able to be in this
 

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.510
namespaced would be able to be in this
build basically we had these manifests

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:52.520
build basically we had these manifests
 

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.090
build basically we had these manifests
of files that had an add import like

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:55.100
of files that had an add import like
 

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.520
of files that had an add import like
syntax in a Jas comment so that they

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:57.530
syntax in a Jas comment so that they
 

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.320
syntax in a Jas comment so that they
would be a nerd if the build process

00:10:59.320 --> 00:10:59.330
would be a nerd if the build process
 

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.270
would be a nerd if the build process
failed

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:00.280

we used Yui compressor for minification

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.080
we used Yui compressor for minification
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.720
we used Yui compressor for minification
we no longer wanted to write our own

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:04.730
we no longer wanted to write our own
 

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.310
we no longer wanted to write our own
scripts this was well supported at the

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320
scripts this was well supported at the
 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.400
scripts this was well supported at the
time so why not we were focusing on to

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.410
time so why not we were focusing on to
 

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.020
time so why not we were focusing on to
build files one at the top one at the

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.030
build files one at the top one at the
 

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.510
build files one at the top one at the
bottom if you're familiar with the best

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:13.520
bottom if you're familiar with the best
 

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.260
bottom if you're familiar with the best
practices they

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.270
practices they
 

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.850
practices they
say that you're supposed to put your je

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:15.860
say that you're supposed to put your je

s at the bottom of the page so why did

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.180
s at the bottom of the page so why did
 

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.360
s at the bottom of the page so why did
we have them at the top if you remember

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:19.370
we have them at the top if you remember
 

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.400
we have them at the top if you remember
that editors can put JavaScript on the

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.410
that editors can put JavaScript on the
 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.630
that editors can put JavaScript on the
page if we wanted them to use our

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640
page if we wanted them to use our
 

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.070
page if we wanted them to use our
frameworks it had to be there before

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:24.080
frameworks it had to be there before
 

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.590
frameworks it had to be there before
they could actually run their code so we

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600
they could actually run their code so we
 

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.940
they could actually run their code so we
put stuff at the top to make sure that

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:27.950
put stuff at the top to make sure that
 

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.890
put stuff at the top to make sure that
that wouldn't break anything this build

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:29.900
that wouldn't break anything this build
 

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.990
that wouldn't break anything this build
process was executed manually so it

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000
process was executed manually so it
 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.850
process was executed manually so it
didn't see widespread usage it's

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:33.860
didn't see widespread usage it's
 

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.440
didn't see widespread usage it's
basically almost done only on the home

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:35.450
basically almost done only on the home
 

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.630
basically almost done only on the home
page and now we have two code bases and

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:37.640
page and now we have two code bases and
 

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.630
page and now we have two code bases and
still no automatic build process but

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640
still no automatic build process but
 

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.430
still no automatic build process but
when we did launch these J's changes to

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440
when we did launch these J's changes to
 

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.960
when we did launch these J's changes to
the home page it was pretty drastic we

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:43.970
the home page it was pretty drastic we
 

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.540
the home page it was pretty drastic we
got a 50% speed-up six seconds down from

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:46.550
got a 50% speed-up six seconds down from
 

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.790
got a 50% speed-up six seconds down from
12 we were very excited by that

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800
12 we were very excited by that
 

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.970
12 we were very excited by that
so 2011 was a bit of a slow year as you

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:51.980
so 2011 was a bit of a slow year as you
 

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.800

in the New York Times we introduced

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760
in the New York Times we introduced
 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.330
in the New York Times we introduced
digital subscriptions in 2011 so

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:58.340
digital subscriptions in 2011 so
 

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.860
digital subscriptions in 2011 so
resourcing for this kind of work was

00:11:59.860 --> 00:11:59.870
resourcing for this kind of work was
 

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:02.740
resourcing for this kind of work was
really really hard to come by oh hello I

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:02.750
really really hard to come by oh hello I
 

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.760

don't know what I just did all right
there were efforts to optimize our

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:09.740
there were efforts to optimize our
 

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.650
there were efforts to optimize our
analytics packaging that we have a lot

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:11.660
analytics packaging that we have a lot
 

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.210
analytics packaging that we have a lot
of analytics packages and they were kind

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:13.220
of analytics packages and they were kind
 

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.400
of analytics packages and they were kind
of doing some really bad stuff they got

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:15.410
of doing some really bad stuff they got
 

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:17.500
of doing some really bad stuff they got
aborted mostly because we were afraid to

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:17.510
aborted mostly because we were afraid to
 

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.200
aborted mostly because we were afraid to
break this act these actual reports we

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:20.210
break this act these actual reports we
 

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.220
break this act these actual reports we
wanted to make sure that the business

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.230
wanted to make sure that the business
 

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.830
wanted to make sure that the business
was able to analyze things correctly so

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:23.840
was able to analyze things correctly so
 

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.600
was able to analyze things correctly so
we didn't continue that so we used a

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:25.610
we didn't continue that so we used a
 

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.520
we didn't continue that so we used a
series of code reviews and style guides

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:27.530
series of code reviews and style guides
 

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.320
series of code reviews and style guides
to make sure that we were enforcing good

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:29.330
to make sure that we were enforcing good
 

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.030
to make sure that we were enforcing good
standards and best practices to keep the

standards and best practices to keep the
 

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.630
standards and best practices to keep the
status quo but at the end of 2011 we

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:34.640
status quo but at the end of 2011 we
 

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.090
status quo but at the end of 2011 we
made the decision we decided to replace

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.100
made the decision we decided to replace
 

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.210
made the decision we decided to replace
prototypes with jQuery site-wide and as

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:40.220
prototypes with jQuery site-wide and as
 

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.800
prototypes with jQuery site-wide and as
you can imagine this is really really

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:41.810
you can imagine this is really really
 

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:43.240
you can imagine this is really really
hard

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:43.250
hard
 

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.190
hard
both actually we needed both them to

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200
both actually we needed both them to
 

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.900
both actually we needed both them to
coexist during the transition we weren't

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:46.910
coexist during the transition we weren't
 

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.340
coexist during the transition we weren't
going to rewrite everything and launch a

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:48.350
going to rewrite everything and launch a
 

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.080
going to rewrite everything and launch a
new site on a new framework all at once

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.090
new site on a new framework all at once
 

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:51.910
new site on a new framework all at once
so we needed both of them to basically

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920
so we needed both of them to basically
 

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.380
so we needed both of them to basically
be around while we did this but in 2012

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:56.390
be around while we did this but in 2012
 

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.630
be around while we did this but in 2012
a group of five developers basically set

article pages we were making really

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:03.290
article pages we were making really
 

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.840
article pages we were making really
really excellent progress things were

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:04.850
really excellent progress things were
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.410
really excellent progress things were
going great

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:05.420
going great
 

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.420
going great
hours and hours of work and then we

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:07.430
hours and hours of work and then we
 

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.500
hours and hours of work and then we
found that there were some inline

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:08.510
found that there were some inline
 

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.240
found that there were some inline
scripts that made reference made

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:10.250
scripts that made reference made
 

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.420
scripts that made reference made
references to prototype j/s and if you

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:13.430
references to prototype j/s and if you
 

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.070
references to prototype j/s and if you
remember that we have these static pages

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:15.080
remember that we have these static pages
 

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.990
remember that we have these static pages

in the code the mix-ins are named after
 

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.120
in the code the mix-ins are named after
the image itself so you just put the

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:46.130
the image itself so you just put the
 

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.130
the image itself so you just put the
image name and you basically get the

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.140
image name and you basically get the
 

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.860
