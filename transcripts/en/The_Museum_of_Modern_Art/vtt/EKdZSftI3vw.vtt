00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.400
Bob: Sometimes I think that what we do is
very primitive.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.880
I have a stick with hair on the end of it.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.093
The same way it was, you know, 50,000 years ago.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.500
It hasn't changed very much.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.540
Alanna: I think we've got to do that.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.500
I think it's gonna be beautiful there.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.450
Man: It's gonna go essentially to the ceiling.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.450
Woman: Okay.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.730
Is that what it's supposed to do?

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.250
Man: Yeah, I mean, it's...

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.439
Alanna: Yeah, that's what it's supposed to
do.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.930
I'm just having my back thoughts about 
remembering 40 years ago.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.130
So it took up more of the wall 40 years ago.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.470
I think a lot of the energy that comes out
of New York art has to do with the artist

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.940
confronting that aspect of abandonment.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.260
They take that energy right from the street,
or right from the building.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.149
Richard: It was a space that was almost an
outdoor space at that point.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.150
The windows were broken.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.290
It was full of water.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.460
It was very hard to think of as a building.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.360
The best show to have been working on in the
last few years was the "Rooms Show," the first PS1 show.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.540
Alanna: We can't move it any farther to the
right.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.040
The only thing...

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.380
Man: At the very least, you can move it to
here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.060
Alanna: Right, at the very least.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.740
Man: But then...

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.220
Alanna: And then I'm just thinking about that.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.340
Richard : In 1976, what Alanna decided to
do was to invite a bunch of artists, close

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.920
to a 100, a lot of artists.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.979
The idea was a very interesting one, a very
simple one, choose your space, walk through

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.940
this wreck of a building, and tell me where
you wanna work?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.340
This just big place where we could make art.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.920
Judith: You know, there was no social media
and no word of mouth, the following, I mean,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.330
what it became, the world-famous curators,
who knew her, and knew to be here

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.440
for certain things because they just knew
how exciting her vision was.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.099
Alanna: It looks good.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:17.139
Bob: To have an opportunity to literally be
given carte blanche to make a piece.

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.629
Actually, I went through a lot, I just said,
"You know, I don't want just one room, I want

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.380
two rooms, and I'm going to put a corridor
in the wall between the rooms," and she said,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.520
"Fine."

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.620
Alanna: How close are you staying to the
original painting you did in the '76 show?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.980
Bob: Oh, it's the lean and...

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.340
Alanna: The lean is the same.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.100
Bob: ...and the backlit part.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.020
All of that's the same..

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.700
Alanna: Alright.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.020
Bob: The color and the paint are different.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.439
Alanna: Okay, so that...the color and the
paint are what you're giving yourselves 40

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.500
years of extra knowledge.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.480
Bob: Yeah, I mean, this thing didn't even
exist then.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.430
Richard: In the first PS1 show, she took a
classroom, and on that blackboard the text

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.510
was very sexual.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.980
Now, Marcia is 80 years old, and
so she's writing about her feelings about

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.110
those things now, as opposed to then.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.500
Richard: One of the interesting things about
the original show, most of us were close friends,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.120
and most of us helped each other with our
work because nobody could afford to hire assistants.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.699
When we brought the steel from my piece into
PS1 originally, Bob was one of the guys who

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.629
helped me and, you know, I probably helped
him build the wall here.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.460
Judith: I was one of the youngsters.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.849
They were all 10 years older than me.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.059
Really, in my association with the artists
that were in "Rooms," I began to understand

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:45.260
that how you think about things is part of
what you're doing.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.439
That's what I think the sculptors made me
understand.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.379
Richard: In a certain sense, every piece in
that show was an installation.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.460
Now everything gets painted white, the floor
is clean, so your eye moves.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.379
But in the original show, your eye moved more
slowly because there was water, and there

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.549
were reflections, and the walls were broken.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.460
It was about the spaces, about the ruins,
because there was no avoiding it.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:21.360
And you walked from one person's wreck into
another person's wreck into another person's wreck.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.120
Bob: There's this, sort of, brewing intensity
here.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.540
You know, you've got, well, I don't know,
70 or 80 artists here, and everybody's trying

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.880
to come in to do something new.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.400
Klaus: Alanna, a big toast.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.820
We're here because 40 years ago, you started
this.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.470
To Alanna.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.580
[Applause]

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.370
Alanna: You dream what kind of situations

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.250
you can provide that are exciting to everyone,
exciting to an audience, exciting to people

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.010
who make art, exciting to people who look
at art.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.940
I can't really think of anything I'd rather
do than what I do.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.130
Richard: It was an important moment
of change in the way that we all were able

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.640
to think about art.
