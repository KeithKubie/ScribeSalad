00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.944
- [Instructor] As we get into the 1500s,

00:00:02.944 --> 00:00:07.397
the Renaissance has been going
on for roughly 200 years.

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:11.381
Especially Europe has been
rediscovering the knowledge

00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.035
from the Greeks and from
the Romans and as they enter

00:00:15.035 --> 00:00:18.545
into the 16th century,
they start to go beyond

00:00:18.545 --> 00:00:22.167
the knowledge of the
Greeks and the Romans.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:26.793
In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus
publishes On the Revolutions

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:31.106
of the Heavenly Spheres, famous
for suggesting that earth

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:34.302
is not the center of the
universe but that the earth

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:36.302
revolves around the sun.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:41.324
What was powerful about this
is it challenged centuries old

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:45.980
ideas about how the universe
worked and at a meta level,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.497
it was about using new methods
and evidence in order to make

00:00:49.497 --> 00:00:52.896
conclusions no matter how revolutionary

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:55.195
those conclusions might be.

00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:59.004
And this publication is
often cited as the beginning

00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:03.679
of what will be known as
the scientific revolution.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.605
Many people view the capstone
of the scientific revolution

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:11.522
to be Newton's publication
of Principia in 1687

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.912
and this is an incredibly
powerful publication.

00:01:17.912 --> 00:01:20.874
It describes the laws of the universe,

00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:25.247
it's a universe in which
most things can be explained

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:28.358
with simple principles, with mathematics.

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:30.303
This is so powerful that
it would not be challenged

00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:34.042
for over 200 years until Albert
Einstein comes on the scene

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:36.808
with his theories of relativity.

00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:40.669
But even today, Newton's
laws, this is what is taught

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:44.336
in a first year physics
class, this is what you learn

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:47.116
in an introductory engineering class,

00:01:47.116 --> 00:01:48.594
so there's many things to think about,

00:01:48.594 --> 00:01:51.015
why did this happen at
this period of time,

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.107
how was it related to the Renaissance,

00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:55.194
how was it related to
things that were happening

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.630
in politics in Europe at the time?

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.034
But needless to say, it gave
humanity a new perspective

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:05.421
on the universe and it
gave humanity new powers

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:09.091
and we began to challenge all assumptions

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:13.258
and so as we get into the
late 1600s and early 1700s,

00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:17.828
people start trying to
use these same tools,

00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:22.372
the same deductive reasoning
on some of the oldest questions

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:25.079
that humanity has ever asked itself,

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.822
questions like, what rights
do we have as human beings?

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:31.856
Who gets those rights?

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:36.821
What duty and obligation do
we have towards each other?

00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:39.135
What is the role of government?

00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:41.302
Who has the right to rule?

00:02:42.173 --> 00:02:45.042
Now some of these questions
have been the fodder

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:49.949
of philosophers and religion
for thousands of years.

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.118
But now there was the power and the tools

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:56.934
and the challenging notions
of the scientific revolution.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:59.511
And this philosophical
movement that is really tied

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:03.678
to the scientific revolution
is known as the Enlightenment.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.448
And just to have an
example of the thinking

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:11.615
during the Enlightenment, here
is a passage from John Locke

00:03:12.793 --> 00:03:15.241
who is considered one of the
pillars of the Enlightenment.

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:18.158
This is published in 1689,
it's the Second Treatise

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:20.356
Concerning Civil Government.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:23.839
"The state of nature has a
law of nature to govern it,

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:28.746
which obliges everyone and
reason, which is that law,"

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:31.967
so reason is the law
of nature to govern it,

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:35.291
"teaches all mankind
who will but consult it

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.363
"that being all equal and
independent, no one ought to harm

00:03:39.363 --> 00:03:42.985
"another in his life, health,
liberty, or possessions.

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:46.684
"And when his own preservation
comes not in competition,

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:51.097
"ought he as much as he can to
preserve the rest of mankind

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:54.954
"and may not unless it be to
do justice on an offender,

00:03:54.954 --> 00:03:58.179
"take away or impair
the life or what tends

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.759
"to the preservation of the
life, the liberty, health,

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.365
"limb or goods of another."

00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:06.273
Now to parse what he's
saying, he says that reason

00:04:06.273 --> 00:04:10.269
is this natural law that
should govern human action

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.578
and he's saying no one
ought to harm anyone else

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.283
and that if we're not in competition,

00:04:15.283 --> 00:04:17.086
maybe there's only
enough food for one of us

00:04:17.086 --> 00:04:18.630
and there's two of us
there, in which case we'd be

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.081
in competition, but if there
isn't that competition,

00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:24.024
we should be trying to help
each other and we should

00:04:24.024 --> 00:04:27.469
be trying to preserve the rest of mankind.

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:29.926
And unless it's for
the purpose of justice,

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:33.239
you don't have the right to
take away or impair the life

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:36.438
or things that help preserve
the life, the liberty,

00:04:36.438 --> 00:04:39.560
the health, limb, or goods of another.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.680
Now you might say, hey,
isn't this common sense?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.247
And religions for all of
time have touched on some

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:46.892
of these issues but you
also have to appreciate

00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:51.545
that this is a time when kings
and emperors ruled the world.

00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:53.514
What gave them that right?

00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:56.840
Why are certain people slaves
and other people not slaves?

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.423
Why do certain people in that world

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:00.907
have a right to own these other people?

00:05:00.907 --> 00:05:03.637
And so this was a very controversial idea,

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.009
challenging some of
these fundamental notions

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.206
of who should rule, who
has the right to rule,

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:11.231
and to what degree should
people exert control

00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:15.711
over one another, so given
these challenging notions

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:17.801
of the Enlightenment, and
John Locke was only one

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:20.054
of the actors who would figure prominently

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:23.448
in this roughly 100-year
period, it's no surprise

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:28.023
that as you get into the
late 1700s and early 1800s,

00:05:28.023 --> 00:05:31.262
you have a whole string of revolutions,

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:34.667
especially in the Americas,
to a large degree inspired

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.893
by the ideas of the
Enlightenment, things like life,

00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:40.270
liberty, health, in the
United States Declaration

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.688
of Independence, these things are cited.

00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:45.944
During the French Revolution,
these things are cited.

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:48.076
In the various revolutions
in Latin America,

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:50.675
these ideas are cited.

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.152
Now one of the reasons
why the Enlightenment

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:55.093
came about when it did, not
only did we have new tools

00:05:55.093 --> 00:05:58.067
of thinking and the opportunity
to challenge notions,

00:05:58.067 --> 00:05:59.753
but it might have been
that society now had

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:01.923
the responsibility to
think a little bit deeper

00:06:01.923 --> 00:06:03.899
about these ideas because
it was getting more and more

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:06.443
powers through the scientific revolution.

00:06:06.443 --> 00:06:09.106
And those powers were
becoming even more significant

00:06:09.106 --> 00:06:11.246
when that science was applied

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:14.282
during the Industrial Revolution.

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:17.005
Now society could produce
more than it could ever

00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:20.218
produce before, but as we
talk about in other videos,

00:06:20.218 --> 00:06:22.243
the Industrial Revolution
had a certain hunger

00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:26.022
for raw materials and a
certain hunger for markets

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:28.156
in which to sell your finished product.

00:06:28.156 --> 00:06:31.132
It also allowed for more
powerful weapons and ways

00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:34.669
to project power and to
control a larger empire,

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.997
methods of communication,
methods of force,

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.560
and many historians tie
it directly to the age

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.536
of imperialism where especially
Western European powers

00:06:44.536 --> 00:06:48.583
sought areas to get raw
materials and markets

00:06:48.583 --> 00:06:51.924
in which they could push
their finished products

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:55.525
and so as the industrialized
world had more and more power,

00:06:55.525 --> 00:06:58.750
these ideas of the Enlightenment
became maybe even more

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.654
relevant even though they
might not have been implemented

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.474
consistently during
the age of imperialism.

00:07:04.474 --> 00:07:06.464
And as we've seen in other videos,

00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:08.848
even though the technology
keeps accelerating

00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:11.678
during the Industrial
Revolution, the philosophy

00:07:11.678 --> 00:07:15.807
and the moral framework does
not accelerate along with it

00:07:15.807 --> 00:07:19.437
and in 20th century, we see
one of the bloodiest centuries

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:22.428
in all of human history,
so let me leave you

00:07:22.428 --> 00:07:25.310
with a final series of questions.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.587
As we go into the 1800s,
we talked about the various

00:07:28.587 --> 00:07:31.090
independence movements
especially in the Americas,

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.572
we also have the abolishing of slavery

00:07:33.572 --> 00:07:38.104
in most of the world around
this time period and so to some

00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:40.825
degree, it looks like the
ideas of the Enlightenment

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:44.506
are coming to be, but
at the exact same time,

00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.815
you have the age of imperialism,
where more and more control

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:51.237
is exerted over people around the planet.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:55.149
This all comes to a head in
World War I, which is one

00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:58.544
of the bloodiest conflicts
in all of human history.

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:02.210
So to what degree did the
Enlightenment help the world

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.612
and to what degree did
it not get fulfilled?

00:08:04.612 --> 00:08:08.009
Or maybe in some way,
things like World War I

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:11.752
and World War II were the birthing pangs,

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:15.281
the transition state,
from the world before

00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:17.884
the Enlightenment, then
how close are we truly

00:08:17.884 --> 00:08:19.931
to those ideals today?

00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:22.497
In a future video, I'm
gonna talk about that

00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:24.721
and I'm gonna talk about
the idea of human rights

00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:28.480
and how we as a civilization
have attempted to address it

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.063
after World War II.
