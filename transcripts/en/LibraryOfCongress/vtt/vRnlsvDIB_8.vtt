00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; John Van Oudenaren:
Good evening.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.170
My name is John Van Oudenaren.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.560
I'm the Director for Scholarly
and Educational Programs here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.860
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.860
I met some of you
the other evening

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.690
when you were just
arriving, those of you

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.780
from the Rare Book School,
I did meet some of you

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.230
and others of you I haven't met.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.220
I'm here to introduce our
distinguished speaker.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.730
Michael F. Suarez, S.J.
has served as Director

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.190
of the Rare Book School,
Professor of English,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.050
University Professor,
and Honorary Curator

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.240
of Special Collections
at the University

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.200
of Virginia since 2009.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.160
He has many degrees.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.170
I actually had to have a little
tutorial out in the hallway

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.790
about how to say
some of these degrees

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.760
but he received a D.Phil., a
Master of Studies and an MA/BA

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.680
from Oxford University, a
Master of Theology and a Master

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.130
of Divinity from the Weston
Jesuit School of Theology,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.420
and a B.A. from Bucknell
University.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.890
He has written widely
on various aspects

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.290
of 18th-century English
literature, bibliography

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.460
and book history and he has
held research fellowships

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.680
from the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.240
at Harvard University,
the National Endowment

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.200
for the Humanities, the American
Council of Learned Societies,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.780
and the Folger Shakespeare
Library.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.640
He is a CLIR, that's
Council on Library

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.240
and Information Resources,
C-L-I-R,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.300
he is a CLIR Distinguished
Presidential Fellow,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.380
member of the Advisory
Board of Library

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.840
of Congress Literacy
Awards Program,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.440
the Council of the
Bibliographical Society

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.530
of America, and the
Board of Managers

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.310
of the Lewis Walpole
Library at Yale University.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.720
So he comes with
great credentials

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.040
and an enormous amount of
experience and knowledge.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.230
Since 2010, he has
served as editor-in-chief

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.980
of Oxford Scholarly
Editions Online.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.240
His recent books include "The
Cambridge History of the Book

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.500
in Britain," Volume five,
1695-1830, obviously published

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.560
by Cambridge University
Press, which is co-edited

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.490
with Michael Turner, and
"The Oxford Companion

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.980
to the Book" published by
Oxford University Press,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.760
a million-word reference book
co-edited with H. R. Woudhuysen.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360
"The Book: A Global
History," also co-edited

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.940
with H. R. Woudhuysen,
first appeared in 2013.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.020
In 2014, Oxford University
Press published his edition

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.340
of "The Dublin Notebook,"
co-edited with Lesley Higgins,

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.360
in the "Collected Works
of Gerard Manley Hopkins."

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.540
He delivered the 2015 Lyell
Lectures in Bibliography

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.230
at the University of Oxford.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.330
So with that introduction,
Father Suarez, we look forward

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.700
to hearing you talk about
the business of abridgments

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.230
in 18th-century Britain
and America.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.530
Thank you.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Suarez:
Thank you, John.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.030
[ Applause ]

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.280
We probably don't need
the waiver on the podium.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.010
I know the federal government
is interested in the legality

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.080
but we can probably
put that to the side.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.800
So today I'd like to talk to
you little bit about the world

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.820
of abridgments and, indeed,
I'd like to establish

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.000
with you the ubiquity of
abridgments in the 18th century.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.990
I think it's not too much to
say that the reprint trade

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.360
in the 18th century is
the trade in abridgments

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.110
and I'll explain why
as we continue on.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.660
So first I'd like to begin
with a small post octavo

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.030
that you see on your screens.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.290
This is Ortelius, his
great atlas done in octavo.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.630
This is 1601 and by no means
the first of these abridgments,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.320
there's an antecedent
abridgment in 1577.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.510
And I adduce this because
the abridgment isn't invented

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.150
in the 18th century.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.740
That would be fatuous to
think so, but the rhetoric

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.830
of the abridgment is very
much part and parcel here

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.570
of what will be in
our own century.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.880
Somehow this is smaller,
more portable, more useful,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.100
that's how it's being marketed,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.530
and there's always a
rhetoric of value added.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:58.530
So in this case there is a star
map and two other maps added one

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.070
of Formosa that aren't
in the original

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.660
and so the idea is get this and
you'll be able to have things

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.620
that you wouldn't be able to get
in the full big trophy atlas.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.530
It's also true that many of you
will know from studying Ortelius

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.580
that that book was seldom used.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.520
It's a gentlemen's
trophy book in many ways.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.950
Whereas if you, as I have,
make a comprehensive study

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.130
as best you can of the surviving
abridgments from '77 and '01,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:39.410
these post-octavos show many
more signs of actual use.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.030
Many of you will know the
story told by Daniel Defoe

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:52.180
who went hold up for five years
while writing his great poetic

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:58.180
treatise on the divine right
of kings, "Jure Divino,"

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:06.880
a book in 375 pages
folio, a book that cost

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.910
without the frontispiece
the whopping sum in 1706

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.990
of 10 shillings and with the
frontispiece in which Defoe is,

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.720
as you can see, big
wigged, it's 13 shillings.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.470
Okay? This is Defoe wanting to
become the next John Dryden.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.760
Okay? He fails.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.840
And on the day that the
folio was published,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.930
the very same day Defoe
discovers he was betrayed

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.490
by someone in his own
printers printing office

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:53.550
and exactly concomitantly the
down market version in octavo

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.230
of this book comes
out selling not for 13

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.150
with the frontispiece,
not for 10

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.120
without the frontispiece,
but for 5 shillings.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:14.450
Defoe himself says, I lost 1500
pounds because of the piracy,

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.780
and people often think
because they know the octavo,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.240
it survives in large
numbers that it's

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.360
because of the publication
of this octavo.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.040
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is by no means the case.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.990
The octavo hurt him.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.920
He had to lower his price,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.170
but the real couplet are the
halfpenny and penny abridgments.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.660
And this is an example
of one of those.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.340
You can see the incredible
page depth,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.880
the number of lines
per page here.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.790
You can see how closely printed
it is and there's the idea is

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.510
that there's one either full
sheet or half sheet number

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.550
for each of the 12 books.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:08.030
These are very rare now because
they were little pamphlets.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.540
They're very hard to find
in any concentrated numbers

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.750
to study bibliographically.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.770
But let's look at what
the advertisements say.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.400
You can get the 12
books of "Jure Divino,"

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.320
which had been 13 shillings
and then came down to 5

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.490
because he had to
compete with the octavo.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.150
Thank you very much.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:34.490
You can get it now in
halfpenny parts on the left

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.040
or in penny parts on the
right, depending upon

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:40.130
if it's a half sheet
or whole sheet.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.310
So you can get the whole
of "Jure Divino" not

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.400
for 13 shillings, not for 10
shillings, not for 5 shillings,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.420
but for 12 pence or 6 pence.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.440
While it's not the
whole, it's the epitome.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.610
Yeah. It's the abridgment.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.280
And this is the attitude that
I had toward abridgments.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.830
This is what I knew
abridgments were.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:09.410
I had made a study of Defoe
and I knew about Hills,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.400
the black friars pirate
and what he had done

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.100
and this is exactly
what an abridgment was

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.850
in the 18th century, I
felt certain, but I decided

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.430
to inquire a little bit
further and I read the work

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.740
of a man named Jordan Howell

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.970
in the library an article I
recommend to you most strongly.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.110
And Mr. Howell for his doctoral
dissertation made a study

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.330
of the abridgments
of "Robinson Crusoe."

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.260
And here's what he discovered;

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:52.940
75% of the "Robinson
Crusoe" titles published

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.580
in the 18th century
are abridgments;

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:03.390
75% of the titles
are abridgments.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.380
That's a breathtaking thing.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.540
And as we'll see,
Crusoe abridgments appear

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.980
in a disproportionate way.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.640
Now this is partly because
we know "Robinson Crusoe"

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.150
as one book, whereas "Robinson
Crusoe" is really three books.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.240
Okay? First, there's the story
of Robinson Crusoe that we know.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.460
Then there's the strange
and surprising adventures

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.380
and finally there's serious
reflection on the life

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.090
and history of Robinson Crusoe

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:39.710
and so these volumes together
make up a three-volume set

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.080
and this is very long and I
can tell you the third volume

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.780
in particular kind of
boring, lots of reflections

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:51.090
on particular providence, not
many things moving very quickly.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.430
And so this gets abridged
and abridged and abridged.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:56.730
Well, very well.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.420
None of these abridgments
were authorized.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.720
And again, I thought this
must be akin to what happened

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.650
to Defoe with "Jure Divino."

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.430
And then I start to look still
more closely into the world

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.840
of abridgments and I saw
that one John Wesley,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.660
the founder of Methodism, who
didn't seem like very much

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.310
of a rapscallion to me,
certainly not akin to Hills,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.050
the black friars pirate.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:30.470
I saw that in '48 he abridged
"Pilgrim's Progress" and that

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:36.510
that one by '66 is
in a fifth edition.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.870
And I thought, oh, very well.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:42.390
He does this because he
has a religious purpose

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.690
and they leave them alone

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.600
because obviously this
must be actionable.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.130
And then I went in and I
saw some more Wesley books

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.050
and I was astonished,
"The Manners

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:56.040
of the Ancient Christians"
is in the fifth edition.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.350
It's an abridgment.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:03.490
Nicodemus, "A Treatise on the
Fear of Man, The Life of God

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.110
and the Soul of Man" and you
can see at the bottom one

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:11.400
of the keys to Wesley's
success, printed and sold

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.860
at the New Chapel City Road

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.690
and at the Reverend Mr. Wesley's
preaching houses in Town

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:21.580
and Country and here we
see a distribution network.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.320
And on further inquiry,
with the help of ESTC

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.050
and a little digging, I discover

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.480
that John Wesley is the
greatest abridger in the history

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.850
of the 18th century and that
he's responsible for more

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:45.190
than 100 titles being abridged,
about 600 editions in all.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:50.250
And I thought to myself, gosh, I
wonder if Wesley was ever taken

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.080
to court for any of these
because he doesn't seem

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.490
like a man who would
willfully break the law.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.580
And I found out that the
only time he ever ran

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.540
into any trouble at
all was when in one

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.310
of his volumes he reprinted
parts of "Night Thoughts"

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.980
which was in the
copyright of Robert Dodsley.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.820
And Dodsley came
to him and said,

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.680
that's mine, thank
you very much.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.890
And they settled the matter
completely out of court.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.910
Wesley gave him 20 pounds and
promised not to do it again

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:29.260
and that seemed to be
okay for everybody.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.780
But searching the records of
the law courts in England,

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.480
Wesley is never, never, never,
numquam, numquam, numquam,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.190
ever brought to court for
any of these abridgments.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.100
We'll soon see why.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.290
So let's pause for a
moment here and try

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.450
to understand why
abridgments are

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.940
so ubiquitous in
the 18th century.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.360
For the most part, a
pamphlet costs between 6 pence

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.230
and 18 pence and you can
see that newspapers are

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:10.570
about 3 pence, novels un-sewn
are 2 and 6, or 3 shillings

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.480
if they're in trade
bindings, and octavos are

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.600
about 5 shillings a volume.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.160
This is a lot of money.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:26.090
And books are luxury commodities
throughout the century.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.680
And unless we understand that,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.750
we won't really understand
the world

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.600
of abridgments although
there's a lot more to say.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.930
A little consumer price index
information to try to help you

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.670
out so you understand, well
how much is 5 shillings,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.510
how much is 3 shillings, and
you could say that you see

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.550
that a bushel of
coal is 14 pence.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:55.520
A pound of wheat
is 1 and 3/4 pence.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.720
Okay? An annual rent
for a laborer,

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.160
1 pound 8 shillings
and twopence.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.580
And with the cost of all
his utilities as it were,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:08.610
his heating, it's about
3 pounds per annum, yeah,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.450
2 and 1/2 pounds per annum.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.820
So when we start to think
about what books cost,

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.100
we see the books are
indeed luxury commodities.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.300
There's more to be
told still, however.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:29.200
So Samuel Johnson himself
in Rambler 145 tells us

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.920
that some readers delight
in abstracts and epitomes

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.170
and I think other than money,
the most powerful resource

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:40.490
that people have is time.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.820
And so we shouldn't just
imagine that the only people

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.430
who are reading abridgments
are people who are too poor

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.030
to buy the full thing
because maybe you just want

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.890
to get the gist of it and
move on, maybe you just want

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.630
to be able to say
sure I read that.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.610
Right? So this is
kind of interesting.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.580
So when we think about
why abridgments are

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.380
on the one hand everywhere

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.090
and on the other hand have been
bibliographically invisible

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.940
to us, I think that we need
to think about two things.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.950
The first of these is the
cultures of collecting.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.620
Do you really think
that with the formation

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.040
of the principal cultural
institutions of England

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.790
and America in the 19th century

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.930
that those institutions
were collecting the piracies

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.690
of "Robinson Crusoe?"

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.080
Do you really think that they
were collecting the abridgments

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.580
of Locke and Hume?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.250
Why would they?

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.950
They're not the "real thing."

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.750
They're not the first editions.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:55.610
They haven't received any
bibliographical treatment.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.010
There are no points.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.900
And so you can imagine that
the culture of collecting

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:06.720
in the 19th century right
through the 20th century is one

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.780
in which the abridgment
is pretty much invisible.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.240
That's the first thing.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.950
The second thing to bear
in mind is survival rates,

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.610
ladies and gentlemen.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.990
It is true that survival
rates are not entirely

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.570
stochastic processes.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.700
Sure, sometimes there's a flood.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.360
Sometimes there's a fire.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.510
And whatever is in its wake
is going to be destroyed.

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:39.070
But it's also true that
smaller books have a lower

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.480
survival rate.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.390
Unbound books have a
much lower survival rate.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:49.220
The unbound book does not
survive is a good rule of thumb.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:54.180
If you're buying the small
abridgment, is that rather akin

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.690
to buying the paperback?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:03.240
So then why would you bother
to pay to have it bound?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.220
Right? But we also need

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.170
to remember Roger Stoddard's
law, which goes like this.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.690
Roger Stoddard, the brilliant
bibliographer and curator

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.640
at Harvard University for so
many years, informs us, rightly,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:25.250
bigger books linger longer,
little books last least.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:29.160
While these abridgments are
little books per force both

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.820
in their formats,
duodecimos and 16 mos,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.310
some of them even 32 mos,
but they're also little books

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.640
in the sense that they
have low sheet count.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.660
Right? So these are the books

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.780
that are likely to
last the least.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.420
The cultures of collecting
determine

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:53.690
that they're not important,
they're not the "real McCoy"

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.870
and they're going to be unbound.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.460
They're not sold
in trade bindings.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:05.760
And they're little books that
are very likely to last least.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.660
So the survival rates
are extremely low.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:14.870
And yet we know Samuel
Johnson was an abridger.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.110
Tobias Smollett was an abridger.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.100
Oliver Goldsmith was abridger.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.800
You get the idea, right?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.420
There a lot of people
who we regard

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:29.590
as pretty high-end authors who
are employed by the booksellers

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:33.230
to do the business of
creating these abridgments,

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:38.460
in part because over time their
names carry with them a kind

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:42.390
of authorizing cultural capital.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.870
So this is a very preliminary
bibliometric analysis

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.190
of the English Short
Title Catalogue.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:54.810
And you can see, ladies
and gentlemen, for this,

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.740
all I did was look at titles
that announce themselves

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.280
as abridgments or epitomes.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.620
So there are no silent
abridgments in this count at all

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.730
and there are many other ways to
talk about what an abridgment is

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.830
than just say on the title
page, abridgment or epitome.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.130
Right?

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.730
So here you see the vast
number of abridgments.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:21.260
If you run out to the store
right now and go by volume five

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.770
of the Cambridge history
of the book in Britain,

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:31.950
I say completely disinterestedly
and look at the chapter

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:38.140
on bibliometric analysis, you
will see that this profile here

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.520
of the abridgments bears a
remarkably close correspondence

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.060
to the productive output
of the century itself.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:52.210
In other words, the proportions
stay alarmingly closely the

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.110
same, almost to the
degree that it looks

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.240
like I cooked the
books, which I haven't

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.900
and this is part of
an ongoing study.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.930
This is work in progress.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.760
You saw it here first.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.490
So if we look by title at some

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.420
of the most important
abridgments,

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.320
here you see Robinson Crusoe
is a complete outlier,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.780
but then you start to see
these are just abridgments

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.630
and I won't read it to you.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.550
You can read for which you
should thank a teacher every day

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:28.330
but you see that overwhelmingly
religious books are highly

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:31.610
abridged among the
bestsellers of abridged books,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:36.840
but also voyages as well,
dictionaries and so on.

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.100
So here is a breakdown by genre.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:43.050
As I say, these results
are preliminary

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:48.360
but you can see the profound
abridgment of religious books,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.070
fiction, and historical books.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.210
Okay? So that just gives
you a little bit of the lay

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.520
of the land and gives a
little evidence to my argument

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.270
for this ubiquity of
abridgments in the 18th century.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:10.860
Why? Remarkably, because
the Lord Chancellor himself

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.960
in Gyles v Wilcox in 1741 ruled

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:23.870
that a thoughtful abridgment
is protected by law.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:29.650
That is to say if I take Mark
[inaudible] immortal book

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.660
that you will all have read
Beach Blanket Bibliography,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:36.300
I know you know this
classical text,

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.230
and if I take Beach
Blanket Bibliography

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.950
and merely reprint
the first 200 pages,

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.180
that is not a thoughtful
abridgment

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:48.000
and that is actionable.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.150
There can be an injunction
issued right away prohibiting

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.760
the vending of that product.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.700
But if I make what's called
in the law a judicious

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.580
or thoughtful abridgment,
and I actually go through

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.030
and make careful selection
and epitome as it were,

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:12.600
of what Mark has written, then
mirabile dictu, very foreign

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.690
to our modern sensibility
that is protected

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:21.760
under the law according
to no less an authority

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.710
than the Lord Chancellor
himself.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.820
This is a remarkable thing
and this legal doctrine helps

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:37.830
to explain why the reprint trade
is the trade in the abridgments.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:42.390
Boswell said to Johnson,
this is ridiculous,

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:48.550
this is like taking the ears or
the horns and the tail off a cow

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:53.490
and calling it a new thing and
trying to sell it as a new cow.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.210
And Johnson says,
nonsense, Boswell.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:03.130
It's like making
the cow have a calf.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:07.190
So you will remember that
the act for the encouragement

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.220
of learning is about the
preservation of good copies

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:16.650
in order to help the public
be informed and learned.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:21.550
And so were Lord Chief Justice,
Lord Chancellor Hardwicke rules

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.700
that the judicious abridgment
is protected under law

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.400
because he sees it as being
commensurate with the act

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.130
of Queen Anne because it's
in the public interest.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:38.700
It's an act not merely for
profit but for the public good.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.900
And then when the booksellers
come back at this again

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.920
and you have Bell versus
Walker and [inaudible],

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:50.070
again in 1785 the Master of
the Rolls writing the opinion

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:55.240
for the Lord Chancellor again
reinforces the idea, remarkably,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:00.320
that of thoughtful abridgment
is non-injunctionable.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.450
This is a remarkable thing and
so it's protected under law.

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:10.840
So it's all very well for us to
say, ha, I've read "Tom Jones."

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.220
I know how long that book is.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.390
Look at thin little volume.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.740
This isn't "Tom Jones."

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:23.990
But here's the question:
What does the presence

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:29.730
of this book printed and
reprinted in the market do

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.530
to our understanding of
the reception history

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.830
of Fielding and of this novel?

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:43.920
It's no good for us to get on
our high horses and to say,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.750
well, that just isn't
"Tom Jones."

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:49.610
If more people read "Tom
Jones" in abridgments

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.110
or if more people certainly
read "Robinson Crusoe"

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.840
in abridgments, then
what's the real McCoy?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.360
Do you see?

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.860
So bibliography is now
confounding our sense

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:10.700
of the reception history that
we thought we knew all too well.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.440
So here we have the history
of "Sir Charles Grandison"

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.820
in 170 duodecimo pages.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.740
This is absurd in some
ways, but if you've read

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:24.330
"Sir Charles Grandison,"
you are grateful.

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.200
I am deeply grateful
for the abridgment.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.260
And it's all very well
for us to say, oh,

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.840
but this isn't Richardson.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.830
Well, in some ways it is
and in some ways it isn't.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.950
It's all very well
for us to complain.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.570
Well, epistolarity is lost.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.470
Yes, epistolarity is lost.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.960
But if this is what
a significant portion

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.940
of the population is reading,
then we must countenance this

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.850
as a liminal moment in the
reception history of this work.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.430
And so once again,

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.190
bibliographical history
judiciously done informs

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:08.940
and re-informs the conduct
of literary history.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:14.740
Here is a book that I discovered
was on the cart for our class

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.930
on the book in the 18th century.

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:21.060
You see in the middle this is
a Library of Congress book.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.250
Sterne is dead by the
time this book comes out.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.980
This is a Dublin reprint of
"Tristram Shandy," which as many

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.480
of you will know is
a bestselling book

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.300
in nine volumes, and this is
the whole of "Tristram Shandy"

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.700
in three small octavo volumes.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:50.030
Why? Not only because it's
cheaper but please understand

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:55.710
if I'm a bookseller, even in
Dublin where I can't be touched

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.210
by the idea of the
laws of piracy,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:08.490
it's extremely risky undertaking
for me to produce nine volumes

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.180
of Laurence Sterne, even though
I already know he's a bestseller

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.570
because that's all lot of paper.

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.660
That's a lot of typesetting.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.650
Right? And that's
a big investment

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.770
on the part of the audience.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:28.190
But if I can commission someone
to abridge "Tristram Shandy"

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.780
into a limited number of sheets,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:37.950
then my abridgment can be
calibrated to the capital risk

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:42.280
that I can afford
and my judgment

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.340
of the carrying capacity
of my local market.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.920
So now all of a sudden
I'm not imprisoned

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.510
by Sterne's prolixity.

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:58.920
I can do what I want
to do and say, well,

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.950
this is about as many sheets
as I could handle in terms

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.080
of the capital expenditure
at this edition size.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.880
And so I can calculate

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:14.220
in advance how long I want
the abridgment to be and then

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.550
when I commission John to do
the abridgment, it has to come

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:23.270
in at a certain number of sheets
or indeed a certain word count

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.840
or if I'm the printer I
think about it in terms

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.910
of a certain number of
[inaudible] perhaps and now all

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:33.190
of a sudden I've ameliorated my
capital risk and I've been able

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:39.230
to make a locally informed
judgment about my resources

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.460
and the carrying
capacity of the market.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:48.440
And so all of a sudden if we
start to study abridgments

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:54.220
in these ways, we can give a
local habitation and a name --

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.670
That's an original phrase
that I just thought up.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.310
We can give a local
habitation and a name

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.980
to the carrying capacity
of particular markets,

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.830
at particular moments
in history,

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.550
because we can see how
many sheets the different

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.850
abridgments are.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.100
They could be as
long or as short

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.310
as the bookseller
wants them to be.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.380
They're not at the
mercy of anybody.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.150
This is another Library
of Congress book.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:22.730
This is "Clarissa."

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.690
This is Hartford, Connecticut,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:32.440
and here this book is 138
pages, which is remarkable.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:38.010
"Clarissa," as you remember, is
a book eight volumes and seven.

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:42.400
"Clarissa" costs those
3 shillings times seven.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.480
Last time I checked,
3 times 7 is 21.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.160
And last time I checked,
21 shillings is the guinea.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.520
A guinea is a boatload of money.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.460
Right? Hartford,
Connecticut isn't going

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:59.720
to pay the equivalent of
a guinea for eight volumes

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:04.790
of "Clarissa" and no
local bookseller can bear

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:06.240
that capital risk.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.800
And the productive capacity

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.350
of his press just
can't handle that.

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.190
So what does he do?

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.090
He makes "Clarissa"
into 138 pages

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.660
because that's what
the market will bear

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:22.050
and that's what his
capital expenditure can do.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.040
So all these books
are, therefore, bespoke

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.400
and because they're
bespoke in a different way

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.970
than when Henry Fielding goes
to Andrew Miller and says, here,

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:39.190
I had a bestseller in "Tom
Jones" and now I'm giving you

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.730
"Amelia" and this is what it is.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:46.160
Now, the thing that
Miller has control

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.450
over is the edition quantity,
which in the case of "Amelia,"

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.590
he got wrong and it took
him ten years to sell

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.840
out the edition quantity he
printed because "Tom Jones" had

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.530
to be so often reprinted
but, nevertheless,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:03.380
Miller's at the mercy of what
the author brings to him.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.880
In this case, that's
not so [inaudible].

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:12.410
And so these books allow us to
undertake certain diagnostics

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.460
of the local and
the provincial trade

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:20.230
that we could never conduct
in other ways before.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:26.530
So here's Oliver Goldsmith,
who made a fortune abridging.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.090
He got $500 for producing
the "History of England"

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.820
in two volumes, which
is just in abridgment

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.660
of four antecedent works
and combining them.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.140
And then, of course, he
abridges the abridgment.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.320
We know we have his surviving
agreement for his abridgment

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.840
of the "Roman History"
for which he got 52 pounds

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.140
and 10 shillings.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.140
This is remarkable.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.350
So abridging is good work.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.260
And the reason why abridging
is the work for Goldsmith is

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.710
because he's a celebrity by
this juncture and his name

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:07.020
on the title page authorizes
what's been done to the text.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.790
And this is really important and
Tom Davies is willing to pay him

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:16.700
that kind of money up
front and more if it runs,

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.260
precisely because the
world of abridgment,

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:24.710
the market is always
stratified and so the world

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.190
of abridgment is going to
hit the stratified market

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:32.380
at a place that's new
territory for that book

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.280
and Davies wants
to get in on it.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.230
So what kinds of
books are abridged?

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:43.010
Well, the "World of Voyages" is
extremely popular in England.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:46.800
And so you see this consortium
of booksellers, the Dodsley,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.730
Rivington, Fletcher, Johnson,
Strawn, and Jeffreys come

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:55.710
out with this compendium of
"Voyages" in seven volumes.

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.180
And in the preface
they say, gosh,

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:00.390
there are so many
collections of "Voyages"

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.290
but you know they're
full of dross

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.460
and we're doing you a
great favor by taking

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.580
out the technicalities
of navigation

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.330
and all the boring bits.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.710
And we'll just give
you the best parts.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:19.560
And besides, who could
afford all those books?

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.710
There was those big folios,
those large quartos, but here,

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:30.030
these are companionable volumes
and we are doing, oh yes,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:32.820
a tremendous service
to the public

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:36.850
because we are letting you
have the best of the best

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:40.640
at a price you can
afford, gentle reader.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.540
And so Tobias Smollett is one
of the principal abridgers

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.640
on this project,
thank you very much.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.720
And this runs to
the second edition.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:52.860
What kind of books get abridged?

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.030
Oh, Foxe's "Book of
Martyrs" gets abridged over

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.370
and over and over again.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.460
Foxe's "Book of Martyrs," of
course under Foxe gets bigger

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:02.760
and bigger and bigger.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.650
In the 18th century, it
gets smaller and smaller

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.220
and smaller, to some degree.

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:12.300
I can tell you neither of
these editions of Foxe,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.650
1760 which is really
'61 and then again '66,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.530
neither of these editions

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.710
of Foxe tell you they're
an abridgment anywhere.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:23.820
They just say, hi, here's Foxe.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.960
And I can also tell you because
I was able to check the sheets

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.450
in the Bodleian Library,

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:32.020
these are indeed two
completely different printings.

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.490
And so that's interesting
to know

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.570
that the market will bear that.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.620
So Johnson's dictionary, 1755,

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.950
we all know that the
English were so proud

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.630
because it only takes
one Englishman

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:51.960
to do what the entire French
Academy could not accomplish.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.710
And so that's wonderful.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:58.080
And of course that's two
volumes folio, a massive work,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:02.960
1500 copies printed and
in Johnson's lifetime,

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.990
in the 29 years from
when the first edition

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.130
of the dictionary comes out
until Johnson's death in 1784,

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:15.790
hey, 5000 copies of those four
editions of the folio come out

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.900
and that's pretty great.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:23.590
Only somewhere between 35,000
copies and 40,000 copies

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:30.120
of the octavo abridgment made
by Johnson himself in service

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:34.150
of the common reader sell.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:39.450
So now, what's Johnson's
dictionary

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.670
and how would you know?

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.760
It we're asking about the
dictionary as monument,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.930
it's those twin pillars of
lexicography, the folios.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:55.580
If we're asking how did
Johnson's much-vaunted common

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.380
reader employ the dictionary,
it's got to be the octavos.

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.770
Yeah? But this is a way of
conducting literary history

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.450
and reception history that is
heretofore very little practice

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.170
because we haven't yet done
the bibliographical homework

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.240
in a thoroughgoing way.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.370
Bibliography and book history
is meant to make us more knowing

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:25.250
so that we can do history
more authentically.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.040
And here is one of a
number of examples.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.000
Of course, the abridger
himself is repeatedly abridged.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.810
Here are the first 20 some
odd lives of the poets,

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:44.370
all compassed into
roughly 100 pages in, yes,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.790
an abridgment of
Johnson's "Lives."

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.410
It's also true that abridgments
will come out when you want

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:58.920
to limit your capital risk but
when you also want to capitalize

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.150
on a dormant capital resource.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:07.240
So here we have the
micrographia and the plates

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.030
to the micrographia still
exist, Hooke's original plates

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.650
and so what are they
going to do?

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.480
Well, micrographia
ristorante, of course.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.280
So we're going to use
the plates and turn them

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:24.010
into an active capital
resource instead

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:26.340
of a dormant capital resource.

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.570
We're going to reprint
all the plates

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.770
but note the rhetoric
of the abridgment.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.840
This renders the present volume

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.020
so small though it really
contains the whole sense of all

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.180
that is necessary fully to
understand the following plates.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.860
In fact, it's even better

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.980
because we will take
what was abstruse

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.810
and make it clear, dear reader.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:56.260
This is cheaper,
better, stronger, faster.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.300
You would think this
was American.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:02.510
So this is very typical.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.780
Take a capital resource and
repurpose it but repurpose it

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.650
in such a way that you're
not risking too much.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:15.150
So here you see the famous
play that everybody knows.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.730
And then there is this
chap named George Kearsley.

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:25.910
And if we want to understand
the culture of abridgments,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:30.810
we also need to understand
the culture of excerpting,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.160
which is rampant in
the 18th century.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.300
The culture of publishing
beauties,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.120
the culture of publishing
elegant extracts,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.410
the culture of publishing
the famous [inaudible] books

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.910
which are meant to be books
to teach people oratory

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:53.570
and rhetoric but really are
read as books of the beauties

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:57.640
or excerpts of the major poets
and playwrights of the time.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.060
And here is the beauties
of Laurence Sterne

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:07.570
for half a crown, two
shillings and sixpence,

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.540
thank you very much,
and I, George Kearsley,

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:16.430
will just happen to remind you
that this book is not related to

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.120
but may be occasioned
by the fact

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.040
that Sterne's works have
just come out in ten volumes

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.430
at the outrageous
price of two guineas.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:31.460
So here you can either pay
half a crown or two guineas.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.760
What are you going to do?

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.730
A guinea is 21 shillings.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:41.920
So 42 shillings or two
shillings and sixpence.

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.220
What do you want to do?

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.880
What's in your wallet?

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:51.420
So it turns out that Kearsley
has this interesting habit,

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.070
this is from the
Bodleian Library,

00:40:54.070 --> 00:41:00.530
and he engineers the third,
fourth, and fifth edition

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:06.210
to come one every month but
it's all the same sheets.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:07.910
He changes the title page

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:11.070
in the early preliminaries
so you can't tell.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.790
But if you line them up
and fingerprint the sheets,

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.160
as I have been deeply
privileged to do

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.630
in [inaudible], what
do you discover?

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:21.360
You discover that those
sheets, the inner form

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:25.230
and the outer form of every
sheet is exactly identical.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:26.810
Thank you very much.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.610
And what's he trying to do?

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.010
He's trying to get
momentum for the book.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:36.310
He's trying to make the book
a fashionable commodity.

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:43.310
Huh. So here is a book that's
bibliographically fascinating,

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.900
something of a puzzle to me.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:51.070
This is a translation into
French of "Tom Jones."

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.730
Now in my view -- And I
haven't finished my study yet.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.740
This is going to take
me several years.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:03.370
But in my view, almost every
translation from English

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:08.990
into French is an abridgment
and almost every translation

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:13.890
from French into
English is an abridgment.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:18.370
And partly because, if you're
reading it in another language,

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.990
how would you know that
what was being abridged,

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.920
and again this is an
opportunity for the bookseller

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:28.720
to calibrate how big he
wants the book to be.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:32.530
In this case three
volumes bound into one,

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.040
three volumes duodecimo.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.910
So this is an abridgment.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.290
Trust me. It's also
a false imprint.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.770
It's not published in London.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:47.060
And it's using a
London bookseller's name

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:50.220
but the London bookseller has
nothing to do with this book.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.820
And the thing that I haven't
been able to determine,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.340
if there are any experts
out there, I'd be grateful

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.560
for the help of The
Baker Street Irregulars.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.510
I cannot -- I'm having
difficulty telling

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:05.540
if the paper is Swiss, which
would lead me to believe

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.910
that it was printed at the STN,

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:11.210
the Societe typographique
de Neuchatel,

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:14.830
or if the paper is French,

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.590
in which case I believe it's
most likely printed Leon.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:22.220
So paper moves back and forth a
lot and it's a little bit hard

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:27.410
to tell, but the idea is
this ain't what it seems.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:32.500
It looks complete to those
who don't know but it's not.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.560
It's an abridgment.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.030
So as you will know,
the three voyages

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:43.250
of Cook are signal moments

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.530
in the history of
human exploration.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:52.200
And as you will know, Cook
tragically dies on the shore

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.360
of Hawaii and in
the third voyage

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.410
and when the crew comes
back they're desperate

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.280
to have the official account.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.430
And when the official account
is published one fine June day

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:15.570
in three volumes large quarto
with the volume underneath

00:44:15.570 --> 00:44:18.640
that you can see the Atlas
volume because there are

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.090
so many cuts, so
many engravings,

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:27.010
the charts of navigation
and so on.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:35.180
These three volumes go for
four and a half guinea.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:40.010
The press run is 2000.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:48.380
In the mid afternoon of the
third day of sale, the third day

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:57.000
of sale in June 1784,
they sell the last copy

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.470
and begin printing
the second edition.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:05.590
Do you think this was of
fashionable commodity?

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.760
Do you think that the upper
classes had to have this book?

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.560
Well, no less the middling
sort had to have the book too

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.540
and immediately there follows
the first of a whole series

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:23.280
of abridgments of the third
voyage of Captain Cook,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.730
this one published
in four volumes,

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:33.410
each volume comprising six
parts, 24 parts in all.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.300
They make no bones about the
fact that it's an abridgment,

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.590
as you can see, and you
can follow the progress

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.590
of this along merely by
looking at the direction line,

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.550
which will tell you in
an unabashed way exactly

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:51.400
where they are in the progress
of this coming out in parts.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.380
Will it surprise anyone
by this juncture to note

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:58.900
that they had the
subscribers all lined up

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.160
and already paying in advance?

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.160
No. No. So the reason why
this is issued in parts is

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:14.040
because the first part can be
printed the first day of sale

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.930
and be available by the
second day and they can begin

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:22.060
to satisfy all the subscribers
by the end of the week

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:28.040
because it's only one
fascicle in the six by four set

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.690
of fascicles that they're going
to use for the whole thing.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.800
This is ingenuous.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.300
Many of you will never heard

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.700
of a bookseller named
George Kearsley

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.480
who we saw earlier the
Beauties of Johnson.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:45.470
Here you see that it's
an unabashed abridgment.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.480
Right there it says the
first word an "abridgment"

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:52.320
of Captain Cook's last voyage
and the plate of the death

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.850
of Cook right in
the frontispiece,

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:58.640
the portal into the
sensational story.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:04.540
And Kearsley publishes his
abridgment for four shillings.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:06.970
That's the second one.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:10.010
And here, note the
rhetoric of the abridgment.

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.400
Here, it is an undoubted fact
that not one person in 50 can

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.920
with convenience or
propriety make the purchase,

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:20.630
however eager the
curiosity pursue it

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:24.090
but we will accommodate
you, gentle reader.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.390
We will help you.

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.600
We will make this
available to you.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.040
It will be better,
faster, stronger.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:31.340
You get the idea.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.610
It's the same rhetoric
as you're getting

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.090
when Ortelius is abridged
and those three maps,

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.630
the star map [inaudible] and
the other map are added, right.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:42.930
This is the same idea.

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:48.640
Somehow this is smaller
but somehow this is bigger.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.800
Right? Because we're giving
you what you most want.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:56.580
Then the third abridgment
comes out and I want you

00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:01.030
to understand there
are 49 plates

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.940
in this abridgment and two maps.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.170
This is not a cheap
print production.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:13.530
I mean, it's relatively cheap
compared to paying 4.5 guineas

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:16.350
but this is not the
low-end of the market.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.200
The low-end of the market
is yet to be exploited

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:22.460
and I won't iterate
every abridgment of Cook.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:28.250
But this too is a highly
desirable production and raises

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:32.050
for us the question, I
believe, what does it mean

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.530
to read an abridgment
in the 18th century?

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.630
What does it mean to
undertake an abridgment?

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:42.410
It seems not at all to be
an occasion of shame either

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:46.760
to consume these things or
to produce these things.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.230
Rather, it seems that
this is part and parcel

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:56.230
of the ordinary operation of the
marketplace and yet an aspect

00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:00.080
of the operation of the
marketplace that we have again

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:03.610
and again missed for
a variety of reasons,

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:07.520
some of which I've
tried to delineate here.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.040
So then in my view, the
history of the abridgment

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.550
of Cook's third voyage
becomes still more interesting

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:20.380
when we look at their
reprinting in America

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:24.040
and in other provincial markets.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.910
So here we see those
three volumes

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:35.290
in a large octavo become 9
and 1/2 sheets in duodecimo

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:40.580
in Isaiah Thomas' [inaudible],
very, very interesting

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.520
because of the bespoke nature
of what an abridgment is

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:52.340
and his measure of the
carrying capacity of his market

00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:58.350
or here we see in Philadelphia
an 18 [inaudible] production

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:00.470
in just seven sheets.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.520
This is remarkable to me.

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.610
A city like Philadelphia
is going to deliver Cook

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.210
in such a truncated way.

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.770
Why? Because they can

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:18.770
and because he limits his
capital risk or even here,

00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:25.060
this more extensive rendering
of Cook here in Boston,

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.650
the whole thing,
the three voyages

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:33.330
in just two volumes duodecimo.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:37.220
Right? So here are
all the best bits.

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:39.160
It's not the CliffsNotes.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.670
This is Cook's voyages but
it's Cook's voyages in a way

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:48.940
that you can afford and
it's Cook's voyages in a way

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:54.580
that the undertaker can
afford to deliver to market.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:58.940
So it seems to me, ladies and
gentleman, that the presence

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:03.810
of these abridgments in
the market need to occasion

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:08.870
in us a rethinking of how
we conduct literary history

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:13.570
and ought to, I think,
in us revive our sense

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:18.190
of how essential bibliography
and book history can be

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:23.670
to understanding the
reception history of books.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:27.870
A caution, you cannot get most

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:32.250
of this information
out of catalogs.

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:37.620
There is no substitute
for the haptic knowledge

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.980
of holding the book in your hand

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:46.100
and examining it
with your own eyes.

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.530
Oftentimes, the abridgments
are not cataloged as such

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.270
and so you need to
really look at the books.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.320
And if you really want to
understand how they're made and,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:02.370
above all, what their
production values actually are,

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:05.760
you need to look
at a lot of books.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:11.700
Graham Pollard famously said,
you know nothing about books

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.740
until you have examined
with your own hands

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:21.110
and your own eyes
5000 hand-press books.

00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:26.200
So we need to restore, as
librarians, as scholars,

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:31.160
as curators, as conservators,
we need to restore a sense

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:35.670
of the essential nature of
the haptic knowledge of books

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:40.460
as cultural objects that
can teach us again and again

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:47.290
that our old certainties are
false, that our old pictures

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.880
of the market and of
the way things were read

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:55.100
and understood are
at best partial.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:00.080
As Mr. Shelley teaches
us, "We must learn

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.290
to imagine what we know."

00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.090
Thank you very much, indeed.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:11.700
[ Applause ]

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.640
I'd be very happy
to take questions.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:18.350
Please.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.850
&gt;&gt; I assume the law
changed at some point.

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:24.030
&gt;&gt; The law does change at
some point because if you try

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:26.900
to make an abridgment, they're
going to throw you in jail,

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:28.230
if it's not authorized.

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.650
Right, so copyright law
changes a great deal

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:33.210
in the 19th century.

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.820
But for the 18th century,
this is the practice.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:41.290
Now it is true that the
stationer's company does have

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:45.760
ways of trying to marginalize
you if you operate outside

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:52.490
of the [inaudible] and taboos
of the guild but it's also true

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.590
that there are lots of people,

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.870
especially the provincial
booksellers

00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:01.480
and the booksellers abroad, who
make abridgments all the time.

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.760
Scotland, Dublin, America,

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.450
and indeed once you get
outside the home counties,

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:12.420
none of these are, there are
no prosecutions for this.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.960
&gt;&gt; My sister had a copy of
"Little Women," that I grew

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:22.250
up reading and it wasn't until
I was reading it to my daughter

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.900
that I realized that what she
had had was an abridged edition

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:28.700
and I have no memory of
it saying anywhere on it

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.820
that it was abridged
[inaudible] 20th century.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:35.260
&gt;&gt; Sure. And so this abridged
edition of "Little Women"

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.520
that doesn't even call
attention to itself

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:43.200
as an abridgment is produced in
part for the very same reasons

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.880
that as it were my booksellers
were producing these abridged

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.350
editions because
they're cheaper,

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:53.490
because the capital
risk is delimited,

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.300
and because they're
less intimidating.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:00.940
They seem to be friendlier
books, down formats, smaller,

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.060
less an investment of
your money and time.

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:07.950
And so why wouldn't you do that?

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.750
Yeah. Please.

00:55:09.750 --> 00:56:20.200
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:22.450
[Inaudible] it's
a great question.

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.090
So let me just repeat
the gist of it.

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.940
Obviously, the whole thrust

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:28.720
of this argument is
somehow [inaudible]

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:32.440
because there's no
sort of perfect version

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:36.420
of "Robinson Crusoe" or
Moll Flanders in the sky

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:41.150
but rather we need to look at
what was actually happening

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:44.710
on the ground and how people
were reading their books.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:49.990
Dare I say we need to do the
history of reading in part

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:53.440
from the material
objects themselves.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:57.060
Reading is conditioned of
course by social practices

00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:02.030
and I would never be a material
determinist but surely we need

00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:06.380
to understand reading
practices as highly conditioned

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:13.300
by that beautiful and complex
equation between materialities

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:17.270
and the making of culturally
instantiated meanings.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:23.210
And so we need to look at
what's actually happening and,

00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:27.460
therefore, Dr. Kleiner [assumed
spelling] asks the question,

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.680
is it not the case that there's
some evidence of the reception

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.730
of these and some
kind of comparing.

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:40.450
And here, I feel like I often
felt as a child at the school

00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:46.450
of the holy child Jesus standing
before the nuns and confessing,

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:49.970
in this regard I have
not done my homework

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:54.140
because this project is in
process and I haven't gone

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:57.090
to the review journals, the
Monthly and the Critical

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.360
and the Edinburgh to look
for these data points.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.060
So they may be out there and
they may not be out there.

00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.900
I don't know the answer, but
it's extremely salutary point

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:13.290
to make, is there any weighing
up of the abridgments of Cook

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.110
to say, oh, the Kearsley
is rubbish

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.400
but this other one
is really good

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.540
and you'll get much better
value for your money.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:23.510
I would hope so.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:25.910
But I don't know.

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:27.210
John.

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:32.050
&gt;&gt; I have a sort of
related question, Michael.

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:42.780
How much corroborating evidence
have you come up with thus far

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:47.280
for your assertion regarding
contemporary attitudes

00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.870
about abridgments?

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:51.160
If I'm reading your
argument correctly

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:55.600
and I may have missed something,
the argument is running,

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.100
there were a whole
heck of a lot of them

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:02.360
and respected people were
doing them and, therefore,

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.750
attitudes toward
them were positive.

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.610
But the same could be said for,

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:14.200
and I may be wrong misreading
you, but the same could be said

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.210
for study guides today.

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.600
We have the learned Harold Bloom
writing the learned version

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:27.500
of CliffsNotes just as we
and there are vast numbers

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:34.600
of four separate editions of the
CliffsNotes for Jane Eyre alone

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:40.430
and four [inaudible] literature
guide and everything else.

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:44.030
Is this a 20th century attitude?

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.200
Is this an 18th century
attitude?

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.710
And is it in fact different?

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.010
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:59:51.010 --> 00:59:54.160
I would say that Harold Bloom
engages in this activity

00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.260
because he has a disabled son,

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.180
a developmentally disabled
son who's going to be

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:01.850
in an institution for
the rest of his life

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:04.840
and this is how Bloom
intends to make sure

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:08.620
that his son never lacks the
support that he requires.

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.990
I think Bloom is in some ways
an outlier in doing this.

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.360
I think most of the people

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.250
who write the CliffsNotes
are impoverished postdocs

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.810
or graduate students.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.490
I'm sorry.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.460
But it's also true that
I have been looking

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.190
for derisory remarks
about these abridgments

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:31.110
and of course the original
publishing booksellers don't

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:34.890
like them except for when
they themselves commission the

01:00:34.890 --> 01:00:39.780
abridgments as in that marvelous
consortium of the princes

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:44.240
of publishing in the middle
of the 18th century Miller,

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.290
Dodsley, Kearsley, and
so on, all who own shares

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:51.070
in the dictionary and they
know exactly what to do

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:55.620
and they know exactly who their
man is and exactly how to do it.

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:59.640
So I think an abridgment
is a really great thing

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.530
when you're going to
make money from it

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:03.620
and an abridgment is
not a really good thing

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.040
when somebody's going
to make money

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:07.620
from what you have
originally published.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.880
And I think it's
as simple as that.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:14.830
I think that we're a
bit idealistic and naive

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:20.390
when we think about what
somebody like Robert Dodsley,

01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:25.270
how he may have thought about
his business undertakings.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:31.570
His principal goal, mirabile
dictu, is to make money and,

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.390
sure, he understands
that he's going

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:37.070
to occupy a certain
stratum in the market

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:43.580
but within certain
behaviors that are forbidden,

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.330
he's going to do
just about all he can

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.690
to leverage his advantage, both
against his fellow booksellers

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:56.420
and to activate the consumer
habits of the public.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:02.060
And so I have not found
any derisory comments

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.650
from either authors
or booksellers

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:07.810
about the world of abridgments.

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:13.270
And I think in many ways it's
akin to saying, hey, you know,

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:17.180
my article got syndicated
or, you know, hey,

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:20.580
this thing is reprinted
in another venue

01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.950
and that's terrific and more
people will get to see it.

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:28.840
So for the most part I haven't
been able to find that sort

01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:31.890
of material though I've
certainly been looking for it.

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:37.350
And Goldsmith, who, you know,
drinks a lot and gambles a lot,

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:42.710
does not in any way seem to
do this out of desperation,

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:44.340
for the most part, right.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:47.470
We know that Johnson
appears at Goldsmith's door

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:49.570
and brings the money
to his creditors

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:51.590
because the bailiffs
are pacing up

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:53.070
and down in front of his door.

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:58.020
So maybe Goldsmith isn't the
best example but Smollett is not

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:03.480
in penury of any kind when he's
undertaking these abridgments,

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.060
to the best of my knowledge.

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:08.680
Johnson could have commissioned
the abridgment of the dictionary

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.210
to someone else very
easily but he does not.

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:16.260
So I think it's important
to say, you know,

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:18.820
people were undertaking
these abridgments

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.420
because they were
successful, you know.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:23.070
The abridgers were making money.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.760
The booksellers were
making money.

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.210
The publishing, you
know, the other sellers

01:03:28.210 --> 01:03:30.110
of the abridgments
were making money.

01:03:30.110 --> 01:03:34.850
This seems to me like win, win,
win all around but not part

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.670
of the collecting
practice of individuals

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:42.320
or cultural institutions,
inordinately low survival rates,

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:46.730
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
and this to me is why, you know,

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:49.090
how can I say, oh, well
this has always been here

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:50.860
but we just haven't noticed.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.970
Well, I think because of a
concatenation of a variety

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:57.570
of reasons, some of which
are about the survival

01:03:57.570 --> 01:04:01.800
of material traces and some
of which are about the nature

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.050
of the cultural products
that are for projects

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.940
that our forebears
have undertaken.

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:17.080
&gt;&gt; The 19th in America you read

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:22.950
that people were ecstatic
thinking about the arrival

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:27.900
of a new Scott novel
from England.

01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:35.450
Would this have been
abridged or stolen from Scott?

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:37.630
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a very
interesting question.

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.990
So the question is, you know,
people, we know, for instance,

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.290
let's just shift from Scott

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.130
to Dickens just for
a moment, right.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.970
We know, for instance,
that people were waiting

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.360
on the dockside of
New York, right,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.480
to see what happened
a little Nell, right.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.080
You know, we know
that, you know,

01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:58.250
the police were worried
there are so many people

01:04:58.250 --> 01:05:00.960
on the dock waiting for
the ship to come in so

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.260
that someone could, you know,

01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:06.000
break open the package
and read the passage.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.160
And I won't spoil what
happens to little Nell

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.330
in case you don't know but many,

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:15.420
many unhappy people
left the dock that day.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:17.190
Men were weeping.

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:18.740
But Dickens, of course,

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:28.330
undertakes his reading tour
precisely because he is furious

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:31.090
that the American
booksellers are making

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:36.940
so much money off his wit and
imagination and word craft

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.720
and he's making nothing.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:44.610
So he'd says, damn it, I'm going
to undertake a reading tour

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:49.950
because I have this popularity
and I am going to find a way

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:53.890
to capitalize on it
because all the booksellers

01:05:53.890 --> 01:05:57.580
who are publishing
my works are pirates.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:02.690
And even Conan Doyle,
for instance, you know,

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:05.820
quite a bit later, Conan
Doyle comes to America

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.650
to undertake his reading
tour and his lecturing tour

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:12.590
for the very same reason.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:15.840
The way that the American
copyright law is written

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:21.310
at that juncture is that
international copyright obtains

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:27.050
if the book is published first
in America and, of course,

01:06:27.050 --> 01:06:30.710
that's not what happens most
of the time and, therefore,

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:34.300
these books are not protected
in the United States and,

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:38.470
therefore, authors find other
expedience in order to try

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:42.510
to capitalize on
their popularity.

01:06:42.510 --> 01:07:06.950
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:08.540
So the question is, well,

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.040
if these abridgments
-- May I paraphrase?

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.960
If these abridgments are so
darn ubiquitous, Michael,

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:19.930
then surely there must
be some reflexivity

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:26.500
that they must affect the
cultural production of novels.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.850
Perhaps. On the other hand,
we need to remember that,

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:34.030
for instance, when George
Eliot publishes "Middlemarch"

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:39.440
in those eight parts, she has
an incentive for prolixity.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.130
I think "Middlemarch" is the
greatest novel ever published

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:43.550
in the English language.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:50.850
Others may disagree,
maybe, but she has a reason

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.550
to make it be in eight parts.

01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:55.750
That's what her contract says.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.450
Dickens, you know, needs to get

01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.470
to that 19th and
20th part, right.

01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:04.360
Thackeray, you know, there's
a reason why "Vanity Fair" is

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:08.310
as long as it is or "Pendennis"
or the "The Virginians"

01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:11.790
or even "The History of Henry
Esmond" for Pete's sake.

01:08:11.790 --> 01:08:17.820
So it seems to me that there
are two contrary market forces

01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.570
at work and I think
that the bird

01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:23.730
in the hand is worth
a lot more than two

01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:25.610
in the bush in this instance.

01:08:25.610 --> 01:08:30.060
So I personally -- Again,
I've only been working on this

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.360
for about three years

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.340
and I think this requires
quite a sustained study.

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.950
I like to assure you it's not
the only thing I ever plan to do

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:43.210
with the rest of my life but
at the same time I do believe

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.090
that this requires
further study.

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:48.280
And the question of
how it translates

01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.910
into 19th century practice,
I leave to my betters,

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:54.840
many of whom are
sitting in this audience.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.640
Please.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:23.030
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:26.590
Is it correct to assume

01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:30.800
that because these are less
expensive print products

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.760
and occupy a different
stratum in the marketplace

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.780
that the production
values are inferior

01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.520
to the original production
values?

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.920
Is that fair paraphrase?

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.990
No, not at all and that's one
of the reasons why I wanted

01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:50.980
in particular to show
you that third abridgment

01:09:50.980 --> 01:10:00.770
of Cook's final voyage because
with 49 charts and two cuts

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:03.610
in the book this is a
remarkable, you know,

01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:05.650
high-value production.

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:09.250
It is true that some of them
are on lesser paper, which is,

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:10.930
you know, most of the cost

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:15.600
of producing the book,
but by no means all.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:20.450
I would say that the "Tom Jones"
for instance that I showed you,

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:23.000
now it happens to be a very nice
copy in the Houghton Library

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.210
and the binding is
in some ways risible.

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:29.170
It's a collector's binding, very
rare thing to find an abridgment

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:30.470
in a collector's binding,

01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:33.100
speaking to the point we
were addressing earlier.

01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:40.080
But no, I find that for the most
part the production values are

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.290
quite high with some
notable exceptions.

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:50.660
And I would say, too, it
would be injudicious of us

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:57.140
to compare printing in Hartford,
Connecticut to printing

01:10:57.140 --> 01:10:59.550
in London at the same time

01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:02.880
because the resources just
aren't the same, right.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.920
So we need to be a little bit
careful about comparing apples

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:10.050
to apples and not
comparing apples to oranges.

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:12.870
I think if we were to sort of
say, well, how are you going

01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:15.840
to evaluate that Hartford,
Connecticut production,

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.770
we'd need to compare it
to original publications

01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:22.220
that were also part
of provincial presses

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:27.920
in New England and we would see
that indeed this one is as good

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:31.170
as anything that's
coming off those presses.

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:36.260
So again, I think that these
are of course price points

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.230
but there are certainly
theories about the market.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:46.810
And I think that to make
the books unattractive

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:49.330
with a few exceptions.

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:54.400
I mean we saw that those
halfpenny half sheet epitomes

01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:00.930
of "Jure Divino" are
nasty productions, right.

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.230
The paper is bad.

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:04.020
Of course, the paper
trade in England is bad

01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:07.370
at the time but the
paper is bad.

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:09.920
The press work isn't
particularly good.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.600
The wood cut on the
cover is stolen.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:18.240
It's reversed from
the second edition

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.180
of "True-born Englishman"
and so on.

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.280
So it's not always the case.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:28.310
There are times when -- But I
think that in the case of the

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:32.350
"Jure Divino" it's
because of speed.

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:33.650
It's not because so much --

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.910
It's not merely because
of price point.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:39.620
It's because speed is of
the essence at that moment

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:42.610
in getting the product to
market and that's, you know,

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:47.200
you can make it, you can make
it good and you can make it fast

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.110
and you can make it cheap,

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:51.600
but you can't make
it all three, right.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.110
You have to choose.

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:56.510
You can make a good and fast
but it's not cheap, right.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.010
You can make it cheap and good

01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:01.420
but then it's not going
to be fast and so on.

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.700
So you have this
triangle of value

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.450
and you can only ever have
two of them at the same time.

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:12.340
And to me that's a very
useful heuristic for thinking

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.250
about the book trade
more generally.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.490

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.790

&gt;&gt; You talk about the value
of speed when creating a book.

01:13:24.010 --> 01:13:31.000
Did book sellers or writers ever
publish their own abridgments

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.500
or were abridgments
something that [inaudible]?

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.800
&gt;&gt; It's interesting.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.360
Well, certainly Goldsmith
abridges his own abridgments.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.770
Johnson abridges
his own writings.

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:48.950
But by and large --
It's a good question.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:55.450
By and large, as
far as I know, not.

01:13:55.450 --> 01:14:01.730
Now one of the issues is
I've been searching mostly

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:05.260
in the manuscripts division
of the British Library

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:09.140
for the agreements for
undertaking abridgments.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.850
As you might imagine,
they're not well calendared

01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:15.530
and they're hard to find.

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:23.070
But for the most part, we
don't see authors undertaking

01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:25.610
abridgments of their own works.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:28.990
Let's take for instance in works
of science because they say,

01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:33.980
well, I'm, you know, I'm trying
to do work or in the case

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:37.790
of novelists, because these
abridgments, generally speaking,

01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:40.890
are meant to be sure bet,
it's the reprint trade

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:44.190
and they're undertaking
possibility of writing a novel

01:14:44.190 --> 01:14:49.620
or a new play for which the
income they would receive is

01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:52.010
much greater than for
undertaking the abridgment.

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:54.590
So again, I think
this is a marketplace

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:57.130
and we haven't figured
abridgments as part

01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:59.510
of the marketplace
either in authorship

01:14:59.510 --> 01:15:00.870
or in the bookselling world

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:03.510
or in the consumption
of cultural goods.

01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:07.300
And I do think that the
more we countenance this,

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:11.180
the more we'll know, and we'll
get a fuller thicker picture

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.460
of what's actually
happening in the culture.

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:16.090
Let's have the final question.

01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:18.170
You need to eat.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:21.750
&gt;&gt; Did it work the other way?

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.110
Would the American author expect

01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:28.460
to see his novel abridgment
[inaudible] see that happening?

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.860
&gt;&gt; Well, in the 19th
century, of course,

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.710
the only novel that's
published for a long time

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.920
by an American printer is

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.290
when Ben Franklin produces
his edition of "Clarissa"

01:15:43.290 --> 01:15:47.510
and that goes, "Pamela," I'm
sorry, of "Pamela" and that goes

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:52.490
so badly that it's more than
30 years before a new novel is

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:57.880
printed in the United
States, as it were.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.600
So for the most part,

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:06.720
those longer print productions
are produced in England anyway

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.670
and so then they become part of
the ecosystem in a normal way.

01:16:10.670 --> 01:16:12.650
I have kept you a long time.

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:14.890
I'm very grateful for
your attentiveness.

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:17.990
I would be glad to answer
questions for those of you

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:22.300
who still have remaining
questions or comments

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:26.290
or indeed excoriations
and I thank you very much

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.090
for coming this evening.

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:33.600
[ Applause ]

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
