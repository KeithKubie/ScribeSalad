1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:01,771
Okay.

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:06,480
So we're talking about Nmr spectroscopy
and today we'll talk about that.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
Tools that you use to identify are the
aspects of Nmr Nmr spectroscopy that

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:16,920
allow you to assign
structures to molecules. Uh,

5
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,120
so the chemical shift, which
involves diamagnetic, anti Satrapi,

6
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:25,710
the word that you will impress your
friends with and spin, spin coupling.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,010
And maybe at the end we'll get
to dynamics if not next time.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,860
So as we said last time there,
the,

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,540
the precession frequency of
the protons in a molecule,

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,360
a depends on the magnetic field they see,

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,170
which is mostly this enormous
applied magnetic field.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,340
But there's also a little fields in the
molecule that make a difference to give

13
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:49,740
this effective field in particular,

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,390
the orbiting of electrons,
the net orbiting of electrons,

15
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,150
because they orbit both
ways and mostly cancel.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,530
But a little bit of net orbiting gives
rise to what's called the chemical shift,

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,830
which can change the field by 12 parts
per million in roughly for protons,

18
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:12,210
sometimes a little more 200 parts per
million for carbon because they're more

19
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:16,410
electrons around carbon. Right?
But there's another effect,

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,500
another magnet to bear in mind that
the magnetic aspect of nuclei is not

21
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:27,140
influenced by electric
stuff, right? So that that a,

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,260
a proton,

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,560
the nucleus of a in a molecule
is held in position in x,

24
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:38,430
Y, z by the electron
density around it. Okay?

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,510
That's the bonds we talk about.
But the orientation of the magnet,

26
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,450
right, is not, is not at all
or is rarely effected by that,

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,490
right? It's affected only by magnetic
things, not by electric charges.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,780
Okay.

29
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,780
Just moving electric charges that generate
magnetism does it so that it's as if

30
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:04,570
the, the Proton is on
a, is on a perfect, uh,

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,210
uh, ball bearing or something. If this
is the molecule and the Ma and the,

32
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
and the molecule rotates the,
the,

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,810
the spin keeps pointing to the same way,
right?

34
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:18,810
It doesn't rotate with the molecule.
Okay.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,460
We'll talk about that a little
more on just a second. Uh,

36
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,590
okay. But, but so the things that are
magnetic or the circulation of electrons

37
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,170
and nearby magnetic nuclei,
they're obviously magnetic too.

38
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:38,040
So if there's more than one magnetic
nucleus, then you get what's called spins.

39
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:42,330
Been splitting as we'll discuss and
notice that the units are different from

40
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,100
that. We talk about the units of spins,
been splitting in terms of hurts.

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,150
That is frequency, that is
energy, not parts per million,

42
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,800
not a fractional unit. And you'll
see why. So first the chemical shift,

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,000
which is due to this electron orbiting
and involves diamagnetic can I Satrapi.

44
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,270
Hey, we saw last time this idea
that when you have higher, uh,

45
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,070
electron density around the Proton,

46
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:14,071
you get more of this diamagnetic
shielding and the peaks are shifted to the

47
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
right.

48
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,240
And when you have less electron density
is in the carboxylic acid there shifted

49
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,460
to the left.
And that made some sense.

50
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,280
But there were things
that didn't make sense,

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,810
like a settling where you'd think that
the sp hybridization of the carbon would

52
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,470
withdraw electrons from the hydrogens
and shifted down field compared to the

53
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:36,970
double bond. It shifts it up field.
Right? And furthermore, as you'll see,

54
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,850
the same thing applies to benzene.

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,540
It's shifted downfield compared
to other hydrogens on carbon,

56
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,710
carbon double bonds.

57
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,370
And the reason is this thing
called diamagnetic anti Satrapi,

58
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,660
which we will now discuss.

59
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,110
So you get Daya magnetism from orbiting
electrons. So suppose that, uh,

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,100
that red.is the nucleus and we're in an
applied field and there are electrons

61
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:05,101
that are circulating around the nucleus
and they create the name Daya magnetism

62
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:07,330
means that opposes the applied field.

63
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:12,220
So they reduce the field that seen by the,
by the nucleus.

64
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,650
And that's the source of these splittings.

65
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:18,280
We were these shifts that
we were talking about. Okay,

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,990
but now we're talking here about
electrons orbiting around this nucleus.

67
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,070
The one we're looking at,

68
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,810
there are lots of other electrons in
the molecule orbiting other nuclei.

69
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,200
What effect do they have?
Okay,

70
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,500
so suppose we're interested in
the field at the red nucleus,

71
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,090
but there's some other nucleus,

72
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,350
the blue one and electrons are
circulating around it too. Now,

73
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:46,060
what effect is that going to have on the
field seeing at the red nucleus? Okay,

74
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,260
well we can look at the lines of force
and see it has the same kind of effect

75
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,490
but not as strong because it
depends on one over r cubed.

76
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,630
So as you move away,
the effect gets smaller.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,200
That's not surprising that you can see
the lines of force get further away as

78
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,940
you move further up,
okay?

79
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:08,290
So the effect is weaker from the same
number of orbiting electrons on another

80
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,090
nucleus.
That's fine.

81
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,570
But suppose that the nucleus were studied
is fixed relative to the other nuclei

82
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:21,040
by bonds buy a bond like
that or other bonds.

83
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:25,240
It could be connected in a complicated
way to the blue nucleus, okay?

84
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,950
And suppose that the molecule rotates,

85
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,310
right? So it's not always in the same
field. So we can look at it like this.

86
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,210
Here's the, uh, can you see
this here? Okay, so here's the,

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,520
here's the nucleus we're interested in,

88
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,080
and here's the other nucleus about which
things are spinning or are orbiting,

89
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,830
right? And as we go like this, right?

90
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,650
Sometimes we're in a region
where the field is pointing up,

91
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,170
sometimes in a region pointing down.
In fact,

92
00:05:56,171 --> 00:05:59,480
I have it the wrong way here because
I'm wanting to use this same diagram for

93
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:03,080
another purpose later,
okay? But you can see that,

94
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,670
that we're going to have to average,

95
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:09,650
if the molecule is tumbling rapidly to
see what the influence of electrons here

96
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,910
are when we're over here.

97
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,703
Okay.

98
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,960
So let's try to do the average.
Okay. When it was up, when it was,

99
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:23,160
when the bond was pointing up, we saw that
the field pointed down. How about here?

100
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:27,780
When the bond is down, which way does the
field point from the blue circulation?

101
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,063
Debbie,

102
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,770
look at the lines of force. Which way
are they pointing down road? Where?

103
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,790
Where the red nucleuses down.
Okay. So it's the same. Good.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,930
That's going to reinforce it. But
suppose it's turned at 90 degrees there.

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,920
Keep us going, Debbie. Now, which
direction to those lines points.

106
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,260
Oh, okay. And how about if
we rotate to the other side?

107
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,750
And how about a four at 45,

108
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,440
or actually some a little bit
less than 45 degrees there.

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,930
Oh, they're pointing sort of down
to the, uh, down to the right. Okay.

110
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,550
And if we're over there,

111
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,030
they're pointed down to the
left and if they're down here,

112
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,850
down at the bottom there,
pointing down to the right or the left,

113
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,970
depending on where we are.
So we have to average all of these.

114
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,030
Some of them are bigger than others. There
are pointing in different directions.

115
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:25,110
But notice that if we average
over a whole circle of rotation,

116
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,820
then the ones that are at
the top and at the bottom,

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,270
within the scope of those
double headed yellow arrows,

118
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,050
those are all net down,
right?

119
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,850
Some are down very strongly,

120
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,780
some are down very weakly and the right
and the left one's cancel one another,

121
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,170
right? And the right to left.
So it's net down at the top,

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,240
net down at the bottom also.
But on the sides it's net up.

123
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,870
Everybody with me now
which one's gonna win?

124
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:56,700
Yeah,

125
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,020
the ups and the downs.

126
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,990
Why do you say the downs first?
They're more of them,

127
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,240
right? And second, they
can be stronger. In fact,

128
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,420
if this turns out up at the top to be
twice the lines of force are twice as

129
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:15,840
close together here as they are out here,
there's a factor of two.

130
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,960
So clearly the downs have it right.

131
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:24,030
So if you average around the circle,
you're going to get net down. However,

132
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,400
that's not the way you average.

133
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,130
Can everybody see why you
don't average around a circle?

134
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,990
When I look at the effect of this,
the fields over here on this,

135
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,630
why don't I just average around a circle?

136
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,220
Because the molecule is not held
in a plane. It can go this way too.

137
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,790
Okay? So we have to average over
a sphere, not around a circle,

138
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,600
right? And notice that when
you average over a sphere,

139
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,770
you get much more area around the
equator than you do up at the polls going

140
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,740
around the sphere.

141
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,690
So now that's going to be an advantage
for the ones that are pointing up a much

142
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,820
heavier weight and the averaging,
right?

143
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,060
And it turns out that the net
average over a sphere is zero.

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,920
And that's great because it means you
don't have to worry about it, right?

145
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,060
You can't get an effect from someplace,
the circulation someplace else.

146
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,310
If you're only interested in the
ones that are circulating about you.

147
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,331
Right.

148
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:35,331
That obviously simplifies our life greatly
except for diamagnetic anti Satrapi.

149
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,790
Okay, so let's see what that is. So we
can ignore the electrons on other atoms.

150
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,980
Good News.
Unless orbit,

151
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,040
unless the amount of orbiting depends
on the orientation of the molecule and

152
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,840
then they aren't all that or not.

153
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,500
That's not always the same orbiting
for different orientations. Okay,

154
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,220
so let's just suppose that were up
there and suppose when the molecule is

155
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,330
oriented vertically,

156
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,110
that way when our nucleus is above
these circulating the electrons,

157
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,670
suppose there's less orbiting for
some reason in that orientation.

158
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,940
So we're going to make that a pink things
thinner and that will have the effect

159
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,370
of making the magnetic field less.

160
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:21,450
The lines of forests are now further apart
and that means we don't have as big a

161
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,450
field up on the up on top.
Everybody see?

162
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,410
So if it Everage to zero
before it will average up.

163
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,870
Now everybody with me because we've cut
down on the amounts that are going up.

164
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,000
When the molecule is in this orientation,

165
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,130
if when it's down in
the other orientation,

166
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:44,930
you have the full compliment of
circulation, then the DA, then the,

167
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,530
the ups are going to win. Okay, so that,

168
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,620
and this is what's called diamagnetic
and I saw atrophy diamagnetic as this

169
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:57,570
circulation that causes a field opposed
to the applied field and is driven by

170
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,600
the applied field.
Right.

171
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,330
The reason it's there is because you
put the applied field on and if you put

172
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:07,770
more applied field on you get
more of it. But in a, in a stay,

173
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,340
in a fixed field, right? You
have this diode magnetism,

174
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,790
but it's not isotropic isotropic means
the same in all directions if it's

175
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:20,130
different in different directions
than it doesn't cancel anymore.

176
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,450
So diamagnetic anisotropy
means that you're in trouble,

177
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,200
that you have to consider the
electrons on other nuclei as well.

178
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,840
So let's consider that
in the case of benzene.

179
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,470
So we have these Pi orbitals
overlapping in benzene.

180
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,740
And then when you put a magnetic
field on in that direction,

181
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:42,210
you can cause circulation of those
electrons. Net circulation. Okay.

182
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,430
Now that creates the field that's,

183
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,700
that's opposed to the applied
field in the middle of the ring.

184
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,740
But reinforcing the applied field
out on the, where the protons are.

185
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,460
Everybody with me on that.

186
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,450
So it's reinforcing the
applied field however.

187
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,220
So it's like that.
But if you turn the molecule edge edge on,

188
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,410
then you don't have the path anymore
where they can circulate because they're

189
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,970
driven by the big field.

190
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,110
They circulate around the big field
and now the path isn't there to go on.

191
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,600
So it turns it off or at least reduces
it when you turn the molecule that way.

192
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,640
So this is exactly a
situation of diamagnetic anti
Satrapi where you have the

193
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:27,550
effect for some
orientations and not others.

194
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,470
And now there'll be a net average
field due to the circulation in these p

195
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:35,440
orbitals of carbon as
seen by the hydrogens,

196
00:12:35,441 --> 00:12:38,560
which is what you're looking
at in your NMR spectroscopy.

197
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,020
So it's a net d shielding.

198
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,340
The orientation shown here is the one
that dominates, where the field is big,

199
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,810
where the circulation is big, it's not
big when you turn it the other way.

200
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,690
So this,
this one wins and this one,

201
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,780
notice this one reinforces the applied
field at the position of the nuclei were

202
00:12:58,871 --> 00:12:59,704
interested in.

203
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,780
So that means that they
get shifted down field.

204
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,850
So that's why in benzene,

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,120
the protons are further down field that
way than you would have expected just

206
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,700
from their being in an sp squared bond.
Okay.

207
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,220
Now this then provided, once this
was appreciated, Nmr came along.

208
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,860
It came along at the same time that
people were interested in hookah.

209
00:13:24,861 --> 00:13:29,861
Lara meticisly four n plus two and it
was a happy coincidence because in a

210
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:35,590
molecule like this one here,
which has 14 Pi electrons,

211
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,390
is that four n plus two right?
It's four times three plus two.

212
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,020
So this is like Ben should
be like benzene, right?

213
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,050
Four Times three plus two and this is,

214
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,760
this is the Nmr spectrum in the normal
region of that compound. However,

215
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:56,230
what comes at zero? Remember
what comes at zero. That's tms,

216
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,340
our reference peak.

217
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,730
And what comes at 7.2 that turns
out to be the solvent flora form,

218
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,110
right? So tms and chloroform, there
are no peaks for our compound,

219
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,690
right? The reason is we have to
look out of the normal range,

220
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:16,990
right?
So if you look for those protons,

221
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:22,060
you find them way down there further
down from where benzene usually comes,

222
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,910
which is in the seven to eight region.
Okay.

223
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,770
And that's exactly the same region that
they're out beside the plain of this

224
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:33,190
thing that Molly, the electrons
are circulating around that loop.

225
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,260
When the molecule is flat like this,

226
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,640
and it feels exactly the same kind of
effect as in benzene, except more so.

227
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,770
Okay. Now, but there are methyl
groups there too. Where are they?

228
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,610
Do we have to go still further down field?

229
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,420
Where are the methyl groups?
Right?

230
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,170
So there's a picture of the molecule
taken from an x ray crystal structure and

231
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:05,030
you see the circulation would be around
this path. Where are the methyl groups?

232
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,880
The methyl groups are in the middle,

233
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,490
right where the lines of force are going
the other direction and you find them

234
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,370
up here.
Right?

235
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,760
So that's a really dramatic example of
this diamagnetic and I Satrapi hey now,

236
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,700
uh, there, there, uh, once people got
this particular bit in their mouth,

237
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,330
they started looking a lot of other cases.
For example,

238
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,280
this molecule that we talked about,

239
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,870
which member had that ch two bridge
across the middle and then 10 Pi electrons

240
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,610
four times two plus two, right?

241
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,444
And again,

242
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,980
you see them shifted downfield when
they're outside and upfield when they're

243
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,840
inside, okay, now they're
not shifted as far.

244
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,710
Why not shifted as far?
There's not as much ring current.

245
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,660
They're not as many electrons. But the
other reason is that that was distorted.

246
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:06,460
So the overlap isn't as good and you
don't get as much circulation right?

247
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,960
But still you can see that it is,
uh,

248
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,500
it is benzine like it is in this context.

249
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,090
Aromatics aromatic because the
ch two is shifted up above tms.

250
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,380
Very unusual.
Okay.

251
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,720
Now that's 14 Pi electrons.

252
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,300
Suppose you treat it with potassium.

253
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,580
Potassium easily gives up electrons. It
reduces the compound. In fact, it put,

254
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,330
you can put two electrons into it.
And for this purpose,

255
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:39,500
we're going to condense the scale. Same
spectrum, but I just squeezed the scale.

256
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,470
And for reasons that will
be obvious. Okay, that,

257
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:47,471
so they're the sort of super aromatic
hydrogens shifted downfield to about nine

258
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:51,590
parts per million and the ones
on the inside shifted way up.

259
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,940
But if you put two more
electrons in and make the dye,

260
00:16:55,941 --> 00:17:00,200
and I on like that,
now it's not aromatic anymore.

261
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,730
It's four n instead of foreign plus two.
And look at its Nmr spectrum.

262
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,550
They exactly shift, right?
So aromatic goes one way.

263
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,750
Hocal antiemetic goes the
other way, right? So this was,

264
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:19,160
so there were lots and lots of examples
done like this during the 1960s and

265
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,700
early seventies
okay.

266
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:27,230
So the ch three signal shift
downfield by 26 parts per million,

267
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,190
despite adding member that the electric,
they're more electrons.

268
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:34,640
Now we've put two more electrons into
the system. They should shield it,

269
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:39,110
but in fact it's de shielded by 26
parts per million. Really dramatic.

270
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,440
Okay, so it's an anti aromatic
dance, Diane Ion. Now,

271
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:48,450
how about a settling right now,

272
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:53,100
a settling has these p orbitals that
it's were written at vertical here.

273
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:54,090
There are two p orbitals.

274
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,540
And remember about when we talked
about what the electrons look like.

275
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,180
If you have p orbitals equally occupied,

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,490
if you have three p orbitals each with
two electrons in it and look at the total

277
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:10,110
electron density, what does it
look like? It's a sphere, right?

278
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:14,730
It's not lumpy.
And to give a cylinder,

279
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,620
right? So this, this thing
has a cylinder around.

280
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,740
It's around the carbon carbon triple bond,
right?

281
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,420
So there's a path in which
electrons can circulate. Okay,

282
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,930
so we get a this diamagnetic current,

283
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,840
when we put a field on
that and get these fields,

284
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,790
how is this different from the case
in Aram? Anticipate? Do you see

285
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,680
when it was benzene, it could
circulate when the molecule was flat,

286
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,900
right?
And the hydrogens are out here.

287
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,250
Now it circulates when the molecule is
oriented this way and the hydrogens are

288
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:54,390
above the middle. So the lines of force
go exactly the opposite direction.

289
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,150
But as in benzene,
when you turn the molecule,

290
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
you don't have the path for circulation.

291
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:04,920
So it's Daya magnetically and isotropic.
It goes one way and not the other.

292
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,720
This is the way that wins.

293
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,960
And the nuclei of acetylene lie above
the orbiting path where there is ringed

294
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:12,990
current.

295
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,880
So the applied field is diminished in
the signal shifts up field rather than

296
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:22,320
downfield. So that's why when you
made it sp rather than sp squared,

297
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,710
it didn't go downfield because
of the electro negativity.

298
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,390
It went up field because of diamagnetic
and I sought therapy and it's just the

299
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:35,070
opposite of what you see in Benzie
and where the protons are beside the

300
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:38,490
circulating path rather than on its axis.

301
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,100
But here's a warning.

302
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,350
This is a handy picture and has
been taught for for 50 years now,

303
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,580
I guess close to, uh,
but it might be nonsense.

304
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,240
And Professor Weiberg
has done calculations and
observations that show that it

305
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:01,140
doesn't work for c 13,
whether it works for Protons,

306
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,110
uh, I'm not sure, but at any rate,

307
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,470
it's a really handy picture to
remember who shifts which direction.

308
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,650
And it has sort of the
ring of truth about it,

309
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:14,300
but it might not be supported by really
careful calculations of the kind of

310
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:18,210
Professor Weinberg does. Okay. So that's,

311
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,420
that's the idea of
diamagnetic anti Satrapi.

312
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,790
And what gives rise to chemical shifts.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,550
These things we talk about
pulling electrons away.

314
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,720
Mostly it's the electrons on the
nucleus in question that are important.

315
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,590
And as you pull the electrons
away, you get a shift, uh,

316
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,660
downfield right?

317
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,970
Apartment downfield downfield set
direction for you. Okay, good. Okay. But,

318
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,081
but you,

319
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:47,680
but in special circumstances you have
this diamagnetic anisotropy then you have

320
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,290
to think about it in the
terms we just talked about.

321
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,760
But there's also the local fields
that are due to other nuclei.

322
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,860
And this is called spin spin
splitting. For example. This is a,

323
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,780
this has taken,
and again,

324
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:05,530
I will recommend to you
this chem two 20 website,

325
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,270
which has NMR problems. They give
you a spectrum and say, what is it?

326
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,720
And then the nice thing is you
can show a spectrum like this.

327
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:18,020
They allow you to go in and look in
detail at the peaks and see what they're

328
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,950
integral is our and uh,
and,

329
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,090
and also gives a detailed explanation.
So there's an answer key.

330
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,680
So that's a handy place to go. But this
is, this is the first problem in that set.

331
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,480
Now you can see there are three kinds
of protons in this. It turns out,

332
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:39,250
I'll give you the answer first,
that it's ethyl acetate. Okay?

333
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,420
So there's,

334
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,420
there'll be two groups of three
protons and one group of two protons.

335
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,590
So obviously these are the three and
that's the two. Okay. But let's look at,

336
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,380
let's zoom in.
As this program allows you to do,

337
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,950
has that website allows you to do,
and when you look at that triplet,

338
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,370
you see that it's the,
when you look at that peak,

339
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:05,170
you see it's in fact three peaks and
they're in the ratio one to two to one in

340
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,630
their intensity.
Now why is that?

341
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,130
Those are the ch three
groups of the methyl group,

342
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,960
ch three protons of the, of
the a methyl group, right?

343
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,020
But adjacent to it,

344
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:23,470
there are two other protons
in the vicinity, right?

345
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,790
And you can have those oriented,

346
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,910
each of those can be oriented
either with or against the field.

347
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,900
So there are two of them.
Each can be with or against the field.

348
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,430
So there are four different ways
to do it. Okay. To to the two.

349
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,110
Okay.

350
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,110
So they're different molecules which
have different orientations of next door.

351
00:22:46,301 --> 00:22:50,530
Protons. Okay. Of those protons.
Now let's think about those.

352
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:51,940
They could both be down,

353
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:56,020
they could both be against the field
and then we get this peak. Okay.

354
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,250
Or they could both be with the
field and then we get this peak.

355
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,243
Okay.

356
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,360
So that you have it when you think you
have just one kind of molecule there.

357
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,550
In fact,
you have what you might call,

358
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:14,080
nobody calls them that I
think spin isomers. Right.

359
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,580
They differ only in how these neighboring
protons have their spin oriented,

360
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,290
but they're different molecules
in there. Okay. So there,

361
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,780
but they are so similar and energy.

362
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,580
The magnetic interaction of the protons
with the field is so small and energy

363
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,530
that the Boltzmann constant is
one equal amounts of the two.

364
00:23:35,531 --> 00:23:37,330
I mean there's a tiny,
tiny difference,

365
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:41,170
but not that you could measure
by the intensity of the lines.

366
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,700
So they're equally abundance.

367
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:47,510
So the yellow peak is just as
big as the peak or agreeing.

368
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,700
Okay.
Now what's that?

369
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,620
That's when one of them is up and the
other is down and it's just as likely as

370
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,750
the others.
So it's one to one to one,

371
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,670
but you can also have one
down in the other up right,

372
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:06,230
the opposite direction and that fit.

373
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,430
So that's why it's one to two to one
because they're all four of those are

374
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:11,270
equally likely.

375
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:14,600
And to have them come in the middle where
they cancel each other in their effect.

376
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,870
Okay, so that's a triplet.
Now how about this thing here?

377
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,580
That's a core tet and we can
figure out how that works too.

378
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:26,570
That's the Cah twos. They're shit.
Why are they shifted? Downfield

379
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,180
why did they come farther to the
left from where the methyl group was?

380
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,300
The chemical shifts there because the
oxygen's withdrawing electrons. Okay,

381
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:41,990
so are shifted down there.
They're integrates for two.

382
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,260
That's how many protons are
being involved. So it's that.

383
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,210
It's that the ch two group,
but it's a quartet. Why? Well,

384
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:54,380
let's look at the name now. There are
three hydrogens on the next door, carbon.

385
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,660
So they're going to be eight
different spin isomers uh, uh,

386
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,970
differ in the spins.
Then of the adjacent a hydrogen nuclei.

387
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:08,090
So let's think about it. There's the ones
that were, they all oppose the field.

388
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,120
They'll be up at the right,
the one where they're all with the field,

389
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,110
that'll be at the left,

390
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,610
and then you can have
one down or two down,

391
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,700
or our second one down or a third one
down. But they're all the same, right?

392
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,940
All have one down. So they come to that
peak and then there's one of them up,

393
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:30,470
a different one up, a different one up.
So it's one to three to three to one.

394
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,390
Okay. So if we have three neighbors,
we get one to three, to three to one.

395
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,230
If we have two neighbors,
we get one to two to one.

396
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,740
What if you have only one neighbor?
What patterns should you see?

397
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,750
Probably if he had just
won neighboring proton.

398
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,350
And you're looking at this one here,
what will it,

399
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,710
what will the signal of this when
you're looking at look like, right.

400
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,930
There'll be a peak like one.
Some molecules will be like that.

401
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,990
Others will be like that.
It'll be one to one. Okay.

402
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,730
So if it's just one, it'll be
one to one. Now what if it's for

403
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,750
anybody know what that one's going
to be? Yeah. One, four, six, four,

404
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:16,700
one. How did you get that?
Right? It's Pascal's triangle,
the binomial coefficients.

405
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,830
So it looks like we can do
this for anything, right?
We're in good shape. Okay.

406
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:26,390
Now, how, how big is this splitting?
It's measured in energy units in Hertz,

407
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,840
and that's called Jay. And
they're, they're equal.

408
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:34,400
You expect those to be equal because both
of them involve the same change in the

409
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:39,260
neighbor, right? Flipping one
proton. Okay. And at the same time,

410
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,150
those are all the same too.

411
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,340
But this is exactly what
you could say we should say,

412
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:48,780
because the influence of this magnet on
this magnet has gotta be the same as the

413
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:53,010
influence of this magnet on this magnet.
If they're the same kind of magnet,

414
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,510
all protons. Right? So
that's great. They're, uh,

415
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,020
and notice it won't depend on how big the
magnetic field is because this is just

416
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:07,380
the interaction between two magnets,
which have fixed magnitudes.

417
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,270
It was different for the orbiting
because the orbiting was created by the

418
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:16,380
magnetic field. When you had more magnetic
fields, you've got more orbiting, right?

419
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,770
So the chemical shift is
measured in fractional units.

420
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,700
What fraction of the big field does
it shift at? Some parts per million.

421
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,810
But this is measured in Hertz and
energy because it doesn't depend on the

422
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:28,680
applied field.

423
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,290
So it's independent of Bz zero
versus the chemical shift,

424
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,940
which as we know does depend on be zero.
The orbiting is driven by be zero.

425
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,000
Okay, now let's look at
another one. This is ethanol.

426
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,660
A spectrum measured over
the break by Phil for us.

427
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,990
Okay. Now, uh, so we had
o, h, c h two and ch three.

428
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,080
Uh, let's see if we can
figure out all these peaks.

429
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,210
Which one is that furthest to the right?

430
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,410
Which, which of the protons
in ethanol is that peak?

431
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:06,510
That's furthest to the right,

432
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,470
which turns out to be a triple
what it's on the methyl group,

433
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,840
cause the other ones
have oxygen withdrawing.

434
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:16,830
So it's the further it has the highest
chemical shift or the lowest number of

435
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:20,880
chemical shifts least shifted
down from zero. Right?

436
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,630
And it's a triplet. Is that makes sense
to you? That it should be three lines.

437
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,310
Okay.
What do you say?

438
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,333
Why?

439
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,970
No, th th th th it's three protons, right?

440
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,830
But the signal is not a single peak.
Three times as big as the others.

441
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,450
It's three peaks. One to two to
one. What causes that splitting?

442
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,860
You remember it's not chemical shift.

443
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,140
It's called spins. Been
splitting. What's the other spin?

444
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:55,730
That splitting years signal.

445
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,730
It's the protons on the adjacent carbon
and there are two of them and you can

446
00:29:01,731 --> 00:29:06,560
orient it in, in uh, uh, in this, uh,

447
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,980
two to the three to two to the two ways.
Four ways.

448
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,430
One bomb bump. Okay. That's
what we just talked about.

449
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,800
So it's a triple if that's
what you expect. Okay,

450
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:20,030
so that's the splitting of the ch
three by the ch two protons. Okay.

451
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:23,150
Now let's look down at the other end.
And incidentally,

452
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,590
the chemical shift positions is
measured on the spectrometer or that,

453
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,960
but actually we should measure it not in
parts per million where the difference

454
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:36,650
is 0.018 parts per million.
We should measure it in Hertz.

455
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,790
So the,
so the Hertz units are at 7.2 hertz.

456
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,270
We by the frequency of the spectrometer,

457
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:48,070
which it says here is 400
megahertz. Okay? So it's 7.2 hertz.

458
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,170
Okay, now we looked down there and
we see a triplet. What's that do to

459
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,700
Alex? Yeah. Why? Why is it,

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,710
why is it the,
Ooh,

461
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,780
so it's got two neighbors,
right? Okay. So that's,

462
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:15,840
and it's shifted all the way down
field because of the oxygen electron

463
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,180
withdrawing. It would
appear. Okay, so there,

464
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:22,710
that's the ch two splitting the other
direction. Now let's compare those two.

465
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,110
They're not the same size.

466
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:33,010
The interaction between the Oah and the
Cah two is smaller than the interaction

467
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:38,450
between the ch three and the Cah
two. Right? That one is 5.1 hertz.

468
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,110
Okay.
Now what's this thing here?

469
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,440
What's that do to that?

470
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,540
So that's the ch two and what's it
split by? The age of the O, h and h is,

471
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,300
okay,

472
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,300
so how many H's all together and what
do you expect the Intensity v one four,

473
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:05,330
six, four one. So let's blow it up.
Okay. Is it a one, four, six, four,

474
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:09,900
one quintet?
Not Quite.

475
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,440
Now what is going on? Notice that those
two interactions are not the same,

476
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,930
right? One is 7.2 hertz and the others
5.1. So if we look at those there,

477
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,850
we see a quartet that split by how many?
That's foot by three.

478
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:30,360
That's the ch three splitting.
But in fact there are two quartets,

479
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,730
right? So that's the smaller
splitting Dubai to the Oah.

480
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,210
Now had they been the same then the
separation of the three on the sh,

481
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:46,000
the separation of the, of the
two quartets would have been, uh,

482
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,390
let's see.
Would it been instead of being like this,

483
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,760
it would be like this and then it would
be one, four, six, four, one right?

484
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:54,930
But that doesn't look like that.

485
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:59,460
It's actually what we call a doublet
of quartets or a quartet of doublets.

486
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,880
Okay. So that's a little
bit different. Okay.

487
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:06,720
Now there's some other tiny peaks here.
What's this one do to?

488
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,543
Any thoughts?

489
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,250
What a good idea could be water,
but it's not.

490
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,210
The solvent is dms o d six but unless
you would spend an absolute fortune,

491
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,280
you have some dms o d five
in there that has one proton,

492
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:29,851
right?

493
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:34,851
So those few molecules of the solvent
that have hydrogen on them look like that,

494
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,550
right? So you'll see a signal
from that, okay, that's fine.

495
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,790
And that's what the signal
looks like. Now, there are
no other hydrogens in there.

496
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,010
What's causing spins been splitting?

497
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,000
Deuterium is also magnetic.
It's not very strong magnet.

498
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,710
So it doesn't have a very big splitting.
These splittings are very small, right?

499
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,430
And furthermore, not only is it
a weaker magnet than a proton,

500
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,990
but so that it's only 1.8 hertz,
right?

501
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,640
It could be oriented three
ways in the field. Remember,

502
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:14,180
Proton can be with or against,
but to do tiering them can be with,

503
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,740
against, or across. So now there
are three ways of putting it.

504
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,010
So if you have two of
them with three ways,

505
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,470
it turns out what you get instead
is a one, two, three, two,

506
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:31,630
one quintet. And you can work
that out for yourself if you, if,

507
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,850
if a single would splits at one to
one to one because there are three

508
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:38,900
orientations, right? What did
to do so you can work that out.

509
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:43,010
If you figure that out, then you'll
understand the math we've been doing here.

510
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,940
Okay. Now here's another
peak. Matt, what's this peak?

511
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,420
Why did I ask you? Is that
water? That's water. Yeah. Okay,

512
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,270
good. Okay. But look over here

513
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,450
just to go to this.

514
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,103
What are those?

515
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,210
Yeah,

516
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,040
blow it up.
This bit here.

517
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,190
These little ones are due to
an artifact of the instrument.

518
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,550
Don't worry about those,
but these are real here and there.

519
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,460
So they both look like they're triplets,
right?

520
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,570
Like what's in the middle
of them is a triplet, right?

521
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,250
And there's a 7.2 7.2 hertz splitting,

522
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:31,880
which is exactly what you had here,
right?

523
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,350
So it looks like it's being split
by the CIA, by the ch two next door.

524
00:34:36,351 --> 00:34:37,550
That's the splitting here.

525
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,510
We're looking at something that has to
do the ch three, it's been split by that,

526
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,990
but there's something else
that's splitting at what
else could be splitting it.

527
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,000
Okay,

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,980
there's another magnetic nucleus.

529
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,840
It can't be this h out here
because that's so far away.

530
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,800
It would have a minuscule effect.
This is an enormous effect.

531
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,190
This doublet splitting and the ideas,

532
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,340
it's sort of related to this one actually.

533
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,440
There's another nucleus there that's
magnetic, but only 1% of the time.

534
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:17,150
These are only half a percent
as big as this is, right?

535
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:20,210
So the total of this,
and this is just 1%,

536
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,580
there's 1% of some other
magnetic nucleus in their carbon.

537
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,310
It's carbon 13 right?

538
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:32,630
And that has an enormous
interaction with the protons.

539
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:37,010
I did a 125 hertz.
That's much closer to the protons.

540
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,460
Okay? That's one per one point. 1%
of carbon and natural abundance.

541
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,850
And notice one other thing that
we're going to address later, uh,

542
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,020
probably we won't get to it today, which
is that these are slightly asymmetric.

543
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:52,320
This one's just slightly
bigger than that one, right?

544
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,030
And the green ones here are slightly
bigger than the pink ones. Right.

545
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:01,680
And this one is slightly bigger than
that one. And we'll get to that too.

546
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:05,730
So we've looked at this
in pretty much detail now.

547
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,270
What determines the strength
of the spins, spins, splitting,

548
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:12,890
how many hertz it's going to be.
Uh,

549
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,170
and so we're going to
talk about isotropic, uh,

550
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,390
j coupling between protons.

551
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,823
Yeah.

552
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,820
And it's not a through
space magnetic interaction.

553
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,710
It's mediated by bonding electrons.
Uh,

554
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,220
because that's what this was
actually made for here are the,

555
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,780
here are the lines of force created by
this nucleus and we're looking at this

556
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,100
one. So it can be like this
or it can be like that. Okay.

557
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,730
So we get a doublet of when we're
looking at this proton over here,

558
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,920
because this one can be
either this way or this way,

559
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,730
but that if we follow it's lines of force,

560
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,940
they can either oppose the applied field
or they can help the applied field.

561
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,170
And what do we get if the molecule is
tumbling in three dimensional space for

562
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,750
the average of that?
Zero.

563
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:08,250
Because now you're not going
to get diamagnetic anti
Satrapi because this magnet

564
00:37:08,251 --> 00:37:11,520
has nothing to do with the circulation
of electrons and where the pants are.

565
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,320
It's just the the nucleus itself and
they're on perfect ball bearings, right?

566
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,590
So there's no nos special stuff going on,

567
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,380
so it'll absolutely canceled to zero.

568
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,640
But then how in the world do we
get interaction between the two?

569
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,930
How do we get splitting if the through
space interaction of magnets won't do the

570
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:31,764
trick?

571
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,693
Yeah.

572
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,140
Okay. It goes through bonds
and let's look at this.

573
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:44,060
So let's look at the magnitude of some
of these coupling constants is that are

574
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,890
called Jay.
Okay.

575
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:50,891
So in for adjacent positions in benzene
at six to eight hertz for next adjacent

576
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,480
positions is one to three hertz.

577
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,890
And for remote positions it's zero to
one hertz. So what does it look like?

578
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:58,730
It depends on,

579
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:00,630
yeah,

580
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:02,190
any thoughts?

581
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,230
The position of agents?

582
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,290
Yeah. It depends on position
obviously, but in what way?

583
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,273
Closer.

584
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,490
The closer they are,
the bigger the interaction.

585
00:38:12,491 --> 00:38:14,500
Can I see the hands of
those who are surprised?

586
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,753
Okay.

587
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,680
Okay.
Now let's look at these.

588
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,400
That's 1.85 this is 2.38
that's 3.07 on strums

589
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,720
and here are their coupling constants.
What do you think your theory, Derek,

590
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,890
it's not holding up right here.
It's exactly wrong. The close,

591
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,570
the closest ones have the smallest
splitting and the farthest ones have the

592
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,440
biggest splitting,

593
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,400
but we know that it shouldn't be
distance because we've just seen that at

594
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,070
averages to zero. So it must
be something else, okay?

595
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:57,990
It's not spatial proximity.
The through space interaction,

596
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,800
the dipoles average to zero on
tumbling. Okay? Now let's look it up.

597
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,940
Faa in here and look at those two protons,
top and bottom,

598
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,110
top right and bottom left. And look
at this particular molecular orbital,

599
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,720
which turns out to be homo minus three.

600
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:15,280
There are lots of others we could look at,

601
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,110
but this one is good to look
at for reasons. You'll see
now when this, when this,

602
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,640
uh, when there are two electrons that
are going to be in this orbital, right?

603
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,980
And when one of them is on this nucleus,
the one,

604
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:33,670
let's say the electron, remember it's
magnet too. When it's pointing up,

605
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,290
there's going to be in that orbital,

606
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:40,000
there's going to be one electron pointing
up, one electron pointing down. Okay?

607
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,060
So suppose the up one happens to be here,

608
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,480
then the down one can't be up there.
Only the down one.

609
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,890
The downwind can only be over here.

610
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,520
That is only the down electron
is available to be here.

611
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,500
It can't be the blue one when
the blue one is up there. Okay.

612
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,740
So the electrons provide a way to
communicate between the nuclei,

613
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,270
like suppose that that,

614
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,760
that this electron likes to
interact with that nucleus.

615
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,960
When that nucleus is up, let's say. Okay,

616
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,820
then in those particular molecules
where this nucleus is up,

617
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,890
this nucleus prefers to be down.
Okay.

618
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,940
And vice versa,

619
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:33,090
the nuclei would be lower in energy when
they're anti parallel than when they're

620
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:38,440
parallel. So it's as if the nuclei
were interacting with one another.

621
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,310
But in fact one is interacting with one
electron and the other is interacting

622
00:40:42,311 --> 00:40:46,090
with the other electron, but the two
electrons are in the same orbital.

623
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:49,150
So they interact with each other.
One has to be up in the other down.

624
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,990
So it's this indirect
interaction through the bonds.

625
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,070
Now that has an interesting implication.
So in tumbling molecules,

626
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,710
nuclear spins,
communicate not through space,

627
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:02,890
but through paired
electrons on the nuclei.

628
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Because if that other electron wasn't
right on the nuclei on the nucleus,

629
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,390
then as it orbits,
it'll cancel.

630
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,520
There's only one place that electron
can be where rotating the molecule won't

631
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:17,920
cause it to cancel.
What's that place

632
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,430
on the nucleus
when the electron is on the nucleus?

633
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:27,820
Tumbling won't average it,
right?

634
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,230
So what orbital does it have
to be in to be on the nucleus?

635
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,130
It has to be an SR,
but all right,

636
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:42,230
so it's only the s orbital electrons that
allow this communication to take place,

637
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,160
right?

638
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,160
So the j the magnitude depends on the s
orbital content of the various molecular

639
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:52,520
orbitals, not just the one I
showed, but others as well.

640
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,480
Now you weren't. Why is, why is this one,

641
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,520
the Auntie are trans.
Why is that bigger than this one?

642
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,330
Could it be that you have more
overlap here than you do here?

643
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,800
So the molecular orbital is better for
communicating between these two then for

644
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:11,390
communicating between these two.

645
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,790
So we have to decide which of these
orbital overlaps looks better to you.

646
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,040
The one on the right
or the one on the left.

647
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,190
If you had to guess which one is
better overlap, what would you guess

648
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,910
or you wouldn't guess.

649
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,550
Suppose I asked it on an exam and you
had a 50 50 chance of getting some credit

650
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,510
then, or maybe maybe it's 60
40 if your intuition is good,

651
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,820
which one is better overlap, this or
this, right or left. How many say right?

652
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,650
How many say left?
There are no lefts.

653
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,960
You think this one's better overlap?
Okay, well, let's see. Okay,

654
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:52,340
so which gives better overlap?

655
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:57,370
Now the way we can tell is to dissect it
into the atomic orbitals that are part

656
00:42:58,131 --> 00:43:02,240
of those orbitals, right? So we
examined the overlap of the components.

657
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:03,960
So notice that this,

658
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,930
this one is a combination of a p orbital
here and an sp hybrid pointing that way.

659
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,760
This is a combination of a p orbital here
and an sp hybrid pointed that way and

660
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:17,840
corresponding over there and let's
take them apart so we can consider them

661
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:22,310
separately. Okay. So notice that
these are the same on both sides,

662
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,370
so we can forget that that's
going to be the same overlap.

663
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,420
But now the question is, which is
the better overlap? This or that?

664
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,660
Let's vote again. Partial credit
here. You chance to redeem yourself.

665
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,360
How many think this one is better overlap?

666
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,990
Notice that means that this,
if it's true,

667
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:46,610
that means this is better overlap if
this cause these are the same. Okay.

668
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,600
And how many think that's better overlap?
Okay.

669
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,800
Not many people think that and
for obvious reasons, right?

670
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,970
But let's dissect that a little more.
Okay?

671
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,320
So let's just look at this one
where the difference lies. Okay?

672
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:08,150
And this you notice as a combination of
these p orbitals and these s orbitals

673
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,590
and this is a combination of these
p orbitals and these s orbitals.

674
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,760
Everybody with me now let's see which,
which one?

675
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,230
Which ones have better overlap?
Okay, so this is good. SS overlap.

676
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,540
Okay.
And that one's bad.

677
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,280
Anti-Bonding and the P
orbitals good and bad.

678
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:33,780
Shall we vote again?
How many people think this one's better?

679
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,260
Good. Okay. You're thinking. Okay.
What haven't you thought about though?

680
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:47,890
This s can overlap with this p and this
asks can overlap with that p and the

681
00:44:49,971 --> 00:44:51,050
same thing over there.

682
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,400
So here are two bad
overlaps between s and p.

683
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,440
Okay. And here are two good
overlaps between s and p.

684
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,570
So now the question is,

685
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:07,571
which is more important s with
p four s with s and p with p.

686
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,600
And if you had a photographic memory,

687
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,350
you would hark back to lecture 12 where
we talked about the overlap of carbon

688
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:20,970
hybrids and saw that curiously,

689
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:24,990
the s p overlap is bigger
than either s s or p p.

690
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,370
So in fact, this is the
dominant one, right?

691
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,540
And that one has better overlap.
Isn't that cute?

692
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:41,600
So the backside overlap is really counter
intuitive that this is better overlap

693
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:44,760
than that. They don't really doesn't
look like it in simple pictures.

694
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,780
I absolutely agree with you. Yeah. Okay.

695
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:51,030
And here's that thing from
lecture 12 last semester, right?

696
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:55,620
There's s with us at the distance of a
carbon carbon single double, triple bond.

697
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:59,010
Here's p with p and the sigma overlap.

698
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,510
And here's s with P,
right? So asks with p Wins.

699
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,733
Good.

700
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,810
Okay.
So now let's look at something else here.

701
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,840
This is a table that you can
find in the book and in many,

702
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:15,930
many books say this kind of thing,
but there's some errors here,

703
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:18,600
which is what I want to show you.
I mean overall it's worthwhile,

704
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,800
but there are a couple of areas.
It says identical hydrogens do not couple.

705
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,640
That is absolutely not true.
They do interact with one another,

706
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,000
but the coupling is invisible.
Okay,

707
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,420
so in fact the magnitude of the coupling
is not zero. It's 10 to 20 hertz.

708
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:37,321
Right?

709
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:42,321
But you can't see it because there's
no handle for the radio frequency.

710
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:45,450
The light can't cause a
transition between the peaks.

711
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:50,160
That would show that splitting and frame
26 that we won't get to until next time.

712
00:46:50,161 --> 00:46:54,030
We'll show that. Okay, one
other one here. This one,

713
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,880
it says that the coupling is
six to eight and that's fine,

714
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,200
but it depends on this angle
because remember the overlap
of this bond with this

715
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:04,290
bond, which is what we just talked
about, is going to be bigger one.

716
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,100
It's anti than when it's that
one. That's a clips, right,

717
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,380
and something different.
When it's like this.

718
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:13,740
So it's going to depend on
this angle, right? And in fact,

719
00:47:13,741 --> 00:47:18,120
it can be between two and 13 hertz,
depending on the con formation.

720
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,240
Now, of course, if it's
spinning around rapidly,

721
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:24,450
it'll average spinning
around the internal bond.

722
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,400
Okay. So it's, it's 13
when it's like that,

723
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,240
it's two hertz when they're perpendicular
and it's 11 hurts when their sin.

724
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:41,140
That's just like what we saw last time,
bigger like this than like this. Okay.

725
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,270
When it's, when they're Gauche, which
is one of the more likely ways to be,

726
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,850
then it's seven hertz,
which is that.

727
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,560
And that's also the average
of all these others. Okay.

728
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,080
And notice that this, if
you have a torsional angle
that's spit, if it's spinning,

729
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,870
then you average to six to eight,
right?

730
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,660
But if it's fixed in some molecule,

731
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,110
then you can measure the
angle by measuring j.

732
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,910
So that's another way to
get structure. Okay. Uh,

733
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,900
let's see what time we got here.
Uh, let me do this one last. Uh, no,

734
00:48:16,901 --> 00:48:18,760
we'll do this next time.
Okay.
