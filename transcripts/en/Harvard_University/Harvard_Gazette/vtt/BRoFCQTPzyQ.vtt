00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.990
This first song we're gonna do, Mason and

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.939
I wrote this summer. This is probably

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.309
only the third time we played it, so if

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.240
we mess it up,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.600
please have mercy.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.640
My name is Brynn Elliott. I live in

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.340
Currier House. I'm studying philosophy

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.140
and I am class of 2018 so I'm a junior.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:36.460
(Music)

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.239
What I study often informs my songwriting. I think

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.980
that's kind of one of the biggest

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.739
reasons that I'm at college, at Harvard,

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.590
is so that I can sort of build up a bank

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.600
of knowledge for songwriting. I was

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.219
really interested in the humanities

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
in general. I remember the first English

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.649
class I ever took was, like, the most

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.041
amazing thing to me and I started

00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.461
getting interested in philosophy

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:01.999
because I loved asking questions.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.720
(Music)

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.490
The way I describe being a student musician is

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.260
just sort of like being an athlete, so I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.479
travel on the weekends to play different

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.850
shows, different gigs. I practice every

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.340
day, so it's also like being an athlete

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.450
where, you know, 2 â€“ 3 hour practices just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.330
music and listening the songs and just

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.010
kind of growing as a musician.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.660
(Music)

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.080
I often procrastinate writing papers through writing songs.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.040
This past weekend I was supposed to

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.860
write a paper on Spinoza's mind-body

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.720
problem and I just wrote a song instead.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.560
I did write the paper but it was just rushed.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
(Music)

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.400
I think the Harvard community definitely influences my

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.729
music because I'm around so many

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.210
interesting people every day with so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.100
many interesting stories and human

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.500
perspectives. I think so much of writing

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.480
music and writing a song is about

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.790
getting into another person's story,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.450
trying to use a collective unified human

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.630
voice and I think being here, being at

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.690
Harvard that's just, there are opportunities

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.590
to engage with that everywhere you go.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:39.360
