2008 I've written some books where I
 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.140
2008 I've written some books where I
explained what happened then I think

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
explained what happened then I think
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.479

it's time to bring the story up to date

it's time to bring the story up to date
 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.309
it's time to bring the story up to date
and that's what I propose to do today

in previous books so I won't repeat it

their understanding of reality and the
two are never the same although the

two are never the same although the
 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.939
two are never the same although the
extent of the divergence varies and the

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949
extent of the divergence varies and the

growing deficit is not a growing debt is
is actually a not an additional burden

00:40:22.749 --> 00:40:22.759
is actually a not an additional burden
 

00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:26.390
is actually a not an additional burden
right now i think is this misconception

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400
right now i think is this misconception
 

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.269
right now i think is this misconception
that is dominating the debate thank you

00:40:32.269 --> 00:40:32.279
that is dominating the debate thank you
 

00:40:32.279 --> 00:40:34.460
that is dominating the debate thank you
I was interested in early part of your

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:34.470
I was interested in early part of your
 

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.130
I was interested in early part of your
speech and you talked about Germany as

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140
speech and you talked about Germany as
 

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.450
speech and you talked about Germany as
the conservative force and that's

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460
the conservative force and that's
 

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.589
the conservative force and that's
exactly where I'm from and I was

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599
exactly where I'm from and I was
 

00:40:39.599 --> 00:40:41.059
exactly where I'm from and I was
wondering what were the concrete steps

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:41.069
wondering what were the concrete steps
 

00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:43.400
wondering what were the concrete steps
the German should take to adjust the

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:43.410
the German should take to adjust the
 

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:46.819
the German should take to adjust the
situation your opinion thank you what

00:40:46.819 --> 00:40:46.829
situation your opinion thank you what
 

00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:48.470
situation your opinion thank you what
were the concrete steps that Germany

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480
were the concrete steps that Germany
 

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:56.109
were the concrete steps that Germany
should take to correct its imbalances I

00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119
should take to correct its imbalances I
 

00:40:56.119 --> 00:40:59.200
should take to correct its imbalances I
think that that it should not be

00:40:59.200 --> 00:40:59.210
think that that it should not be
 

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:04.750
think that that it should not be
reducing his budget deficit at the

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760
reducing his budget deficit at the
 

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.820
reducing his budget deficit at the
present time and also should look for

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:10.830
present time and also should look for
 

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.300
present time and also should look for
ways for stimulating the European

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:14.310
ways for stimulating the European
 

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:19.040
ways for stimulating the European
economy altogether the Germany situation

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:19.050
economy altogether the Germany situation
 

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:25.250
economy altogether the Germany situation
is very constrained by the requirement

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:25.260
is very constrained by the requirement
 

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.840
is very constrained by the requirement
that it has to balance is it's the

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:29.850
that it has to balance is it's the
 

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:34.010
that it has to balance is it's the
federal budget by twenty fifteen or

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020
federal budget by twenty fifteen or
 

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:37.370
federal budget by twenty fifteen or
twenty eighteen in a number of years and

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380
twenty eighteen in a number of years and
 

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:42.170
twenty eighteen in a number of years and
it has to move towards that that a

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180
it has to move towards that that a
 

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.660
it has to move towards that that a
balanced budget over time and that is

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:47.670
balanced budget over time and that is
 

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.440
balanced budget over time and that is
what is pushing the reduction in the

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:51.450
what is pushing the reduction in the
 

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.630
what is pushing the reduction in the
deficit and that is what makes it

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640
deficit and that is what makes it
 

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.790
deficit and that is what makes it
difficult to find some source of fiscal

00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800
difficult to find some source of fiscal
 

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.670
difficult to find some source of fiscal
stimulus for the European economies as a

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680
stimulus for the European economies as a
 

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:05.810
stimulus for the European economies as a
whole and I think therefore that fiscal

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:05.820
whole and I think therefore that fiscal
 

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.510
whole and I think therefore that fiscal
stimulus has to be found within the

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520
stimulus has to be found within the
 

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:16.030
stimulus has to be found within the
European Union is in one way or another

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040

step in these circumstances but that

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:28.770
step in these circumstances but that
 

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:34.420
step in these circumstances but that
would require quite a bit of convincing

called for a clear distinction between

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:42.900
called for a clear distinction between
 

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:45.860
called for a clear distinction between
financial markets and politics but this

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:45.870
financial markets and politics but this
 

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.870

these days so would you say that what we

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:50.100
these days so would you say that what we
 

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.670
these days so would you say that what we
have today is a political marketplace

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680
have today is a political marketplace
 

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:56.240

and if so what can we do about it it was
 

00:42:56.250 --> 00:43:00.100
and if so what can we do about it it was

the question of the interaction between
 

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:04.370
the question of the interaction between
politics and finance and I think partly

they are very susceptible to that kind

they are very susceptible to that kind
of pressure and if you look at for

really lobbied and and and the fact in
 

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.489
really lobbied and and and the fact in
the process so it really doesn't do the

the process so it really doesn't do the

imperfect because they are unstable and

imperfect because they are unstable and
they need to be regulated I should

00:46:17.809 --> 00:46:17.819
they need to be regulated I should
 

00:46:17.819 --> 00:46:20.779
they need to be regulated I should
equally emphasize that regulations are

00:46:20.779 --> 00:46:20.789
equally emphasize that regulations are
 

00:46:20.789 --> 00:46:24.109
equally emphasize that regulations are
even more imperfect because they are

00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119
even more imperfect because they are
 

00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:28.880
even more imperfect because they are

the regulators of bureaucrats and
