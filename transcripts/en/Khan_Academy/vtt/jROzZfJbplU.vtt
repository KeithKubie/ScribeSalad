00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:03.202
- [Voiceover] SO we've got these
three penguins, grammarians

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.137
we've got Raúl, who
you may remember from

00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:10.812
his sweet mohawk, we've got
Cesar and we've got Gabriela.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.280
Three magellanic penguins from Argentina.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.088
And they are all different
amounts of happy.

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:28.088
Cesar is a medium amount of
happy, Raúl is more happy,

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.993
and Gabriela is the most happy.

00:00:31.993 --> 00:00:35.014
And in English, we have
a way to compare these.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:37.047
To compare Raúl to Cesar.

00:00:37.047 --> 00:00:41.468
To compare Raúl to Gabriela,
or any combination thereof.

00:00:41.468 --> 00:00:44.881
We call these comparative
and superlative adjectives.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.330
And before I get too into
the weeds on that, let me

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.989
just show you what that looks like.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.989
So we can say Raúl, let
me put in the accent,

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:58.868
Raúl is a happy penguin.

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:04.598
He's go all the fish
he wants, life is good.

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:09.598
Raúl is happier than Cesar.

00:01:16.362 --> 00:01:19.580
This is what we call a comparative,
because we're comparing

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.001
Raúl to Cesar, and we're
comparing their happiness levels.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.643
And Raúl has more happiness
in him than Cesar does.

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.267
Poor Cesar.

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:36.267
However, Gabriela is the happiest penguin.

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.978
Ta-da.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:46.247
The happiest is something that we call

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:48.735
superlative in English.

00:01:48.735 --> 00:01:53.156
So it's not just a comparison.

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:55.840
It's not Raúl is happier than Cesar.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.274
Gabriela is happier than
all the other penguins.

00:01:59.274 --> 00:02:02.036
She is the happy-est, she is the happiest,

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:03.557
she is the most happy.

00:02:03.557 --> 00:02:05.807
So one way to think about
this is that Raúls happiness

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:09.517
is slightly larger than Cesars happiness,

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:12.735
but Gabriela's happiness is double plus,

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:16.622
is unbeatably more than both of them.

00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:18.833
I'm gonna use a made up math symbol.

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.517
Boom boom boom, like super greater than

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:26.517
undisputed, she is the happiest penguin.

00:02:26.926 --> 00:02:31.926
Because the comparative is
the same thing as saying more.

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:37.741
The comparative equals
more, and the superlative

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.857
equals most.

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:45.617
So this is slightly more,
this is super much more.

00:02:45.617 --> 00:02:46.989
And something that's neat
about English is that

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.772
you can use the comparative
and superlative for both

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:53.522
positive relationships and
also negative relationships.

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:57.667
So we could say Raúl is a
happy penguin, and we can say

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:00.588
Raúl is happier than Cesar.

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:05.588
We can also say Cesar
is less happy than Raúl.

00:03:09.568 --> 00:03:12.960
So this is comparative but
it's going the other way.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.182
Right.

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.828
Cesar is less happy than Raúl.

00:03:16.828 --> 00:03:18.940
So then we use the less than symbol.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.426
Gabriela is the happiest
penguin, and so for this group

00:03:21.426 --> 00:03:26.197
of three, Cesar is the least happy.

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.662
So you can use the comparative
and the superlative forms

00:03:30.662 --> 00:03:34.427
of adjectives to compare
relationships where one thing is

00:03:34.427 --> 00:03:39.427
more or most than another
or others, or relationships

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.050
where one thing is less
or least than others.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.926
That's how the comparative and
superlative work, but if you

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:50.023
stick around for the next video,
I'm gonna talk about how to

00:03:50.023 --> 00:03:53.755
figure out, how to form the
comparative and superlative

00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:56.754
when you're looking at a word
you've never seen before,

00:03:56.754 --> 00:04:00.188
like, what if we made up a word, like

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:03.209
like blarfy.

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.492
What do you do with that?

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:06.169
Well, you'll find out next time.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.775
In the meantime, you can learn anything.

00:04:08.775 --> 00:04:10.242
David out.
