00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.280
Worms.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.980
They’re weird, primitive creatures that
seem to just squirm around senselessly.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.950
BUT this simplistic behavior is exactly what
we are looking for in our endeavours to digitize

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:10.969
a living brain.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.349
Now look at this.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.840
This..this looks like a robot being controlled
by an ewok.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.520
But actually, this robot isn’t being controlled
AT ALL.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.090
What you are looking at is a copy of the brain
of a Caenorhabditis elegans, or C. elegans.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.570
This is the digital brain of a worm ON a computer
chip IN a lego robot.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.980
This little guy is a simulated brain navigating
on its own.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.289
Well, navigating the best way a wormbot can.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.440
The scientists put sensors on their robots
“noses” and “tails”so if they meet

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.499
a wall, they know to turn around.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:43.949
Just like the C.elegans.

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:50.030
But, as simple as this robot seems to be,
getting to this point took a long time.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.750
Researchers spent decades looking at each
and every cell in the C.Elegans,and at how

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.749
each cell works with the cells around it.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.719
Then other researchers built a program that
could mimic that interaction.Each one of these

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.859
boxes represents a neuron interacting with
the environment.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.300
They could do this, because scientists have
a complete map of every single cell in the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.130
C.Elegans and their functions.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.320
It’s the worm’s CONNECTOME, and it holds
around 1000 cells and all 302 neurons of this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320
little worm.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.970
So, once you’ve digitized how every cell
and neuron interact, you have the digital

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.360
version of the C. Elegans brain!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360
Sort of.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.030
By simulating a brain at a cellular level,
the researchers can watch the larger aspects,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.409
like movement, emerge...naturally.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.090
Or, put another way, they turned it on and
let the wormbot be a worm... bot.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.520
To do this they took the connectome, some
algorithms, and a precise anatomical map and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.759
combined them.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.240
Then they threw it in a simulator -- which
is super complicated, and I don’t really

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.310
understand how it all works -- but the important
thing is what happened once they flipped it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.310
on.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.409
The robot behaved like a living C.Elegans!

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.090
Well, almost.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.630
The researchers are starting small.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.979
They want to get the neuron’s interacting
with the “muscles” of the robot.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.110
It still doesn’t have independent instinct,
it’s not going to start looking for food

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.180
or anything yet.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.629
Those behaviours are definitely on the agenda
for our researchers, but they just want to

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.819
get the digital organism moving first.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.890
Now, I know what you’re thinking, is this
a huge step towards some crazy scientists

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.480
digitizing and uploading human brains into
robuts!

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
AHH!!

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
But, no.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Not really.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
No.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.379
These scientists are mapping this worm’s
brain and creating an accurate digital simulation

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.980
because WE still don’t know a lot about
how OUR brain works.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.370
This project’s success could completely
change the way we map and understand our own

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.370
brain.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.870
Plus, with this application we could possibly
get rid of squishy living organisms in labs

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.510
and could rely on computer simulations instead.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.580
There’s nothing to fear…

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.410
C.elegans are only 1mm long.It will take a
while before we start digitizing your brains

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.410
guys.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.760
For more science in your day, subscribe to
Seeker and are you wondering how our brains

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.319
power our thoughts in the first place?

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.590
We explain it right here.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.379
Did you know that the C.elegans is the first
animal and currently, ONLY animal with an

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.120
entirely mapped connectome?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.519
Pretty cool.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.470
Thanks for watching.
