you know I think that this sparks a lot

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
you know I think that this sparks a lot

imagination to think about what one

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500
imagination to think about what one
 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710
imagination to think about what one
might want to do with a technology like

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
might want to do with a technology like
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.779
might want to do with a technology like
this maybe not today and maybe not next

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
this maybe not today and maybe not next
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
year but you know in the in the future
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.179
year but you know in the in the future
and it's one thing to talk about being

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
and it's one thing to talk about being
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.420
and it's one thing to talk about being
able to remove mutations from the human

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
able to remove mutations from the human
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.549

population that caused genetic disease
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.380
population that caused genetic disease
and I think for many people that would

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
and I think for many people that would
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540
and I think for many people that would
be a desirable thing to do on the other

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
be a desirable thing to do on the other
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910
be a desirable thing to do on the other
hand it's very I think it's a very

different different discussion to think

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
different different discussion to think
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.360
different different discussion to think
about using a technology like this to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
about using a technology like this to
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.420
about using a technology like this to
create enhanced human beings people that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
create enhanced human beings people that
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610
create enhanced human beings people that
are taller or have a certain eye color

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
are taller or have a certain eye color
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.130

or other kinds of physical or
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.410
or other kinds of physical or
intellectual traits that might be

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420
intellectual traits that might be
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.010
intellectual traits that might be
considered desirable and you know it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
considered desirable and you know it
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630
considered desirable and you know it
sort of immediately brings out the whole

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
sort of immediately brings out the whole
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.960
sort of immediately brings out the whole
area of eugenics and sort of access to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
area of eugenics and sort of access to
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.149

who decides who decides whether or not

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
who decides who decides whether or not
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.149
who decides who decides whether or not
to do such a thing should companies be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
to do such a thing should companies be
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340
to do such a thing should companies be
allowed to offer this as a service to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
allowed to offer this as a service to
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.460
allowed to offer this as a service to
parents who want to do this and you know

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
parents who want to do this and you know
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.560
parents who want to do this and you know
if so should they be regulated in some

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
if so should they be regulated in some
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929
if so should they be regulated in some
way it's a there's a lot of very

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
way it's a there's a lot of very
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.270
way it's a there's a lot of very
interesting and challenging questions I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
interesting and challenging questions I
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.340
interesting and challenging questions I
think that go along with that and then

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350
think that go along with that and then
 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.450
think that go along with that and then
there's the whole question of you know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
there's the whole question of you know
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.429
there's the whole question of you know
since this is a technology that is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
since this is a technology that is
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740
since this is a technology that is
widely available I really call it a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750
widely available I really call it a
 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.870
widely available I really call it a
democratizing technology because it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
democratizing technology because it's
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.450
democratizing technology because it's
you know it's it's not very expensive to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
you know it's it's not very expensive to
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640
you know it's it's not very expensive to
use and and labs worldwide have been

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
use and and labs worldwide have been
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.800
use and and labs worldwide have been
able to easily deploy it in different

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
able to easily deploy it in different
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.649
able to easily deploy it in different
systems so then how do we think about a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
systems so then how do we think about a
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.319
systems so then how do we think about a
global regulation is it even possible to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
global regulation is it even possible to
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.569
global regulation is it even possible to
come to some kind of consensus globally

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
come to some kind of consensus globally
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.210
come to some kind of consensus globally
I'm not sure honestly the answer to that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
I'm not sure honestly the answer to that
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310
I'm not sure honestly the answer to that
I think that you know it's certainly

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
I think that you know it's certainly
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139
I think that you know it's certainly
important to be having this discussion

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
important to be having this discussion
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330
important to be having this discussion
with our colleagues and other countries

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
with our colleagues and other countries
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.179
with our colleagues and other countries
and fortunately that's happening but are

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
and fortunately that's happening but are
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.770
and fortunately that's happening but are
we going to be able to control what

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
we going to be able to control what
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.660
we going to be able to control what
people are doing in every jurisdiction

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
people are doing in every jurisdiction
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510
people are doing in every jurisdiction
III think no way and so I think it's

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520
III think no way and so I think it's
 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.100
III think no way and so I think it's
just you know it's one of those things

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
just you know it's one of those things
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.530
just you know it's one of those things
that it's one of the aspects of this

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540
that it's one of the aspects of this
 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.880
that it's one of the aspects of this
technology that we have

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
technology that we have
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410
technology that we have
to grapple with is the fact that it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420
to grapple with is the fact that it's
 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.320
to grapple with is the fact that it's
widely available and that people will

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
widely available and that people will
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.180
widely available and that people will
start using it in different ways

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
start using it in different ways
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.059
start using it in different ways
potentially even in the future to create

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069
potentially even in the future to create
 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.870
potentially even in the future to create
genetically altered humans

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
genetically altered humans
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.130
genetically altered humans
