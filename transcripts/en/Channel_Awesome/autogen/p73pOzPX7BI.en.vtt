if you're a fan on Lord of rings I would
 

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.810
if you're a fan on Lord of rings I would
see it once but I mean as somebody who's

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.820

a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan that's

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:18.340
a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan that's

and I saw it in twenty eight frames per
 

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.980
and I saw it in twenty eight frames per
second so I have no idea this is great

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:28.990
second so I have no idea this is great
 

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.900

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:30.910
debate is it better to see it in 48
 

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.150
debate is it better to see it in 48
frames per second or scrub your eyes out

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:33.160

with steel wool like but I I just saw it

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:36.430
with steel wool like but I I just saw it
 

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.330
with steel wool like but I I just saw it
in the normal version and it will crisp

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
in the normal version and it will crisp
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.010
in the normal version and it will crisp
and good but like the the effects the

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:41.020
and good but like the the effects the
 

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.510
and good but like the the effects the
resolution was so high on the CGI

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520
resolution was so high on the CGI
 

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.040
resolution was so high on the CGI
effects in particular I can only imagine

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:44.050
effects in particular I can only imagine
 

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.690
effects in particular I can only imagine
it's going to be worse with the higher

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:45.700
it's going to be worse with the higher
 

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.960
it's going to be worse with the higher
framerate so um yeah and I think you

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:48.970
framerate so um yeah and I think you
 

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:50.160
framerate so um yeah and I think you
know you know what I think of it you

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.170
know you know what I think of it you
 

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:50.530
know you know what I think of it you
know

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:50.540

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640
what I enjoy and you can probably get a
 

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.400
what I enjoy and you can probably get a
grasp of if that's what you would enjoy

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.410
grasp of if that's what you would enjoy
 

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.350

characters breathe but you need to have
 

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.510
characters breathe but you need to have
some sort of momentum and you need to

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520
some sort of momentum and you need to
 

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.360
some sort of momentum and you need to
have some sense of story from a short

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:07.370
have some sense of story from a short
 

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.700
