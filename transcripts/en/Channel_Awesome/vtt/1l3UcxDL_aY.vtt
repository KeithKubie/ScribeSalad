00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.560
Where do I start with Can of Worms?

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.900
Just imagine you're channel surfing and suddenly, you come across this:

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.680
"Don't move and put your appendages behind your back!"

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.180
"Admit nothing. Did he read you your rights?"

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.160
"Time for an explanation and it better be good!"

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.420
"It will, officer. Of that, I can assure you."

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.760
Those are just the tablescraps of insanity that this special has to offer.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.600
It's the craziest goddamn thing I've ever seen.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.880
I mean, it's absolutely ludicrous.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.620
And dumb.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.600
And not good.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.700
And...I...

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.520
I don't even have the words for it.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.820
The story, if you can call it that, centers around a kid named Michael.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.740
Just listen to a couple seconds of him.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.980
"Thousands of spaceships bristling with force-fields and weapons surrounded the planet, that in motion would be doomed!"

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.820
"Doomed?"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.140
"Doomed."

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.700
Yep, that's the kind of performance you gotta put up with this whole film.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.540
You see, Michael is a bit of a nerd, so much so that he believes he's from another planet.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.920
Yeah, not make-believes, believes believes.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.820
He constantly tells stories to this little kid and he acts like it's real.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.960
He tells himself that he can't be, but he can't help but shake the feeling that maybe he is.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.880
But put that on the back-burner for about 40 minutes.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.100
Yeah, there's no talk of aliens, or anything like that, for 40 minutes in this hour and 20 minute movie.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.600
Instead, we focus on how he sucks at football.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.940
Yet the lead cheerleader, of course, falls in love with him and asks him to help her put together all the decorations for the Halloween dance.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.360
He uses all his computer skills and nerdy technology to make it a big hit, but the BULLIES sabotage it, causing him to run out in a panic.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.060
What does he do?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:04.020
He goes to his giant space satellite--you know, like every kid has--and sends out a message to the universe that he is being held there hostage and wants to be taken to another galaxy.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080
Again, like most kids would.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.540
"I fulfilled life nullified by the ignorant and cruel indigenous population of Earth."

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:25.160
Lightning strikes the satellite and he soon forgets about it, until a dog voiced by Malcolm McDowell arrives, telling him that he's from a non-profit organization that wants to take him to a world where he'll feel more comfortable.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.820
But wait! It gets stranger! Soon other aliens start to arrive, for various reasons.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.640
One wants to make a lawsuit out of him and sue the Earth.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.580
Another wants to sell the rights to his story to make an intergalactic movie.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.740
Another wants to be his agent, it just gets stranger and stranger.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.560
But then, things get REALLY out of hand when one comes to kidnap him for a zoo, accidentally stealing his little friend.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:55.020
And they have to go in and save him, while also saving one of the aliens he thought he was in the story he was talking about in the beginning.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.100
Yeah, it looks like they're real.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.780
How did he know about him? How does he know how to open their cage and use some of their devices?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960
It is never explained.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.320
They never say whether or not Michael is an alien or a boy, they never explain how we got all this information--it just ends with him petting Malcolm McDowell dog behind the ears.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.960
So, well, yeah. This is exactly as goddamn insane as it sounds.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.420
I guess from the oddness of the story and kind of a satirical edge, you can maybe get a few jokes out of it.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.360
Maybe there's some possibilities for it. It's just so damn strange.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:38.240
But no, none of it goes together--the story is horrendous! The writing is ridiculous! All of the acting is over-the-top! None of it makes any goddamn sense!

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.040
The only thing kind of interesting about it is the design of the aliens.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.340
I mean, I have to give credit. These are some pretty bizarre, out-there puppets.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.560
But aside from that, I have no idea what I just watched.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.360
This has got to be the friggin' weirdest thing Disney Channel has ever put on TV, and that's saying quite a bit!

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.220
Even by kid movie standards, it's ridiculous.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.680
The first 40 minutes, almost nothing happens except you watch him get ready for this dance.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.380
And then the rest of it is all this talk about lawsuits, and signing contracts, and stuff, that a lot of kids probably wouldn't follow it.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.660
And it's, it's just stupid!

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.380
It's so stupid!

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.420
You just can't believe what you're watching half the time.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.340
The only way I can think to describe it is: the Santa Claus Versus the Martians of Disney Channel movies.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.960
It's not just bad, it's laughably bad and I think that even kids that watch it would know how dumb it is.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.260
I guess, on that level, it's kind of entertaining.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.340
I mean, how could anyone predict where ANY of this was going to go?

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:52.100
But, if you want something that's entertaining on say, a kid's level, an adult's level, a satirical level, a charming level, or performances that don't look like Walter Banasiak doing Zack Snyder, then this probably isn't the movie for you.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.560
And if it is the movie for you?

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.220
Please kindly keep your distance from me.
