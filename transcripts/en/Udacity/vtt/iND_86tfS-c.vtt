Now the question is suppose an eavesdropper can listen in on this link and can listen in on this link,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so it has a way to listen on the outcoming links from me and the incoming links to Alice,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
can they determine that we're communicating?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
No.   Yes, if there's no similar traffic on the network.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yes, if there is a way to correlate message 1 and message 2.

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And yes, if the adversary can see all the traffic on the entire network.
