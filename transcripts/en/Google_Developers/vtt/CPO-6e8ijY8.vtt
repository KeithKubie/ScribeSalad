00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.810
Hello, and welcome to another
Google Maps Developer

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.240
Relations screencast. My
name is Andres Ferrate.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.550
And today I'll be talking about
our new Events feature

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.270
in the Google Places API.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.030
That's right.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.790
We've added a new Events feature
to our Places API.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.510
OK, so what's up with this
new Events feature?

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.330
Well, with this new Events
feature, your users can add,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.400
delete, find, and check-In to
events and places using the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.270
Places API service.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.350
Say for example, a donut shop.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.840
The Events feature is accessed
via HTTP, using POST request.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.550
And so here's an example
of a request for

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.010
Google's office in Sydney.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.290
I'm going to submit
a new event.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.690
That's right.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.190
I'm going to add a happy hour
for Thursday afternoon, here

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.620
in the Sydney office.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.270
Now the idea here is that you
can use this feature to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.770
provide your users with
information about events that

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.560
are currently happening.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.530
This could be one of the
millions of locations that we

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.470
currently have available
in the Places API.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.960
And once they find an event,
users can check-in at a

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.820
specific place or they can
check-in to a specific event.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.340
OK, so how do you get started?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.510
Well, simply follow the
instructions in our reference

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.140
documentation at this URL.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.580
And by the way, this is found
at our new home at

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.790
developers.google.com.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.639
So yeah, check it out and let
us know what you think.
