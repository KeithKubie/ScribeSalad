00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.039
Both of us had retired not too long before
we started coming to MoMA and neither one

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.039
of us,

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.219
I think, would have envisioned that this would
be something we really got excited about.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.200
Not that we didn't appreciate art before,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:45.320
but participating -- we both didn't see ourselves
as doing this. You know, we just would have

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.070
felt "that's not us, we can't do that."

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.390
But it's given us a new -- something new,
so we love it.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:03.410
Well, for me the experience of art-making
is the taking of myself out of myself -- my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:14.110
norm. Putting myself into another dimension,
partially which I occasionally fantasize about,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.550
this becomes a reality for me.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:25.880
And partly, something I am tempted to do but
frequently don't have the determination or

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.630
guts to do. And so it gives me the opportunity
to take a chance, based upon the circumstances

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.540
that I have to do it, that I'm forced to do
it, I do it the best I can. Part of my philosophy

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.800
in life is to constantly seek out and overcome
challenges.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.079
Hello. I am Laurel Humble

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.979
Hi I'm Meryl Schwartz and we work on The MoMA
Alzheimer's Project within the Department

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.840
of Education at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.619
Funded by a major grant from MetLife Foundation,
The MoMA Alzheimer's Project allows Meryl

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.000
and me and our colleagues in the Department
of Education to develop art discussion and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.070
art-making programs for people with Alzheimer's
disease and their carepartners. We teach these

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.150
programs here onsite in the Museum's galleries
and studio spaces, and also offsite in care

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.220
facilities around the city.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.390
Based on our work with this audience, we also
lead training workshops for arts and health

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.800
professionals, and have developed educational
resources used by staff of museums, care facilities,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.030
and other community organizations serving
people with dementia and their carepartners.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.360
And one of these resources is this video!

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.859
This video is for people involved in dementia
care or museum and arts education who want

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:55.440
to learn more about how to facilitate an art-making
program with people with Alzheimer's disease.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.390
It is designed for individuals with varying
personal and professional expertise, who are

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.600
likely working in a variety of settings, each
with their own logistical considerations,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.530
such as spaces, time, and budget.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.500
Accordingly, we've chosen not to focus on
those aspects of programming.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.930
Instead we'll focus on the teaching strategies
and other tools necessary for leading a successful

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.530
art-making program, including:

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.870
Some background information, like general
information on dementia and MoMA's program

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.340
structure and approach, and the role of the
educator in creating a successful experience

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.810
How you as an educator conceive of and prepare
for your project

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.220
How to lead your project, step by step

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.410
And general tips for facilitating successful
art-making programs as well as tools for troubleshooting

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.540
challenging scenarios

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.639
Throughout we'll include program footage and
anecdotes from our experiences.

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.739
While our discussion will be framed by our
perspectives as museum educators working with

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.650
groups in our studio spaces, the techniques
we will discuss are applicable to any setting

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.040
or situation, so long as you can access art-making
materials and have a bit of space to work.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.989
In addition, we encourage you to think of
about these programs as an opportunity for

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.669
you to learn and grow. This approach should
inform the decisions you make in your planning

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.580
and facilitation. Throughout we will emphasize
the importance of developing projects that

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.650
you, as the educator, find interesting as
well.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.540
In the end we hope that you will feel confident
in your ability to facilitate a meaningful

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.220
art-making program that leads to new understandings
about the creative process and prompts new

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.800
social connections among participants.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:46.210
ART MAKING
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.280
In this section, we'll give you some background
information to consider when planning art-making

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.900
programs for people with Alzheimer's disease,
including what our typical program structure

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.760
includes, benefits of engaging with art in
general, basic information about Alzheimer's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.610
disease and other forms of dementia, including
which symptoms we most frequently encounter,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.370
and finally, a general overview of what you
can do as an educator to create a successful

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.860
experience.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.930
Let's start with an overview of MoMA's art
making programs for individuals with Alzheimer's

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.470
disease and their carepartners.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.210
Our art-making programs last about 1 Â½ to
2 hours and are taught by an educator with

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.770
additional help from support staff or volunteers.
At the start, the educator outlines the main

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.629
ideas in the chosen project. They then facilitate
a brief discussion of a few related works

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.599
from the Museum's collection.

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.900
Afterwards, they distribute materials and
give participants ample time to create their

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.749
own works. In the end participants discuss
their works together. Finally, the educator

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:56.819
concludes the program by providing last thoughts
and suggestions for future art-making opportunities.

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.919
Whenever possible we hold an exhibition to
share the participant artwork with a greater

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.620
audience.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.189
The program structure and the teaching techniques
we use are well established in museum education.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.599
In fact, we use them in MoMA's education programs
for people of all ages and abilities.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.879
This is because we recognize that engaging
with art by making works allows all people

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:24.060
the chance to express ideas, talents, and
experiences,

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.110
Create an original object that is unique to
them,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.319
Experience both tactile and intellectual stimulation
simultaneously,

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:38.830
Reflect on their creation within a greater
context of artistic practice,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.560
Explore and exchange ideas with other people
in a social environment,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:50.699
And finally, to participate in a meaningful
activity that fosters personal growth,

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.879
These benefits apply no matter who the audience
is, but they are particularly significant

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:00.330
for individuals with Alzheimer's disease who
might be experiencing a dearth of opportunities

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:06.300
for cultural engagement and personal development.
With a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease there

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.080
can be an assumption that people are no longer
able to learn or they won't benefit from exposure

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.830
to new experiences. But surely the desire
for personal growth and development remains,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.139
and participating in arts engagement programs
can satisfy these lifelong needs.

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:28.029
Moreover, making art is particularly well-suited
for engaging people with Alzheimer's disease

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:34.270
because the process of creation doesn't necessarily
require short term memory. You work on a physical

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.490
object that remains in front of you, and you
continue to develop that object in real time.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.889
Short term memory loss is one of the main
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but it isn't

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.919
the only one. We'll talk about some of the
symptoms you may encounter when working with

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:53.379
this audience, but first, let's start with
the basics:

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:58.159
Dementia is a general term for a group of
brain disorders. Alzheimer's disease is the

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:03.509
most common form of dementia. All types of
dementia impair mental functioning and are

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:09.580
severe enough to interfere with usual activities
of daily life. Dementia may also affect language,

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:14.190
visuospatial functioning and executive functioning.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:18.099
Some of you may already have a great deal
of experience working with people with Alzheimer's

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:23.349
disease or other forms of dementia, while
others may not. There are a number of resources

00:08:23.349 --> 00:08:28.860
you can turn to to find out more, including
your local medical professionals, hospitals

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.120
or care facilities, your local chapter of
the Alzheimer's Association, or the National

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:41.020
Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Education
and Referral Center.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.020
In our experience symptoms differ from person
to person and many challenging behaviors can

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.290
be circumvented through your planning and
facilitation of the experience, as well as

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.940
the tone you set as the educator.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.360
Overall, these are the symptoms we've most
frequently encountered in our art making programs

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.650
for people with early to mid stage Alzheimer's
disease:

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.380
The first is memory loss. Forgetting recently
learned information is one of the most common

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.630
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Participants
may not remember things you or other participants

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.340
have said, including the guidelines for the
project at hand.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.140
We've also experienced difficulties with language.
As you are conversing, it may, at times, be

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:27.290
hard to understand a participant's words.
Participants may forget words or make unusual

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:33.190
substitutions. Some participants may have
lost significant verbal ability.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:38.600
We've also experienced difficulties with visuospatial
thinking. Participants may have difficulty

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:46.020
navigating your set up and spaces. They may
also have trouble handling certain materials.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.990
Another symptom you may encounter is apathy.
Some participants may need additional or continued

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.120
prompting to remain engaged.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.870
On the other hand, some participants may demonstrate
a lack of inhibition or have trouble with

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:06.120
impulse control. While some participants are
more inhibited, others may be candid or unreserved.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.290
In the Tips and Tools section we'll discuss
ways of addressing some of these behaviors,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.580
if they come up.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.650
Though it is important to familiarize yourself
with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:21.460
other forms of dementia, it should not be
your focus during the program.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.150
In fact, in our programs we never mention
Alzheimer's disease. Our goal is to create

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.850
an experience where the presence of the disease
is minimized and people of all abilities are

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:35.290
able to engage and contribute on an equal
level.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.190
So in subsequent sections we'll be focusing
mainly on what you can do, as the educator,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:46.061
to create a successful program, one that suits
all abilities. But generally speaking, what

00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:48.970
do successful educators do?

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.100
A successful educator does one or more of
the following at any given point during a

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.680
program.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.041
First, they model positive behavior for the
group by setting an inviting tone, encouraging

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:05.950
experimentation, and by treating all participants
as equally valid contributors

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:12.820
They lead the experience, initiating the various
steps of a project and maintaining an overall

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.540
structure.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.990
They also listen -- they listen to participants
comments so that they can better understand

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.810
their interests and motivations.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:26.820
In addition to listening, they actively observe
participants, interpreting their processes

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.890
and determining where assistance is needed.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.230
Educators prompt different modes of creation,
making suggestions and challenging participants

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.000
to try new things.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.610
They also encourage: they provide validation
and specific feedback throughout the process.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:49.600
And finally, they synthesize- they find and
highlight connections between ideas, comments

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.490
and artworks, providing continuity and cohesion
throughout the program.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:00.070
In subsequent sections we'll talk practically
about how to accomplish all these things,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:05.430
what they look like, and how they feed into
preparation and facilitation.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.340
All in all, the project, the participants
and you as the educator are all equal factors

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:15.010
in the experience. Together you contribute
to a program that includes:

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:20.860
Generation and development of ideas and objects
Validation of individual contributions and

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.850
creations
Socialization among participants

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.330
And a general sense of sincerity and enjoyment

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:34.560
It is important to internalize these ideas
as you move forward as they profoundly affect

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.950
the experience you create.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:46.730
ART MAKING
Educator Preparation

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:51.440
In this section we'll discuss how to prepare
for an art-making project.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.000
We'll first discuss how to conceive of an
art-making project, by focusing on three specific

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.140
components of any project -- the materials,
action, and topic. We'll explain these three

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:08.380
components in detail and also introduce a
tool that allows you to combine them to generate

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.540
project ideas, called the Project Matrix.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.050
Once we have discussed how to conceive of
a project, we'll then go through the things

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:21.630
you can prepare in advance, including a structure
and schedule for your program, an artwork

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:27.570
discussion, project examples, and your spaces
and supplies.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.920
So, let's begin with conceiving of a project.
There are any number of approaches you could

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.600
take in your planning, but for our purposes
we have created a tool that will help you

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.910
easily generate projects that are focused
yet flexible. We call this tool the Project

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:48.350
Matrix, and it allows you to build projects
around three main components:

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.410
The first is your materials- the actual items
that participants will be working with,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.050
the second is your action- how participants
will work with with those materials, how specifically

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.380
they will manipulate them.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.090
And the third is your topic -- the broader
idea that participants will explore or interpret

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.740
through the creative process.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.200
These three project components work in tandem
to form the substance of your project and

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.100
also the parameters that give the experience
structure.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:21.320
Let's look at each of the three project components
more closely, beginning with materials.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.120
The materials are the items that participants
will use to create their artworks. There are

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.920
a myriad of possible materials that you can
select from. Here's a selection of materials

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.510
that are represented in our collection at
MoMA. This is by no means an exhaustive list

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.780
but merely a few ideas to help you get started.
You can find inspiration for possible materials

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.970
by looking at different artists' practices,
or seeing what is available in art supply

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.290
stores or in your immediate surroundings.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:55.070
There are even works in our collection that
incorporate chocolate or taxidermy animals.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.920
All of which is to say that you don't need
to limit yourself to what are seen as traditional

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.120
art materials.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.420
Take a moment to think about possible materials
that you might work with. Are there ones that

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.820
aren't represented in our list here?

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:19.700
Keep in mind that this list is fairly general;
there are varieties that exist within each

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.500
of the materials listed here. For instance,
there are various forms of paint -- watercolor,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.320
gouache, acrylic, oil paint, egg tempera,
and so one.âall with their own properties

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.500
and histories.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.800
On that note, take a minute to consider one
of the materials listed here and the various

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.490
sub-types available. For instance, what kinds
of paper are available? What kinds of different

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.730
cameras could you use?

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:56.200
Of all the materials available to you, you
will eventually choose one or a couple main

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.250
materials for your project. You may feel inclined
to provide a great variety of materials, but

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.800
we have found that this abundance can overwhelm
the creative process. Further, by narrowing

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.280
down the selection of materials for your project
you afford participants a more focused exploration

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.360
of your chosen materials' unique properties.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:21.400
Overall, choose materials that are age appropriate.
Materials that are designed for use in schools

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.930
or geared towards young children may be seen
as infantilizing.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:30.690
Also, be mindful of the physical difficulties
that might come with aging and select materials

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:35.610
that are accessible to individuals with limited
dexterity, trouble with fine motor skills

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.360
or reduced vision. Avoid items that might
be too small to handle or difficult to see,

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.250
such as little pieces of paper and fine wire.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:49.690
We'll cover specific adaptations that can
be made to make some art supplies more accessible

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.230
in the Tips and Tools section of this video.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:58.410
The next project element to consider is your
action. The action describes how your participants

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:00.860
will handle or manipulate the materials.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:06.439
Here are some actions or processes that are
represented in our collection:

00:17:06.439 --> 00:17:13.390
Some may be more familiar to you, like drawing
or painting, and some, like marking or performing

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.549
may be new points of departure.

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:20.799
This is by no means an exhaustive list and
it's derived from the actions undertaken by

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:25.720
artists in our collection. Again, take a moment
to come up with other actions that you could

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.460
employ.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:38.410
Again, select one particular action in order
to provide guidance for an intentional exploration

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.590
of the material at hand. This allows for an
experience that is more detailed and descriptive

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.409
than merely quote "making" something.

00:17:47.409 --> 00:17:52.230
In general, choose an action that everyone
is physically capable of doing. Again, think

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.190
about the abilities within your group.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.180
In addition, you should select an action that
you can demonstrate or model clearly for your

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.600
participants. Your ability to explain and
provide a visual reference is essential, especially

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.130
if you are introducing an action that is unfamiliar
to participants.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:16.080
The last component is the topic. A topic gives
additional scope and focus to your project;

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.799
it's the guiding idea that participants will
explore as they are working.

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:24.580
Some topics that we have explored in past
projects include more traditional subject

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.700
matter in art history, like:

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:34.330
Portraiture, including self-portraiture and
family portraiture and Landscape or Cityscapes

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:40.090
We've also facilitated in-depth explorations
of a single formal element, for instance line

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.150
and color.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:46.270
But there are also a number of broader ideas
that you could consider, such as identity

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:48.659
and politics.

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:54.870
Again, this list is just a jumping off point.
Take some time to think about other possible

00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:00.480
topics, including other formal elements, different
themes you notice in art history or the practice

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.690
of other artists, or broader ideas that interest
you or are most relevant to your audience

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:13.210
and setting.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:17.970
Of all the possible topics, select one for
your project.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.620
In general, choose a topic that:

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.669
Is narrow enough to provide focus to your
project. For example, just "people" as a topic

00:19:24.669 --> 00:19:29.679
might be too undirected, but narrowing down
the category to family or friends provides

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:33.019
scope to participants' explorations.

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:37.409
At the same time, make sure your topic is
general enough to still allow for multiple

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:42.950
approaches. Projects that are too focusedâfor
instance asking participants to depict a specific

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:47.830
place and time as their topic, say the restaurant
where they celebrated their first anniversary

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.129
âmay prohibit creative response.

00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:56.460
And finally, choose a topic that is relevant
and accessible, and interesting to you as

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.570
the educator.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:03.690
Now that we've considered each of the three
project components individually, let's put

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:09.710
them together, starting with materials and
action. You can see that some of these actions,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:15.470
like photographing, are associated with a
particular material, like a camera. Others

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:20.019
are more open and can be used with any number
of different materials.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:25.950
For instance, drawing. What does it look like
to draw with pencil- a more traditional approach-

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:31.350
as opposed to drawing with wire. What if you
draw with light? What if you use your body

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:37.759
to draw? Sometimes choosing a less obvious
pairing yields more interesting artworks.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:44.169
Now let's add the final componentâtopicâin
with the other two. Here you have the full

00:20:44.169 --> 00:20:45.440
Project Matrix.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.769
From here you can select one of each of the
components, combining different materials,

00:20:50.769 --> 00:20:56.210
actions, and topics to generate any number
of project ideas.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:21:00.570
Here's a selection of projects that we've
implemented in the past:

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:06.600
We've asked participants to build a landscape
(specifically a cityscape) with pieces of

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.160
wood.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.789
We've also asked participants to use newspaper
to create collages about political events.

00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:18.919
We've asked participants to assemblage their
own personal objects -- bringing objects from

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:23.080
home -- to explore personal identity.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.450
We've asked participants to make a print with
their body and ground charcoal as a way of

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.909
investigating abstract self-portraiture.

00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:38.009
In the past we've asked participants to explore
the figure by drawing with wire.

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:43.740
We've also asked participants to investigate
line by spreading ink.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.529
Take some time to think about other combinations
that you could try.

00:21:49.529 --> 00:21:57.279
Again, we also encourage you to come up with
your own lists of possible materials, actions,

00:21:57.279 --> 00:22:02.750
and topics, which will likely be better suited
to your interests and circumstances. As you

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.840
move forward you can continue to come up with
ideas based on your own experiences engaging

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.039
with art in cultural institutions, public
spaces, or at home.

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:17.909
So, using the project matrix as a tool we've
chosen the following project combination:

00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:24.230
paper, collage, and portraiture. We'll stick
with for the rest of this video, explaining

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:27.960
the various steps of preparation and facilitation
throughout.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:33.129
Again, the project matrix is meant to help
simplify the process of generating project

00:22:33.129 --> 00:22:37.490
ideas, while also helping you to think of
ways of making art that might be less obvious

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.220
or straightforward.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.440
Further, the Project Matrix enables you to
start with whichever component makes the most

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.179
sense for you. For example, you can look at
the materials you have on hand, choose one

00:22:49.179 --> 00:22:54.490
specifically to focus on, and build a project
from there. Alternatively, if you are thinking

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:59.530
about the particular themes of a special exhibition
you can start by choosing a topic and then

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.619
choose a material and action that will help
participants explore that topic.

00:23:04.619 --> 00:23:10.080
Of course, not every combination that you
come up with will necessarily work as a project.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.340
Overall, design projects that are:

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.799
Geared toward all levels of artistic skill.
For example, a project that asks participants

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:23.320
to draw life-like portraits of one another
using pastels may be intimidating and frustrating.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.280
There are certainly other options that are
better suited for the artistic skill level

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.159
of your average adult and will be more enjoyable.

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:35.690
Design projects that are feasible in the time
allotted. For example, a large landscape made

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:40.400
using oil paint would be difficult to complete
in a 2-hour session, as that particular material

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.600
would need far longer to dry.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.149
Along those same lines, make sure your project
is realistic considering the amount of staff

00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:53.490
you have on hand. There may be materials,
actions, and topics that together will require

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:59.070
continued guidance or assistance from staff.
Be mindful of your ratio of staff to participants

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.000
when choosing those components.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.019
And finally, design a project that is interesting
to you as the educator. Use your own interest

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:10.929
or excitement level as a gauge. If you're
not interested in the project, then don't

00:24:10.929 --> 00:24:13.639
expect others to be.

00:24:13.639 --> 00:24:19.380
If your project meets all these criteria then
it is more likely to be successful and enjoyable.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:24.250
That said, your group will inevitably have
diverse preferences, varying experience with

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:30.179
art, a range of cognitive abilities. Accordingly,
expect that some participants might be hesitant,

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:35.239
no matter what project you design. All of
which is to say, be thoughtful in your planning

00:24:35.239 --> 00:24:39.101
but don't try too hard to anticipate how everyone
will react, as you never really know.

00:24:39.101 --> 00:24:46.520
Now that we've covered how to conceive of
a project, we will discuss how to prepare

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:52.539
for that project. We'll go through preparing
a structure and schedule, an artwork discussion,

00:24:52.539 --> 00:24:56.940
project examples, as well as supplies and
spaces.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.710
Let's begin with your program structure.

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:05.059
As a reminder, our typical programs take the
following form. We begin with an introduction

00:25:05.059 --> 00:25:10.039
of the project's main ideas, followed by an
artwork discussion that relates to the project's

00:25:10.039 --> 00:25:15.539
components: the materials, action, and topic.
From there we explain and demonstrate materials

00:25:15.539 --> 00:25:20.909
and help participants think of how to get
started on their works before they begin creating.

00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:25.049
We spend a significant amount of time making
art but we also save time at the end for group

00:25:25.049 --> 00:25:29.989
discussion of participant artwork. We conclude
by sharing last thoughts and reflections on

00:25:29.989 --> 00:25:30.989
the experience.

00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:36.299
So, in planning your project, think about
these steps and how you will facilitate each

00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:38.019
stage.

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:42.670
For instance, think about which ideas you
might want to introduce from the outset. Consider

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:48.450
your three project components. Will your chosen
materials, action or topic merit definition

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.269
or discussion at the beginning of your program
and if so, think about how you will explain

00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:58.110
them. Will that require some additional research
in advance of your program?

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:04.509
For our example, again we've chosen paper,
collage, and portraiture. Paper is a commonplace

00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:09.350
material, but participants will likely be
less familiar with collage and portraiture,

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.770
so we will plan to discuss these ideas at
the outset. In advance, we will better familiarize

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.330
ourselves with portraiture and collage processes,
and spend some time thinking about how to

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.309
define them in a straightforward manner.

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:26.480
Next, think about your artwork discussion
as it relates to your schedule. We'll cover

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.989
how to prepare the content of your discussion
shortly but for now, think about the number

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:35.909
of works you can discuss and how much time
you have to do so. Each individual artwork

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:39.549
discussion should last no longer than 10 minutes.

00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:44.529
So, for our example we will plan to spend
about 20 minutes discussing artworks from

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:50.179
MoMA's collection, so we'll need to choose
3-4 artworks, max.

00:26:50.179 --> 00:26:54.960
Think more specifically about your materials
and how you might demonstrate using them.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.259
If a material is unfamiliar to you, spend
some time experimenting with it yourself in

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:05.429
advance of your program in order to get ideas
as to possible techniques that you might demonstrate.

00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:09.799
For our example, we'll experiment with the
various papers we've selected, trying different

00:27:09.799 --> 00:27:15.809
ways of folding, tearing, twisting, cutting,
and so on.

00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:20.480
Think about how you might help participants
plan and then begin to execute their works.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.239
What will you ask them to think about before
they start working? What will you ask them

00:27:24.239 --> 00:27:28.499
to do first when it's time to execute their
plan?

00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:33.179
So for our example, our topic is portraiture,
and that topic is fairly broad, so we'll need

00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:37.899
to break that idea down into something more
manageable for participants. We'll plan to

00:27:37.899 --> 00:27:42.320
start by asking participants to consider who
they'll be making a portrait of, and give

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.149
them some possible options. Once they've decided
who to depict we'll ask them to think more

00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:47.149
specifically about which aspects of that person
they'd like to include in their portrait.

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:50.350
The remaining portions of your program will
be determined in large part by what transpires

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:55.669
over the course of your session. How you support
participants as they are making will be determined

00:27:55.669 --> 00:28:00.340
by their process and needs, and the discussion
of participant works and your final thoughts

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.700
will grow out of what you observe and discuss
during the program.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.590
Thinking about how you'll move through each
of these steps ahead of time will allow you

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:13.619
to facilitate your program effectively and
confidently. In the Leading a Project section

00:28:13.619 --> 00:28:19.169
of this video you can see clips of us executing
all of these steps, continuing with our collage

00:28:19.169 --> 00:28:21.830
portraiture project.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.530
As we mentioned before, toward the beginning
of your session you'll facilitate an inquiry-based

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:32.960
discussion of about 2-4 established artworks.
This discussion is meant to provide insight

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:38.470
into your project components as well as inspiration
for participants' art-making.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:43.159
To find these artworks, look online- on museum
or gallery websites, especially, as they have

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:48.169
higher quality images than those found on
other websites. You can also think about using

00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:51.940
reproductions found in art books or posters.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.400
In general, choose artworks that:

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:58.049
Employ the same components -- that is, the
same materials, topic and action -- that your

00:28:58.049 --> 00:28:59.769
project employs.

00:28:59.769 --> 00:29:05.210
Show variety in their approach to those components,
so participants are exposed to multiple perspectives

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.850
on your chosen materials, action, and topic.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:14.019
Exhibit a range of complexity, thus broadening
participants' notion of what is acceptable

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:16.009
and accomplishable.

00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:20.710
And are clearly legible in reproduction, if
that is what you'll be using.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:25.159
So to return to our collage portraiture project,
the works that we've chosen in relation to

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:26.370
this project are:

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:32.880
A detail from Henri Matisse's multi-panel
collage, "The Swimming Pool," made in 1952.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.460
This section depicts a horizontal figure collaged
from pieces of painted paper that have been

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.510
mounted onto burlap.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:46.309
Romare Bearden's "Patchwork Quilt," from 1970.
Bearden used cut and pasted cloth and paper

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:51.279
to depict a figure reclining on a divan with
a patchwork quilt draped behind her.

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:57.730
Chuck Close's "Phyllis" from 1982, a black-and-white
collage of a woman's face, who looks straight

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:59.820
out at the viewer.

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.999
And finally, Lara Schnitger's [short "I"]
"Ciara" from the year 2000, which shows the

00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:10.460
head and torso of a woman. This work was created
using colorful, decorative papers cut and

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:14.970
pasted to depict both the woman and her surroundings.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:19.629
All of these works approach our three project
components- paper, collage, and portraiture-

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:21.749
in different ways.

00:30:21.749 --> 00:30:27.570
For example, let's consider our topic, portraiture.
The title of Schnitger's work suggests a portrait

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:33.150
of a specific person, Ciara. Matisse's work,
on the other hand, gives us no sense that

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:38.679
this is a specific person, as he has abstracted
his figure. It is therefore a less traditional

00:30:38.679 --> 00:30:40.139
kind of portrait.

00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:46.539
In terms of our material, paper, Bearden employs
decorative patterns in his choice of materials,

00:30:46.539 --> 00:30:49.239
while Matisse uses simpler solids.

00:30:49.239 --> 00:30:53.899
And in terms of our final component, collage,
you can see that Matisse has collaged very

00:30:53.899 --> 00:30:59.919
few pieces of paper in comparison with Chuck
Close's more dense arrangement.

00:30:59.919 --> 00:31:03.690
Once you've selected your artworks, think
more about how you will prepare to facilitate

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:08.489
a conversation about them. While there are
many things you could discuss within any given

00:31:08.489 --> 00:31:14.380
work, your focus should be on the elements
that most relate to your project and its components.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.260
First, look closely in order to identify these
components.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:24.020
Look for evidence of the materials, the process
or action undertaken by the artist, or their

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.720
approach to the topic. In addition, notice
the formal decisions that the artist has made,

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:35.669
like how they've employed or arranged lines,
shapes, forms or colors. Consider how all

00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:39.470
of these elements come together to create
an overall mood or effect.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:44.399
Pinpoint a couple of elements that you find
important and craft questions that will help

00:31:44.399 --> 00:31:47.889
participants notice and describe them.

00:31:47.889 --> 00:31:53.009
For example, in the Close work I am initially
struck by the texture. I want participants

00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:57.169
to think about how they might create a sense
of texture in their own works. So I might

00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:01.739
plan to say something like, "Describe the
surface of this work. Does it seem smooth

00:32:01.739 --> 00:32:07.570
or rough? Let's think more specifically about
the individual pieces of paper Close used,

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:10.049
how would you describe their edges?"

00:32:10.049 --> 00:32:14.570
In addition, I'd want participants to notice
how Close built up his surface by layering

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:19.360
pieces of paper on top of one another and
overlapping them, so I might ask something

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:27.610
like, "How are the pieces of paper arranged?
Does this image seem light to you, or dense?"

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:32.010
Alternatively, what strikes me most about
the Matisse work is that he created a figure

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:38.480
seemingly in motion, and used very few pieces
of paper to do so. I'm going to want participants

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.690
to notice these aspects of the work so they,
too, might think about depicting movement

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:48.529
as a viable option for their own collages.
As such, I'll ask something like "What does

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:54.279
this figure seem to be doing?" "Does he seem
to be moving or staying still?" "How did the

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:59.250
artist create that sense of movement?" And,
finally, "roughly how many pieces of paper

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:03.100
did the artist use to create that effect?"

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:08.369
In addition to looking closely, do some research
about the artworks and the artist who made

00:33:08.369 --> 00:33:13.720
them. Find detailed information about each
work's materials, the action or process employed,

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.989
and the artist's approach to the topic. Learn
what you can about the artist's motivations

00:33:17.989 --> 00:33:22.330
behind making these choices. Consider how
this work relates to the artist's practice

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.220
overall.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.029
As you're deciding which art historical points
you might share during your discussion, prioritize

00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:33.250
that which is most relevant to your project
and what you will be asking participants to

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.879
do.

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:39.279
So going back to my Matisse, through the course
of my research, I learned about his process

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:42.899
in making this work -- that he generally cut
the shapes out freehand, using a small pair

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:48.260
of scissors and saving both the item cut out
and remaining scraps of paper. Then he and

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:53.200
his assistants would painstakingly arrange
and re-arrange his loose pieces of cut paper

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:59.120
before pinning and then finally pasting them
down. I'll prioritize sharing this information

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.809
during my discussion because it relates to
the collage process that I'll be asking participants

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:09.109
to try. I also found out a bit more about
his overall practice -- that he started his

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:13.940
career in the early 20th century working with
painting and sculpture and didn't turn to

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.859
collage until later in life.

00:34:16.859 --> 00:34:20.960
Prior to your program create an artwork that
employs your project components, which will

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:24.020
serve as an example during your program.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:28.310
Creating a project example allows you to go
through the steps of the project yourself,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.649
which will better familiarize you with the
process you'll be asking participants to undergo,

00:34:32.649 --> 00:34:39.119
and also allows you to identify and resolve
any potential trouble spots.

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:43.480
Examples should demonstrate various techniques
or approaches to your project components and

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:49.349
should represent what is realistically possible
given the timeframe and supplies you'll provide.

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:54.760
Don't utilize materials or spend more time
than will be available to participants.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.730
For our project we've created two example
works.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:02.570
I created a portrait of Laurel. I wanted to
provide an example of a portrait of a person

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:08.690
I knew. I used scissors to create the various
components of Laurel's face, hair, and clothing.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:14.200
I created a portrait of an imaginary figure,
a frog prince. I opted to create my portrait

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:19.309
by just tearing and folding paper, forgoing
the use of scissors. I wanted to create a

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:24.599
finished project employing a more accessible
method of working with paper.

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:29.120
On the day of your program, prepare your spaces
and supplies. Arrange your space in a way

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.070
that allows all participants room to work
and to interact with each other. Your set

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:38.390
up should afford you access to each participant,
so that you'll be able to interact with them

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.690
individually during the program.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:46.010
Gather all the materials necessary and organize
them in a way that will allow you to easily

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:50.290
access and distribute them later on.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.789
So for our program we will gather different
varieties of paper, making sure to account

00:35:54.789 --> 00:35:59.550
for the background paper that participants
can use as a surface as well as various kinds

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:04.650
of colored and decorative papers that they'll
use to create an image. We'll go ahead and

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:09.360
cut some of that paper into different shapes,
in case anyone prefers to work with pre-existing

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.960
pieces. We'll also pull out scissors and glue
and plan to arrange our tables in a U-shape

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.390
so participants can see us and each other.

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.579
In general, when conceiving of and preparing
to lead an art-making project:

00:36:22.579 --> 00:36:26.910
Develop a project that is both focused and
flexible. Whether or not you choose to use

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.920
the Project Matrix in your planning, projects
with defined parameters are easier to follow

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.200
for participants, and easier for you to facilitate
clearly.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.480
Consider the accessibility of your project.
Choose project components that can be clearly

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.849
explained and that are engaging for participants
with a diverse range of physical and cognitive

00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:51.799
abilities, as well as varying levels of artistic
expertise.

00:36:51.799 --> 00:36:56.620
Choose artworks and create project examples
that will inspire creative thinking and variety

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:02.530
of approach, not discourage personalized exploration
and response.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:06.531
Combine your project components in a way that
is interesting to you as the educator. You'll

00:37:06.531 --> 00:37:10.820
be having your own experience with your project
-- both in your preparation and when you facilitate

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.020
the program -- so you should be excited about
it.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.420
Keeping these things in mind as you conceive
of and prepare for your project will allow

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:26.250
you to prompt individualized artistic explorations
without over-determining participant experience.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:35.260
ART-MAKING
LEADING A PROJECT

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:40.210
In this section we'll cover how to lead an
art-making project, which includes the following

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.510
steps:

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:47.400
Welcome -- setting up the experience
Discussing Artworks -- facilitating a conversation

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:53.619
about works of art for inspiration
Explaining Materials -- defining and demonstrating

00:37:53.619 --> 00:37:58.549
the materials that will be used
Starting the Art-Making Process -- helping

00:37:58.549 --> 00:38:04.050
participants begin to create
Supporting the Art-Making Process -- continuing

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:10.000
to support individual participants and the
group once everyone has started to work

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.150
Sharing Works Created-- presenting and discussing
participant artwork, and finally

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:20.410
Conclusion and Project Extension- providing
final thoughts on the experience and suggestions

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.710
going forward

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:27.970
This structure is meant to provide you with
a flexible outline for facilitating your project.

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:33.080
It is grounded in prevailing practices in
museum education. We use it as a guide for

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:38.079
structuring our programs for people with Alzheimer's
disease and their carepartners but also with

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:43.740
other Museum audiences, because it allows
for various forms of interpretation and creation,

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.980
no matter participants' level of ability,
and connects the art-making process to ideas

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.829
and works in MoMA's collection.

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:54.900
In this section we'll cover how to structure
an art-making program in general, without

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.720
focusing too directly on the specific needs
of individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:04.730
Information pertaining specifically to this
audience will be covered in the next section,

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:10.040
Tips and Tools, as will ways of creating a
supportive and validating environment. The

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.000
tone you set is just as important as the structure
you follow.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.650
Further, this structure can accommodate many
different kinds of projects. The materials,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:24.010
action, and topic that form the parameters
of your particular project, may determine

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:28.690
how quickly you move through certain parts.
For instance, in a project where the materials

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:33.839
are intuitive and the process straightforward,
say arranging adhesive stickers on paper,

00:39:33.839 --> 00:39:39.230
your material explanation might be much quicker.
On the other hand, multi-step project like

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:43.299
block-printing might require a more prolonged
explanation.

00:39:43.299 --> 00:39:49.240
As we go through we'll continue with our example
project employing paper, collage, and portraiture,

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:54.231
including clips from a program that Laurel
and I co-taught in our studio spaces. In a

00:39:54.231 --> 00:39:59.290
typical MoMA program there is one lead educator,
with additional support staff. But, for the

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.609
sake of filming, we taught this session together.

00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:07.720
Let's get into the details of leading a project,
beginning with welcome.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:12.770
To begin your program, welcome participants
with a relaxed and inviting tone and orient

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:19.350
the group to the experience. Introduce yourself
and outline the upcoming project. As we discussed

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.130
in the Educator Preparation section of this
video, you should already have your materials

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:29.599
set up in an organized and accessible fashion,
so as to be able to engage with participants

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:32.599
as soon as they walk in.

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:37.500
After introducing yourself and the project,
give a brief outline for your program. Frame

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:43.110
participants' expectations as to what is to
come. Additionally, it's important to communicate

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:48.079
the goals of the experience-- to explore and
experiment as you work on an image or object--

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:51.680
and to emphasize what is possible in the time
allotted.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.600
Here's a clip of Laurel framing the session
and communicating its goals:

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.260
We're going to spend about an hour and a half
today working. We're going to start out by

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:05.369
discussing a few works of art from our collection,
then we're going to work for a bit, and then

00:41:05.369 --> 00:41:09.080
at the end we'll have an opportunity to see
what everyone else has made and to share a

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.460
bit with each other.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:14.480
Collage can be a really labor-intensive process,
and some of the works we're going to talk

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.700
about today took months and months to create.
So, it's just to say that we're not necessarily

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.799
going to make the next "museum masterpiece"
since we only have an hour and a half, we

00:41:23.799 --> 00:41:28.839
can only accomplish so much. But the goals
are just to experiment with the materials,

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:35.890
and explore some of the ideas that we're going
to be discussing, and to see what we come

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.299
up with.

00:41:37.299 --> 00:41:42.291
You can see that Laurel encouraged participants
to use the time to explore and create. She

00:41:42.291 --> 00:41:46.510
also stressed that there was only a limited
amount of time within which to work. This

00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:54.150
was not meant to limit participants but rather
to take the pressure off and encourage experimentation.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:59.369
From there, elaborate the project's focus
and explain the key project components. As

00:41:59.369 --> 00:42:03.790
mentioned in the Educator Preparation section
of this video, you should decide ahead of

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.650
time which project components merit definition.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:10.670
Here's Meryl elaborating on two components:

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:17.930
Today we're going to be doing a paper collage
project as a way of exploring portraiture.

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:22.619
Collage -- I just found this out -- the word
collage comes from the French work "to glue",

00:42:22.619 --> 00:42:26.250
and it involves taking parts of things --

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:28.069
"little bits and scraps" --

00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:32.650
exactly, just like Carol said, little bits
of this and that, right. The materials can

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:38.640
be anything; we're going to work with paper
today, some artists use fabric, some use newspapers

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.650
or magazines. Taking little bits of this and
that, like Carol was saying, rearranging them,

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.070
and making a new thing. That's what collage
is.

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.020
The second thing we're exploring today, as
I mentioned, is portraiture. So what do you

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.309
think of when I say the word "portraiture",
what's that?

00:42:56.309 --> 00:43:00.190
I see Carol going like this, so we're on to
something

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:08.950
It's a real formal focus on one particular
thing, and really paying attention to that

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:09.950
object.

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.660
Absolutely right. So portraits are normally
very focused, they're just of one thing, and

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.089
what is that one thing that they're normally
of?

00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:18.089
Person's face

00:43:18.089 --> 00:43:23.000
A face, exactly. Marty, you were going to
say that too? Exactly, right. Some portraits

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.310
are very lifelike and others can be a bit
more abstract or just capture one or two of

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.270
the physical attributes that define a person.

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:35.520
And we're going to look at a couple examples
in a second of both of those different kinds

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.740
of portraits.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:43.600
You can see in the clip that Meryl defined
the ideas of collage and portraiture. Before

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.440
giving her definitions, however, she asked
participants if they had heard of or experimented

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:56.670
with these ideas before, honoring their prior
knowledge and experiences.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:00.920
Once you've introduced your project, you will
lead a short inquiry-based discussion about

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:06.750
your preselected artworks. The artwork discussion
is meant to provide inspiration and to contextualize

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:12.270
the experience within a larger framework of
artistic practice.

00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:17.359
Distribute and discuss each work one-by-one.
If possible, have a large central image around

00:44:17.359 --> 00:44:22.161
which you can unite the group, and also pass
out reproductions to each participant so that

00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:28.210
they can look at the works more closely and
continue to refer to them throughout the experience.

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:32.849
As you start your discussion, explain to participants
that you'll be showing examples of artworks

00:44:32.849 --> 00:44:37.500
that employ the same materials, action or
topic that they will also be exploring, that

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:42.180
you plan to spend about 5-10 minutes discussing
each of these works and that you're eager

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.200
to hear their thoughts.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:45.200
Here's an example:

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.099
We're going to look at a few works from the
collection so we can get some inspiration

00:44:49.099 --> 00:44:53.579
for our own art-making process. The artists
that we're going to show you have employed

00:44:53.579 --> 00:44:59.559
different materials, have used different processes
of building the works that they've created.

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:04.290
So you can use their ideas to, you know, help
you get started or for inspiration, but you

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:10.109
can also feel free to depart from what they've
done.

00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:14.190
In that clip Laurel explained the purpose
of looking at artworks, though she indicated

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.580
that participants had a choice as to whether
or not they would like to incorporate the

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.589
techniques viewed into their own making. It
is important to emphasize to participants

00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:26.440
that they are not meant to just copy the style
of one artist.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:30.750
As you move through the discussion, ask questions
that prompt explorations of the particular

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:36.400
approach to the materials, action, or topic
within each work. Point participants to the

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.190
formal properties of the work, specific decisions
made by the artist, the resulting image and

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.089
overall effect.

00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:49.440
Here's a clip from Laurel's discussion of
our final artwork, Chuck Close's "Phyllis".

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.450
Looking closely at our last work of art, do
you have a sense of how it might be made or

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:59.579
what materials are that this artist has used?

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:00.579
Crepe paper

00:46:00.579 --> 00:46:01.579
Gray paper?

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:02.579
Crepe

00:46:02.579 --> 00:46:07.130
Oh yeah, that textured paper, crepe paper,
right?

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.970
Confetti! And Carol, what made you think of
confetti?

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.450
It's small and round

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:18.500
Does everyone notice that there are little
round pieces of paper of different kind of

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:24.670
shades of white to black, that have been layered
over each other to build up the image of this

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:25.670
person?

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.670
But it's also interesting --

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.531
--you can put it wherever you want

00:46:28.531 --> 00:46:32.410
Yeah, you can put it wherever you want, exactly.
As Carol's saying -- and this is exactly what

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:37.559
we'll be doing -- we'll be layering and arranging
pieces of paper to create an image of a person

00:46:37.559 --> 00:46:38.730
or another kind of figure.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:46.190
There are not smooth edges on the paper. They're
all kind of, a little bit uneven, an effect

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:53.319
or they're serrated in some fashion, so that
adds an additional interest to this composition.

00:46:53.319 --> 00:46:59.210
Yeah, and I'm going to repeat back what Lynne
said. It's interesting that the edges of the

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:05.130
little pieces of paper that are used to construct
this image aren't perfectly even. It's not

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:09.120
like they're cut up squares or smooth, they're
really rough, exactly, and in fact when we're

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:16.220
making our works today you can think about
that. You can sort of fold or tear and think

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:22.700
about different ways of manipulating the paper
to get a certain effect like that.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:27.289
In the clip Laurel asked questions that encouraged
participants to examine the materials used

00:47:27.289 --> 00:47:31.760
in the work, in this case paper, and then
to think of how they were applied to create

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:37.589
the image of "Phyllis." She also linked participants'
observations about Close's choice of paper

00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:42.540
to choices that they might consider when working
later on. It is important to make this direct

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:47.309
link, always situating the artworks shown
during the discussion within the context of

00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:49.309
the art-making process to come.

00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:54.589
Remember, when facilitating a discussion about
artworks at the beginning of your art-making

00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:58.970
program, the emphasis is less on building
a personal and collective interpretation of

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:04.200
the work, considering its broader significance
in art and world history, than on asking questions

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:10.059
that prompt close attention to the materials,
action, or topic. Encouraging participants

00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:15.820
to think about how something is made will
lay the groundwork for their own making.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:21.069
Once you've concluded your discussion, introduce
and explain your materials. Review the various

00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:25.990
materials that you have available and demonstrate
as necessary.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:30.559
Here's an example of Meryl reviewing our project's
materials:

00:48:30.559 --> 00:48:36.750
So everyone will get the same background paper,
and then we're also going to be working with

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:42.080
a variety of colored and patterned paper.
And they have different textures and weights,

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.100
so they fold and tear differently.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.920
You can tell, actually, Carol, that this paper
is very easy to fold. It's very light, if

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:52.349
you want to hold it. And so that's something
to think about as you're making your own work.

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:57.089
as well, right, the paper that rips easily
or tears easily versus the paper that is a

00:48:57.089 --> 00:48:58.150
little weightier.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:04.320
And then, of course, we've gone ahead and
precut some paper here as well, and so everyone

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:08.730
should have some of this in front of them.
There's solid colors on the one half and then

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:14.039
some of this precut pattern paper on the other
half, so that might be nice to try to experiment

00:49:14.039 --> 00:49:16.930
with too.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.710
You can see that Meryl clearly explained the
kinds of paper that were provided and their

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:26.619
varying properties. Don't assume that everyone
is an expert. You should explain what is available,

00:49:26.619 --> 00:49:30.490
even if the materials seem straightforward.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:34.310
Once you've introduced the materials, explain
a bit more about how to use or manipulate

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:35.859
them.

00:49:35.859 --> 00:49:39.390
One way to do this is to show participants
your project example.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:44.589
Here is a clip of Laurel showing an example
of a collage portrait she made prior to the

00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:46.369
program:

00:49:46.369 --> 00:49:50.980
And so here's an example I made just be tearing
and folding. If you look at some of the details,

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:56.190
you'll notice that I folded this crown into
the spikes, I made a bit of a frog prince

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:01.440
here today. And then ripped the eyes out and
the nose to create all of the facial features,

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:06.360
and then again sort of folded this patterned
paper at the bottom to create a sense of his

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360
collar.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.430
In her explanation Laurel described some of
the ways that she used the paper to create

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:10.380
aspects of the Frog Prince's body and dress.
She also emphasized that the work was created

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.380
without using scissors.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:14.970
You can also create or at least start to create
a work in front of participants, in order

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:17.740
to show firsthand ways of working with the
materials.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.559
Here is an example:

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:28.990
So today I'd like to make a portrait of Meryl.
Then what I'm going to start with is just

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:37.940
to do her face -- cut out a face for her.
But you know, Meryl sometimes when she gets

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:43.109
really excited or maybe is like a little a
bit anxious she turns bright red, so I'm going

00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:53.170
to do her face in bright red. So you can just
cut out a shape that, you know, she's got

00:50:53.170 --> 00:51:01.470
ears, but then if I'm thinking maybe I want
to do her hair, today she wore her hair curly

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:05.609
which I really like and I want to see if I
can maybe get some different textures in there,

00:51:05.609 --> 00:51:12.430
right, some shape and some depth. So maybe
I want to use a few different kinds of reddish

00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:18.769
browns or maybe I'll get even less lifelike
and throw some purple in and just sort of

00:51:18.769 --> 00:51:28.640
layer them. And for these I'm just going to
rip, maybe, and maybe I'll do a little bit

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:41.720
of an accordion fold to get some of the curl,
the texture. So now you can see my Meryl is

00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:45.960
sort of coming to life.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:51.470
In that clip Laurel quickly planned and started
a work, narrating her thoughts and process.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.490
She modeled how you might get started, by
cutting out a face, and then demonstrated

00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.849
a few different techniques, including cutting,
folding and tearing. Moreover, in her brevity

00:52:00.849 --> 00:52:05.019
and low-key manner she implicitly conveyed
that the task of art-making was not meant

00:52:05.019 --> 00:52:07.910
to be intimidating.

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:12.090
You can also demonstrate techniques without
actually starting a work, and ask participants

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:16.569
to try them out with you as you go. This is
an especially good idea if you are working

00:52:16.569 --> 00:52:20.950
with a material that is new and unfamiliar
to participants, as it gives them a chance

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:25.180
to try things out before working on a final
product.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:29.000
Distribute relevant materials, but don't pass
out everything at this point, as some materials

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.940
might serve as a distraction during your demonstration.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:39.950
After you've introduced and explained your
materials, begin the art-making process. Give

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:44.180
participants an opportunity to plan their
work and provide some instruction or guidance

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:49.400
on how to begin. It can be difficult to transition
from discussion and instruction to creating

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:56.859
a work, so providing initial prompts can ease
participants into the art-making process.

00:52:56.859 --> 00:53:01.180
While the particular prompts you give will
be specific to your project, it's generally

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:06.079
a good idea not to give too many directions
at once. Instead, your initial prompts should

00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:09.490
be concise and concrete.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:10.490
Let's take a look:

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:17.299
The first thing to do as you're thinking about
creating your own collages is to decide who

00:53:17.299 --> 00:53:22.700
you want to be making a collage of -- you
want a person, exactly -- who you want to

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:28.960
be making your collage portrait of. So you
can make a self portrait, you can choose someone

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.069
in this room, like I chose Laurel. Sometimes
it's nice to have a visual reference right

00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:38.089
on hand. Or, you know, you can choose an imaginary
person -- our definition of portraiture is

00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:45.400
loose today. You can also feel free to abandon
your ideas later if the materials sort of

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:50.650
take you in a different direction. For example,
if I want to make a portrait of my Mom but

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:55.280
I really like that shiny paper and my mother
becomes an astronaut, that's fine too.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.100
So maybe take a second to think about who
you want to make a portrait of, some of their

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:05.030
defining physical attributes, or something
about their personality and turn to the person

00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:16.210
next to you and let them know who you think
you're going to be creating a picture of today.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:22.930
So, Marty and Susie you said you're going
to work together, who are you going to be

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:28.310
making today? Okay, so Marty is going to be
making a collage portrait of Susie with Susie's

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:32.750
input. And then the second thing to do, after
you've chosen your person, is to think about

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:38.490
if you want to make just a face or a bust,
like in the Chuck Close, right, or if you

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:43.680
want to make a whole body or even, you know,
a body in action the way that we saw with

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.769
the Matisse work here. Right, so again, something
else to consider: who you're going to be making

00:54:48.769 --> 00:54:53.010
and what part of their body you want to be
depicting.

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:56.770
In that clip you can see that Meryl asked
participants to consider who might be the

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:02.450
subject of their portrait and presented a
few possible options. She also kept the process

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:08.480
open, reiterating that it's okay to change
your mind midway. After having participants

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.930
discuss their ideas, she then asked them to
further develop their plan and consider what

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.410
part of the person they wanted to focus on.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:20.980
Indeed, breaking up these two ideas better
facilitated participant planning. It is generally

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:25.269
best to ask participants to consider one idea
at a time.

00:55:25.269 --> 00:55:30.500
Further, by asking participants to discuss
their ideas together Meryl encouraged continued

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:35.460
conversation. Sharing thoughts with another
person also creates a memory prosthesis, which

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:38.790
is helpful for those with short-term memory
loss.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:42.609
Once participants have an idea of what they
will make, make sure they have all the necessary

00:55:42.609 --> 00:55:48.070
materials to start their work. Walk around
to each participant and reiterate the prompts

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:52.559
individually. Often, participants need a bit
of personal attention at the outset to help

00:55:52.559 --> 00:55:57.049
get them started. Further, you can get a sense
of where they are going with their project

00:55:57.049 --> 00:56:02.480
so that you can return to them constructively
later on in the process.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:07.039
Throughout the art-making process, continue
to support participants. Encourage them as

00:56:07.039 --> 00:56:13.710
they work, prompting different avenues of
exploration and assist participants when necessary.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:18.480
Begin by moving around freely and observing
participants as they work. See if anyone needs

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.039
any additional materials or other supplies
and assess the various members of the group

00:56:23.039 --> 00:56:27.829
to see if anyone might benefit from more targeted
assistance.

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:32.250
As their projects are developing, ask participants
about the choices they've made and the direction

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:37.279
they are going with their work. Provide constructive
and specific encouragement, incorporating

00:56:37.279 --> 00:56:41.490
what they might have said and what you've
noticed. You can also touch on comments they

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:45.509
might have made during the artwork discussion,
reintroducing what they said and connecting

00:56:45.509 --> 00:56:48.930
it to their process.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:54.109
You can also provide participants with a range
of options as to how they might move forward,

00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:57.119
encouraging experimentation and exploration.

00:56:57.119 --> 00:56:58.220
Here's an example:

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.990
We can also trying moving them around, arranging
them.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.970
Yeah, yeah. Maybe that's better.

00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:05.160
Maybe that's better?

00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.740
Yeah, I think so.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.470
Well, you show me and I'll just do the gluing
for you.

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:15.789
I think it would be better on the side.

00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:19.859
I like that you had it sort of looking over
to the side.

00:57:19.859 --> 00:57:24.180
How's was that? Was that the first pose?

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.880
In that clip Meryl suggested that Carole play
with the placement of her figure's eyes, moving

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.960
them around and trying different arrangements
before making a decision.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:37.180
Prior to that, Carol and I had spent some
time thinking about how to make the eyes.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:42.470
We tried cutting one eye out and tearing the
other to see which one she preferred.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.299
As participants are working, you should provide
suggestions as to how they might accomplish

00:57:46.299 --> 00:57:52.119
a particular aspect of their work or expand
the techniques they are using. Provide a practical

00:57:52.119 --> 00:57:57.640
visual reference by demonstrating individually
how to achieve or incorporate what it is you

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.270
are suggesting. Sometimes it's not enough
to just mention a method of working, but physically

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:05.490
demonstrating can be helpful.

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:10.690
You can also reintroduce one or some of the
artworks discussed earlier. Highlight similarities

00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:15.490
and differences in order to generate new ways
of working or validate a participant's process

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:19.890
thus far. But just remember that if you are
going to refer to something you've seen or

00:58:19.890 --> 00:58:26.759
discussed earlier you should have a visual
reference on hand as a reminder.

00:58:26.759 --> 00:58:32.730
As people are working, hold up works in progress
so that participants can see other approaches.

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.930
Encourage participants to look at each other's
work throughout the session.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:37.930
Here's an example:

00:58:37.930 --> 00:58:41.950
Do you mind if I hold yours up to show everyone?

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:43.460
Well look at that, that's gorgeous!

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.609
So I just want to show everyone an example
of someone's work so far. Lynne has been doing

00:58:47.609 --> 00:58:48.810
a portrait of Manny.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.500
Wow, that's great!

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.190
Not very good.

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:59.130
Ty is a tough critic but I really like how
you've already gotten his beard and the texture

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:08.790
of his hair on top of his head.

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:13.540
In that clip Laurel got everyone's attention
before sharing Lin's work-in-progress, thus

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:18.529
maintaining group cohesion and prompting exchange
among participants.

00:59:18.529 --> 00:59:22.860
As time winds down, let participants know
how long they have left to work so they can

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:25.930
finish up before sharing with the group.

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:31.299
About 15 minutes before the end of your program
bring the art-making to a close and give participants

00:59:31.299 --> 00:59:36.369
a chance to present and discuss their works
with each other. This discussion allows for

00:59:36.369 --> 00:59:42.730
individual validation and strengthens connections
among participants.

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.289
Here's an example of Laurel initiating this
step:

00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:49.990
I know that some of you guys are still working,
and again we'll send you home with some of

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:55.410
the supplies so you can continue to work at
home if you like, but for now let's see what

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:59.910
everyone has made, okay?

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:04.369
In that clip you could see that Laurel expressed
enthusiasm at seeing participants' work and

01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:09.819
reassured everyone that they could continue
to work later on if need be.

01:00:09.819 --> 01:00:14.230
Go around to each participant and invite them
to present their work to the group, or ask

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:19.390
if you can share on their behalf. If a participant
is willing to share, ask them about their

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:23.760
process and/or the decisions they've made
and pull from conversations you had as they

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.839
were working.

01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.200
Let's take a look:

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.700
And then I want to show Marty's portrait of
Suzy.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.170
Surreal portrait of Suzy.

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.530
The surreal portrait of Suzy, is what Marty
said.

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:40.590
Oh, that's nice! Oh yeah!

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:46.920
So this is Marty's portrait of Suzy. So Marty,
what were some of the aspects of Suzy that

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.609
you wanted to capture, besides her hair?

01:00:51.609 --> 01:01:09.690
Her vibrancy, with the colors. And her openness,
through the length of the paper...and the

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:11.030
diversity.

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:20.740
The diversity. And then the.. vibrancy you
said also, with the choice of paper. It looks

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:26.819
like you did choose papers that had some sparkle
and had some bright colors, vivid colors.

01:01:26.819 --> 01:01:29.559
It's very vibrant.

01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:36.579
And I think the texture that you created also
plays into that. And Suzy, do you see a little

01:01:36.579 --> 01:01:39.751
bit of yourself in it?

01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:40.751
I'm very flattered.

01:01:40.751 --> 01:01:44.259
In that clip Laurel asked Marty to discuss
some of Suzy's particular characteristics

01:01:44.259 --> 01:01:48.720
that he wanted to capture or communicate,
linking them to his choice of paper and use

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.009
of texture.

01:01:50.009 --> 01:01:55.920
In addition, you can ask participant's to
title their work, and to provide some explanation

01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:01.190
for that title, in order to gain greater insight
into what they've made and why.

01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:07.789
Throughout, draw comparisons between participant
artworks. Find and comment on similarities

01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:12.900
or differences in how participants approach
your project components. You can facilitate

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.700
comparison by displaying the works together,
either by placing them on a table or adhering

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:22.859
them to the wall. This also allows participants
to see works made by those who may not want

01:02:22.859 --> 01:02:25.740
to share individually in front of the group.

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:30.700
Once you've finished discussing participant
work, bring your program to a close. Summarize

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:35.680
the experience and consider how participants
might continue with the ideas explored.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:40.670
Thank everyone for their time and participation.
Share final thoughts or observations from

01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:46.130
the session, as well as any logistical information,
such as ways of transporting artworks, or

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.099
information about future programs.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:55.130
If possible, display artworks in an exhibition.
This public forum allows for further validation

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:59.760
and extends the experience beyond the time
in the studios. It connects your work and

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.720
that of your participants to a broader audience.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.650
Display works in a quality fashion and be
intentional in your curation. Title your show

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:14.690
and provide an explanation of the ideas and
processes explored by participants, using

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:19.930
language that communicates the value and sincerity
of the work. If possible, hold an opening

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:24.220
reception for the show so that participants
can share their experience with family and

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:26.080
friends.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.869
In general, as you lead your art-making project,
keep the following in mind:

01:03:30.869 --> 01:03:34.880
Provide some initial structure but allow the
project to flow

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:40.490
Customize prompts, materials, and assistance
based on individual preference and ability,

01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.559
and
Encourage both individual and group exploration

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:48.581
By internalizing these ideas you will allow
participants to create original, personal

01:03:48.581 --> 01:03:52.480
works of art that are connected to broader
ideas in art and art history.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:58.630
ART MAKING
TIPS AND TOOLS

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:02.650
In this section, we'll go over general tips
and tools for successfully facilitating your

01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:08.009
art-making program. We'll first share with
you some practical tips for leading your program

01:04:08.009 --> 01:04:11.940
and then discuss some challenging scenarios
that may come up and ways you can address

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
them.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:18.130
So, let's begin with general facilitation
strategies. No matter the group you're working

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:23.180
with, it can sometimes be difficult to balance
the interests, abilities, and personalities

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:29.060
of each of the participants. We'll next discuss
some general facilitation techniques that

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:35.799
will help to foster an environment that encourages
individual creation and group cohesion:

01:04:35.799 --> 01:04:39.130
The first technique is to animate the experience,
yourself.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:44.240
Show your enthusiasm. Think of the experience
as an opportunity to be your most performative

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.920
self. But make sure your level of animation
does not come across as insincere.

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:55.960
Also, share personal information about yourself
in order to make participants feel more comfortable

01:04:55.960 --> 01:05:00.880
with you. Doing so makes the whole experience
feel less formal or intimidating.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:06.960
In the same vein, ask participants to respond
to the project by drawing on their own personal

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.009
experiences, when appropriate. Also, use what
you know about them as individuals to prompt

01:05:12.009 --> 01:05:14.539
or validate their process.

01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:15.539
Let's take a look at this:

01:05:15.539 --> 01:05:23.089
So I, you know, Carole and I were having trouble
coming up with what person to make but Carole

01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:30.910
was a teacher and loved kids, still loves
kids, so we decided on a baby. And do you

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:36.609
want to talk a little more about some of these
decisions, Carole? Carole, you mentioned that

01:05:36.609 --> 01:05:38.690
we were tearing all of this paperÃ

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:46.319
Yeah, I do like torn paper for something like
this.

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:48.299
I agree.

01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:52.490
In that clip, you saw Meryl sharing Carol's
motivation for choosing to create a portrait

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.220
of a child.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.799
As Carol and I were working I encouraged her
to draw on her own life experiences when trying

01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:03.579
to decide what kind of figure to create.

01:06:03.579 --> 01:06:07.829
Address participants by name and make eye
contact.

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:11.450
Don't be afraid to address people directly
-- use their name when you are working with

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:16.500
them or when you ask them to share their opinions
or ideas. Make eye contact in order to convey

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.319
sincere engagement.

01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:24.749
As you are facilitating your program, repeat
often. This includes repeating participant

01:06:24.749 --> 01:06:29.240
comments back to the whole group during your
group discussions, as well as reiterating

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:34.800
prompts and guidelines frequently, both to
the group as a whole and one-on-one. This

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.220
strategy ensures that those with short-term
memory loss or those with hearing difficulties

01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:41.609
are not at a disadvantage.

01:06:41.609 --> 01:06:46.030
Let's take a look at Laurel using this technique
during the artwork discussion:

01:06:46.030 --> 01:06:50.820
What's interesting also about the little pieces
of paper is that they're not smooth edges

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:56.710
on the paper, they're all kind of a little
bit uneven. They have a ripple effect or they're

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:03.339
serrated in some fashion, so that adds an
additional interest to this composition.

01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:08.650
Yeah, and I'm gonna repeat back what Lynne
said. She said it's interesting that the edges

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:13.920
of the little pieces of paper that are used
to construct this image aren't perfectly even,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:22.170
it's not like they're cut up little squares
or smooth. They're really rough, exactly.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:25.569
You can see that Laurel first told the group
she was going to repeat Lin's comment, and

01:07:25.569 --> 01:07:30.950
then did so, in order to ensure that everyone
heard and understood.

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:36.250
During your facilitation, try not to mention
materials, techniques, artists or artworks

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:41.200
that aren't immediately visible to participants.
If you want to bring something up that's not

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.410
visually available, try to find or create
a visual reference. Only reference that which

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:51.269
can be seen and understood by everyone, otherwise
you put those with short term memory loss

01:07:51.269 --> 01:07:56.789
or those newer to art-making at a disadvantage.

01:07:56.789 --> 01:08:03.599
As much as possible, try to invest quality
time with each individual as they are working.

01:08:03.599 --> 01:08:08.789
Pull up a chair so that you're at eye level.
Ask the participant about their artistic decisions,

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:13.880
give feedback or give them choices on how
to proceed. By sitting down with each participant

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.090
you communicate your interest in their work
and gain better understanding of their interests

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:24.130
and processes, which will play into the discussion
of participant artwork to come.

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:29.690
Though some people may need more assistance
than others, try to check in with everyone

01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:34.880
at some point. By divvying up your attention
in order to connect with each participant

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.549
you maintain an environment where everyone
is treated equally.

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:43.850
Encourage participants to experiment freely
and enjoy the process, even if that means

01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:49.120
deviating from the project parameters. Don't
over-direct or over-determine someone's art-making

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:53.100
process by forcing them to work in the ways
that you had anticipated.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.710
Right, it's a fine line between helpfully
assisting and making decisions for someone.

01:08:57.710 --> 01:09:03.320
In emphasizing process and encouraging experimentation,
you may get a wider range of final products,

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.529
but this is a good thing and you should embrace
it!

01:09:06.529 --> 01:09:11.069
When responding to participants' works, go
beyond saying that you quote "like it." Look

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:15.319
closely at the work and identify the choices
that the participant has made and validate

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:17.279
them specifically.

01:09:17.279 --> 01:09:22.609
General feedback, like "that's really nice"
can come off as superficial and patronizing.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:23.609
Let's take a look:

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:29.109
One thing that I really liked is that you
were sure to depict me here and now, and in

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:36.279
my exact same outfit even with the example
artworks in the background.

01:09:36.279 --> 01:09:45.369
The tilt of the head is so lifelike! It's
excellent, and the hairline...

01:09:45.369 --> 01:09:49.829
You can see that Laurel has not just generally
praised Ed's work, but found something specific

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:54.150
-- that he provided context for his portrait
by including the details of the room-- to

01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:59.070
comment on and draw others' attention to.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:04.300
Throughout the program, create opportunities
for exchange between participants. Remember,

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:09.449
while all participants work individually,
this is also a social experience.

01:10:09.449 --> 01:10:14.060
For example, encourage participants to look
at and comment on one another's work throughout

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:20.320
the program by holding up works in progress
for consideration. If some people finish early,

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:24.650
encourage them to walk around and observe
others. As participants finish, collect all

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:30.800
works in one place so group-members can easily
admire and compare them. Point out commonalities

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.219
during your discussion of participant works.

01:10:34.219 --> 01:10:37.590
Let's take a look at Laurel encouraging the
group to compare two works at the end of the

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:38.590
program:

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:45.080
I wanted to show these together because I
like how you both used minimal facial features

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:51.969
and created these facial expressions on both
of your figures. And I like these are all

01:10:51.969 --> 01:10:57.250
torn and cut and there's something kind of
soft and squishy about your baby, Carole,

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:04.250
and then for Ty's work all these angular features
of his nose, and his eyes, and his eyebrows.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:12.770
And the horns, how could I forget the horns!
He has a very satanic face.

01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:16.770
You can see that we held up both works so
as to draw attention to similarities and differences

01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:20.450
in the two participants' approaches.

01:11:20.450 --> 01:11:25.940
Throughout your program, maintain a degree
of lightness and humor. Remember, one of the

01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:31.540
goals is to create a fun experience where
participants are able to relax and enjoy themselves.

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:35.120
From the start and throughout, set a tone
that communicates these goals.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:40.110
There can be a level of insecurity or intimidation
that comes with art-making, especially if

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:45.320
it's new to some of your participants. Additionally,
the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease may create

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.500
moments of embarrassment. But by maintaining
a light and relaxed tone, any moments of awkwardness

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:54.521
or embarrassment will be minimized as you
move forward and stay focused on the project

01:11:54.521 --> 01:11:56.530
at hand.

01:11:56.530 --> 01:12:00.500
As with any audience, there are a number of
challenging scenarios that may come up as

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:05.900
you're facilitating your program. We'll next
go through a number of situations we've encountered

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.090
and suggestions for how to address them.

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:14.450
So the first one that we often experience,
no matter the group, is that participants

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:19.500
can be slow to get started in the art-making
process. It can be a challenge to switch gears

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:25.010
from conversation to creation. After you've
presented the materials and guidelines it

01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:30.280
is helpful to walk around the group and prompt
participants one-on-one. Sometimes participants

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.650
just need this additional cue to know that
it's time to get started.

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:39.790
If you notice that a participant is still
having trouble beginning their work ask if

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:44.340
they have the materials they need. Once they
do, re-demonstrate how to use them one on

01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:48.770
one. Speak to them at eye level to be sure
you are connecting.

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:54.670
If that doesn't work, start to make suggestions
for how to begin. So, for example with this

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:59.730
collage project, one of our participants was
slow to get started. After I re-iterated the

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:05.040
prompt and redemonstrated the materials, I
asked if I could work with her. We chatted

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.800
and it became clear that she was stuck on
deciding who to depict but she was sure she

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.659
wanted to create a bust, not a whole body.
So I suggested that regardless of who she

01:13:13.659 --> 01:13:17.060
ended up making, we'd need to start with a
head.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.790
She agreed and so I handed her some scissors
and offered her a range of flesh-tone paper.

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:28.219
I asked her to choose one of the papers and
to cut it into an oval. For her, this initial

01:13:28.219 --> 01:13:32.650
suggestionÃ¢ to make a head -- paired with
clear, concise instructions -- to cut the

01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:37.310
paper into an oval -- was enough and she took
off with the project on her own after that.

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:42.240
But if she had still not responded, I could
have cut or torn a number of shapes that resembled

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:48.030
eyes, noses or lips myself, and asked her
to make a selection and arrange them to her

01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:52.620
liking. Then, if she had still been hesitant,
I could have placed the first piece onto the

01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:56.449
paper for her, and encouraged her to build
her image from there.

01:13:56.449 --> 01:14:01.469
Right, if it comes to it, try making the first
mark or the first move with whatever material

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:07.420
it is you're using merely to break up the
intimidation of the blank surface. Personally

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:14.630
I even find it easier to work off of a preexisting
image or a mark than to start from nothing.

01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:18.570
Once you've made a suggestion as to how to
get started, move on and give your participant

01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:22.679
time to process the idea. Don't hover, but
check back later.

01:14:22.679 --> 01:14:28.110
Generally, if a participant is not taking
to the project, encourage collaboration and

01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:32.860
take a more active role -- offer to work with
the person or suggest that they work with

01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.480
some one else.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:39.310
Some participants may have difficulty using
your materials but there are a few things

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:42.380
that you can do to make them easier to work
with.

01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:47.630
First, take steps to ensure that participants
can see the materials clearly by increasing

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:52.469
the contrast between the table surface and
your materials. For example, don't use white

01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:55.850
paper on a white table.

01:14:55.850 --> 01:15:00.820
In general, be mindful of the size of your
materials. Very small items or utensils may

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:03.780
be difficult to see and/or hold.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.969
You may need to find ways to make the materials
easier to handle. For example, if you are

01:15:08.969 --> 01:15:12.840
working with clay you can warm it up with
your hands to make it softer or more malleable.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:18.340
Or if you are working with wire, have multiple
gauges on hand so participants can choose

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.500
the one they're able to bend most easily.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:26.920
Finally, encourage alternative ways to get
to the same end. For example, if participants

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.030
are having trouble with scissors, suggest
tearing or folding instead. It's easier and

01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:37.150
the end result is the same. Or, find ways
to assist with this step ahead of time. For

01:15:37.150 --> 01:15:42.800
instance, for our project, we pre-cut a variety
of paper.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:47.380
If those adjustments don't work, find a way
to help execute the creative choices of a

01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:52.670
participant more actively. For example, the
balsa foam we use for block printing workshops

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:56.840
can be difficult to carve for some. So, I
have had participants draw their work onto

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:00.960
the balsa foam and then I've gone through
after to deepen the lines, so as to ensure

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:03.340
a clear print.

01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:07.460
You may work with a participant whose physical
limitations make independently creating their

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:12.750
own work impossible. In that case you can
act as their proxy, prompting them to make

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:18.940
decisions and then executing those decisions
for them. For example with collage portraiture,

01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.920
you could ask the participant what color paper
they want for the various facial features,

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:27.190
then offer them a range of options in that
color, eventually cutting some options for

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:32.130
them to choose from in their selected hue.
You could then demonstrate possible arrangements

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:36.230
and ask which they prefer, and so on.

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:40.980
Don't make participants feel uncomfortable
about your assisting them. I even tell participants

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:45.250
that many contemporary artists today make
the creative decisions but have others carry

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:47.280
out the tasks.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.179
The aesthetic decisions are the most important
part of the art-making process. Focus on them

01:16:52.179 --> 01:16:56.020
and you'll highlight the participant's successes.

01:16:56.020 --> 01:17:00.330
Another scenario we've seen is when participants
do not create something within the framework

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:05.780
you've provided. In short, who cares? The
diversity of your participant artworks represents

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:11.560
the degree to which you've allowed each individual
to exercise their unique creative agency.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.139
Embrace these individual approaches and interpretations.

01:17:15.139 --> 01:17:18.969
While you provide structure and guidance,
participants may prefer to engage on their

01:17:18.969 --> 01:17:24.219
own terms and in their own way. If participants
deviate from the instructions, it's not a

01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:28.989
failure on their end, nor a failure of the
project or facilitator, but just an honest

01:17:28.989 --> 01:17:32.429
expression of that person's preferences.

01:17:32.429 --> 01:17:37.489
You may be tempted to try and re-route participants
toward the instructions you've outlined, but

01:17:37.489 --> 01:17:42.619
be wary of hindering someone's creative expression
-- we've seen good intention backfire, so

01:17:42.619 --> 01:17:47.989
to speak. Instead, focus on the process behind
their product. Try pointing out something

01:17:47.989 --> 01:17:52.420
about their work that is interesting to you,
and ask the participant about their aesthetic

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:57.140
choices, whether or not it's within the frame
of your project components. Encourage and

01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.510
validate, no matter the final product.

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:05.150
Interest and abilities within any given group
may vary, and balancing those needs can be

01:18:05.150 --> 01:18:10.010
challenging. One of the ways this most often
manifests is that some participants may finish

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:14.440
their project far before everyone else and
some don't finish at all within the allotted

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.920
time.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.540
Be sure to have extra materials on hand ahead
of time so that if someone finishes early,

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:26.469
you can encourage them to start a second work.
Add some sort of adaptation to the guidelines

01:18:26.469 --> 01:18:31.940
or make suggestions for how to do things differently
to keep the second endeavor fresh. For our

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:37.170
example, if a participant were to finish a
portrait of their husband's face, I might

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:42.969
then encourage them to start a new version,
but this time, depicting his whole body.

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:47.840
If participants are not interested in continuing
to work, suggest that they walk around and

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:52.630
look at other works or even assist you. No
matter what, encourage them to stay involved

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:54.760
in the group in some way.

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:59.610
Alternatively, if a participant does not finish
in time, be sure to include them in your group

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:04.739
discussion, sharing their piece as a "work
in progress." Send materials home with them

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:08.530
so that they may complete the work on their
own time.

01:19:08.530 --> 01:19:13.250
Of course these are only a handful of the
challenging situations you could encounter.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:16.790
Every time we teach there's a new challenge
and surprise and we're constantly learning

01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:20.720
and improving our practices as educators.

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.850
In sum, remember to

01:19:21.850 --> 01:19:26.869
Take the lead. You have the ability to inform
how participants engage through your approach

01:19:26.869 --> 01:19:32.630
and demeanor. If you remain relaxed and flexible,
if you're enjoying yourself, sincerely appreciating

01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:39.090
participant contributions, and setting a respectful
tone, then others will do the same.

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:44.570
Address and encourage each participant. Individualize
the art-making process by making adaptations

01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:50.780
freely, based on each person's needs or interests.
Moreover, encourage each individual participant

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:55.400
to interpret your guidelines as they please.
Show genuine interest in participants' ideas

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.070
and decisions.

01:19:58.070 --> 01:20:03.949
Foster connections between participants. Though
every participant may be working individually,

01:20:03.949 --> 01:20:08.860
this is still a social experience. Take advantage
of the fact that everyone's in the same room

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:14.380
together. Encourage participants to learn
from one another and enjoy each other's company.

01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.590
With these approaches in mind you'll be able
to facilitate your project in a way that minimizes

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:22.590
challenging moments and encourages varied
forms of creative engagement.
