00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.620
- [Narrator] Why Ronald Reagan's
presidency so significant?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.210
- Ronald Reagan plays an important role in

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.110
the modern presidency for
two big things that he did.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.950
One on the domestic front,
he broke considerably with

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.240
the kind of way of doing
things in Washington.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.320
He basically in response to the New Deal,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.650
Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.284
and the Great Society from Lyndon Johnson,

00:00:25.284 --> 00:00:28.160
President Reagan came in and said

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.670
no longer is government your
friend in American life.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.860
The government is actually the problem.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.571
This is the message of
his inaugural address.

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:40.780
And he broke with the idea
that the federal government

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.980
through the application of its resources,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.690
could help American life,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.570
which was a very stark ideological break

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.080
with the way the American
government had been going

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.610
since the mid 40s.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.220
And then on foreign policy,
his increased defense spending

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.520
and his very strong position
against the Soviet Union

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.610
coupled with a willingness
to actually negotiate

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.750
with the Soviet Union,
which got him a lot of grief

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.740
from conservatives in his party,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.830
that both hard line and
ability to negotiate

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.423
helped usher in the end of the Cold War.
