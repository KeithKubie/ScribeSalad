[inaudible]

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.670
<v 1>one of the concepts,</v>

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:12.090
one of the strategies that I'm most commonly asked about from the four hour

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.090
workweek is batching.
There are many,
many,

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:20.091
many finer points to this and quite aside from of course 80 20 delegating,

6
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.200
outsourcing,
Parkinson's law,
batching comes up again and again and again.

7
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.560
So what does batching to explain it in simplest terms,

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.110
we can talk about laundry.
All right,

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:36.000
so you wouldn't do your laundry every time you have a new pair of dirty socks,

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.830
you wait for a certain critical mass of dirty laundry to accumulate and then you

11
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.670
do the laundry.
Why?
Same with post office.

12
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660
If you have many different types of mail,
they're going to come together,

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.211
you need to mail,

14
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.550
you're going to wait for a certain critical mass as opposed to just going there

15
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.900
for every single letter because there's a setup cost.
There is a task,

16
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:57.840
switching costs,
getting in the car,
driving there,
spending the gas,

17
00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:02.070
spending the time,
laundry,
putting it all together,
detergent and so on.
Right?

18
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:07.071
So the the time and labor involved and doing one letter or 20 or one pair of

19
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:12.711
socks or entire basket of clothing is the same and you want to be both effective

20
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.470
and efficient with your allocation of resources.

21
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.910
I each time if you apply those to business you can apply them in 1,000,001

22
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:23.520
different ways and I'll give you a few examples.

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
One of the most common I suppose directional questions or specifics that I'm

24
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.840
asked about is frequency.
While do I batch on a daily basis?

25
00:01:33.841 --> 00:01:38.310
Do I batch on a weekly basis to I batch on a monthly or quarterly basis and the

26
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:38.760
answers?

27
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.050
I do all of those things but you don't have to try it all at once and I would

28
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:44.730
not encourage you do that.

29
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.120
I would encourage you to perhaps try one or two approaches and see what works

30
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.110
for you.
This is a very personal set of techniques.

31
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.240
You develop a portfolio that works for yourself.

32
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.470
Let me tell you a few things that I and others do.
For instance,

33
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.640
you might decide that on a given day from the time you wake up until lunch is

34
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.750
your primary creation period.
This could be writing,
it could be recording,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.910
could be anything that is proactively creative and synthesis.

36
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.010
Then once you have lunch you are permitted to do administrative tasks,

37
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.870
phone calls,
email triage,
calendaring and so on.
I do this quite a lot,

38
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.070
particularly from Tuesday to Thursday,
uh,

39
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:31.680
on certain ways on a weekly basis.

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.320
I know the CEO of a very well known startup,

41
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.730
pretty much everyone watching this would know this company and instead of

42
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:43.350
batching on a daily basis looking at his week,
Monday to Friday,

43
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.940
he might have day one administrative tasks,
day to HR,

44
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.590
hiring,
day,
three,

45
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:54.591
product day for marketing and on each of those days he will focus on

46
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.970
thematically are categorically those types of tasks that is yet another

47
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.804
approach.

48
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.990
And very commonly I will batch phone calls on Mondays and Fridays and I was even

49
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.350
broadly speaking,
this is voice related tasks.

50
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
So I will have phone calls and podcast recording on Mondays and Fridays and this

51
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:25.360
helps to prevent also interruptions and task switching.

52
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.830
That can result.

53
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.090
If you have miscellaneous phone calls and podcasts scattered throughout the
week,

54
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.900
it makes it very difficult to do deep work on anything that might require three

55
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:39.220
to five hours of uninterrupted time on a,
on a quarterly basis.
Uh,

56
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.550
you could look at batch producing or completing certain types of normally

57
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.380
scattered activities.
For instance,

58
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.860
I am recording this video right now during a content generation week or a week

59
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:58.741
is blocked out once per quarter to focus on answering common questions that all

60
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.901
of you or my readers or listeners have asked and so on and so forth on a say six

61
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:07.240
month to yearly basis.

62
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.760
I have started in the last few years batching travel.
Why would I batch travel?

63
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.590
And there are many different reasons to vegetable.

64
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
One of my reasons is that I want to practice being off the grid for extended

65
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:25.291
periods of time to not only remind myself and prove to myself that it is

66
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:28.390
possible to do that and know the Internet will not stop.

67
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.080
The universe will not end if you are unavailable and unreachable for certain

68
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:36.910
periods of time.
Uh,
and also to rejuvenate,
to recharge,

69
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.540
being away from social media and keyboards and laptop screens and so on.

70
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.190
Batching is one of the fundamental concepts that you need to understand.

71
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.810
If you understand the principle,
the reasons for it,
the concepts,

72
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.460
you can come up with your own examples to experiment with and these are not

73
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:57.400
permanent changes.
Think of them as two week experiments.

74
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.560
One tiny thing that you can test,

75
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.960
assuming that it's on a daily or weekly basis and try it out.
See what works,

76
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.011
keep what works,

77
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.410
reject what doesn't add what is uniquely need on borrowing from personally.

78
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.720
With that,
and before you know it,
you will have a reliable,

79
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:17.170
dependable way of making yourself more effective and more efficient,

80
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.370
which is your bespoke iteration of batching.
