00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.969
My name is Kristen 'Krispy' Uccello.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.145
I am a developer advocate for Google
with our strategic games partners.

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:10.960
And what that means is I work
in an engineering capacity

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.000
with these partners to help overcome
any issues they have while bringing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.210
their technology to Google Play or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.310
integrating Google technologies
into whatever they've built.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400
I am a serial entrepreneur.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.600
I've started and bootstrapped several
dozen companies over my life,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.340
and have learned a lot of
lessons in those years.
