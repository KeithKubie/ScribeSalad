00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.350
It can be easy to imagine we possess reasonable
social skills, because we know how to maintain

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.650
a conversation with strangers and – every
now and then – manage to make a whole table

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.140
laugh. But there’s a test far sterner than
this, surprising in its ability to trip us

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.519
up: the challenge of having a pleasant time
with a child we don’t know. Theoretically

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.599
speaking, this should be so easy. We were
all once kids. We know a great deal more than

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.330
they do and – as far as they’re concerned
– hold all the cards: if we felt like it,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.340
we could buy 26 packets of biscuits and go
to bed whenever we wanted. Yet, in reality,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.650
it’s strangely hard to be at ease around
children we’re not already close to. Imagine

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.839
being invited around to your boss’s house
for lunch and being left alone at the kitchen

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.870
island with her moody ten-year-old son; or
being introduced into a playroom with two

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.610
shy five-year-old girls, the children of a
friend. We may swiftly grow bewilderingly

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.049
tongue-tied and inept. The reason is that
children are unable to do any of the normal

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.990
things that ease social encounters between
adult strangers. They don’t ask polite questions

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.789
about what we’ve been up to. They have no
feeling for our lives or what might be important

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.499
to us. They don’t do the news or the weather.
And they can’t usually tell us much about

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:27.700
themselves and their enthusiasms. If we ask
them why they like a toy or a film, they tend

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.060
to look blank and say they just like it, that’s
all. So for all their sweetness, children

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.200
present formidable and fascinating barriers
to social fluidity – which is also why they

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.460
are the greatest tests of one’s mastery
of the arts of charm and kindness. We have

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.359
– across cultural history – a few moving
examples of accomplished adults getting on

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:54.189
well with children. Montaigne remarked that
he found ‘nothing more notable’ in the

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.020
life of Socrates (the man who more or less
began Western philosophy) than that he was

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.979
exceptionally gifted at playing with children
– and would, especially in his later years,

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.690
spent many hours playing games and giving
them piggy-backs. ‘And it suited him well,’

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.970
added Montaigne, ‘for all actions, says
philosophy, equally become and equally honor

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.650
a wise man.’ Henri IV, King of France from
1589 to 1610 is remembered as one of the most

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.080
benign French monarchs who also happened to
be very sweet around children. On one occasion,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.140
famously painted by Ingres, the Spanish Ambassador
came to see the king and found him pretending

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.960
to be a horse for his children to ride on.
Rather than interrupt the game immediately,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.470
Henri kept the Ambassador waiting a little
while, sending out a strong signal of where

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.280
he felt sensible adult priorities should sometimes
lie. What’s touching in these cases is that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.070
the adults did not insist on using their obvious,
socially-endorsed strengths around children.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.100
Socrates did not opt to deliver lectures about
metaphysics, Henri IV did not sit impassively

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.620
on a throne discussing how to rule a kingdom.
They put aside their well-known virtues and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.620
prestige in order to make themselves vulnerable
– as one must whenever friendship is at

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.950
stake. They dared to lay themselves open to
attack by those who might have described them

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.820
as ‘silly’ or ‘undignified’, implicitly
understanding that friendship can only emerge

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.360
when we let the fragile, unadorned parts of
us meet – without artifice – the fragile,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.730
unadorned parts of others. Furthermore, these
two grand men knew how to find common ground

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.560
with creatures who were, in so many respects,
entirely alien to them. Cosmopolitans of the

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.930
mind, they imaginatively searched for what
unites rather than what divides people and

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.020
were able to locate, somewhere within their
characters, the joys and excitements of someone

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.810
who has only been on the earth a few years.
The socially-adept know that we contain (even

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.850
if only in trace, embryonic forms) all human
possibilities within us, which they draw upon

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.320
to feel their way into the needs and points
of view of strangers. So even if they happen

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.650
to be confident, they will know how to be
in touch with the more timid version of themselves;

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.949
even if they are the financially secure, they
can mobilise their own experience of anxiety

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.509
to enter into the inner world of someone beset
by money worries; and even if their careers

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.050
have not gone well, they can, without bitterness,
find a part of themselves that would love

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.250
to prosper and use this to engage warmly with
someone whose professional life has gone very

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.599
well indeed. The moves that these grand people
made with kids are ones we should all learn

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:43.580
how to make with anyone, of whatever age,
we want to bond with. But it’s particularly

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.729
useful that these were grand people who made
neighing sounds, for what so often holds us

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.940
back around others, and makes us cold when
we deep down long to be close, is a fear of

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.699
a loss of dignity. Friendship begins, and
loneliness can end, when we cease trying to

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.289
impress, have the courage to step outside
our safety zones and can dare – for a time

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.680
– to look a little ridiculous.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.720
Did you know that The School Of Life is actually a place?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.280
10 places in fact, campus' all over the world from Melbourne to London, Taipei to Istanbul,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.000
with classes and books and lots more.
