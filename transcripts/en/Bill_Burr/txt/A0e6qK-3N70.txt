Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burn and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 2:          00:00:07       ahhh

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       just checking in on you. Just checking in on you, seeing how your week's going. How's your week going on? Did you have fucking team? Have another championship parade like minded. Well, you know what? I wish it did. Why the fuck should my town have all the Goddamn success? You know, it's fucking unbelievable. I still can't believe you won that fucking game, but I'm not going to go

Speaker 3:          00:00:31       on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       about it. Um, I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina came in a day before the comedy zone Gig. I went to the a shallot hornets versus the Brooklyn Nets, you know, and when you try to go to a home game, sorry, I'm going to, um, I don't have my fucking microphone, so I'm just recording. Right. If my laptops are, anytime I click on something, it might be God damn issue. Um, but, uh, when you're trying to do what it is that I've been doing, which is to basically go to all of the, uh, to go to a home game of every fucking team and all four major sports, every once in a while you got to go to a game. It's not the best game. You've got to go see a couple of franchises that even though they, they've had their moments, this is not their time. They are, they're currently re rebuilding.

Speaker 2:          00:01:18       And that's what, that's what happened when we saw the Charlotte Hornets play the Brooklyn Nets. Um, a couple nights ago, Jesus Christ, it was, it was just like it was, I don't know. I don't know what it wants. It was like a fucking WWE NBA game. WNB A at its worst in the first couple of seasons, you know, they, they just didn't look good. I mean, they look way better now, the fundamentals and all that, if he's watch any of the WNB. But those first few years, I couldn't understand why it looks so bad cause women's college basketball look better in a w NBA. But Jesus Christ Charlotte Verse Brooklyn, Geesh, that I say that enough time, oh this is how fucking boring that game was. The kids that played at halftime was fucking more exciting cause they will run in the court. Big smiles on their faces was fucking hilarious. That game was like something like, you know, 16 to 14. And it was all layups. It was just all fucking run in the court. Layups was tremendous. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:02:19       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:02:19       But anyways, last night, uh, we went to um, yeah, we worked the comedy zone and uh, I did, the smartest thing I've ever done on the road in a long time was when the show was over. I just went home and I went to fucking bed. Um, because the Charlotte Brooklyn night, you know, I had a couple of pops about 17, and uh, the next day woke up. I'm like, what the, what am I doing? What, what the fuck am I doing? Okay, I've got a newborn at home. I can't get any goddamn sleep. I'm on the road now. I should be like, like a fucking sober as a church mouse and just go right to bed. And that's what I did last night. Fucking phenomenal. Other than God damn fucking cleaning ladies coming by every 10 minutes. Yeah, they didn't, they, this place I'm staying in doesn't have the fuck off side.

Speaker 2:          00:03:10       Um, so they just keep coming. Housekeeping 11, they fucking knock, right housekeeping and then immediately open the Goddamn door. There's that. There's the lost art of knocking on a door, waiting for a response and then coming in somewhere along the line. These goddamned kids today. Oh yeah, I just said that these goddamn kids, they think the fact they just knocked that they can just means they can then enter the room. You knock, you wait for somebody to say, you know, hang on a second, or blah blah, blah, blah, blah. You don't just knock on a fucking door and walk in. You've got to give the person a chance, you know, put the dick away or something, you know? Well, who knows what they're doing. Maybe they're just sitting there in their underwear, right? I don't fucking know. She fucking knock and you wait and then you went, sorry, just saying it fucking can't stand. That's one of my pet peeves annoys people who knock and then they just fucking walking, um, that shit. Or if you know, when you go into to a parking spot, you know with two cars could fit and you just stick your fucking cunt car right in the middle of both. So no one can fit. Two cars can fit anymore unless you drive in a smart car. Um, so anyways, tonight you probably think Jesus bill have to uh, that patriots Superbowl. How could your sport,

Speaker 1:          00:04:34       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:04:35       I could just sportsworld get any better. You don't, I mean we'll after a major dip I believe on Monday, which I think they did on purpose cause the Bruins had a little gap in their schedule with all the buzz about do we give the patriots excuse, we have yard care be a good time to get rid of a Clo Julian and a, I just want to thank coach Juliette for, uh, being the best Bruins coach since I've been watching them. Um, for the last, you know, close to 40 years. Um, Jesus [inaudible] everybody adversely, I'm doing my podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:18       All right. Let me, let me in an hour. You think or no? Uh, there's just the Thursday one. I'll be done in like a half hour. All right, cool. And then if you want to talk, Hey Paul, you go eat those eggs and then I'll meet you first steam.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:05:33       All right. We got breakfast coming in like 20, and when it's done I'll call you. Okay. All right buddy. Okay, pal. Okay. Alright, cutie. Anyways, um, the fuck don't fuck was I talking about? Um, yeah. Hello Julian. Jesus Christ. I'd never seen a guy more of a victim of the GM and for the, I do not that fucking move whatsoever. You know, I guess maybe if he had fallen out with the people up top, I have no idea. But, um, how you just gonna blame it on him and not get rid of your fucking GM. I don't know what they see in this. Our GM, I have no fucking idea. I don't know. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:06:19       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:20       I have no idea what this guy is doing. I mean, he got rid of everybody and I just didn't, I don't see that way. We actually, we're playing our best hockey of the year. I felt, yeah, we won three in a row. Lost a tough one of the fucking capital's not a tough one. They actually kicked our ass five to two. But I mean what the fuck did the capitals, we didn't do bad for a seventh seed. I don't know. I think it's a dumb move. You get rid of the guys like okay, you want to get rid of the guy? Who are you gonna replace them with? WHO's out there, you know, and actually tweeted congratulations to every year, every other NHL team out there that needs a fucking coach that knows how to win a cup. Um, cause that's what we just dumped.

Speaker 4:          00:06:58       Um, I dunno,

Speaker 2:          00:07:01       I dunno. I don't know to get the shit that stuff where the ownership gives into the fan base. It's like, what are they listening to? The fucking dopes that call into sports talk radio. I've never called in a sports talk. I'd watch sports all the fucking time. I would never call it a sports talk radio show, you know, just specifically to talk about the sports thing. I mean, I'll call in and the hyper show, you know, who wore myself out. Oh, I would absolutely do that. Oh, speaking of worn myself out. Um, well wait, wait, wait, wait. Let me get back. So, uh, thank you Clo, Julian and uh, for bringing us the Stanley Cup and uh, and in a, you know, 40 year drought, um, and continued success wherever you go. I know you're gonna do great wherever you go. Hopefully you've got a better GM at the next place you go to.

Speaker 2:          00:07:52       Um, so anyways, um, after all my ranting and raving about, uh, award shows, I think I might be a presenter at one old Hollywood bill is the writers guild awards. And um, they asked me to be a presenter or whatever. And at first I was like, then I'm not going to go down and do that fucking bullshit. But then, you know what, I'm actually, I guess often enough or selling out, depends on how you look at it. But what I realize is that on our show, um, it's those awards shows are a big deal for, uh, for the writers because that's how they actually get money. So if you win an an Emmy, um, or a writers guild or a sag thing or whatever, it's great for the writers in the writers room cause they can say that they wrote on an Emmy award winning show and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker 2:          00:08:47       So old freckles has to play the game a little bit. Um, go put it on a God damn monkey suit to fucking black tie thing. I got to go, I'm going to go to one of those fucking from places where they have the cheap tuxedos cause I don't think anybody can fucking tell, just come out in those God damn plastic bowling shoes. Um, I don't know who the fuck decided that they wanted me to be a fucking presenter, but like, if they've never, they've obviously never listened to me read out loud on a, on my podcast. But, uh, I don't know. I figured this would be a good one to try out to see what I think about it because a, it's not televised, you know? And um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:31       I don't know if we'll see if I can actually read out loud. I don't know if knee has been on me about this shit. You gotta do it. You gotta play the game. Alright, I'm playing the bucket game. Why make a fucking difficult business even more? God damn difficult. I'm like fuck it. I'll give it a two. I'll let you guys know how that goes. How my reading out loud, if that's in fact what they have. Me Too. But it's not bad. It's only like two hours long. Um, so it Kinda seems like the best one to go to and Patton Oswald is hosting it and I think he's a fucking genius, so at least I'll get to listen to his monologue. Um, but I am without a doubt. I am going to get the fuck. I'm going to get a nice fucking, I'm going to get a senior prom special, the clip on fucking tie and all of that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:10:18       That's like the dumbest shit ever to go out and go buy some expensive Tuxedo. It's like, what are you a fucking Rockefeller? Uh, but I guess people trash you then, right when you watch walk the red carpet or something like that. Um, so anyways, so there you go. This my fully shit moment I have to make in front of all those fucking awards shows. Uh, I'm actually gonna walk, go to one. I don't know. What are you going to do the fuck am I going to do right? I'm doing it for the tape. Okay. Can I get out of it by saying that? So anyways, I was saying, um, how my, um, my, uh, my sporting world, how it could get any better after the, uh, the Patriots win and then the, uh, the, the let down of seeing them given to the fan pressure or whatever the fuck they did.

Speaker 2:          00:11:05       Getting rid of coach Julian, um, tonight, me for Z and a Joe Barnick or doing a bucket list thing for any person that's even remotely into sports. We're going to the, uh, the Duke versus a North Carolina Tarheels game tonight. And we've got some great seats, was sitting right behind the f the fucking Duke Bench coach k's going to be there. If it wasn't so God damn loud in that place, we could hear him, you know, during the timeouts and everything, it's going to be crazy. So, uh, I don't know. It was a chance you might see the three, three of us dummies on TV. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:11:46       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:46       But beyond excited to go to this like this is, there's a fucking huge one. This is a huge one. Um, as far as the bucket list, sports stuff to go to, uh, years ago I told you, I don't know if I told you guys I went to the, um, I went to uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       Indiana university versus, um, what was it? Michigan state and I believe it was a year that Michigan State won the National Championship and Bobby Knight was still coaching there. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:15       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:16       I've never seen anything like that. All the years, everything I've ever, every sporting event I've ever gone to, I have never seen anything like watching Bobby Knight coach a game. I mean that guy, you watched him more than as much, if not more than you were watching the game. I was actually rooting for the Spartans. You know, I came there rooting for Indiana, but Bobby was so fucking entertaining. I started rooting for the Spartans because I wanted to see him flip out even more. I've never seen somebody with, yeah, she made me feel good about myself. Like just complete loss of composure obviously or whatever his coaching style motivating people. I remember they let up a couple of easy buckets in this kid. The point guard starts bringing it up the court and Bobby Knight is like 10 feet onto the court and he's yelling so much.

Speaker 2:          00:13:09       He's like, do you have a c a was it Ben Kingsley and sexy bass? When he, when he's, when he's yelling and being a right content and he's like throwing his head into everything that he's saying. That's what the fuck he was doing. But it was way more intense cause he wasn't acting. He was serious. And um, I've never fucking seen anything like that. And that's one of my favorite of everything that I've seen in sports. The coolest thing ever is that I got to see Bobby Knight Coach at Indiana University. Matt's fucking legendary like scenes Zeplin we're seeing the Beatles, you know, James Brown or whatever, like, you know, that's right up there. I saw Eddie Murphy on the raw tour. I saw Eddie Wee. These might think greatest things I've seen. I've seen Eddie Murphy on the raw tour. I said when he went the purple suit, I saw Bobby Knight, coach Indiana.

Speaker 4:          00:14:05       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:14:07       the fuck did I go from there? So Judas Priest and the Turbo Lover Tour, does that count?

Speaker 5:          00:14:14       I know I saw Stevie Ray Vaughn.

Speaker 4:          00:14:18       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:20       I saw Dan Marino kicked the shit out of the Patriots,

Speaker 4:          00:14:24       um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:25       with Don Shula coaching as someone. Great. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:14:28       Thinking about being an old guy as you can start talking about all this shit since like, nope, that now fucking no longer exists. So I actually made a, a few guys who just bear with me clicking here, sorry. And let's fucking loud as hell. I know it's annoying and you're going to listen to it again. Right now. All right. I actually looked through, um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       I got this, this document teams scene

Speaker 5:          00:14:52       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:14:54       I have seen 31.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:14:58       I've been to a home game if every major league baseball team, I haven't been to all the stadiums cause like the mets changed. There's got a new one. Philly's got a new one. Um, but I've seen a total of 31. There's 30 professional baseball teams. I've seen 31 cause I went to the expos. Um, I've seen 32 home games of the NFL. There's 32 teams, but I still need to see the Tampa Bay Buccaneers there. The last one I need to see, but I saw the St Louis and the fucking, um, the Saint Louis and the fucking, uh, La Ramps. So that's how I got up to 32. I've seen 25 NBA teams. Uh, one of those being the a, I saw both the Seattle Sonics.

Speaker 1:          00:15:44       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:15:44       And the, uh, Oklahoma City Thunder. Um, and I saw the New Jersey Nets and I got to go see the fucking Brooklyn that's speaking of which I also saw the fucking, oh, did I see the fucking the islanders at Nassau Coliseum. Now, if they don't, if they don't become the Brooklyn

Speaker 5:          00:16:07       fucking islanders than a, that I don't need to go see him. It's like if you change your foot, it's still in New York. You know what I mean? I don't need to fucking do that. So I've seen 27 of the 30 fucking, uh, I got three more to see in, um, in hockey. So I'm going to try to knock those out over the next year. The Fan Slam is what I'm calling it, you know, you know, Serena's fucking the Serena slim. This is just the fan slam. The fucking, you know, you have no life. You run the fucking road, you don't want to kill yourself in a comedy Condo, so you start building it around home games. Um, I actually made a list and I don't know if you're not a sports fan, this is going to bore the shit out of you. But these are all the fucking places I've been to that now no longer exist. Uh, the Boston Garden, Sullivan Stadium, a Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium, Veterans Stadium, three rivers stadium, soon to be no longer there. Joe Louis Arena, the RCA slash Hoosier dome. I saw Peyton manning there. Uh, I saw a game at original soldier field, got a picture and then this fucking asshole stole my goddamn camera. I was, had a picture of me and uh, when I went to, um, uh, green bay packers, that game was a, um,

Speaker 5:          00:17:23       it was a preseason game. They played the browns bred fabric was still there. Verse he says, I can't count that one because it's preseason. But the reality is, is you just wants me to book, you know, book a Gig at like the skyline cafe and go to a packers game, which of course I will, I'll do. Alright. Continuing on county stadium to the target center, the Metrodome, the Edward Jones Dome, which is still there, but the St Louis Rams don't play there anymore. Texas stadium, the Astrodome mcnichols Arena Mile High Stadium, Sun Devil Stadium. That still exists. But I saw the Arizona cardinals versus the Patriots there. Qualcomm stadium still exist, but the fucking charges aren't there anymore. Uh, I also saw that the, um, San Diego Padres there and I went there with and watch Mark McGuire take batting practice the year. Uh, he broke Roger Maris his record and I saw him hit number 27 to 28 there, uh, Addison field before they redid it.

Speaker 5:          00:18:20       Um, La, the La sports arena that's still there, but I saw, um, who did I see there? I saw the clip was there. I saw the clippers there and biggie smalls was in the crowd and four days later he was dead. Swear to God. Uh, the La Forum. Um, I saw fucking a young Koby Bryant and just left the, uh, magic shack with del Harris as a coach. I want to say Dennis Rodman was on that team. I went to candlestick park, sat out in right field and saw a, a early on head getting bigger Barry bonds, key arena for a Seattle Supersonics game with a rookie year cad, Kevin Duran, and then, uh, the kingdom. I saw a young Ken Griffey Jr I sat right out in center field, a bleachers. And as far as I know, oh, and you know what else? The, uh, the Montreal forum, I can't believe I forgot that I saw the [inaudible] 1989 I went up there in March and I saw I, uh, Canadians versus the fucking Minnesota North Stars with Patrick won that.

Speaker 4:          00:19:32       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:19:32       I of course, rooted for the North Stars and they of course lost. Um, so whatever that that's the dumb bullshit that I do when I'm out here on the road. And now I can add the after tonight, do Carolina and, uh, I want to thank the comedy zone for hooking us up,

Speaker 4:          00:19:49       um,

Speaker 5:          00:19:50       with some sort of Duke booster that gave us those tickets. And I was surprised the person came to the game. I came to the game, came to the show last night and left without saying hello, which was, it's like at least go to thank the guy. So if he's listening or she's listening, whatever the fuck it is, it got me the tickets. Thank you so much.

Speaker 1:          00:27:44       All right, let's stop.

Speaker 5:          00:27:48       That's Delta, Sierra, tango, Lima, Delta. All right, let's get back to the tone for the page here and finish this out.

Speaker 4:          00:27:55       Um, all right.

Speaker 5:          00:27:58       Is that been a half an hour? I have no idea. I never know whenever I'm fucking recording on just the garage band thing here. So A, we're going to go to the game here tonight. Um, I can't believe I'm going to see them be this close to fucking coach k. I know Duke's having a tough time this year, but coach k's back from back surgery and um, he did that thing where he, uh, I guess every once in a while I get so disgusted with his team. He doesn't let them wear any Duke gear and he won't let them in the locker room until they start playing at a fucking level that the university has used to see you gotta Love That Old School coaching that made me look up like 'em.

Speaker 1:          00:28:40       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:28:40       You know, I was looking up all this stuff on coach k and I didn't realize that when he was at army, he played for Bobby Knight. I didn't know that he assisted with Bobby Knight and all and there's all these great fucking pictures. He got to see the way Bobby Knight is dressed in 1979 in Puerto Rico when he's at the Pan Am games. Of course he ended up getting arrested because he allegedly slapped a cop or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:29:03       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:04       You want to talk about a guy that needs to fucking meditate? Jesus Christ. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:10       So anyways, uh, I was watching all this stuff where's coach sent me down this rabbit hole of Bobby Knight stuff

Speaker 4:          00:29:17       and um, you know,

Speaker 5:          00:29:21       my favorite clip of all the Bobby Knight ones was when somebody secretly recorded them cause I feel like that was the real Bobby night cause I thought towards the end he kind of was, was doing the Bobby Knight thing. Like when he did that game face thing, I think at that point he was just, he started like hamming it up when he didn't need to. But like when you listen to that one where he's talking about the Purdue game coming up and that he has an eight and 10 record, um, I swear to God, I'm going to start listening to that speech before I go to the gym because I actually listened to that thing and he's talking about how he had to go to some function and he goes, and I'm sitting there, I'm tired of sit down with a fucking eight and 10 record. Everybody fucking look sick. Second fucking time. Hello. Is it a fucking per, do you guys get the fuck out there? Send somebody if you fucking lose to Purdue, he put me in that fucking position. I will fucking run you something until you, I don't know, something about puking or whatever. It's, it's just such a great speech. And then the end of it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:30:22       my natural reaction, I laughed and just said, that's how it's done. And a, I know we got a lot of criticism for the stuff that he did, but um, I think a lot of that criticism came from people that, um, are not athletic. We're never in a locker room. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:30:42       you know, they came from that whole, they, they actually had bad experiences in sports and listening to Bobby Knight Yell I think just brought all their sucking in gym class memories back and um, I dunno, it's like there's this certain type of person that is a fucking athlete and can handle that and understands what the fuck that is. And uh, I think if they don't have a problem with it, all these people who don't play sports should just shut the fuck up about it cause you don't understand what's going on. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:31:16       okay.

Speaker 5:          00:31:16       I mean, Jesus Christ, Bobby Knight won almost a thousand fucking games and all his former players for the most part love them. And um, and I always felt that kid, that last fucking incident that Bobby Knight had, um, I thought that felt that kid was baiting him cause Bobby Knight walked by and I think the kid said, what's up night? You don't say that. That's totally disrespectful and night just said that, that fucking tempers zero to fucking 9,000. Um, but I remember when I heard that story, like that kid was being a fucking cunt. Um, but you can't do that shit anymore. At least during his heyday, there was no cell phone cameras, man. He really would've gotten a lot of trouble because they would have been fucking video of that. And I would've loved every second. I would have loved every second of watching him grab some student by the fucking throat who just, what's up night guys walking around.

Speaker 5:          00:32:09       900 fucking wins. Some sophomore comes by. That's come on. Um, so anyways, yeah. So we're going to be hitting that game tonight. Um, if anybody knows, uh, oh, by the way, I have to give a shout out man. I went to a, um, this is my new thing now when I'm on the road, you know, cause I got my beautiful little daughter up at home and I can't play drums as much, you know, uh, Nia still lets me rehearse and stuff like that, you know, not rehearse, like practice and shit when, uh, what I'm homeless

Speaker 1:          00:32:40       to pick the kids up. But, um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       I haven't been able to go to a, a, you know, the practice place that I go to out in La as much as I would like. So I'm like, why am I on the road out or look up these rehearsal spaces? So I looked up this place when I was in Charlotte. It's called the playground and yeah. Um, I went down. Yeah man, shout out to Eddie Z who runs it. Totally fucking one of the coolest dudes I've met. A lot of these rehearsal spaces are just absolute shit. The drum kits are old. Everything's fucked up. Everything sounds like shit. I went into this place, this place was like a fucking first-class place. He stuck me in the best room that they had a, at a discount price cause they were doing construction on some other rooms that he didn't want them, you know, disturb me or whatever while I was playing, I played for like fucking three hours. Well, I paid for three hours long to get to about, you know, two hours and 20 minutes. And my body was like giving out on me and I just had the best fucking time. And you know what I love when I went in there, the snare gun was tuned too low and I was able to tune it up to sound pretty good. And I used to not even remotely have a game plan on how to tune up a snare. And, um, I was really psyched about that. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:33:57       thanks. [inaudible]. Anyways, um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:01       this guy, Eddie z was saying he, he actually, uh, used to be a roadie for van Halen and he was on the 1984 tour, the last phone with David Lee rough. And, uh, then he did a couple with Sammy Hagar. So he had all these fucking really cool pictures, just originals that he took of like Sammy and, uh, Eddie van Halen and Dave Lee Roth was really fucking cool and, uh, I had the best time and like, that's gonna be on. So what I'm gonna do when I'm on the road, now that I'm on back building up the hour, work in the comedy clubs like the old days, uh, at such a great time. Last night on stage a comedy zone. Do Comedy Zone is one of the best fucking comedy clubs out there. By the way, if you can find the God damn thing, you got to, he walk in and there's like a cafeteria, then a bar and there's, there's a sign that says comedy zone and nobody tells you.

Speaker 2:          00:34:55       You got to like ask like 20 people. It's like you feel your way through the dark. Did finally go down those stairs to go down there. But just the hallway, this, the stage is set up. Um, it seems like every seat in the house is a good seat. Um, you know, for, I mean obviously I've never sat in the crowd out there, but uh, just had the best time working the shit out. I did two shows, both shows I was able to do a little over an hour just pasting together new ideas that I have and then old bits that, you know, never made it on to specials. And I'm just thought out this is, this is, you wouldn't think so this is one of my favorite times of doing stand up is just letting everything else go and just trying to figure out like what the new shit's going to be. You know, I'm reading newspapers, I'm bright and shit down. Anything that I can throw against the wall. Last night I was on stage talking about how fucking human beings are edible. Like and everyone was like, what the fuck? And that'd be something that I would abandoned but I had no material and I just kept going with it. And um,

Speaker 6:          00:35:56       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:57       I dunno, it just takes me back to my early days. Um, I was stand up when uh, because your skills, like if you don't have the material, it just complete your skills completely diminished even though you have the poise and the, the skill set because you've been doing it that long, but it's just completed. Just imagine a band if they had to like just work workshop, some rifts in front of a fucking crowd without like rehearse. And that's the greatest thing about the art of stand up comedy is that you can't, you can't go to a rehearsal space and get this shit together and then fucking like you have to second. You like coming up with riffs and front of the fucking crowd. Um, and it's, uh, yeah, it's fucking work. It's absolute work. But, um, I don't know. I'm a fucking lunatic, so I totally enjoy this part of it.

Speaker 2:          00:36:52       So anyways, that is the podcast. Uh, once again, thanks to whoever it is that owns these two seats, um, whoever that is, get in touch with the comedy zone. You have free tickets to any comedy show that I ever do. Full life, front row, whatever the fuck you want. Forgiven given up these tickets. Um, Jan, thank you enough. This is going to be amazing. So I'm, we're on our way up to Durham and I was just out there, so I know a couple of good spots to eat at. So, uh, we're going to have a good time. All right, that's the podcast. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. Yukon and I will talk to you. Uh, I'll talk to you on Monday. I'll let you know about the game. All right.

Speaker 7:          00:37:36       Mm.

Speaker 8:          00:37:39       Uh, [inaudible] uh

Speaker 7:          00:37:49       mm.

Speaker 6:          00:37:54       Hey,

Speaker 9:          00:37:54       what's up? This is Bill Barr and uh, this is the Monday morning podcast. I just did a 50 minute podcast. I tried to save it and didn't once again this week. Talked for fucking hour evidently to nobody. Um, I'm going to have to buy some sort of device so I can save them so I can try and pull them back up. I don't know what to tell you, but a, I don't even know if this one's going to record. I don't know if I'm going too long. I don't even know who the fuck I'm supposed to call. Who the fuck do I call? It's not like I called this number on anybody you can talk to, picks up, you know, typical of how we're living. Do you know I was on the fucking airplane flying out to Boston, right? I'm on the airplane and for some reason they always have the fucking intercoms turned all the way up the 10.

Speaker 9:          00:38:47       Right? Hello is my God damn eardrums out. So I say the lady, she walks by, I go, is there any way you can turn the thing down? She's like, Nah, sy die. There's nothing we can do. You mean there's nothing you could do? You can go up there. He can fucking turn it down. But it would, they be installed an intercom system on 10 with no fucking volume, whatever. Fuck this technology shit. I got to figure out, somebody sent me an email about something that I can record into. I'm going to try to find that. I guess I got to go out and buy it, but I apologize. Um, I'm gonna try to do one again tomorrow or something like that. Uh, oh Jesus. It was such a great podcast. God dammit. All right. Whatever. I'm gonna try tomorrow. So all 14 of you hang in there. I'm gonna do a podcast tomorrow. All right. Take it easy.

Speaker 6:          00:40:17       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:40:17       bill bar. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with this g thing, but I have figured out how to save my podcast. All attitude was press number two. For some reason that wasn't hearing that, you know, I dunno, she was saying it or whatever. The computer with the fucking female voice has been saying it, but I don't know what's going on with this thing. It seems anytime I record something longer than a, I don't know what a doesn't fucking go through, but I know how to save them. So all I'm saying is from here on out, um, I won't lose any more podcasts, but I'm going to do a podcast tomorrow and I'm going to save the thing and hopefully I can publish it. All right. Thank you for your patience and God bless the United States of America.

Speaker 6:          00:41:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:41:31       Hey, what's going on? It's still, it is the Monday morning port by podcast. Somebody said, pull it. The Monday morning podcast will on Guy Island. That's six 18 on a fucking Wednesday. And I learned how to save these podcasts and he'd go, this is the podcast. This is it. I'm doing one take. I don't give a fuck. I've already done it three times and I'm running a red light and I made it good deal the deal. Oh Hey you guys, you guys got cameras, you got cameras where you're at. You know, you run a red light and they take your fucking picture. And if for some reason you have to pay the fucking ticket, I got a way around it. I got away around it that I've learned. Somebody told me, all you gotta do when you run the red light is you gotta be in the center.

Speaker 9:          00:42:21       You know, if there's two lanes, just be in the middle, had half your car in one lane after your car on the other lane and no, it doesn't get your full license plate or your full face and you throw it. Granted, I haven't tried that yet, but I heard you can do that also is another way. When I got my car out here and last on delays, evidently, evidently there's so many fucking people out here that, uh, that, you know, it takes, I swear to God, it took like four weeks or six weeks for me to get my license plate. Something ridiculous. So basically I drove around for well over a month with the, just the name of the dealership where I bought my car at, on both the front and the back. And one day as luck would have it, I was like going to the airport and I ran a fucking red light and they took my picture and I flipped out.

Speaker 9:          00:43:18       I was like, ah, fuck. You know, that's me flipping out that, fuck. See, I stick it acting. That's good. Bill, could you raise the stakes you want to? I really did. I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me. This is fucking punk shit. That's what I really did. But I didn't want to yell like that. And um, but basically all they had was the picture of the dealership and my stupid face. So I never got the tickets. Why am I admitting to this? Can they use this in a court of law? Come and get me Shea. So anyways, I'm driving down the street and I don't have my laptop with me, so I don't have your questions, but God knows I read them enough times that I can actually remember him once. So here's the first question somebody asked me, hey bill, what kind of drum kit that you have?

Speaker 9:          00:44:07       And it, um, well you have it a band and if so, do you have any good band stories? All right. I have a late seventies Slingerland five ply, the five ply shells and nobody wants, everybody wants to three plus shells from the late sixties, early seventies to get that great tone. Whatever the fuck they're talking about. Well, fortunately I'm a comedian so I don't give a fuck. I'll tech, I'll take the extra two plies. And uh, basically they're all bottom sizes. 14 by 24 bass drum. I add a 13, I mean 30 had 14 and then an 18 inch floor Floortime. So years later I bought the 16 inch floor Tom. And recently I had another bass drum cause I was listening to Primus and I was like, I want to play like Tim Alexander, even though I already had a double pedal. I'm like, I'm going to add another bass drum pedal because that guy from slayer said it's not the same unless you have the fucking both of them.

Speaker 9:          00:45:02       So I went out and I bought another bass drum and I should have realized the fact that I suck with the double pedal, that they added a second base drum. All it was going to do was just take up more room and it wouldn't make me any better a drummer, but I did it. So, uh, yeah, that's what I played. I got an old snuggling kit and have I ever been in a band? No, I was never in a band. I just had a fucking, I didn't, the drums were at my house. Everybody came over to jam man. And we sucked. Which is why everybody, whoever came over now has a real job.

Speaker 9:          00:45:41       Um, yeah, that's it. I don't have any rock star. I don't have any of you fucking fan stories other than that we stunk the usual shit. And the next question somebody asked me was, uh, what the fuck was the question was some question about I guess late at night they got these new economy dentures, something like this. That's what the person asked me. Have you seen these economy dentures? What the fuck is this? And, uh, it's actually a really interesting question because I used to work in a dental office and I know a little something about dentures. Huh? We're going to meet, it's peeling off another layer of the onion as Madonna says. You know, she actually had the balls to say that one time. She doesn't have any balls. God knows. We've all seen her Twat, um, that she actually had the nerve to say that when she did yet another totally planned out. You know, look, I can dress like a whore this way. Nice fucking parking job. You fucking idiot.

Speaker 9:          00:46:48       Fuck. I swear to God, man. People just, you know, people cannot fucking drive out here in la. They really can't. Like a lot of people don't know that. All they talk about is the traffic. Who it good. It's good because so fucking bed man. Well you know what, when it clears up, the driving gets it and people can actually drive the, there are, I've established it before. You know they fucking, they suck at driving out here. You're that homeless guy. There's a homeless guy out here. I swear to God he looks like George Clinton. I'm from parliament. Anybody. So anyways, you're asking me what these economy dentures are. I'm going to guess that they are a one size fits all denture, which really fucking bizarre. And I bet I'm on the upper, it has some sort of a form fitting thing that will fit to your pallet.

Speaker 9:          00:47:40       It's horrific because when you get a denture, you're actually supposed to, you know this impressions, you pour up a model, you know if they took out some teeth, they try to get the teeth to look like your other teeth. So you don't freak people out. Like one day you look like a witch and the next day you come walking in and look like Guy Smiley. You know, I used to work in a dental office. I actually am certified to take x-rays. I can take impressions. The upper impression was the worst. I'd always get some. I'm just going to let you know that I'm a gagger. I gag. Really? Why don't you just brush your fucking teeth so I don't have to worry about you throwing up on the mud. The fucking left sleeve of my, uh, my what? What do you call those? The doctor robe. The doctor coat or whatever. Yeah. I used to take the impressions and people used to always gag when you do the top. And if you hang in there another eight seconds, and then they always have done, they always say, yeah, God, I fucking hate the dentist. Really? Well, why don't you brush your fucking teeth? You idiot. You know? I guess I do the same thing. I ain't going to the gym, but God knows I'm going to go order a fucking pizza right now.

Speaker 9:          00:48:53       Jesus. I'm gonna move. So yeah, that's what I would get. So basically after you took the impressions, if you want to know the whole fucking process and the person's going every five seconds, if they don't puke on you, you actually have a good impression. Then you take it into the little lab and then you take out the little Green Cup, that rubber Green Cup, that's all I remember. Things could only be mixed in that. I never took a chemistry class, so I don't know why it couldn't be just a plastic bowl, but it was always those rubber things. And then you'd mix it up and then you'd pour it into the fucking impression and then you'd stick it on this little vibrating thing, trying to get all the bubbles out of it. And it was nothing fucking worse if you didn't get all the bubbles out of it. And then I swear to God, the bubble would always be right where the person's tooth was and you'd fuck up the whole impression.

Speaker 9:          00:49:40       And then you'd have to go in there and be like, we gotta do it again. I'd have to deal with that again. So I would guess that what they're doing is, is they, uh, they're skipping that whole step. I don't know what they do. If you take a whole pack of juicy fruit and you chew it up and then, you know, form it to the top of your mouth and then you mail that in and they make a denture out of that. I have no fucking idea. But that's really a, that's really a scary thing. It's a really scary thing, you know? That's the kind of Shit I wish people focused on. Like everybody keeps talking about that fucking broad where the eight kids, can you believe it? I mean, that's so irresponsible. Who gives a fuck? People talking about all the money she's going to cost us.

Speaker 9:          00:50:26       She's going to cost us what, a couple million, you know, what about these? Do you know the fucking bankers? Three quarters of $1 trillion. Nobody gives a fuck about that. Some chicks squirts eight babies out of her twat. It's going to cost us, you know, one half of 1% compared to what these fucking cons did, who stole a trillion dollars and then gave themselves $30 million bonuses. Nobody gives a shit about that. You know, some chicks squirts up fucking eight babies and all of a sudden no one can stop looking at it. You know why? Because it has a face. You know what she looks like? That's the thing. That's the genius of the bankers. Nobody knows what a banker looks like. I don't even know what the fuck my teller looks like. I go to the Goddamn ATM cause I worked nights. Um, all right, what else? What else could I do on this podcast?

Speaker 9:          00:51:12       This is going to be a short podcast. I'm doing a podcast until I get home and that's going to be it because I'm exhausted with these fucking podcast. All right? It's insane. The amount of podcasts that I've done this fucking week and to no avail. You know, it reminds me of listening to somebody talking about who the fuck was it recording with like a ray Charles. You do like nine, 9,000 takes of Georgia on my mind by the end of it, you wanted to make them deaf too. You know, that's what I feel like right now with these fucking podcasts. So, um, I guess the last thing that I have to do is I'm stuck in traffic waiting to make my left hand turn to come home to order a pizza, uh, is I gonna announce the winner of the, uh, the submissions for the original a proc tologist.

Speaker 9:          00:52:02       I went to the proctologist joke, I gotta admit, man, they were all strong and everybody seemed to like, there's sort of an even amount of people like in every one of them except for one. So basically I think I'm gonna pass out like a three or four DVDs. You know, you know what? Everybody's a winner, except for the one guy, the one guy on meandered for 20 minutes about having the chicks titty mashed in the mammogram. He's the only one who didn't get any votes. Everybody else. The Guy with the potato salad line got a lot of votes. The dude who freak me out get a bunch of votes and uh, the dude who did the, uh, had the great angle. I thought this was the most original angle of, of the gay guy bragging that he's dating approch cologists you know, if he didn't listen to that podcast, he was saying like, it's kind of like if you know one of your, one of your buddies started dating a generalist, you know, and then, then all your buddies would be jealous.

Speaker 9:          00:53:01       Like Jesus Christ. I bet she can do some freaky shit. You know, you can bend her every which way you're saying gay guys would do that. I bet they'd get jealous if you started dating a proctologist and they'd all be sitting around going to Kai. I bet he really knows his way around an ass. Thank you. That was the hacky gay guy voice. I don't know if you guys noticed, but my chick voice is basically the hacky gay guy voice. Just done it a whisper. If you ever want to get that impression down instead of going, hi fellows. I just go,

Speaker 10:         00:53:34       hey, what's going on? This is

Speaker 9:          00:53:36       his relationship going exact site that I am a complete fucking no talent. And anyways, I'm in my garage right now. So this podcast is over. I know it was a quick one. I know. It was a quick one. All right. It's a little 12 minutes. It's an ETP. All right. Like guns and roses live. That's what it's like. All right. Step. I didn't drop the n word even though there was a half black Obama guitarist in my group. How fucking drugged up with slash that day where he fucking co-signed on that one. Anyways, I want to thank everybody who came out to the, uh, my shows back in Boston. Uh, the comedy connection at the Wilbur Theater and out in chicken p Massachusetts. I had an, I had a great time coming back there and a bunch of friends, family, former babysitter from the 70 showed up.

Speaker 9:          00:54:29       It was a, a was just, it was an unbelievable weekend. And uh, then I went out to chickopee, Massachusetts. That show sold out as well. And I was a bunch of drunks and I made my way through it. And uh, then I went back to my fancy hotel in Boston. I ordered a Philemon Yawn. The, the made had left classical music on the clock radio. Trying to remember how this went down. That's fine. I walked into my a hotel room, but you know the turn down service, I don't know what that means. They fold your sheets back and they give you a mint. And she left classical music claim on my clock radio. I ordered the a menu minion, little mashed potatoes, a glass of red wine. And I sat there and ate it. And it was one of the most loneliest experiences I've ever had in my life to the point I actually had to call Robert Kelly and tell him in the moment how lonely I was.

Speaker 9:          00:55:32       The stakes suck too. I actually, it was such a bad space. I actually didn't even consider putting a one on it. I went straight to ketchup. That's how bad it was. And I don't put anything on, you shouldn't put anything on a steak. It should just taste delicious. And the thing was so fucking, I ordered it medium rare and it was gray all the way through and it was tough. Like fucking shoe leather. That Mozzarella. Um, anybody know the app? What's that one from anybody? I'll give you five seconds. Tough like fucking shoe leather. That Mozzarella, I only know one other fucking person who have a new that reference. We have a brought it up and he owns Gotham comedy club. It was, uh, Eric Roberts and uh, the of Greenwich village talk like fucking shoe leather, that Mozzarella, any the fucking steak stunk. And I actually put ketchup on it.

Speaker 9:          00:56:28       I like it literally takes, it tasted like fucking hamburger it. No it didn't cause hamburger tastes great, but you know what I mean? Any chefs out there, you never put ketchup. Okay, let's do overrated or underrated. You know, it's fucking overrated. A one steak sauce. I don't even get it. It's, it's just, it sucks. I am in a garage right now talking to myself basically about fucking a one steak sauce. Who gives a fuck? I'm done with this podcast. Next week you're going to get, you're going to get a double album out of me. All right? I promise you. But this week you get in the EAP. All right. Thank you to everybody who came out to the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts and all you fucking meth heads and drugs who came up to the hooky Louth and chicken chickopee Massachusetts. And uh, my next Gig, my next upcoming Gig, I am going to be at wise guys in Ogden, Utah.

Speaker 9:          00:57:21       I believe it's Saturday night, the uh, February 21st. So, uh, please come out to see me, man. I've never done a club up that way. I've only done colleges. And why don't you come along and bring your 18 fucking wives or whatever the hell is you Mormons do out there. And uh, you know, I think a, you're a cool Mormon if you're actually listening to this. So you know, come out to the show and uh, congratulations to the Lakers in the Cavaliers, man. You guys look like you're going to be playing, you just playing a hundred game, playing a fucking hungry or game. But I have to, I have to say this before I sign off. I really think that, uh, the reason why I can't stay on the fucking NBA is unlike any other sports like that sport, the officials control the outcome of the game.

Speaker 9:          00:58:11       Like I've never seen. It's like, it always like the Celtics Lakers was a fucking great game and then down into the end they just kept blowing the whistle on both sides. I'm not being a crybaby here. Lakers won fair and square, but I'm just saying, you know, sometimes they should just put the fucking whistle away, you know, just let them fucking play. And they did that in the Cavaliers game. It's like you got these two juggernauts going head to fucking head and then this little fat keeps blowing his whistle. Now all the action stops and then you know, you know, hey, stop pushing him. That's ridiculous. Okay, let's let them shoot uncontested. It's the most, it's the biggest fucking buzz kill to the end of any game I've ever seen. You know? And I love how they, there's been a referee that was, has been busted for having mob ties in the fucking NBA and I'm supposed to act like that's the only guy.

Speaker 9:          00:59:08       Like there was that was, yeah, that was just one bad apple. You know, I think, I don't know. What do you guys think? That's my question for you. This week I'd have all the four major sports. Which referee do you think if you bought them, could influence the outcome of the, the uh, the outcome of the game? I'd have to go NBA cause it's so easy to get a guy out of the game. You just keep calling files in football, you know, you want how many? You just throw a guy out of the game, you've got to wait til he, you know, kick somebody in the balls and spits in their face. And I don't know what will get me babbling. And literally the light in my garage went out. I got to get out of the car. All right guys, that's it. I'm going to save this podcast so you're going to hear it.

Speaker 11:         00:59:49       What's, I don't know how to fucking uploading.

Speaker 6:          00:59:52       It's been a brutal week. Alright God, let's take it. [inaudible] alright.

Speaker 11:         01:00:25       Fuck list bill. I wake up at my girlfriend's house. She leaves to work. I can't find my socks. She says I have some. She says I have some just use mine in leaves. I wake up later and I look for the sock drawer. Top drawer. Right. Um, and I find this list with about 20 to 30 names on it and my name is near the bottom. Oh No. Some have check marks on them, et cetera. I asked her about it and while she's initially upset it turns out to be her fuck list. Wow. I don't even have a file. I have a list in my head. She actually made a fuck list. Dude, you coined a phrase. She said she made it after we got together with some friends drunk one night. She then admitted to being somewhat of a whore. Her words, not mine before we met, but assures me that she hasn't done anything since she met me with anyone else.

Speaker 11:         01:01:30       I do believe her, but I totally blew up on her. And we haven't been talking for a few days. I also look a bit creepy as to why I went through her door drawer. It was in an envelope. Yeah. You know what it is? Yeah. You kind of look creepy, but she would've done that to you. You know women call it snooping when we do it. It's fucking creepy. Anyways, he goes, I need some help here on this one too. I apologize. She already has. Do I just say fuck it and forget about it? What's Ne his take on it? God dammit. You know what?

Speaker 11:         01:02:10       I'm going to have to ask her. Take on that one. I'm not going to have it on this podcast. When I, when I go home, I fly home tomorrow, I'll try to have an epilogue to this podcast, um, or maybe tack it onto to the following weeks. That is a great question because I don't trust this girl. You know that when, when a girl is that fucking free. All right. And I know girls are getting mad. Why? Why can't we be as free as you? I'll tell you why you can't because you don't have to work at getting laid. Okay, I can be sexually liberated. I still have to go out to the bar, man, I got to do a fucking tap dance. You know, like me getting laid. It's like somebody on fucking a American idol trying to get that ticket to Vegas. You know? That's what it's like as if for most guys anyways, to get laid, even if you get good at it, it's, it's like fucking, you know.

Speaker 6:          01:03:15       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:03:17       It's, it's, it's not hot, but you guys, anytime you want to fuck you can fuck. Look at that. Golden the came up with a backup. I didn't know Zia. I put my hand and I wasn't ready. 44 year old guy. I'm sitting there, the bootleg can't even fucking talk. Um, so that's what I would be worried about. She said she's a bit of a whore. Like I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing or like a, I don't know about that one. She sat down and she made a list. Jesus Cry 20 to 30 names. Now, this is the thing, I don't know how old she is. All right. 20, you know, for a girl, 20 to 30 names, I don't think is even that bad. The fact that she, well I dunno, but we might be even worse because they, they

Speaker 11:         01:04:16       are not honest about their numb. They do the exact opposite of what we do. Guys. We exaggerate our numbers. They dial them fucking back like, like women's, how many guys are you been with? Numbers is like when they put out how many people are unemployed in this country, you know, they try to keep that number fucking down. It's the same thing. Uh, a fuck list. I mean, uh, I, I don't know, I never get past that. You sat around with your friends are your friends all whores, you know, and it's not like they just sat there going, oh yeah, you know, I've fucking, you know, Bobby fell up fucking Dakota Tornado, another fucking modern name. Um, Range Rover, whatever. Fucking people call kids and boys now. Um, and then, you know, there's checks next to them of, of like what she did with them or how good the Dick was.

Speaker 11:         01:05:26       And uh, I, I don't know if that's one of those things that they all fucking do and you just unfortunately peak behind the curtain and you should let it go. I have no experience with something like that. Um, oh, this would have been a great nia question. I have to do this with her and get into a fucking giant argument, but then I run the risk of possibly getting a fucking preview of her fuck list, which I don't want to know about. I don't want to know. I mean I gotta be honest with you. I don't give a fuck at my age. I don't give a clean good. Okay. What do I think? You will fucking in a, in a goddamn bubble. I hope your banged enough guys and learned how to fuck. I really do because I don't need some fish in bed, you know, just laying there. Haman fucked a lot of people. Great. Isn't that great? Do you want a pilot who hasn't flown a lot of planes? You know there's, there's give and take. Okay, you got to, girl hasn't fucked a lot of guys at, you know.

Speaker 6:          01:06:22       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:06:23       She sucks a dick. Like she's eating green beans. That's the trade off yet. Oh, a two. That sucks. That really sucks for you. Why were you going to wear one of her socks to work though? You know, with a little fucking Chris Everett ball hanging off the back.

Speaker 6:          01:07:58       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].
