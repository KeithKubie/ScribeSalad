00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.490
You started an online store, and
the customers are rolling in.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.150
Your website is functional art,
your ad campaign's gone viral,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.850
and the shopping
carts are filling up.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.130
Your products have
universal appeal.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.660
And you notice, Hey!

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.320
I'm huge in Japan.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.560
You are getting lots of
international traffic.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.520
But it's not
converging into sales.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.010
Why is that?

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.870
After examining
your analytics data,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.360
you see a lot of items getting
abandoned during checkout.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.520
Do your international users just
have a shorter attention span?

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.566
Or is there
something sub-optimal

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:33.440
about the user experience
that is frustrating

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.887
their urge to consume?

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:36.470
We're going to address
these questions

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.740
and elucidate some of
the famous question marks

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.270
that beget profit.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.760
Have you ever seen
an address in Japan?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.120
Let's start with something
easy for me as an American.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.130
Here's where I work
in Los Angeles.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.990
But here's where
Googlers work in Japan.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.700
Let's remove the language
barrier for a second.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.970
As you might notice, we're
not in Kansas anymore.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.680
The order of this address is
almost completely reversed

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.530
from Western conventions.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.300
But you're smart.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.580
You can handle this.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.770
You whip out some JavaScript
and manipulate that DOM.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.530
After a careful
reading of Wikipedia,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.030
you are pretty confident.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.586
You can deal with users
coming from Japan,

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:12.960
shuffle the others
around to make

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.576
sure they feel right at home,
remove any impediments that

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:17.950
might prevent them
from obtaining

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.460
the latest in wearable
tech for their pets.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.630
But wait a second.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.160
Every country does things
a little differently.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.470
How many countries are
there in the world?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.010
I don't know-- a bunch.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.670
You're going to be up
pretty late tonight

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.270
scouring the web for
this sort of information

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.660
for every country
that likes cats.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.310
That's problem one.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.690
Now, here's problem two.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.900
Here is that address again.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.750
But this time it
contains a typo.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.940
Can you spot it?

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.000
I can't either.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.690
But users love typos--
almost more than their cats.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.320
So you better figure out
how to verify the address

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.570
as it's being entered.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.340
OK I will end this rant.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.630
I hope you are convinced.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.990
Addresses are hard.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.940
And you just want
to go shopping.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.950
But it's OK.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.240
Chrome's requestAutocomplete
gives you all this

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.550
and more for free.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.200
RequestAutocomplete is a
brand-spanking new member

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.930
of the HTML standard.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.650
And today, you can
find it on Chrome

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.880
for desktop, Chrome
OS, Android, and iOS.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.150
And it's super easy to integrate
into your site, which is nice.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.245
RequestAutocomplete
remembers the address.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.060
So in practice,
most of the time,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.630
you won't need to
enter a new one.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.410
But when you do, here is what
it looks like on your phone.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.926
It's native UI.

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:35.535
So this is straightforward
to use as an American.

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:38.880
You can put in your name,
my city, all that stuff.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880
That's well and good.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.870
But here's the
hard part-- Russia.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.910
As you might have expected
the address fields

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.930
look quite different
from the United States.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.620
For example, you see the
postal code and the city fields

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.250
on top of the street
address and the name fields.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.770
What about validation, you ask?

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:53.670
No problem.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.100
RequestAutocomplete
can do that as well.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.240
Fantastic.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.070
Best of all, next
time my address

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.760
is ready and waiting for me.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.515
So Chrome handles address input,
data validation, and more,

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:06.570
while you focus on your product.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.740
Want to add requestAutocomplete
to your site?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.760
Check it out here or
point your browser here.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.360
Easier internationalization
is just one reason

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.320
why requestAutocomplete rocks.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.200
The team is working hard to
improve the checkout process

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.570
for your users.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.240
Our goal is to help you maximize
conversions and optimize

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.660
the payments experience for the
web, especially the mobile web.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.030
Because let's face it.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.260
This resource is occupied.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.530
Until next time, I'm
Rouslan Solomakhin.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.910
And I'm huge in Japan.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.670
