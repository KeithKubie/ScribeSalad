00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:07.960
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Hello,
everyone, and welcome to Talks

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.646
at Google.

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:10.550
For our first talk
of the year, I'm

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.478
delighted to introduce our
PR guru, Ellen Gunning,

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:14.466
with a warm welcome.

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.454
Thank you.

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:18.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:20.888 --> 00:00:22.630
ELLEN GUNNING: Good
morning, how are you?

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.046
My book, as you
can see behind me,

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:26.640
is called "10 Red Hot Tips
to Promotoe Your Business."

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.400
Basically, it's geared to people
in the small-to-medium-size

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.370
enterprises.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.030
And it's really teaching them
how to promote their business

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.780
by using PR tools.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.160
So all of the tools
in it are PR tools.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.745
I thought I might
begin by trying

00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:42.250
to get us to agree on
what PR actually is.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.452
An awful lot of people think
PR is free advertising.

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:45.160
YOu're in Google.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.784
You know advertising
isn't free, right?

00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:48.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.190
Advertising, you buy the
space, you put something in it.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.356
And the purpose of advertising
is to sell a product.

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.240
So it works or it
doesn't work on the basis

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.400
of how much rpduct did shift?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.170
It's very easy to analyze.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.500
Public Relations, on the
other hand, creates stories.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.680
It tells you who people
are and what they do

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
and why they're passionate
about their business,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.471
and why you should
actually invest in them.

00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:12.245
I often think public relations
people are like doctors.

00:01:12.245 --> 00:01:13.703
Because they work
from a goody bag.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.578
but the goody bag has
loads of tools in them.

00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:18.370
So if you go to a doctor
and you have a cough,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.662
the doctor may say to you,
meh, it's a bit of a cough.

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:21.370
It's no big deal.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.981
You need a cough bottle.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:24.502
The doctor may
equally look at you

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:26.877
and say, oh, I don't like the
sound of that cough at all.

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.077
OK, I need you get x-rays.

00:01:29.077 --> 00:01:31.160
Last time I heard somebody
with a cough like that,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.451
I never saw them a second time.

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.600
Or the doctor may well
lookat you and say,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.970
you're a malingerer.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.040
There's nothing wrong with you.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.700
Go back to work.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.075
I'm not giving
you a certificate.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:40.033
But he dips into a
goody bag of tools

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.560
and say, here's what you need.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.680
PR people do exactly
the same thing.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.237
We look at a business
and we say, OK,

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.070
if you're trying to
communicate with people,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.942
which tool do you need to use?

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.400
So should you be
using exhibitions?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.015
Should you be using e-zines?

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:53.540
Should you be
using social media?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.710
Should you be
using sponsorships?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.744
What's the tool
that will work best

00:01:58.744 --> 00:01:59.910
for each different audience?

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.020
Because you won't reach
everybody with the same tool.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.300
So this book is
about 10 of the tools

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.699
that I believe are most
relevant to people in SMEs.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.850
Before I move onto them, I
should mention the word spin.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.330
Because every time you hear
the word public relations,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.190
you hear spin.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.170
And PR people have this huge
thing about, we do not spin.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.350
We are not spin doctors.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.710
We are in public relations.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.160
I was introduced about
three or four years ago

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.600
as the princess of
the dark art of spin.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.760
I absolutely adored it.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.460
I have dined out
on it ever since.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920
Because I think that
is exactly what we do.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.100
Businesses do it, people do it.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.320
I wore a suit this morning.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.115
I'm serious about
being an author.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:43.025
That's my spin.

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:44.710
I could've come in
in a pair of jeans.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.245
You would've had an entirely
different visual spin.

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:49.620
You chose to dress exactly
the way you chose this morning

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.140
because it says something
about you, the mood you're in,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.330
what you want to project to
people in the world today.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.960
That's spin.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.530
That's a visual spin.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.072
We also do it by text.

00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:00.530
So there are two
ways you can spin.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.540
One is visually.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.620
What you look like
says something.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.380
It creates an expectation.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.280
But equally, text
does the same thing.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.405
Let me give you an example.

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:15.630
If I said that my best
friend is a drug addict,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.490
what immediately
comes into your head?

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.904
What does drug addict say?

00:03:19.904 --> 00:03:21.257
AUDIENCE: Pills.

00:03:21.257 --> 00:03:22.340
AUDIENCE: She takes drugs.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.548
AUDIENCE: Hypodermic needles?

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.645
ELLEN GUNNING:
Pills, Takes drugs.

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:28.200
A bit down and out.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.300
Not really the best, probably
in a bad place right now.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.440
Needs to feed a
habit, so God only

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.930
knows how they actually get
enough money to feed the habit.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.760
The whole "drug addict," just
the use of the words "drug

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.110
addict" says, mm, I wouldn't
have thought she associated

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.812
with those kinds of people.

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:49.790
If, on the other hand,
I said, my best friend

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.150
is a recreational user, you'd
go whoa, too many parties.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.510
Too much white stuff.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.760
Got to cut back on that stuff.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.880
It'll kill you eventually.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.060
It's a whole different spin.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.690
You're still talking about
somebody who uses drugs.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.430
But it's a spin.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.910
It's a textual spin.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.710
Your head creates a
different picture.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.930
And that's what PR people do.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.350
They say, don't look over there.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.537
Look over here.

00:04:10.537 --> 00:04:11.620
That's what spin is about.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.890
It's not about telling a lie.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.513
It's about diverting your
attention just a little bit.

00:04:15.513 --> 00:04:20.390
So visual spin, let me look at
four of the 10 Red Hot Tips,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.660
possibly, that are
included in this.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.085
Visual, photo calls, we
live in a visual era.

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:29.270
Look at the way we watch
news, and the way news

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.920
is presented to us,
how it's changed

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.860
in the last 10 or 15 years.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.647
If you looked at
news years ago, it

00:04:34.647 --> 00:04:36.980
was one person sitting to a
camera on television saying,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.957
here is the news, and
you had a clip behind.

00:04:38.957 --> 00:04:41.077
If you watch news
on television now,

00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:42.660
you've got all these
boxes coming down

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.950
the side with short little
breaking pieces of news.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.190
You've got ticker tape
running underneath.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.240
Nobody actually sits there
and waits for the next story.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.500
We have no patience.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.275
But the visual
tells us something.

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:57.801
It's like this morning, there
was an avalanche in Italy.

00:04:57.801 --> 00:04:58.800
I've seen the avalanche.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.120
I know what ahppened.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.850
It's a visual kind of thing.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.860
If you can create a really good
visual, people will remember.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.150
They associate it
with your business.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.520
There are two ways to do
it. one is by photo call,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.630
and one is by photo shoot.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.690
Photo call is where you
actually invite all of the media

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:14.250
to attend.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.080
And you set up the
picture for them.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.457
Photo shoot is where you
create the photograph,

00:05:18.457 --> 00:05:19.665
and you send it to the media.

00:05:19.665 --> 00:05:22.180
So let me give you
example of both.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.370
I must warn you in advance,
small, little people,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.630
vertically challenged,
generally called children,

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.330
I don't have any of them.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.413
I find it very difficult
to communicate with them.

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:31.180
OK?

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.847
We need to contextualize
this story, OK?

00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:34.804
So I have a guy that was
vertically challenged.

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:36.725
Until they're my height
and make eye contact

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:38.930
and speak in fully-formed
sentences they're like,

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.290
nice to meet you kid, move on.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.170
OK?

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.284
So I'm doing this
photo call and it's

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:44.450
for the opening of a school.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.560
It's a day school.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.200
And I have two children, a
photographer sitting beside me.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.090
And he says, OK, what I want to
get is that traditional shot.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.366
I want to get a little boy,
little girl holding hands,

00:05:53.366 --> 00:05:54.490
walking to school, day one.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.580
I thought, easy.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.236
I told you, I have no kids.

00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:57.735
OK?

00:05:57.735 --> 00:05:58.921
So I was scrambling.

00:05:58.921 --> 00:05:59.420
Two?

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.690
There's a little boy.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:00.940
There, that little girl there.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.095
So yeah, they look nice.

00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:04.220
Sean, do me a favor and
hold Maureen's hand please.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.980
(ALTERED VOICE) No.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.101
I'm not doing it.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:09.055
Right.

00:06:09.055 --> 00:06:10.970
Maureen, hold
Sean's hand please.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.140
(ALTERED VOICE) Oh, OK.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.220
And she puts her hand in.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.800
And he goes, (ALTERED
VOICE) I'm not doing it.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.120
Able Well, we go through this
about two or three times.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.120
I said to the photographer, this
kid has an attitude problem.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.084
He's not going to hold her hand.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.860
And he said, no, and we're
not going to get the shot.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.330
I said, no, no,
we'll get the shot.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.650
I just need to lose the child.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.430
OK?

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.096
So without even
thinking, I turn around.

00:06:33.096 --> 00:06:34.262
Now, I'm in the zone.

00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:36.470
So I turned around and said,
who owns the little boy?

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.180
And the photographer turns
back to me and went, who owns?

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.048
Who owns the little boy?

00:06:42.048 --> 00:06:43.010
I'm dead.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.540
I'm going to record
this on film.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.216
Somebody is going to kill you.

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:48.010
You do not own a child.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.290
And this father came thundering
over the group, like a lunatic.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.192
And he goes, I'm Sean's father.

00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:55.290
And I still haven't
really registered

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.760
what the photographer said.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.040
So I said, great.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.070
Do me a favor, will you?

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.540
The photographer's trying to get
a shot for "The Irish Times."

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.020
The kid won't cooperate.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.340
I just want him
to hold her hand.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.990
He won't do it.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.990
Sorry, but that
kid has his chance.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.570
He's gone.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.590
I need to put another little
boy in, in place of him.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:10.870
I don't do tactful, either.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.370
I should have mentioned.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.590
What was the father's reaction?

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.407
Any idea?

00:07:17.407 --> 00:07:18.543
AUDIENCE: Defensive?

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:20.209
AUDIENCE: He made the
kid hold her hand.

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:23.011
ELLEN GUNNING: Told the
child to hold hands?

00:07:23.011 --> 00:07:24.260
He had the child sideways.

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.320
He goes, Sean!

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.110
You hold her hand
right-by-God now!

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.640
Because all the father
heard was "Irish Times."

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.600
He didn't hear the child's
being uncooperative.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.359
He didn't hear who
owns the child?

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:34.900
He heard "Irish
Times," and my child.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.170
And we got the front
page of "The Irish Times"

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.740
the next day, with the child.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.201
The little girl going, eh.

00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:41.149
And the little boy, rawr!

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:42.520
But it was a classic shot.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.170
If you'd pinch the child, you
couldn't have set it up better.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.259
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.050
YOu're learning a lot
about the way I work.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.980
Probably more than
you needed to know.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.391
From the school's point of
view, what they wanted was,

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:56.390
they were looking for a
bit of publicity to say,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.410
the school has opened.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.310
It's a new school.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.340
It's in this area.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.700
And they ended up was front
page of the "Irish Times,"

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.130
with a shot that said, this
is the new school that opened.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.420
And it was outside of Dublin.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.795
So the chances of actually
getting that kind of publicity

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:08.330
were unreal.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.680
But it was a great photograph.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.560
So if you take a great shot,
people will look at it.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.010
And they remember it.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.280
The exmple that I used in the
book was from Butler's Pantry.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.540
You all familiar
with Butler's Pantry?

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.330
Butler's Pantry, probably
the best way to describe it,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.170
it's like a gourmet food outlet.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.670
You're probably in
there if you want

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:29.330
to buy really good quality,
fresh, homemade food

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.805
on your way home in the evening.

00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:31.950
They're kind of
like, do you know

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.741
the way Marks &amp; Spencers
do those food ads?

00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:36.590
You know the way you could've
completely eaten an entire meal

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.700
and you're stuffed and thinking,
I never want to see food again?

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.925
And a Marks &amp; Spencers food
ad comes on and you go,

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:41.950
that looks lovely.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.520
Then suddenly
you're hungry again.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.350
Food, if you're going
to promote food,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.540
you have promote food
with that yumminess.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.157
And Butler's Pantry bring in
a professional photographer

00:08:51.157 --> 00:08:52.490
each time they take photographs.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.250
But because photography
is so expensive,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.550
and it's probably only
about half the price that it

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.120
was five or six years ago.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.100
Five or six years
ago, before the crash,

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.810
if you brought in a photograph
to do any photo shoot,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.780
you said to the client,
you need 1,200 to 1,500.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.665
You won't get out.

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:11.040
You won't get
change out of that.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.081
Now we're looking at
somewhere around 300 to 600.

00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.410
So it's a big change.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.280
But for a small
business, you're still

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.240
looking at bringing
in a photograph

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.115
to take a photograph.

00:09:19.115 --> 00:09:20.840
And I dont' know if
anybody will use it.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.908
So I have a really
good-quality photograph,

00:09:22.908 --> 00:09:24.075
but will it be used?

00:09:24.075 --> 00:09:27.110
And what Butler's Pantry do is
they trial all the photographs.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.580
So if they're doing a new,
I don't know, salmon dish,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.440
they storyboard
the entire thing.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.055
So this is how we would
like to promote salmon.

00:09:35.055 --> 00:09:37.330
This is what we want
people to think and feel.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.380
When we say salmon, we
people to go, oh, salmon.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.570
I haven't had salmon
in a long time.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.850
Fresh fish,
gorgeous, [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.399
of knowledge, whatever it is.

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:47.190
And then they try to
create the photograph.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.130
So they spend days
seeing what works best?

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.290
Should I put this here?

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.000
Should I put that there?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.035
How, exactly, do
we mix the people?

00:09:55.035 --> 00:09:55.910
The groups together.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.250
And when they think they
have it exactly right,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.290
then they get the
photographer in.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.470
And the photographer
literally shoots it.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.650
But the photographs
that they take

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.970
have been used for up
to five years, which

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.130
is a very long time
to get out of a photo.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.874
But it's good value.

00:10:11.874 --> 00:10:14.330
But their attitude is, if
they spend that much money,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.704
they really want to be sure
before the photographer comes

00:10:16.704 --> 00:10:19.464
in the door that it's giving the
message that they want it to.

00:10:19.464 --> 00:10:20.630
And that's a visual message.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.796
And that's public relations.

00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:23.300
That's a photo call.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.596
The second area I wanted
to look at was sponsorship.

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:27.470
Because people seem to
think that sponsorship

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.380
is all about having
lots of money.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.120
Everybody knows
the big sponsorhips

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.350
because they're in your face.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.930
They've got huge
budgets behind them.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.887
Sponsorship can work
really, really well

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.470
for a small-to-medium-size
enterprise.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.560
But it only works really
well if, like everything else

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.845
you do in life, you
put time into it

00:10:44.845 --> 00:10:45.940
and you think it through.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.110
So let me give you two
examples of sponsorship,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.024
one good and one bad.

00:10:49.024 --> 00:10:50.440
The example I used
in the book was

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.630
a company called Action Coach.

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.730
Action Coach worked with
small-to-medium-size

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.990
enterprises.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.830
And their job is that they
basically go into companies

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.960
and they teach them how
to be more competitive.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.280
So that may be how to take
risks in certain markets.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.520
Or they may say to them,
look, your targeted market

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.370
is far too broad.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.105
You're never going
to reach everybody.

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:13.647
You need to try a
little bit tighter.

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:15.688
Or it may be that you just
don't know what you're

00:11:15.688 --> 00:11:16.800
doing, in terms of money.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.928
So we need to actually
teach you a little bit more

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.190
about profit and loss,
and how to manage money

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:22.806
and how to look after cash flow.

00:11:22.806 --> 00:11:24.680
And basically, they work
with small business,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.897
trying to get them
to the next step.

00:11:26.897 --> 00:11:27.980
They're based in Ballymun.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.350
And they're very passionate
about being in Ballymun,

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.870
and what can they do
for people in Ballymun?

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.320
And I'm going to be shot at.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.690
There's a rugby player--

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.370
I'm hopeless on sports--

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.820
who's from Ballymun.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.000
Does anybody know who
I'm talking about?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.725
Anyway, or he could
be a golf player.

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.950
Anyway, there's a guy who's
a very well-known sports

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.530
person from Ballymun.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.400
And they met him
at a talk one day.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.010
Literally, they were just
sitting, listening to him talk.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.175
And he was talking
about the fact

00:11:50.175 --> 00:11:51.410
that he'd come from Ballymun.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.630
His family were very poor.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.560
He'd done very well.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.170
He was looking to give
something back to the area.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.640
It started them thinking.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.360
They developed a board game.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.950
The board game teaches you how
to deal with profit and loss,

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:06.010
how to look after cash
flow, how to take risks,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.445
how to analyze risks.

00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:09.103
And they decided
what they would do,

00:12:09.103 --> 00:12:10.686
is they would work
with local schools.

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:12.680
And they would go
into local schools

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:15.290
and create a competition,
but teach children

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.490
how to build up these skills.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.357
And they objective was twofold.

00:12:19.357 --> 00:12:21.440
One was that they might
actually find that they've

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.300
an iotnerest in commerce
or becoming enterepreneurs,

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.750
or owning their own
business. but the second

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:28.878
was that if they
never did, they'd

00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:31.044
have developed skills which
were useful for the rest

00:12:31.044 --> 00:12:32.470
of their lives.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.210
And that's a really good
example of sponsorship.

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.053
Another example, by
comparison, you're

00:12:38.053 --> 00:12:40.236
in what we all call
Googleland now.

00:12:40.236 --> 00:12:42.717
But I used to live around
the corner, on Ringsend road.

00:12:42.717 --> 00:12:44.800
So I don't know whether
you should be welcoming me

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.570
to Googleland or I should be
thanking you for inviting me

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:47.320
back home again.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.002
But I've lived on Ringsend Road.

00:12:49.002 --> 00:12:51.210
And I was very involved in
the community in Ringsend.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.410
Because I lived
there all my life.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.000
I got married, moved
away, came back

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.131
to live there when
I was married.

00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:58.630
I only moved out
about 15 years ago.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.310
And I just love being
involved in community.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.847
Because I think
it's who we all are.

00:13:02.847 --> 00:13:05.180
We don't have enough community
involvement, whether it's

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.013
community of interest,
or physical community

00:13:07.013 --> 00:13:07.750
in which we live.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.240
We had a Glamourous
Granny competition

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.221
quite a few years ago.

00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:13.720
And the Glamorous
Granny competition

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.365
was sponsored by the
local beauticians, which I

00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:18.246
thought was a really nice fit.

00:13:18.246 --> 00:13:19.218
It was clever.

00:13:19.218 --> 00:13:20.880
The Glamourous
Grannies all came in.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.530
And they ranged in age.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.760
At that time, I've gone
back probably 20 years,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.560
from 55 to 75.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.760
Now they range in
age from 35 to 75.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.650
But they ranged in age
from about 55 to 75.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:34.230
So most of the ladies came in.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.446
And they had that
lovely gray, buffed hair

00:13:36.446 --> 00:13:38.570
that looked like they'd
just taken the curlers out.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.300
You know that look
that people have?

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.800
Who

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.650
And they came up and they sang.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.190
They talked about their
three children and their two

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.950
grandchildren, and how old they
were and what their names were.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.500
Very nice, very
pleasant evening.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.690
All of the husbands, by
the way, who were alive,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:53.440
came in and stood.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.515
Only came in for
"her" bit, and came in

00:13:55.515 --> 00:13:57.076
and stood at the
end of the hall,

00:13:57.076 --> 00:13:59.200
watch her, and went that's
fine, and went back off,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.659
out for a pint
again, and wouldn't

00:14:00.659 --> 00:14:01.950
stay for the rest of the night.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.300
But they did their bit.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.590
They did it really well.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.440
And the beauticians was ggiving
the prize for whatever it was.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.910
200 euros worth of goods
in the beauticians.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.822
They sent in a young model
to present the pirze.

00:14:14.822 --> 00:14:16.530
So you've got a roomful
of people who are

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.810
55, 75 years age, all female.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.240
And they send in this
absolutely drop-dead

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.345
gorgeous-looking girl.

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:24.460
She was tall.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.870
She was stick-insect thin.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.520
She was on heels
this high, like she

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.230
was teetering on Jimmy Choos.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.730
She walked the way models do.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.724
They kind of walk like
cats on high heels.

00:14:32.724 --> 00:14:35.452
And she strutted her stuff
all the way up the stage.

00:14:35.452 --> 00:14:36.680
She looked amazing.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.680
She came up and she
presented all of the prizes.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.800
And what everybody did in the
audience, as she walked past,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.240
was say, oh my god, look at
the height of those heels.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.220
Can you remember ever
wearing heels that high?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.280
Oh yeah, but it was before
I had my first child.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.850
Never wore heels
that high since.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.280
Look at her little waist.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.460
She's a size 8.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.406
It'd say she's a size 10.

00:14:57.406 --> 00:14:57.905
[GASPS]

00:14:57.905 --> 00:14:59.356
I was never a size 10.

00:14:59.356 --> 00:15:00.730
The smallest I
ever was was a 12.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.910
And actually what they did
was they reminded people

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.930
of what it was like
to be young or single,

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.340
or before they had children.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.610
They brought them
back to their 20s.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:12.745
They did not target them
as 55-to-75-year-olds.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.651
What they should have
done, in my opinion,

00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:16.650
was they should have got
somebody who was either

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.149
very well-known in
the community who

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.770
was of that age, or the
previous winner, the last year,

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.020
and brought her in
and pampered her.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.620
So that somebody in their 60s
or 70s preseneted the prize.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.780
And instead of saying,
look at her little waist,

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.380
and do you remember
those high heels?

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.310
You would actually say, my
god, look at the change in her?

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:34.771
Doesn't she look amazing?

00:15:34.771 --> 00:15:37.990
Actually, this is what the
beauticians did because it then

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.570
reminds people, it makes
the association with people.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.140
And that, to my idea, would
have been a good sponsorship.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.099
They actually misfired.

00:15:45.099 --> 00:15:46.889
They sponsored, they
put the money into it.

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:48.930
They sent somebody in
to present the prizes.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.232
I doubt that anybody
even connected the two.

00:15:51.232 --> 00:15:52.190
It's not about selling.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.106
But I doubt that anybody
walked past and said,

00:15:54.106 --> 00:15:56.170
that's the beauticians
that sponsored.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.940
Because they didn't
make that connection.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.496
So sponsorship,
very little money.

00:16:00.496 --> 00:16:01.870
The other thing
with sponsorship,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.423
just as I think of it, when
we moved back into Ringsend,

00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:08.410
we moved back after
oh, I don't know.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.640
I'd grown up and lived
there till I was about 18.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.907
And I moved back about
oh, probably 25 years ago.

00:16:13.907 --> 00:16:15.490
And when I moved
back, they were still

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.300
delivering milk to the door.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.850
But I'm what everybody
calls a yuppy.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:19.996
So I'm gone early
morning in the morning

00:16:19.996 --> 00:16:21.190
and I'm back late
in the evening.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.795
Ilove the way Ringsenders always
have their own pronunciations

00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:23.420
and everything.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.129
Dubliners do it
as a general rule.

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:26.420
So I was gone early in the day.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.460
And literally, it
got to the stage

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.710
where you'd come outside
the door in the morning

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.654
and go, oh, for God's
sake, there's no milk.

00:16:30.654 --> 00:16:33.530
Or you come out and go, yippe
ki-yay, we have milk today.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.680
And it drove me insane.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.430
So at one stage I met with
one of the neighbors and said,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.520
well, do me a favor.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.580
If you see the milkman,
find out what I owe him.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.177
Pay him off.

00:16:40.177 --> 00:16:41.260
Tell him thanks very much.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.610
I'm going to just get
the milk as I need it.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.516
And she said, really?

00:16:45.516 --> 00:16:47.156
What'd the milkman do on you?

00:16:47.156 --> 00:16:49.130
What's the problem
with the milkman?

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.130
And I said, there's no
problem with the milkman.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.840
It's just that the
milk is there some days

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.830
and it's not there other days.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:55.450
And she said, oh I
see, Ms. Gunning.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.516
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:16:56.516 --> 00:16:57.890
We're not all like
you, you know.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.534
We don't all leave in the
middle of the night, come back

00:16:59.534 --> 00:17:00.659
in the middle of the night.

00:17:00.659 --> 00:17:02.448
That poor man gets
up at four o'clock

00:17:02.448 --> 00:17:03.906
in the morning to
deliver the milk.

00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:04.339
I said, I know.

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.839
But he should be
getting up at 3:30.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.110
Free Because I don't get
the milk outside the door.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.654
She said, I'll tell
you what I'll do.

00:17:09.654 --> 00:17:11.154
When I'm passing
by, if there's milk

00:17:11.154 --> 00:17:12.981
outside your door in
the morning, I'll take

00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:14.230
and I'll put it into the shop.

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.650
And I'll keep it cold for you.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.025
And you can collect it from
the shop in the evning.

00:17:17.025 --> 00:17:18.250
I said, just think about this.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.083
This is not logical.

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:21.473
He jumps outof the van,
leaves me the milk.

00:17:21.473 --> 00:17:22.931
You come by and go
oh look, there's

00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:24.390
the milk-- because I've already
left-- and brings it down

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:25.480
to the shop.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.380
It's just crazy.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.900
Just pay the guy off and
tell me how much I owe.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.385
And she said, no, no, no.

00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:31.600
You don't understand.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.740
This man goes out of his way.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.320
He's been delivering milk in
this area for years and years.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.450
And he goes out of his way
to sponsor the local soccer

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.619
club every year.

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:43.285
He buys them a whole
section of jerseys.

00:17:43.285 --> 00:17:46.365
I thought it was a brilliant
example of somebody who

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:47.859
had connected to the community.

00:17:47.859 --> 00:17:48.650
I wasn't connected.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.520
I didn't have kids.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.790
I didn't respectwhat
this man was doing.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.792
What she did and the
whole community did,

00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:54.970
and that's why we
buy our milk fromhim.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.210
The man has to earn a living.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:57.001
And he's very good.

00:17:57.001 --> 00:17:58.940
And he doesn't have
to buy these T-shirts.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.195
And it really brought
it home that sponsorship

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:05.020
had such a long-term impact
on people around you.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.129
That man was getting
business because people

00:18:07.129 --> 00:18:09.420
who were grandparents or
people like me who had no kids

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.442
were told, he's
earning his lving.

00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:13.050
He's contributing
to the community.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.160
So good sponsorships.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.170
Well, I don't know what it
cost him for a set of jerseys

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.004
for a football team.

00:18:18.004 --> 00:18:19.545
But it wasn't a huge
amount of money.

00:18:19.545 --> 00:18:22.380
But he got the return out of it
year on year, on year on year.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.840
So sponsorship, second one.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.090
Third one is exhibitions.

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.680
The number of people who
don't use exhibitions

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.706
properly-- exhibitions,
you're going to pay to attend.

00:18:31.706 --> 00:18:33.550
So you've decided as
a business that this

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.140
is where you should be.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.430
But the number of businesses
who don't then follow through--

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.425
if you book an exhibition and
you book it early, if you know

00:18:41.425 --> 00:18:44.137
in January that you're doing
an exhibition in September,

00:18:44.137 --> 00:18:46.720
what happens is that people send
you out all of these notices.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.964
The exhibition organizers
send you notices and say,

00:18:48.964 --> 00:18:51.380
so will you be doing anything
different at the exhibition?

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.046
Are you launching
anything extraoridnry?

00:18:53.046 --> 00:18:54.670
Do you have any unusual guests?

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.130
is there anything you want to
tell us about your stall that

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.605
makes it different?

00:18:58.605 --> 00:18:59.980
Small-to-medium-size
enterprises,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.321
because they're busy, look
at it and go, for God's sake,

00:19:02.321 --> 00:19:04.820
how do I know in Januaray what
I'm going to do in September?

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.725
So they leave it.

00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:08.100
They just throw it to one side
and say, I'll do it later.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.260
And then come August, they
fill in all the information.

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.120
And whoever was
organizing has already

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.340
decided who gets the publicity.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.410
Because in January or February,
the organizer is saying,

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.740
I need to know where my
stories are coming from.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.780
So if you take the
trouble to tell me

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.970
that you're doing something
different, I'll promote you.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.440
So it's free PR that's sitting
there, waiting for them.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.065
But people don't
actually take the time

00:19:30.065 --> 00:19:32.610
to do it because they need
to move so much earlier.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.110
And really, if they
did, they'd have

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.910
a whole team of professional
people promoting them.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.660
It's a no-brainer.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.010
It should make sense.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.660
I was on an exhibition
for TY students, students

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.245
and teachers, last year, just
before the book came out.

00:19:46.245 --> 00:19:49.581
And there was a company called
High Rock Productions, who had

00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:50.830
taken an exhibition stand out.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.450
And the exhibition was huge.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.730
It was in this massive
warehouse in Carlow somewhere.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.530
We came into the warehouse.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.260
And every single
stand has something

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.730
for transitionary students.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.570
So you had, "Learn to
Climb the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:07.230
we'll teach you how to
make presentation skills,

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.670
come kayaking with us--

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.230
whole loads of it-- we
teach you first aid.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.719
A mix between the
skills that you

00:20:15.719 --> 00:20:17.260
would use as an
individual and things

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.809
that you went out
and did as groups.

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:21.850
And this particular group,
High Rock Productions,

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.577
I stopped because when
I came round the corner,

00:20:24.577 --> 00:20:26.160
there was an entire
square closed off.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.810
Now, what they actually
do is they go into schools

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.330
and they help
children speak Irish.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.970
So they prep them for
their oral Irish exams.

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.075
But they do it by
creating this play.

00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:37.094
So it's very creative.

00:20:37.094 --> 00:20:38.260
They work with the children.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.140
They create this play.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.970
And when they've made this
play, they help to put it on.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.960
It's all true Irish.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.260
So they become more confident
about speaking the language.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.689
Very hard thing to promote
to children, most of whom

00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:51.170
probably haven't an interest
in and oral Irish and "exams,"

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.710
and they're looking at
TY, which is the year

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:53.790
in between their exams.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.430
So they're not focusing on it.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.814
And what this group had done
was they had taken a square.

00:20:57.814 --> 00:20:59.730
They had about three
times the amount of space

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.813
that they should have had.

00:21:00.813 --> 00:21:02.910
So they'd taken a square
in from of the stand.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:03.868
And they closed it off.

00:21:03.868 --> 00:21:05.710
And they were playing
virtual tennis.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:07.247
It was absolutely brilliant.

00:21:07.247 --> 00:21:09.580
Because one of the guys was
tehre and he was saying, OK,

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.163
are you ready?

00:21:10.163 --> 00:21:12.560
Serve-- step off
the court, please.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.480
You're on the court.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.230
Get off the court.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.510
And as people walked
past, they went, here?

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.120
Oh, sorry.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:17.690
Sorry.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.202
Am I OK?

00:21:18.202 --> 00:21:18.910
Back, back, back.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.355
And everybody got it.

00:21:20.355 --> 00:21:21.350
There was nothing.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.630
There was absolutely nothing.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.296
But everybody go it
and they stood back.

00:21:24.296 --> 00:21:27.040
And when the ball went out of
play, they would say, sorry,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:27.740
could I have the ball there?

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:28.250
Yeah.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.660
No, no, at your other foot.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.160
There?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.460
Yeah.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:30.760
Can you throw it?

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.400
Thank you.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.584
Yeah, got it.

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.210
And everybody stopped to watch.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:35.380
It was brilliant.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.410
It took a huge amount of
attention to their side.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.188
And they gave everybody
leaflets about what they did.

00:21:41.188 --> 00:21:44.650
I thought it was
really, really clever.

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:46.210
When I interviewed
them afterwards,

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:47.980
I said, by the way,
brilliant idea.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.022
You took over so
much space, lads.

00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:50.521
Smart.

00:21:50.521 --> 00:21:53.062
And they said, yeah,
but I'm not sure it was

00:21:53.062 --> 00:21:54.270
as smart as it could've been.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.750
Because it targeted
all of the children.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.500
And their query was that
the exhibition was targeted

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.510
to both children and teachers.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.150
And with hindsight,
they weren't sure

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.285
if you could target
both in one exhibition.

00:22:05.285 --> 00:22:07.645
And what they had done
was they had successfully

00:22:07.645 --> 00:22:10.053
got all of the children involed.

00:22:10.053 --> 00:22:13.060
But the children didn't decide
what they would do in TY year.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.440
The teachers did.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.970
So they'd actually misfired.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.231
They got loads of attention.

00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:18.980
They got loads of kids
talking about them.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.500
But they didn't have the teacher
saying, what a good idea.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.230
And people didn't
connect virtual tennis

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.656
with what they were
actually doing.

00:22:27.656 --> 00:22:29.870
So it was interesting,
because to my eyes, coming in

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.480
as an outsider, I
thought, very smart.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.480
You've captured the whole room.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.270
When they analyzed it
aftweard they thought,

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.740
good btu not as brilliant
as it could've been.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.860
I suppose one of the things that
I'm really conscious of the PR

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.120
is that it's not rocket science.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.570
It does take a lot of time.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.030
But most of the skills
can be easily learned.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.705
But it's about not
doing things on the fly.

00:22:52.705 --> 00:22:54.429
Because PR doesn't
respond well to things

00:22:54.429 --> 00:22:55.470
that are done on the fly.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.095
You end up saying
why didn't that work?

00:22:57.095 --> 00:22:59.081
I've put loads of time
into it on short notice.

00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:00.830
It works really well
if you sit down early

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.830
and say, who am I
trying to reach?

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.340
What am I trying to acheive?

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.250
How do I get them?

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.172
What are they interested in?

00:23:07.172 --> 00:23:11.322
One of the very clever companies
that I profiled in the book

00:23:11.322 --> 00:23:13.914
was Newbridge Silver.

00:23:13.914 --> 00:23:15.830
I'm a big believer in
third-party endorsement.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:18.534
If you stand up and say I
run a wonderful business.

00:23:18.534 --> 00:23:20.025
That's a marvelous business.

00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:21.650
Everybody here just
loves what they do.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.100
We provide great quality
product, or whwatever.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.775
Everybody would say, well, you
would say that, wouldn't you?

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:28.900
Which is fair enough,
because you're not going say,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.032
I run a rubbish business.

00:23:30.032 --> 00:23:31.240
Who was the guy who did that?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.090
His junior business went bust.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.300
There was a man who famously
said he just produces

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.780
junk jewelry and people buy it.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.732
And the entire business went
bust very shortly afterwards.

00:23:39.732 --> 00:23:41.982
Because everybody said, well,
I buy that junk jewelry.

00:23:41.982 --> 00:23:43.220
And he thinks it's junk?

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.250
Why do I waste my
time buying it.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.090
But as a general
rule, you're looking

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:50.300
at third-party endorsement is
where somebody says of you,

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.320
it's good.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.240
Or where you create
an association.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.750
And Newbridge are very clever
at creating the association.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.800
They came up with this
idea of style ambassadors.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.550
So instead of it
just being jewelry,

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.580
they started using
people like Amy Huberman

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.730
and Naomi Campbell and
Ronan O'Gara, and saying,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.725
OK, these are people who you
can associate with our jewelry.

00:24:12.725 --> 00:24:14.945
Interestingly enough,
they used Linda Gray.

00:24:14.945 --> 00:24:17.078
You know the lady from "Dallas?"

00:24:17.078 --> 00:24:18.050
That's interesting.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.510
How many people actually know
Linda Gray from "Dallas?"

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.020
Very few.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:22.520
Excellent.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.170
Thank you.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.087
It makes my point.

00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.420
Because she was introduced
on "The Late Late" years ago,

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.830
when they started using her
And she was wearing big,

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:29.910
chunky Newbridge jewelry.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:30.410
Now,

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.147
Now, she's a fabulous woman.

00:24:32.147 --> 00:24:33.730
She was about in her
70's at the time.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.619
You would've given her
like, 52 at the most.

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:36.410
She looked amazing.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.460
And she was wearing
this chunky jewelry.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.940
And you looked and
thought, she actually

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.046
isn't the type of person
who wears chunky jewelry.

00:24:43.046 --> 00:24:46.865
If she had been doing Newbridge
Cutlery, dining at home,

00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:49.990
and here's how the
posh dine, it probably

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.800
would've sat much more easily.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.774
But doing chukny
jewelry at her age,

00:24:53.774 --> 00:24:55.940
even though she was glamourous,
didn't seem to work.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.830
But it did work very well
with the likes of Amy Huberman

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.140
and Naomi Campbell.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.102
And what they do is they
associate the people

00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:03.810
with the product.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:06.890
So if they're stylish and
tehy wear our product,

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.094
you should do the same.

00:25:08.094 --> 00:25:10.635
Very interestingly, when I spoke
to the lady who coordinates,

00:25:10.635 --> 00:25:13.292
their brand ambassadors,
I said to them,

00:25:13.292 --> 00:25:14.390
it must be very difficult.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.770
Because I innocently assumed
that if you were Amy Huberman

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:21.352
and you were wearing Newbridge,
that as Newbridge you

00:25:21.352 --> 00:25:22.727
would say, by the
way, sweet pea,

00:25:22.727 --> 00:25:24.727
I do not want you wearing
anybody else's jewelry

00:25:24.727 --> 00:25:26.890
because we're paying
you shedloads of money.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.770
So I expect to see
you in Newbridge only.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.400
And she said, oh God, no.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.350
No, no, no.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:34.730
Because nobody who follows Amy
Huberman will believe that.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:37.070
They would know that of
course she has her own style

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.320
and she wears any one of a
number of different things.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.480
So when she chooses
to wear Newbridge,

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.010
we're happy that she does so.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.890
But when she chooses
to wear somebody else,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.770
we're equally happy.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.540
And I thought it
was very clever.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:49.120
Because it then
doesn't look like we

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.930
pay you to wear this
jewelry all the time.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.300
It looks like yes, you're
a brand ambassador,

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.000
but when you feel
like wearing it.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.094
And she actually
wore a long chain.

00:25:56.094 --> 00:25:58.552
When she announced that she
was expecting her second child,

00:25:58.552 --> 00:26:00.050
she wore a long Newbridge chain.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.340
And she tweeted because
she's a mad tweeter.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.050
And she tweeted
something about the coat.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:05.810
I can't remember.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.140
"Bump by BOD, chain
by Newbridge."

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:09.990
And they sold out.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.825
They had no idea she
was going to do it.

00:26:11.825 --> 00:26:14.070
They knew when she was
doing the photo, apparently,

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.040
that she was pregnant.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.494
But she didn't want to
say anything about it.

00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:17.650
And when she
eventually tweeted it,

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:18.941
it was just like it's her call.

00:26:18.941 --> 00:26:19.820
It's her baby.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.750
So she tweeted it.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.040
They weren't expecting it.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.354
They sold out of the chain.

00:26:23.354 --> 00:26:24.770
They went into a
second production

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.377
and sold out of the
second production

00:26:26.377 --> 00:26:28.400
as well, the number
of people who

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.500
just wanted to buy that chain.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.330
So the association from
their point of view

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:33.380
worked really well.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.830
They associated with people
that people want to look like,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.310
or people want to emulate.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.699
And they followed that through
with the Museum of Style Icons.

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:42.740
So they actually have all
of these clothes, which

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.656
are actually, if you've
been down to see them,

00:26:44.656 --> 00:26:47.270
the clothes are moth
eaten and it's incredible,

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.530
how old the clothes are.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.210
But they were Audrey Hepburn's.

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.470
Or they were--
who's the lady who

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.010
went to become Princess
Grace of Monacco?

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.760
Grace Kelly.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.460
So you end up looking at these
clothes thinking, wow, that's

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.180
what people acutally wore.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.471
Did anybody go down for the
Michael Jackson exhibition,

00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:02.405
by the way?

00:27:02.405 --> 00:27:05.270
They had Michael
Jackson's clothes.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.385
You know the famous
glove, the sparkly glove?

00:27:07.385 --> 00:27:08.060
They had it.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.440
I just decided I had to go down.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.650
You never saw anything
like the trousers.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.360
I actually said to
sombody, are they real?

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.776
The trousers were
about this wide.

00:27:13.776 --> 00:27:15.720
My god, he was tiny.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.160
A size eight would
have been giant.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.700
He was absolutely tiny.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.565
But they actually
made that association.

00:27:22.565 --> 00:27:23.960
And it's clever.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.970
It's an association with
style, with glamour.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:26.540
You call in.

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.770
You buy some of the product.

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:28.695
You've made the link.

00:27:28.695 --> 00:27:29.840
Very, very smart.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.150
And they also work with Audrey
Hepburn's and Grace Kelly's

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.510
Foundation.

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.280
So that they approve
whatever it is

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.592
that they design that they use.

00:27:37.592 --> 00:27:39.300
So this would have
been the kind of thing

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.790
that Grace Kelly
would have used.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.800
So it carries her name with it.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.450
Very, very smart.

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:48.020
Much simpler third-party
endorsement, if you like,

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.022
when I was talking about
the book to Bobby Kerr

00:27:51.022 --> 00:27:54.439
on "Newstalk," he had said
to me, OK, what I'll do

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.230
is I'll just use the
examples that we used.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:57.220
And I said sure, I don't mind.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.928
Ask me abotu anything
that's in the book.

00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:00.246
I'm happy to talk about it.

00:28:00.246 --> 00:28:01.995
So he actually talked
about Jackie Martin.

00:28:01.995 --> 00:28:04.360
Then he talked about
Jack Murray's company.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.863
I mean, it's a what, 10
or 12-minute interview?

00:28:06.863 --> 00:28:08.863
So we went trhough the
interview and we chatted.

00:28:08.863 --> 00:28:10.238
And I ssaid, oh
this guy's crazy.

00:28:10.238 --> 00:28:13.710
If you go into his office, the
walls are papered with paper.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.000
And every piece of paper has
this tweet, how many retweets?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.900
What was the reach?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:18.710
Is it worth doing?

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:19.294
Did it work?

00:28:19.294 --> 00:28:20.210
Should we do it again?

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.460
He data mines within
an inch of his life.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.305
And it just seems so
strange that it's all

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:25.400
on paper around the walls.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.260
But I presume it's
because it surrounds him

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.926
and it reminds him,
this is what we are.

00:28:28.926 --> 00:28:30.620
This is what we do.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.425
Did the interview.

00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:32.030
Happy out.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.480
Promotion for the book.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.270
My job was done.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.030
That was on a Saturday.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.410
On Sunday, as I was
driving somewhere,

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.980
I got a text from Jack
to say, thanks very much

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.030
for the kind words about
my business yesterday.

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.494
I knew his father was ill.

00:28:45.494 --> 00:28:47.940
And he said, unfortunately,
my father has died.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.765
And somebody heard the interview
on the way to the funeral,

00:28:50.765 --> 00:28:52.860
and very kind of you to
say such nice things.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.400
And I thought, that's
very decent of him to text

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.120
and let me know.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.070
So I said, sorry to
hear about your dad.

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.710
And thanks for the comments.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.550
And then on the following
Friday, I came into the office.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.610
And there's this
huge box of cupcakes.

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.400
So I said oh, lads,who's
sending us cupcakes?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.161
And he said, us?

00:29:08.161 --> 00:29:08.660
Us?

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.546
It specifically
says, Ellen Gunnings.

00:29:10.546 --> 00:29:11.940
Oh, it's all about me.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.800
Who's sending me cupcakes?

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.770
And inside was a note.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.665
There was a dozen cupcakes and a
note from the same Jack saying,

00:29:18.665 --> 00:29:21.499
Ellen, thank you very much
for all of the comments

00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:22.040
on "Newtalk."

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.627
You wouldn't believe
how much business

00:29:23.627 --> 00:29:24.710
we got out the back of it.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.227
Best regards, Jack.

00:29:27.227 --> 00:29:28.560
I wasn't promoting his business.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.211
I wasn't flogging his business.

00:29:30.211 --> 00:29:31.210
I wasn't advertising it.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:33.865
I was just saying, he's
really good at what he does.

00:29:33.865 --> 00:29:36.080
And that's a
third-party endorsement.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.050
That's somebody else saying
it with no axe to grind.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:40.977
And that is very, very powerful.

00:29:40.977 --> 00:29:43.060
And that's something,
actually, that you in Google

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.370
can do very easily.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.700
You work with SMEs.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.677
You've already gone
through who they are.

00:29:48.677 --> 00:29:49.760
You've cross checked them.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.040
You think they have
something of value

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.970
that you can invest your time or
your money or your energy into.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.670
Is there a way that you
can actually say to people,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:59.444
do you know what?

00:29:59.444 --> 00:30:01.150
There is a way
that you can brand.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.025
You can say brand
Google works with you.

00:30:04.025 --> 00:30:06.150
So that they can take that
to other people and say,

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.941
it's not just me saying
I know what I'm at.

00:30:07.941 --> 00:30:11.616
Google believes I know what
I'm at, so just to leave you

00:30:11.616 --> 00:30:12.365
with that thought.

00:30:12.365 --> 00:30:14.976
There are six other
hot tips in the book.

00:30:14.976 --> 00:30:16.976
I'm happy to go through
all of them if you wish.

00:30:16.976 --> 00:30:18.900
But I might actually give
you a chance, because you're

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.030
sitting quietly, nodding.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.820
And I'm much more comfortable
when people are interrupting

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.020
the hell out of me.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.520
So I might let you ask a few
questions and see what happens.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.906
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: Thanks.

00:30:25.906 --> 00:30:26.680
ELLEN GUNNING: Thanks a million.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.555
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
Thanks a million, Ellen.

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:30.411
That was fantastic, wasn't it?

00:30:30.411 --> 00:30:33.862
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:35.363 --> 00:30:37.404
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: So
will we jump straight in?

00:30:37.404 --> 00:30:39.140
Does anyone have
a burning question

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.120
that they'd like to ask?

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.340
We've got two microphones
to pass around.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:44.610
ELLEN GUNNING: Burning
questions are really good.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:45.235
Nothing normal.

00:30:45.235 --> 00:30:46.255
Go for it.

00:30:46.255 --> 00:30:47.921
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
OK, so while you're

00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:52.050
building up some confidence
and trying to think about it,

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:57.040
I'd like to know, Ellen, you
touched on it very briefly

00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.550
about your audience and
considering who exactly

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.700
am I trying to reach?

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.863
So other than just asking
yourself those really specific

00:31:05.863 --> 00:31:09.610
questions, what else can
we be asking ourselves?

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:12.240
Or how else can we really
answer that question?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.540
ELLEN GUNNING: I think the
trap most people fall into,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.210
we all look to reach people
using the same methods

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:19.230
that we used.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.879
So if I read "The
Irish Times," I

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:22.420
assume that everybody
I want to reach

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.046
will read "The Irish Times."

00:31:23.046 --> 00:31:25.060
If I live on social
media, I assume they all

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.590
live on social media.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.584
What happens is we forget
to look at the other side.

00:31:29.584 --> 00:31:30.750
I call it where people feed.

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.780
I atteneded a conference
a few years back.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.682
And the guy talked
about chasing pigeons.

00:31:35.682 --> 00:31:37.640
I don't know if you've
heard this story before.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.348
It was brilliant.

00:31:38.348 --> 00:31:40.325
And he talked about
if you chase pigeons.

00:31:40.325 --> 00:31:43.000
If you try to feed pigeons
and you chase them in a park,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.150
the pigeons fly away.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:44.754
Like, go away.

00:31:44.754 --> 00:31:45.420
Stop chasing me.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.420
You're bothering me.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.666
Watch the old man who
sits down on the park seat

00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:50.082
and he just keeps
dropping crumbs.

00:31:50.082 --> 00:31:51.966
And the pigeons come to him.

00:31:51.966 --> 00:31:54.340
And it's about knowing, what
are the pigeons looking for?

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:54.610
Bread.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.550
They're not looking for hassle.

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:56.390
They'll come to you.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.931
And the more often they come to
you, the more they trust you.

00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:01.290
And they more you build
up their confidence.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.110
With any kind of an
audience, your problem

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.235
is that you look at them
from the inside out.

00:32:06.235 --> 00:32:08.100
You should look
from the outside in.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.840
The chances are,
with any business,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:10.980
you actually need to use--

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.274
they said originally, when radio
was overtaken by television

00:32:15.274 --> 00:32:16.815
or when television
was invented, they

00:32:16.815 --> 00:32:18.020
said it was the death of radio.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.464
When newspapers
gave in, they said

00:32:19.464 --> 00:32:20.880
it was the death
of something else.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.046
When socieal media came in,
they said, oh that's it.

00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:24.780
People will only
use social media.

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.100
It's actually not true.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.950
We did an interview
at the weekend.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:30.688
We're teaching a TV
presenters course.

00:32:30.688 --> 00:32:32.063
And we were doing
mock interviews

00:32:32.063 --> 00:32:34.062
in advance of the way the
thing for the show is.

00:32:36.349 --> 00:32:38.140
Students were just
interviewing each other.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.405
They're all adults.

00:32:39.405 --> 00:32:40.740
They're all over 20-odd.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.700
And [INAUDIBLE],,
who was leading it,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.908
said to one of the girls,
what are you interseted in?

00:32:44.908 --> 00:32:46.100
And she said, acting.

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.808
And he said to the
other girl, brilliant.

00:32:47.808 --> 00:32:50.010
So ask her about Meryl
Streep's speech, Donald Trump

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:53.600
retweeting, the Golden Globes,
all that kind of stuff.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.090
It was fascinating to watch.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:57.389
So Meryl Streep's speech--

00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:59.680
you are all familiar that
Marilyn Streep made a speech?

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.307
OK, just checking.

00:33:02.307 --> 00:33:04.640
Meryl Streep's speech at the
Golden Globes, what did you

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.163
think of it.

00:33:05.163 --> 00:33:06.412
And she said oh, I don't know.

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:07.120
I didn't hear it.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.614
What was it about?

00:33:08.614 --> 00:33:09.599
And she OK.

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:11.390
And she gave her a very
quick explanaation.

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.930
And she said, uh--

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.720
and Donald Trump
retweeted, you know,

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.928
"the most overrated actress
in America," or whatever.

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.654
And she said, yeah,
I didn't see that.

00:33:18.654 --> 00:33:21.560
And she said, OK, well, what
do you think about the fact

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:25.516
that the President-elect is
tweeting about an actress?

00:33:25.516 --> 00:33:26.940
And she said, I don't know.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.190
I haven't seen any of it.

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:29.000
I have no idea.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.936
I catch up on all my social
media on Sunday mornings.

00:33:32.936 --> 00:33:34.580
And it was eye-opening.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.710
It was like,
everybody in the room

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.430
assumed everybody had
heard Meryl Streep.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:40.690
How could you miss it?

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.110
Because it had been tackled
from so many different angles.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.813
And in her world,
Sunday morning was when

00:33:45.813 --> 00:33:47.035
she caught up on everything.

00:33:47.035 --> 00:33:49.410
So it's looking at your audience
from their point of view

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.840
and saying, if they're
Sunday newspaper readers,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.465
then that's where
you need to get them.

00:33:53.465 --> 00:33:55.798
It doesn't matter that you
can be all over social media.

00:33:55.798 --> 00:33:56.646
They don't find you.

00:33:56.646 --> 00:33:58.520
It's they're social
media people, then where?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.360
What bloggers do
they actually read?

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.460
Who influences them?

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:02.799
Who do they think is rubbish?

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.090
Who do they think is brilliant?

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:07.360
If it's radio, which radio
stations do they listen to?

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.789
So are they "Newtalk"
listeners or RTE 1 listeners?

00:34:09.789 --> 00:34:11.570
It's a different listener.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.976
You tune to the dial and
you stay, more or less,

00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:15.850
on the dial if you're
of a certain age group.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.320
And then if you're of a
certain age group as well,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.260
do you actually go
hunting for information?

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.830
Or does it come
into you by email?

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.111
So it's really breaking
down your audience,

00:34:25.111 --> 00:34:26.694
and probably choosing
a different tune

00:34:26.694 --> 00:34:28.100
for ech subsection.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.212
That's a very long answer
to a very short question.

00:34:29.212 --> 00:34:29.614
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's great.

00:34:29.614 --> 00:34:30.016
ELLEN GUNNING: Sorry.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:30.850
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN: No,
that's a great answer.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:31.314
Thank you very much.

00:34:31.314 --> 00:34:32.814
We've got a question
here, don't we?

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.786
AUDIENCE: I was thinking, first
of all, thanks for the talk.

00:34:40.786 --> 00:34:42.729
I was thinking in
terms of sponsorships.

00:34:42.729 --> 00:34:47.219
I think most of us here are
ex-pats or not from Ireland.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.310
So we're that deep
into the community,

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.260
as some of the initial
examples that you had.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.106
What would be some
of the easy ways

00:34:53.106 --> 00:34:55.280
to get into getting
a sponsorship,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.040
or getting in touch with people?

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.775
What would be some of
the first couple of steps

00:34:59.775 --> 00:35:01.390
to getting into sponsorships?

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.085
ELLEN GUNNING: To actually find
something that's sponsoring,

00:35:04.085 --> 00:35:05.340
I would go the other
way around with it.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.506
If you're not from Ireland,
I would choose something

00:35:07.506 --> 00:35:09.350
that was unique to you.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.621
So it might be Brazilian
movies or something.

00:35:11.621 --> 00:35:12.990
And you think, OK.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.990
Have a look at the
community and see where

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.190
is there a community week?

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.189
And if there's a community
week, is there a role

00:35:18.189 --> 00:35:19.857
in there somewhere for movies?

00:35:19.857 --> 00:35:22.190
And as part of the movies,
we can show Brazilian movies.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.660
It depends on what
the connection

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.370
is that you're trying to make.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.671
But it also sets you up.

00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:27.920
You're the logical connection.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.660
So you can actually
introduce yourself and say,

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:29.990
I'm Brazilian.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.975
That's why I'm passionate
about Brazilian movies.

00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:32.750
You never would've guessed.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:34.210
And people will go,
oh, is that why?

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.450
Because people won't
make a connection

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.324
unless you tell them.

00:35:36.324 --> 00:35:37.445
That's the other thing.

00:35:37.445 --> 00:35:39.020
They will say you're an
"ex-pat," or whatever.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.353
You're not Irish, but they
won't know where you're from.

00:35:41.353 --> 00:35:44.110
So I would look for something
that is close to your heart,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.340
that you're an expert in,
that you can offer to sponsor.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.140
But it's more work.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.890
It means that you need to set
it up, create it, and run it.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.210
But if you do, people will come.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.960
When I did the first
Active Age week,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.095
everybody told me that
I was wasting my time.

00:35:58.095 --> 00:35:59.720
And if I was looking
at creating things

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.971
for senior citizens, what they
were interested in was bingo.

00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:04.091
So if I did bingo--

00:36:04.091 --> 00:36:04.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:04.830
Honest to God.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.204
So if I did bingo seven nights
a week, they'd be happier.

00:36:07.204 --> 00:36:08.620
And I said, look at this face.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.030
Does this look like a face
that ever played bingo?

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.190
Or has any desire to
create bingo nights?

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.190
Not happening.

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:17.273
But what I will do, is
I'll do one night of bingo.

00:36:17.273 --> 00:36:18.940
But I will do everything
else around it.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.981
And if nobody comes to
anything, there's my butt.

00:36:20.981 --> 00:36:23.357
You can kick it and say, I
told you, you're [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:23.357 --> 00:36:23.981
You were wrong.

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:25.220
And we did historical nights.

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.140
We did boat trips.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.875
We did mystery trips
out into the country.

00:36:29.875 --> 00:36:32.173
We did afternoons where
people just came in

00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:34.040
and somebody played
piano and they all sang.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.012
We were blocked out
every single night.

00:36:36.012 --> 00:36:37.220
There was standing room only.

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.630
At every single function.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.911
And they all turned
up for bingo as well.

00:36:40.911 --> 00:36:43.160
But nobody said at the end
of the week, what a pity it

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.240
wasn't all bingo.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.670
So I think if you
actually find something

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.130
that you're passionate
about, that you can create,

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.670
people will come, and it
will make the association.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.056
It also give you a niche
that nobody else has.

00:36:54.056 --> 00:36:55.880
The other thing
with sponsorship is,

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.700
if you come in to sponsor
after somebody has been there,

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.970
it takes a long time to lose
the last sponsor's name.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:05.700
So the general rule is that if
you're doing a sponsorhip deal,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.270
it should be for three years.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.750
And you should an extra two.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.980
So you've a facility that
nobody else can step in

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.688
for the next two.

00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:13.032
You get first dibs on it.

00:37:13.032 --> 00:37:15.841
But after five, you should move
on and inspect your audience

00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:16.340
again.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:19.160
Because after five, if you're
targeting 17-year-olds,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.747
the 17-year-olds are
now 18, 19, 20, or 22.

00:37:21.747 --> 00:37:24.249
They're no longer interested
in the same things.

00:37:24.249 --> 00:37:25.665
They've moved onto
something else.

00:37:25.665 --> 00:37:29.200
But after five years, your
name stays for at least two.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.730
So the next sponsor
coming in has an awful job

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.310
branding their name onto
whatever it is they're doing.

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:37.401
So I'd go the other route, and
create it with your name on it

00:37:37.401 --> 00:37:38.754
and let them follow you.

00:37:39.656 --> 00:37:41.804
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [? Sezgi. ?]

00:37:41.804 --> 00:37:44.655
I'm working in sales team--
in Google Marketing Solutions

00:37:44.655 --> 00:37:45.826
team.

00:37:45.826 --> 00:37:47.782
In fact, mine is not a question.

00:37:47.782 --> 00:37:49.826
It's just inspiration from you.

00:37:49.826 --> 00:37:51.980
It was very, very eye-opening.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:53.380
At Google, we try--

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.600
at Google's sales team,
we try to increase

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.020
our share [INAUDIBLE] from our
clients' [INAUDIBLE] business.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.586
But today, you gave me
another amazing idea--

00:38:03.586 --> 00:38:05.210
why we are going to
try and to increase

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.240
our budget on the team, our
clients may [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.490
Also, we can have payer share
from our client's PR budget

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.000
as well, if you can position
Google products as PR

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:16.780
solutions.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.420
It was very, very
eye-opening, and it

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.590
was a huge leverage
for my business,

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:25.330
when I'm [INAUDIBLE]
back to my desk 100%.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.700
I will do meetings.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.960
I will organize meetings
with my clients' PR managers.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.840
And I will talk
about you to them,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:33.310
and can use for their PRs.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:33.710
ELLEN GUNNING: And I just want--

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.195
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:34.195 --> 00:38:35.650
ELLEN GUNNING: --half a
percent of that business.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.150
That's all.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:40.570
But actually, you're right,
because advertising very often

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.730
is part of a promotional plan.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.405
So you can do a huge amount of
PR that actually gets you out

00:38:45.405 --> 00:38:47.560
there and gets your product
or your brand known.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:48.710
But it gets to the
stage where you say,

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:49.860
now we need to sell it.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.212
But you will still
use PR to enhance.

00:38:52.212 --> 00:38:53.670
Part of it is the
straight selling,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.590
and the other is you simply
turning over to people

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:57.423
and say, oh, I saw an
ad for that somewhere.

00:38:57.423 --> 00:38:58.230
So, brilliant.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.260
Let me know how
you get on with it.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:38:59.770
AUDIENCE: Mhm.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:01.010
ELLEN GUNNING: I
can brag about you.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.432
We can have a mutual loving.

00:39:02.432 --> 00:39:03.920
Excellent.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.980
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a question.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.560
Coming back to your milkman
story, that very inspiring.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.100
But my thought was that
probably the milkman

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.674
didn't realize the effect
that the sponsorship has.

00:39:14.674 --> 00:39:16.090
ELLEN GUNNING: I'm
sure he didn't.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.300
AUDIENCE: So my question
is if an SME at this size

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.140
is to do a PR investment,
what kind of advice

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.019
can you give defining
what success is?

00:39:26.019 --> 00:39:28.060
ELLEN GUNNING: It depends
on what you're actually

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.950
trying to achieve.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:34.030
So, what sponsorship is best
at is creating name awareness.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.040
If you look at any of
the great sponsorships

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.414
they started because people
were moving into new markets,

00:39:38.414 --> 00:39:39.931
or they had changed their name.

00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:41.930
So the company was no
longer known as one thing.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.910
It was now known
as something else.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.990
When-- who sponsored the first
cycle race around Ireland?

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.680
Was it Toyota?

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:51.939
And they sponsored it
because it's a car company.

00:39:51.939 --> 00:39:53.480
Doesn't make sense
that a car company

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.563
would sponsor cycle races.

00:39:54.563 --> 00:39:57.387
It was at the time when Stephen
Roche and all of those guys

00:39:57.387 --> 00:39:58.220
were winning medals.

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.600
But it was because Toyota
used to be called--

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.085
was it Toyota who used
to be called Datsun?

00:40:03.085 --> 00:40:04.460
And people didn't
know the brand.

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:06.365
So the whole idea
was, if you create

00:40:06.365 --> 00:40:08.740
an awareness of the brand,
people say, I've heard of you.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:10.270
And what's the story?

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.450
It opens the door a bit.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:14.420
So what sponsorship is best at
is creating brand awareness.

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.140
So if you're an SME,
and you're trying

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.680
to make people conscious of
the fact that you're around,

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.540
sponsorship is very good at it.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.370
But you need to do
your before and after.

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:23.762
Most people will tell you--

00:40:23.762 --> 00:40:25.595
if you ask people in
Google, how many people

00:40:25.595 --> 00:40:26.780
have heard of Google?

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.690
Well, Google's
probably a bad example.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.170
You're like, oh my god, the
whole world's heard of Google.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.300
Is there anybody
left in the world?

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.250
There's a couple of
people [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.833
I believe who haven't
heard of us yet,

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:35.240
but everybody has heard.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.965
Every SME does the same thing.

00:40:36.965 --> 00:40:38.631
They say, well, they're
very well known.

00:40:38.631 --> 00:40:40.667
And it is true within
their own circle.

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:42.500
So if it's within a
public relations circle,

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.285
or within an IT circle, they
probably are very well known,

00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:48.290
but they're not very well
known to a wider world.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.176
So if you're sponsoring
within the community

00:40:50.176 --> 00:40:53.480
because you just want the
community to know who you are,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.090
what you do, you're
on their doorstep,

00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.798
and they should really
be thinking of you

00:40:56.798 --> 00:40:59.377
in terms of maybe
future employment,

00:40:59.377 --> 00:41:01.210
and just saying to
people they're good guys,

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.449
and they're out there,
they're doing great work.

00:41:03.449 --> 00:41:04.990
Then it will work
very well for that.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:07.630
But you need research in
advance and research afterwards.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:09.449
It doesn't have to
be hugely scientific.

00:41:09.449 --> 00:41:11.490
You can-- so long as you
structure the questions.

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:12.556
You probably know
this, but so long

00:41:12.556 --> 00:41:14.610
as you structure the questions
so that they're open enough

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.319
and people don't know
what the answer is.

00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:18.818
Because if you ask people, do
you think Google is wonderful,

00:41:18.818 --> 00:41:19.775
they say, yes, I do.

00:41:19.775 --> 00:41:22.234
They think Google is
awful, they'd say probably.

00:41:22.234 --> 00:41:23.900
If you say, what do
you think of Google,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.274
you'll get an honest answer
because you haven't told them

00:41:26.274 --> 00:41:27.500
what you expect.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.505
You can do it by, if
it's a community thing,

00:41:29.505 --> 00:41:31.335
you can send people out
into the community saying,

00:41:31.335 --> 00:41:33.043
have you ever heard
of this organization?

00:41:33.043 --> 00:41:34.090
Any idea of what they do?

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:36.870
Who's in the building
down on the corner there?

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.420
And you find out a
lot, but what you

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.097
do is you go back and do
same research afterwards.

00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:43.180
And don't expect that
everybody will suddenly say,

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.900
oh my god, we've
all heard about you.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.969
But if you get like a 5%
increase, that's good.

00:41:47.969 --> 00:41:49.510
You're moving in
the right direction.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.260
And again, it's targeted
to your audience.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.804
So the people you stop to ask
questions of, we sent a group--

00:41:53.804 --> 00:41:55.470
I'm sorry, it's very
long-winded answer.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.230
But we sent a group
out at one stage.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.970
And we were training
journalists.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.012
And I sent them out to do
interviews with people.

00:42:01.012 --> 00:42:03.470
And I said, now, be sure you
don't get all the same people.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.175
So don't stop people
who look like you.

00:42:05.175 --> 00:42:06.800
Stop people across
a mix of age groups.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.591
Stop men and women.

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:11.097
Do everything from like
17 to 77, or something.

00:42:11.097 --> 00:42:13.760
And try and make something,
make some kind of note

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.910
about middle-aged, senior
person, younger person,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.640
so when you come
back, you can say,

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.440
I interviewed-- because
it was for radio.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:23.180
So I interviewed 10 people.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:26.060
Four of them would've under 25,
and the others were over 55.

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.226
And the guys actually were
Ital-- they were Italian.

00:42:28.226 --> 00:42:29.630
Any Italians in the room?

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:32.040
They have a whole 'nother
way of doing things.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.830
So then he went up and he
said, hello, I'm John Marco.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.714
So please, you'll tell
me how old are you?

00:42:36.714 --> 00:42:38.140
And they said,
I'm 36 and a half.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:38.988
I'm 42.

00:42:38.988 --> 00:42:39.412
I couldn't believe it.

00:42:39.412 --> 00:42:41.453
If an Orange person did
it, they would pick me up

00:42:41.453 --> 00:42:42.762
off the ground.

00:42:42.762 --> 00:42:44.983
But it's the audience
you're trying to reach.

00:42:44.983 --> 00:42:47.750
So if you target the age
group as well carefully,

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.132
but that also means watching
who you send out to do it.

00:42:50.132 --> 00:42:52.090
Send out a young person
to target older people,

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:53.360
they won't do it as well.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.300
Send out an older person that's
in same age group stopping him,

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.962
you'll get more honest answers.

00:42:57.962 --> 00:43:00.211
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
before you wrote your book,

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:03.180
did you know what audience
you were targeting,

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.890
or did that come along
when you were writing?

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.519
How did you decide your
audience, or do you target?

00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:11.060
ELLEN GUNNING: What
happened was this

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.915
is my second book
about public relations.

00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:15.290
The first book that I wrote
is called "Public Relations--

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.230
A Practical Approach."

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:19.700
And it's studied by everybody
in Orange who studies PR.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:21.255
So, we're expecting
more colleges

00:43:21.255 --> 00:43:22.480
to-- it's an academic text.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.580
It's an [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.462
It's a doorstop.

00:43:24.462 --> 00:43:26.690
It's about 600
pages or something.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.860
I actually thought that
I'd be revising that book

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.400
but not doing
anything else with PR.

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.020
And I had met with Mercier
Press, who published the book.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.232
And I actually met with
them about a client's book.

00:43:37.232 --> 00:43:38.899
And they had said--I
sent them the page.

00:43:38.899 --> 00:43:40.606
And they came back
and said, actually, we

00:43:40.606 --> 00:43:41.670
wouldn't be interested.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:44.320
We'll meet you, and we would
be interested in publishing

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320
the book for the client.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.130
So I said, that's fine.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.850
I really appreciate you
having a look at it.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:49.433
Where else should
we go with the book?

00:43:49.433 --> 00:43:50.582
Who else should publish it?

00:43:50.582 --> 00:43:51.530
And at the end of
the conversation,

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:52.850
she says, you're
never going to write

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.155
another book on public
relations yourself, did you?

00:43:55.155 --> 00:43:57.857
And I said, well, to
answer your question, no,

00:43:57.857 --> 00:43:59.440
because I've kind
of covered everybody

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.439
who studies the subject.

00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:02.750
And she said, well,
why what about SMEs?

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:03.597
Oh, yeah.

00:44:03.597 --> 00:44:04.180
I [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:04.910
I have no sense.

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.910
They say yes to all the
things that interest me.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:07.800
And then give out
[INAUDIBLE] and just

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.970
say, why did I decide to
d-- who scheduled this?

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:10.690
Me.

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:12.356
But I actually
thought, great idea.

00:44:12.356 --> 00:44:14.495
And it was completely
different because essentially

00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:17.890
what I'll do is-- and I know
the things that SMEs use,

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.940
but it gave me an opportunity
to go out and look

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:21.750
for companies in that sector.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:23.694
Because we all look at
the larger companies,

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.110
so let's look at
smaller companies

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:27.076
and see how they're
using it well,

00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:29.000
and how we could use
them as case studies.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.943
So the audience
almost found itself

00:44:30.943 --> 00:44:33.026
because that was that the
press came for the book.

00:44:33.026 --> 00:44:33.870
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.682
Thank you.

00:44:34.682 --> 00:44:36.390
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
I have someone here.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.700
ELLEN GUNNING: Yeah?

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.860
AUDIENCE: Well, I was
thinking about the sponsorship

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:45.205
and the fact that it's very
good for the brand awareness,

00:44:45.205 --> 00:44:49.770
that it's needed in a very
initial phase of the business.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:54.310
What happens when you do
something bad with this PR

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:54.810
tool?

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.620
So you basically
compromise your reputation

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.320
in a very initial phase.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.640
So, do you have an example of--

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.150
good example of
how some business

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:12.147
could have recovered from
a bad usage of sponsorship?

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:13.730
ELLEN GUNNING: It's
a very interesting

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:14.813
[INAUDIBLE] on reputation.

00:45:14.813 --> 00:45:16.640
Reputation takes a
lifetime to build,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:18.570
and about 30 seconds to lose.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.950
Was it Warren Buffett
who said, if you

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.912
think that everything you
do will be publicly known,

00:45:23.912 --> 00:45:25.620
you'll be very careful
about what you do.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.630
And that's about reputation,
because you lose reputation

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.320
very easily.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.760
People do very stupid
things with reputation.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.090
Probably one of the
best examples was the--

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.590
I can't get the
name of the company.

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.410
Was it [? Tremmell? ?]
The company

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.740
who had-- do you remember
when there was-- going back

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.130
25 years or more, the company
where that guy was actually

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:48.268
injecting Tylenol into
tablets in the States?

00:45:48.268 --> 00:45:50.616
And it was Tylenol tablets.

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.990
I just remembered
the brand name.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.870
They used injecting cyanide
into Tylenol tablets.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:57.520
Anyway, it made people
very nervous about actually

00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.360
using the product.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:45:59.530
And they had a great reputation.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:00.450
They were very well known.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:02.560
And what they did was--
and most people in New York

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.820
thought they were
crazy at the time.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.945
What they did was they
withdrew all of the products

00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:06.654
from the shelves.

00:46:06.654 --> 00:46:08.445
And they put messages
up everywhere saying,

00:46:08.445 --> 00:46:09.520
do not use our product.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.820
If you have it at
home, bring it back.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:11.700
We'll give you a full refund.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.350
For God's sake, don't
take any tablets.

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:14.600
We don't know what's going on.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.640
We don't want anybody to
die because they've taken--

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:18.390
I think two people
in New York had died.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.380
And we don't know
what's happened.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.235
Everybody said, you
know, great move.

00:46:22.235 --> 00:46:24.860
From PR point of view, obviously
they care about the customers.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.170
They're going to have
nothing left to come back to,

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:28.520
because they've left this
gap, and their competitors

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:29.590
were taking over.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:33.377
And when they came back, they
came back with that foil seal.

00:46:33.377 --> 00:46:35.335
And they said, so now
we've made it extra safe.

00:46:35.335 --> 00:46:36.740
So now you will
know if anybody has

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:37.906
tampered with these tablets.

00:46:37.906 --> 00:46:38.500
You'd check.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.320
Seals shouldn't be broken.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.340
The foil should be intact.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.474
It was very clever, and
they recovered market share

00:46:42.474 --> 00:46:44.580
very quickly because
people actually said,

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.630
they care about us.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.390
An example of one
who got it very wrong

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.505
was Shell in the States, when
they did all that damage.

00:46:51.505 --> 00:46:53.590
And they sent over-- and
where they got it wrong

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:54.773
was from minute one.

00:46:54.773 --> 00:46:58.490
They sent over an English
chief executive, an English PR

00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:59.490
person--

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.430
or UK PR person,
and a UK lawyer.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:03.596
So you had-- you're in the
States, (AMERICAN ACCENT)

00:47:03.596 --> 00:47:04.570
where talks like this, OK?

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:05.510
So like, what to they do?

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:07.440
OK, they're after messing
the whole thing up,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.513
and you get, (BRITISH ACCENT)
hello, I'm a chief executive.

00:47:09.513 --> 00:47:10.870
And I'm over here, an American.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:11.912
I'm going to sort it out.

00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:12.953
Hello, I'm the PR person.

00:47:12.953 --> 00:47:13.960
I'm over here with him.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.090
Just common sense says respect
the country that you're in.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:18.800
Now, that's down to reputation.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.480
If you actually respect your
customers, like once you get

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.440
somebody with local eyes
and ears on the ground,

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:28.250
you get somebody who's American
who says this is how it works.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.440
This is how-- just language.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.035
This is how people will
interpret what you're saying.

00:47:32.035 --> 00:47:33.929
And their reputation
suffered massively.

00:47:33.929 --> 00:47:35.470
I'm not sure that
it's recovered yet.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.442
But you'll find enough
of that company,

00:47:38.442 --> 00:47:40.150
when their reputation's
severely damaged,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.010
they actually completely
rename the company,

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:44.899
because they didn't--
the research says you

00:47:44.899 --> 00:47:47.190
won't recover, as people will
always associate you with

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:48.670
the disaster.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.850
So they have no option.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:53.696
But it's a good example
of if you don't get right,

00:47:53.696 --> 00:47:54.820
how much damage you can do.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.027
That's the other side.

00:47:56.027 --> 00:47:57.610
KAROLINE O'SULLIVAN:
That's fantastic.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.446
Thank you so much.

00:47:58.446 --> 00:47:58.945
I love that.

00:47:58.945 --> 00:48:00.255
That was amazing.

00:48:00.255 --> 00:48:01.092
Fantastic stories.

00:48:01.092 --> 00:48:02.800
And I know there are
a few more questions

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.090
that we don't have
time to get around to,

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.495
but you have different ways
that we can contact you

00:48:07.495 --> 00:48:09.080
that you've already
shared with me,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.361
so I can share them
out with everyone else.

00:48:11.361 --> 00:48:13.860
So, thank you again for being
our first speaker of the year.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.735
ELLEN GUNNING: No problem,
thank you as well.

00:48:15.735 --> 00:48:18.342
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:21.828 --> 00:48:24.400
And you did say everybody
chases out at 12 noon.
