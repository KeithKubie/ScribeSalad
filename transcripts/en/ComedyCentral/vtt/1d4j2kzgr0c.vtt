A show where four women

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.738 line:0%
 
get together to talk,

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.040
mostly about
their mutual friend Janelle.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.909
Let's gab.

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.646
(applause)
Hi, hi!
Oh, they're cute, thank you.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.781
So did everybody have an
exciting weekend?

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:15.983
Oh, you know what?
I want to start,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.652
because Saturday
I had a day.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.120
What happened?

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.589
Well, you know, I was picking up
my new rescue puppy Simon.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.658
(audience)
Aww...

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.126
Stop.
You have to rescue.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.061
There's no other way.
On the way home,

00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:30.264
ran into guess who?

00:00:30.297 --> 00:00:31.765
(imitating fanfare)

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.300
Don't tell me.
Janelle.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.434
Oh, I knew it.

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.003
Janelle, okay?
Of course.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.606
So we're saying goodbye, and she
kisses me on both cheeks.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.807
Oh, my God.
Like, um, I'm sorry,

00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.411
are you the duchess
of Brussels all of a sudden?

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:47.281
Yeah, it's like, uh, USA?

00:00:47.314 --> 00:00:49.149
Well, Amy's already
got us started,

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:50.617
so I think we should
just get right into it.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.920
Our "Big Issues" segment.

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.489
Oh, people love this,
love it.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:59.159
Okay, I have a huge issue with
Janelle's Facebook page.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.762
Ugh. Who doesn't?
Don't we all?

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.665 line:0%
 
Hashtag "hope this day
never ends"?

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.868 line:0%
 
Um, that's what days do,
Janelle, they end!

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.838
And B, uh, we know
his name's Steve.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.207
Like, you know she just
wants to say "fiancÃ©."

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.642
So French.
I can't.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.644 line:0%
 
There's something, like, off
about this dude.

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.080 line:0%
 
Mm-hmm, something is up,
something's up.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.549
I actually really
like him.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.520
Yeah, but, like...
come on.

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:30.457
Oh, yeah, totally.
He is weird.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.825
Right!
He is weird.

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.327
So weird.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.328
Well, we're onto our segment
where

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.797
we check Janelle's
Instagram.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.099
Oh, my God,
this is the best.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.870 line:0%
 
Wow, shocker.
It's about her cat again.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.204 line:0%
 
Like, we get it-- its fur
makes it look like

00:01:44.238 --> 00:01:46.640 line:0%
 
it's wearing a tuxedo--
who cares?

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.108
Oh, God.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:51.111
Do you know that that cat,
I heard, isn't even a rescue?

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.114
Shut up.
She bought it, yeah.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.482
No.
I knew it.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.217
You know where she got it?

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.186
The mall.
She got a mall cat.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.189
Oh, my God.
That is so disgusting.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.490
Oh, my God, you guys.

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:05.859
I just got a DM from Janelle.

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:08.161
Oh, my God.
Should we read it?

00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:12.065
Uh, it says, "Heard about
the new show, ladies.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.603
I'm sure it's great
'cause you guys are the best."

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.841
She knows I'm at work.

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.075
Like, I'm at work.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:24.077
Yeah, it's like, we're working.
We're working.

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:26.079
All right, you guys, stay with
us, 'cause when we come back,

00:02:26.113 --> 00:02:28.515
we'll be interviewing Janelle's
personal trainer,

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.517
who she met with once.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.219
(laughing)

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.087
At least she went.

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:36.390
Okay, do you want to be
a part of this show?

00:02:36.423 --> 00:02:38.525
(applause)
