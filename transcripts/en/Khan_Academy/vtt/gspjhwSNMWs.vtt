00:00:00.617 --> 00:00:01.765
- [Voiceover] So, in
the last video I talked

00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:04.614
about curvature and the
radius of curvature,

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:06.220
and I described it purely geometrically

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.647
where I'm saying, you imagine driving

00:00:07.647 --> 00:00:10.339
along a certain road,
your steering wheel locks,

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.408
and you're wondering what
the radius of the circle

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.685
that you draw with your
car, you know through

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:16.646
whatever surrounding fields
there are on the road

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:19.197
as a result, and the special symbol

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:22.324
that we have for this,
for this idea of curvature

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:24.844
is a little kappa, and
that's gonna be one divided

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:26.292
by the radius, and the reason we do

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.805
that is basically you want a large kappa,

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.988
a large curvature to
correspond with a sharp turn

00:00:31.988 --> 00:00:35.733
so, sharp turn, small
radius, large curvature.

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.117
But the question is how do we describe

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:39.784
this in a more mathematical way?

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:45.157
So, I'm gonna to go ahead
and clear up, get rid of the

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:47.484
circle itself and all of that radius

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:50.947
and just be looking at the
curve itself in it's own right.

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:53.029
The way you typically
describe a curve like this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:54.938
is para-metrically, so, you'll have

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:56.997
some kind of vector valued function s

00:00:56.997 --> 00:00:59.565
that takes in a single parameter t,

00:00:59.565 --> 00:01:02.052
and then it's gonna output
the x and y coordinates,

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:04.395
each as functions of t.

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:06.716
So, this will be the x coordinate,

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:08.133
the y coordinate.

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:12.141
And then this specific
case, I'll just tell you

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.503
the curve that I drew
happens to be parameterized

00:01:15.503 --> 00:01:19.670
by one minus the sign of t
as the x component function,

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:24.756
actually no, it's t minus
sign of t, and the bottom part

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.839
is one minus cosign of t.

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:31.276
That's the curve that I drew.

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:32.860
And the way that you're
thinking about this

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.670
is for each value t you
get a certain vector

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.340
that puts you at a point on the curve,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.205
and as t changes the
vector you get changes,

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.300
but the tip of that vector kind of traces

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.967
out the curve as a whole, right?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.901
And you can imagine the
vector drawing the curve

00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:52.543
as t varies,

00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:54.797
and the thought behind making
curvature mathematical,

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:57.317
here I'll kind of clear
up some room for myself,

00:01:57.317 --> 00:02:00.424
is that you take the tangent vectors here

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:01.257
so,

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:05.765
so, you might image a unit tangent vector

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:07.515
at every given point,

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:09.479
and you're wondering

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.510
how quickly those guys change direction,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.343
right?

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:17.350
So with the little schematic
that I have drawn here

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.783
I'm just gonna call this guy t one

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.664
for like the first tangent vector,

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:26.044
t2 , t3, and I haven't specified

00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:26.930
where they started or anything

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.299
I just what give a feel for you've got

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.853
various different tangent vectors

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:31.739
and I'm just gonna say that all of them

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.348
each one of them t sub
somethings has a unit length.

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.619
And the idea of curvature
is to look at how quickly

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:41.346
that unit tangent vector
changes directions.

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:44.802
So, you know you might imagine
a completely different space

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:47.715
so, rather than rooting
each vector on the curve,

00:02:47.715 --> 00:02:49.642
let's see what it would look like if you

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:50.798
just kind of write each vector

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.898
in its own right off in some other spot.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:55.700
So, this guy here would be t one,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.194
and then t two points a little bit down,

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:03.819
and then t three points
kind of much more down

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.347
So, all of these, this would
be t one, that guy is t two

00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:09.779
and these are the same vectors
I'm just kind of drawing them

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:12.234
all rooted at the same spot
so it's a little easier

00:03:12.234 --> 00:03:14.138
to see how they turn, and you wanna say,

00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:16.261
okay how much do you
change as you go from t one

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.677
to t two, is that a large angle change?

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:20.955
and as you go from t two to t three,

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:22.655
is that a large change as well?

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.712
And you can kind of see
how if you have a curve,

00:03:25.712 --> 00:03:27.779
and let's say it's,

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.606
if you have a curve
that curves quite a bit,

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.687
you know it's doing something like that

00:03:31.687 --> 00:03:34.354
then the unit vector,
the unit tangent vector

00:03:34.354 --> 00:03:37.006
at this point changes quite rapidly

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.581
over a short distance to be something

00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:40.143
almost 90 degrees different.

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:42.487
Whereas, if you take the unit vector here

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.290
and see how much does
it change as you go from

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.376
this point over to this point

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:48.383
it doesn't really change that much.

00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:49.502
So, the thought behind curvatures,

00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:50.815
we gonna take the rate of change of

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:52.690
that unit tangent vector,

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.039
so, the rate of change of t, and I'm gonna

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:57.144
let capital T be a function

00:03:57.144 --> 00:03:58.952
that tells you whatever
the unit tangent vector

00:03:58.952 --> 00:04:00.606
at each point is,

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:01.930
and I'm not gonna take the rate of change

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.465
in terms of, you know
the parameter little t,

00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:07.744
which is what we use to
parameterize the curve,

00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:09.886
because it shouldn't matter
how you parameterize the curve,

00:04:09.886 --> 00:04:12.143
maybe you're driving
along it really quickly

00:04:12.143 --> 00:04:13.299
or really slowly.

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.879
Instead, what you wanna take

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.481
is the rate of change with
respect to arc length.

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:20.887
Arc length, and I'm
using the variable s here

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:22.391
to denote arc length, and what I mean by

00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.767
that is that if take just
a tiny little step here

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:29.787
the distance of that
step, the actual distance

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:32.759
in the x y plane, you
consider to be the arc length.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.367
And if you imagine it
being really, really small

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.069
you're considering that a d s,

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.581
a tiny change in the arc length.

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:40.391
So this is the quantity
that we care about.

00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:43.511
How much does that unit
tangent vector change

00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:45.736
with respect to a tiny
change in the arc length?

00:04:45.736 --> 00:04:47.631
You know, as we travel along, let's say,

00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:50.714
it was a distance of like 0.5, right,

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:55.576
you wanna know, did this
unit vector change a lot

00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:56.580
or a little bit.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.583
But I should add something here,

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:59.913
this tiny change in the vector

00:04:59.913 --> 00:05:01.341
that would tell you,

00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:02.999
you know what the vector connecting

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:04.887
their two tips is,

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:06.589
so, this would be a
vector valued quantity,

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:08.675
and curvature itself
should just be a number.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.647
So, what we really care about
is the size of this guy.

00:05:11.647 --> 00:05:14.767
So, what we really care
about, the size of this,

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:17.358
which is a vector valued quantity,

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:18.516
and that'll be an indication of just

00:05:18.516 --> 00:05:20.367
how much the curve curves.

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.044
But if I'm at a sharper turned curve

00:05:22.044 --> 00:05:23.761
you go over that same distance

00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.216
and then suddenly the change

00:05:25.216 --> 00:05:27.793
in the tangent vectors goes by quite a bit

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:30.535
that would be telling you
it's a high curvature.

00:05:30.535 --> 00:05:32.110
And in the next video
I'm gonna talk through

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.755
what that looks like, how you think about

00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:36.939
this tangent vector function,

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:38.699
this unit tangent vector function,

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:41.236
and what it looks like to
take the derivative of that

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.315
with respect to arc length.

00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:44.795
It can get a little convoluted

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:46.452
in terms of the symbols involved,

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:47.715
and the constant picture you should have

00:05:47.715 --> 00:05:50.011
in the back of your mind is that circle,

00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:52.093
that circle that's hugging
the curve very closely

00:05:52.093 --> 00:05:53.867
at a certain point,

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:57.356
and this means of taking the
magnitude of the rate of change

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:00.987
of the unit tangent vector
with respect to arc length

00:06:00.987 --> 00:06:04.320
is all just trying to capture that idea.
