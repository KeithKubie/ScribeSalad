just one element of it better to be
 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.290
just one element of it better to be
strong than to be weak and so you can

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300
strong than to be weak and so you can
 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.209
strong than to be weak and so you can
have a strong hero because it's better

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219
have a strong hero because it's better
 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.339
have a strong hero because it's better
to be strong than to be weak but it's

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349
to be strong than to be weak but it's
 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.350
