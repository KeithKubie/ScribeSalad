00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:01.226
- What I hope to do in this video

00:00:01.226 --> 00:00:02.506
is hopefully give you some clarity

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:06.096
on terms you might hear
used in a fairly related way

00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:10.298
and those are the terms Gene and Allele.

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:13.743
Gene versus Allele.

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:15.092
So let's do a little bit of review.

00:00:15.092 --> 00:00:19.183
Let's just reorient ourselves
in the world of DNA and RNA.

00:00:19.183 --> 00:00:22.251
Let's say that this,
this yellow squiggly line

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.767
is a length of, I don't know, say my DNA,

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.311
and let's say this little
light section right over here,

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:29.412
that's if we were to zoom in,

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:31.662
and we've represented
the various base pairs.

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:33.073
And the sequence of base pairs

00:00:33.073 --> 00:00:36.000
is really the information content in DNA,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.812
and here I've just kind of
drawn it as a, as a ladder.

00:00:38.812 --> 00:00:40.333
We know that the real structure of DNA

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.131
is a is kind of this twisted ladder,

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:43.834
this double helix.

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:48.407
Now if we talk about this
whole yellow squiggly line,

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:49.638
and it could be even a section

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.271
of a longer yellow squiggly line,

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.433
this could code for multiple
for multiple things,

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:56.700
especially multiple proteins.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.274
So different regions of this could

00:00:58.274 --> 00:00:59.641
code for different proteins.

00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.375
So for example, this
section right over here

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.379
could be part of this region
that I'm highlighting in blue

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.372
that codes for a specific protein,

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:11.314
and so we would call this a Gene.

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.180
We would call this a Gene.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.339
This might be a protein that is involved

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:17.064
in, I don't know, I'll make something up.

00:01:17.064 --> 00:01:18.348
It's a protein that evolved,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.169
that's involved in the immune system.

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:24.518
Maybe, maybe this stretch, let
me do it in different color.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.949
Maybe this stretch of DNA right over here,

00:01:28.702 --> 00:01:32.208
this stretch of DNA maybe
it's a longer stretch of DNA.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:36.922
Maybe it codes, it codes
for a protein that's used--

00:01:36.922 --> 00:01:41.212
Maybe it's a protein that
helps regulate DNA replication.

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:46.212
Maybe over here is another
we encode for another protein

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:52.107
that maybe, maybe it in
some ways affects, affects

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.945
the pigmentation of your skin,

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.869
or the pigmentation of your eyes,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.410
and so you these stretches of DNA

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.436
that code for specific things.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:04.450
And actually it doesn't have
to just be even for a protein.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.164
We are, we always talked about even

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:07.946
if you do code for a protein you go

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:11.608
from the DNA to messenger RNA,

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:15.051
to messenger RNA and actually
go to pre-messenger RNA.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.660
That gets processed so you could

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.004
actually lose some sections of it,

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:21.572
but you go to messenger RNA
and then that messenger RNA,

00:02:22.157 --> 00:02:26.947
every three of these
base pairs is a Codon.

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.202
Let me, so let's say that's one codon.

00:02:30.202 --> 00:02:33.409
One, two, three, that's another codon.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.981
One, two, three, each of those--

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:38.001
Maybe I'll draw them next to each other.

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.200
Each of of them codes for an amino acid

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:43.929
that is kind of connected
together to form,

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.037
connected together to form a protein.

00:02:47.037 --> 00:02:48.977
So that's one amino acid right over there.

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:52.312
This could be another amino
acid right over there.

00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:55.122
We can keep going on and on and on and on.

00:02:55.122 --> 00:02:57.243
You could have another
Amino Acid right over here,

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.480
and then they all bond to
each other and they're brought

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.861
actually to the mRNA from a,

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.870
by a functional RNA group.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:05.751
And so there are functional things

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:07.639
other than proteins that
this could code for.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.553
Like tRNA, tRNA which is really helping

00:03:11.553 --> 00:03:13.918
to transport the appropriate Amino Acids

00:03:13.918 --> 00:03:18.575
to the mRNA in the Ribosomes so that you

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.168
can construct these proteins.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.839
So you can have tRNA and
we've seen this before

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:22.736
in previous videos.

00:03:22.736 --> 00:03:24.041
It's this little squiggly line,

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.547
matches up the the appropriate Codon,

00:03:25.547 --> 00:03:27.978
and then puts that Amino Acid in place.

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:31.808
You also have things like Ribosomal RNA

00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:35.614
that make up the structure
of the actual Ribosomes.

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.575
So RNA doesn't have to
only play this kind of

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:39.174
in between messenger function.

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:41.236
It actually can play a functional

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:43.167
or a structural role.

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.636
In fact there are theories
that the earliest life,

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:50.009
the most primitive life was
nothing but self replicating RNA

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.144
and then the systems became
more, and more, and more

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:54.709
complicated and complex
until eventually you end up

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.641
with things like redwood
trees and hippopotami.

00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.125
Hippopotamuses, hippopotami whatever.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:00.826
Elephants, but whatever else,

00:04:00.826 --> 00:04:05.141
but it all started with
potentially self replicating RNA.

00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:06.255
Some people say it might
be some type of proteins

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.905
are able to replicate, who knows,

00:04:07.905 --> 00:04:10.836
but RNA is definitely, is definitely

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:13.014
an interesting character in this.

00:04:13.014 --> 00:04:17.336
So you go from Gene to
RNA, that's transcription,

00:04:17.336 --> 00:04:20.834
and then RNA to protein, to protein

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.943
that is translation but sometimes
you just stop at the RNA,

00:04:24.943 --> 00:04:26.972
and the RNA by itself plays a function.

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:28.472
That's functional RNA.

00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:29.981
So each of these Genes they can code

00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.272
for a type of protein or
even a functional RNA.

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.271
That's what a Gene is.

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:37.368
Now what about an Allele?

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:41.043
When the Allele is a specific
variation of the Gene.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:44.819
So for example, let's
say that you look at the

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.801
at the same stretch of DNA.

00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.733
Let's say this is my DNA and if I were

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:50.744
to take your DNA out and if were to look

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:52.545
on the same chromosome at the same region.

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:53.983
We're both human beings and we have

00:04:53.983 --> 00:04:55.978
for the most part very similar DNA.

00:04:55.978 --> 00:04:58.013
So this is--

00:04:58.013 --> 00:04:59.979
Actually let me straighten it out.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.980
So, let's say this is my
DNA, a section of my DNA,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.900
and let's say this right over here,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.142
this in white is a section of your DNA,

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:11.618
and so if we look at that
Gene, that blue Gene,

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:13.880
that's that on my DNA.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.512
Now if we look at that
and this is the blue Gene,

00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:19.913
this is the blue Gene on your DNA.

00:05:19.913 --> 00:05:21.967
Now we're both human beings and most

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:23.947
of our genetic material is fairly similar,

00:05:23.947 --> 00:05:28.139
but we might have variations
in how this Gene is coded.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.133
For example, you might
have or I might have

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:36.578
a let's say, I have a
an Adenine right there,

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:38.349
but right at that exact spot

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.138
you might have a different base.

00:05:40.138 --> 00:05:42.135
You might have a, I don't know,

00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:44.804
you might have a, you might have--

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:45.248
Actually let me just--

00:05:45.248 --> 00:05:48.308
You might have a Thymine right over there.

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:51.735
So it's encoding for a
protein, or you know,

00:05:51.735 --> 00:05:53.501
functional RNA that's
playing the same role.

00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.438
Maybe it has a role in the immune system

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.541
or role in your skin color

00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:58.570
or role in how your brain develops,

00:05:58.571 --> 00:06:00.601
but there's a variation.

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:02.409
There's a variation in how it's coded.

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:03.911
Now some of these
variations which could arise

00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:06.539
through mutations, it might
not have any impact in

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.683
the function of the eventual
protein that gets constructed.

00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:12.001
You might just have a
different Amino Acid sometimes.

00:06:12.001 --> 00:06:13.770
In fact, you might not even
have a different Amino Acid

00:06:13.771 --> 00:06:15.909
because many times you
have two Codons coding

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.343
for the same Amino Acid,

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.434
but even in a case you might have

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.169
one different Amino Acid in a protein

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.459
that has 4,000 Amino
Acids it doesn't change

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:25.474
how that protein acts or how it functions.

00:06:25.474 --> 00:06:26.937
Or sometimes it might.

00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:28.574
It might change how
that protein functions.

00:06:28.574 --> 00:06:30.634
It might change how that
protein regulates other things

00:06:30.634 --> 00:06:31.903
and whoever knows whatever else,

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:33.961
and so you could imagine
that you have Genes.

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.473
This Gene right over here.

00:06:35.473 --> 00:06:37.173
Maybe it has a role in eye color,

00:06:37.173 --> 00:06:40.453
and because of this variation
or because of other variations

00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.102
that show up in both cases they code

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:45.471
for the protein that
say regulates eye color,

00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:47.512
or regulates the amount
of pigment you have,

00:06:47.512 --> 00:06:49.845
but because your variation right over here

00:06:49.845 --> 00:06:52.677
might lead or help lead--

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:54.081
And these things are very complex,

00:06:54.081 --> 00:06:56.184
it's very seldom do you
have a gene just for this,

00:06:56.184 --> 00:06:57.809
but this might make you--

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:00.217
especially if you have a Gene like this

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:01.341
from both of your parents,

00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:04.376
maybe this one would go for blue eyes.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.622
Blue eyes, it somehow
helps produce blue eyes.

00:07:08.084 --> 00:07:12.037
While this, while mine somehow
helps produce brown eyes.

00:07:12.037 --> 00:07:13.669
And obviously I'd want to think about

00:07:14.132 --> 00:07:17.683
which variant of this Gene
that I get from my mother,

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.313
and the variant of this Gene
that I get from my father.

00:07:20.313 --> 00:07:23.337
We all have two copies in
our regular somatic cells

00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:24.409
and our body cells.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.669
We have except for--

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.058
If we think about the,

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:29.883
xx and the xy chromosomes,

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:31.332
the sex determining chromosomes,

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:34.312
on all the other chromosomes
we have two copies

00:07:34.312 --> 00:07:36.000
of the same Genes.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.834
We just have two--

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:38.844
It's just they're different variants.

00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:40.272
One variant from your mother

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:41.635
and one variant from your father,

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:43.873
or you could say that they
are different Alleles.

00:07:43.874 --> 00:07:46.012
So Alleles are just different variants.

00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:48.041
So these are two different Alleles.

00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:49.912
They code, they're the same Gene.

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.738
They're the Gene that
somehow deals with eye color,

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:55.966
but they're different
variations for that Gene.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:57.550
So the Gene you're speaking generally

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.678
to that region of DNA.

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:02.774
That region of the DNA strand that codes

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:05.558
for some functional molecule,

00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:07.543
usually protein but it could be RNA.

00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:09.983
While the Allele is
that specific variation.
