00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.670
For this assignment, talk about how you might use notion of recording cases to

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.000
design an agent that can solve Raven's Progressive Matrices. You might think of

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.750
cases in a variety of different ways here. For example, each figure in

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.200
a problem could be a case. Each transformation between figures could be a case.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.610
Or more broadly, each problem that your agent has encountered in

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.460
the past could be a case. As part of this, you'll also need to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.110
think about how to evaluate similarity. If you're using figures,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.380
how do you evaluate the similarity between two figures in a problem?

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.630
Or how do you evaluate the similarity between two transformations and a problem?

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.310
Or more broadly, how do you find what problem that you face in the past,

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.380
is most similar to the new one you're facing now?
