1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,770
You are listening to
radiolab radio from w n y.

2
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:08,850
S t e n n.

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:12,840
P. R. Everybody level check.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,750
We're going to start the show with
this fellow. His name's Ben Zimmer.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,260
He's the on language columnist for
the New York Times magazine because we

6
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:23,480
figured since we wanted to
do a show called at break,

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,170
we thought we should call Ben.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,670
And so we came into the studio and he
brought with him a bunch of his favorite

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,420
oops

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,350
example. I just wanted to give
one of my favorite examples of a,

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,830
the first one that he hit us where the,
uh, began its life. Was it in an AP,

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,703
a news article?

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,890
Mm, well, it was an AP story,

14
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:46,891
but the AP story was fine when the AP
story appeared on a news site from the

15
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:52,190
American family association, which by the
way is a conservative Christian group.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Um, the headline, first of all,

17
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,680
said homosexual eases into
100 final at Olympic trials

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,640
and then kissing guys with something
that they would be good at. Well,

19
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:10,630
if you read on, if you're confused by
that headline, very, here's how it starts.

20
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,490
Tyson homosexual easily won his semi-final
for the a hundred meters at the u s

21
00:01:15,491 --> 00:01:18,520
Olympic track and field trials.
And it goes on to say, you know,

22
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,160
throughout the entire article,
you know, on Saturday,

23
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:23,590
homosexual misjudge the
finish is opening heat.

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,260
The entire article had the word
homosexual in place of gay.

25
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:30,670
The, his name is Tyson [inaudible].

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,430
According to Ben, this is a classic,
classic example of a search and replace,

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:37,940
oops.

28
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,750
This group apparently did not like the
word gay because gay makes homosexuality

29
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:45,700
sound very nice and they're gay, right?

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,520
So what they did was they ran a search
and replace every instance of the word

31
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:51,080
gay with the word homosexual,

32
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,070
but then you get Tyson gay
becoming Tyson homeless, sexual.

33
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,160
This was just a one that a, they
were a little careless with.

34
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,110
Just to be fair, here's a
contrasting example. In 1990,

35
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:04,910
the Frizz Newbie ran martyr

36
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,900
about the, uh,

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,940
Massachusetts budget crisis and had made
reference to new taxes that will help

38
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:15,770
put Massachusetts quote back
into the African American. Um,

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,850
and they had to issue a correction saying
it should have said back in the day,

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,940
no, this one might've been a
newsroom prank. We're not sure. Good.

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,330
Then get into paper just for the
hell of it. Here's one last one.

42
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:32,990
This one happened after the famous
broadcast, or Walter Cronkite died.

43
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,110
When did the Chicago Tribune did
their online obituary for Cronkite?

44
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,420
What happened was every instance of
Cronkite got replaced by Mr Cronkite.

45
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,700
You can understand the thinking
behind that. They deciding,

46
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:51,200
okay for deceased males, they should
be referred to with the title Mr.

47
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,900
But then what this, uh,

48
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:58,090
turns into is an obituary where
it says he was born Walter Leland,

49
00:02:58,191 --> 00:02:59,410
Mr Cronkite, Jr,

50
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,360
and he refers to his radio show,
Walter Mister contact's 20th century.

51
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,940
It's got things about his family has
his son, Walter, Mr Cronkite, the third,

52
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,760
his daughter, his daughter
Kathy, Mr [inaudible].

53
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,020
My heart went, Ooh, Jed. The
moment that my heart went, Ooh.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,860
And I'm Robert, I never will
forget to this episode of Radiolab.

55
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,510
The moment that I have for

56
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,680
oopses starting with a tree.
Oops. Then we've got a goose

57
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,870
oops. And an entire town. Oh, oops.

58
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,400
And a Harvard professor

59
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,830
that really want it. Yeah, no, we should
just say before we start, oops. Oops.

60
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:45,040
Is oops, can be a misleading term.

61
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,020
Really what we're talking about
here is something Greek. Well,

62
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,540
you try hard to prevent one thing and
then you get exactly what you didn't want

63
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,170
to get back at you. Right. And our
first story falls into that category.

64
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,520
Back a few seasons ago,

65
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,521
we were doing a show on deception and we
ended up talking with a professor named

66
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,950
Ruben Gore. Hello. Hi. Is this
professor Gar? Yes. Speaking.

67
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,920
He's a psychiatrist. Works at
the University of Pennsylvania.

68
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,380
And I'd call them to talk
about his research on self
deception, self deception.

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,293
It's fascinating stuff.

70
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,810
And I'm not gonna go into it now
because somewhere along the way the

71
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,350
conversation took a really
weird turn. No. Oh yeah.

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,650
Get Out. Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,360
And it happened when he began
to tell me about some studies,

74
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:29,410
range studies done by a,
uh, what was the guy's name?

75
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:33,050
His name is hanging in,
I don't remember. Second.

76
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,220
MMM. MMM.

77
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,850
What's his name? Henry Murray.

78
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,950
And the reason we want to hear about
Henry Murray is what? I built it up.

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,510
Don't you want to know more than that
yet? No. Hold on that. Tell me why. Okay.

80
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm going to let it unfold because we
were so interested in what rubigard told

81
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,790
us that we found a guy.
Yeah. Hi. How's it going?

82
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,170
Who knows a whole lot about professor.
Mary's name is Austin Chase.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,740
Very windy day today, isn't it?

84
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,910
He lives in a remote cabin in Mon Ghana.

85
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,390
Got Another one coming
in the foothills. Okay.

86
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,940
Professor Marie was a
very prestigious scholar.

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,990
He had been a professor of psychology
at Harvard before the Second World War.

88
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,350
During the war. He, uh, went to work for

89
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,210
the s Shasha Office of strategic services,
which was the forerunner of the CIA.

90
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,030
And a couple of years into his
government service says Austin.

91
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,380
Something happened.

92
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,630
It really spooked him and spooked
the country during the Korean War.

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,490
Uh, there were some Gis, he said he'd
been captured in Korea and afterwards,

94
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,710
after the Korean War,
they refused to come home.

95
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,460
They appeared to have communist
portrayed their country,

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,180
their own country, and disappeared
behind Red China bamboo,

97
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,690
correct John, if anybody wants to go home.

98
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,770
[inaudible] and their
military establishment was
very much concerned that the

99
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,460
communists had found techniques for
brainwashing and so Marie and other

100
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,850
psychiatrists in the government were
charged with preparing those soldiers to

101
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:09,440
resist that kind of brainwashing.

102
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,890
And Marie himself developed
a style of interrogation.

103
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,150
Stressful interrogation was the term used
that the army could use on its pilots.

104
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,790
Yeah. He developed this
method of kidnapping.

105
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,300
Then before they were sent them to mission

106
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,100
and then says Ruben Guru. He'd run
them through a battery of tests.

107
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,400
Let's just see if they break and if they
didn't break, they were fine to fly.

108
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,640
This kind of psychological training was
most kind of a new front in the Cold War

109
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,600
and in the 1950s Marie's back at Harvard
and he's thinking of ways to fine tune

110
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:42,150
his techniques and this is
where things get interesting.

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,070
He took a clash of Harvard undergraduates,
20 some odd sophomores, mostly. Oh.

112
00:06:47,071 --> 00:06:51,270
Students were told to write an
autobiographical essay like a diary,

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
and he told him, you know what,
make it very personal, right.

114
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,930
You're deep his thoughts in their highest
aspirations and hopes while you're at

115
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:58,620
it,

116
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,180
right about your sexual fantasies where
class and after the students were done,

117
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,043
he said to them,

118
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,610
now I'm going to pair you up into groups
of two to debate or discuss what they'd

119
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:13,020
written. Students were
like, okay, we'll share.

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,460
No big deal, but they were duped.

121
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,550
They were walked into this
very brightly lit room.

122
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,600
Just turned out to be an interrogation
room with a one way mirror,

123
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,710
put in a chair, strapped in.

124
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,680
Electrodes were attached
to their arms, chest,

125
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,020
their heart to measure stress basically,

126
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,760
and they were also filming through the
mirror and then instead of a classmate in

127
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,080
want a total strange older man.
This guy was holding their essay,

128
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,741
they didn't know it,

129
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:48,741
but Murray had trained to do everything
he could to anger and humiliate the

130
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:54,321
undergraduate and he just tore them
apart piece by piece using the essay.

131
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,530
The mock was shooting aspirations.

132
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,110
Then after this was done,

133
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:09,950
the students have to come back week after
week to view themselves on film being

134
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:15,730
humiliated. That to me seems like the
worst part. After they'd been humiliated,

135
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:19,660
they had to watch themselves
being humiliated over and over.

136
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,670
People became tearful and miserable and
he was proud how he destroyed people.

137
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,150
What, what

138
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,890
kind of person is this? Like why
did he do it? Yeah, why he did it.

139
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,940
There were any one of a number of
explanations and they all could be true.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,170
One is it was a grant grabbing. He
was getting money to do these things.

141
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,640
I'll say, you know, this was the Cold War.

142
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,910
He was fighting communism may have thought
it was justified. Yeah, but, but he,

143
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,550
but he just said he was
proud of this. Well,

144
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:50,551
it also happens to be the case that he
was having an affair for about 30 years

145
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
with a woman, not his wife,

146
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,840
and they had a sexual relationship
that bordered on the shadow mask.

147
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,310
In fact, wash
sadomasochistic another word,

148
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,490
Moorish interest in these
was intensely personal.

149
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,040
Whatever the case in
those Harvard experiments,

150
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,550
there was one student who was
just not prepared for any of it.

151
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,710
His code name was lawful, lawful.

152
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,370
They gave each of the students our
code name because he was considered so

153
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,160
conventional. He was
really still just a boy.

154
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,730
Graduated High School at 16 was
living a thousand miles from home,

155
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,510
two shirts and two charges to his name
and lawful apparently was an especially

156
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,770
lonely kid. The notes I found, okay,

157
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,290
Marie did refer specifically
to lawful Sesay,

158
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,470
which she shies highly alienated.

159
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,560
So when lawful walked into that
room, sat across from that stranger.

160
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,450
The guy really did a job on him.

161
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,660
He was young so he was
barely growing a beard.

162
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,030
So the first thing that guy tells
him is, what is this on your chin?

163
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,660
Something trying to look like a beard.

164
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,890
Then the guy opens up lawfully essay
and lets him have it. Meanwhile,

165
00:09:56,891 --> 00:10:00,070
like all the students lawfully had been
hooked up to all these stress monitors.

166
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,090
I a analyzed his data compared to all
the other participants he had firing

167
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,000
awake, strongest response. Physiologically
you mean like it's heartbeat.

168
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:11,680
The fastest are linked to everything.

169
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,053
[inaudible]

170
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,423
amazingly,

171
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,930
this experiment went on for
three years and decades later,

172
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:24,000
a lot of the subjects were still upset,

173
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,560
considered it one of the most traumatic
experiences they'd had in their 20s

174
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,350
lawful never forgot it. That's right.

175
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,470
It was resentful at the way
he was treated at Harvard.

176
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,460
He had nightmares about Professor
Murray after he left Harvard.

177
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,650
So what happened to this guy? Oh,

178
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,830
well he finished up his four
years at Harvard, got his degree,

179
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,210
and got a phd in math,

180
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,290
and he began to teach math and
then he became a household name.

181
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,140
What do you mean? Well, I mean this,

182
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,800
yes,

183
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,790
Bi raid began just afternoon in a remote
mountainous area called Stemple pass

184
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,850
about five miles outside the
town of Lincoln, Montana.

185
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,000
Turns out that lawful, his real
name your door Kosinski yeah, no.

186
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,380
Oh yeah. Kazanski was no out. Yeah.

187
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,230
The FBI dubbed him the
Unabomber in nearly 18 years.

188
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,150
He found targets all over the country.

189
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,710
His meticulously made bombs have killed
three people and injured another 23

190
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,930
blew my arm off to the side like this.

191
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,440
And the first thing I thought
was why did they do that?

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,950
Do you think that this study
had anything to do with, uh,

193
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,640
Ted Cruz in skis subsequent
very infamous act?

194
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,050
Well, I think he probably would have,
if it hadn't been for that experiment,

195
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,260
he still probably would have been maybe

196
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,360
reclusive living somewhere in a
cabin in one [inaudible] regardless.

197
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:49,890
But I think the evil twist
was, uh, was done there.

198
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,250
Years later while he was researching
a book, Austin Chase corresponded

199
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
with Kozinski

200
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,500
and one of his letters,

201
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:01,501
he mentioned that he participated in some
psychological experiments conducted by

202
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,270
profession. Marie, of course,

203
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:08,230
I was very curious and I wrote it back
to tell me a little bit more about it.

204
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,860
And he shed while you really, uh, don't,

205
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,920
I don't know if you want to
go into that can of worms.

206
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,803
[inaudible]

207
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,010
Rubin Gore is a professor of psychiatry
at the University of Pennsylvania and

208
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,210
Austin Chase is the author of the book
Harvard and the making of the Unabomber.

209
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:41,430
[inaudible]

210
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,350
oops. Oops.

211
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:47,923
Here's one more

212
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,100
from Ben Zimmer. What
is the Cupertino effect?

213
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:56,130
The Cupertino effects is the name given
to the phenomenon of when you rely on a

214
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,270
spellchecker too much, it
will give you a suggestion.

215
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,370
And very often it's a suggestion that
you really shouldn't take. It would,

216
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,150
why is it called the Cupertino
effect? Well, in early spellcheckers,

217
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,460
if you wrote cooperation, the
word cooperation, c, O, o, p, e,

218
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,540
r, a, t, I, O, n,

219
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,370
perfectly typical spelling of the word
cooperation in early spellcheckers.

220
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,290
Um, that word was not there because it
expected you to spell it c o Hyphen.

221
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,530
And so what it would do is it would give
you a suggestion and the suggestion was

222
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:34,960
Cupertino is in another
town and then in California.

223
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,090
So if you look at documents that
are still online from the UN,

224
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,590
from the EU, from NATO,

225
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,600
you'll find dozens and dozens
of Cupertino's that have
found their way in there.

226
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,740
For instance, here's a German
NATO officer was quoted as saying,

227
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,300
the Cupertino with our Italian
comrade proved to be very fruitful.

228
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,130
And then there was a proposal from the
EU scientific and technical research

229
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:04,360
committee. They proposed quote,
stimulating cross-border Cupertino.

230
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,110
Oops. Number two, you go the the next.

231
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,170
This is the next one is just
a different flavor entirely.

232
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,070
We're going to meet someone. I don't know.

233
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,410
I can't really say they did
anything wrong. It's just,

234
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,830
I mean this one is more like, like
would you say luck mixed the poster.

235
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,610
You just picked up a toothbrush and
it was connected to a snake that was

236
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:29,290
connected to a monster that was
connected to the devil himself.

237
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,920
You wouldn't know. You're
just picking up a tooth.

238
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,240
So this is a case where really bad
things happen. The story comes from our,

239
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,370
our own reporter Pat Walters. Yeah,
it concerns [inaudible] go ahead and,

240
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,480
okay, so just to start, I want you
to imagine you're on a mountain top.

241
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,840
Okay. This mountain is in western Nevada.

242
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,990
The second highest peak in the
state of Nevada got a name,

243
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,100
it's called wheeler peak and it
was this, this is Michael Cohen.

244
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,750
I go by Michael P. Cohen.

245
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,530
He's a nature writer and he tells me that
up on top of this mountain there is a

246
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:02,510
grove of old trees.

247
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,390
You can see the trees from a distance
and Eric Wood is so bright that it

248
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:12,350
actually glistens in the sun.
What do they call it? Oh,

249
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,030
bristle cone pines. Yes. Can you
describe what they look like? Sure.

250
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,900
They tend to be shorter, broad
at the base. They get very,

251
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:25,810
very old and as they get old they
become towards your door gnarled.

252
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,350
They sort of twist up towards the sky.
The overall effect is sort of electrical.

253
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,140
They look kind of like what
you'd seen a Tim Burton movie.

254
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,880
So you have that picture in your
mind? Yep. Okay. So the story,

255
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,050
it's about the scientist named Don Curry.
I'm going to take a drink of water.

256
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,280
Wait, I'm going to take
a drink of water. Okay.

257
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,610
Story starts in 1964 don
curry was a graduate student
from North Carolina and he

258
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:54,650
was young. Do we know how old he was?

259
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,460
He was 30 years old and he'd just gotten
a big grant from the national science

260
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:02,360
foundation to do some climate change
research. Not like climate change.

261
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:02,751
Now though,

262
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:06,080
climate change thousands of years ago
because he learned that you can actually

263
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,670
sort of travel back in time,

264
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,700
go back into the past using
this spacing between tree rings,

265
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,410
the annual rings. This is Ron Lanner,

266
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:19,460
he's a retired forest service scientist
and he says you can use the width of the

267
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,410
tree rings to determine whether it was
colder at one time or Rainier at one

268
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:26,720
period in the tree's life or whatever.

269
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,800
So curry up on top of this mountain up
amongst these trees and he needs to find

270
00:16:30,801 --> 00:16:34,640
one that he can look inside and kind
of see what the weather was like.

271
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Way Back in the past five minutes
of looking is all it was involved.

272
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,020
This is from a Nova documentary.

273
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,400
Carrie died a few years ago and this
is actually the only time that he ever

274
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:50,400
talked about this story on tape.
Literally he found a tree there,

275
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,210
first old tree that we climbed to that uh,

276
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,640
he described as looking super, super old.

277
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,770
So curry takes out this special drill,

278
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,370
which scientists used to take like a
core sample to look at the rings. Yeah.

279
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,110
And presses it up against the tree,

280
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,550
give it a good push to get it through
the bar and he starts twisting it in and

281
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,860
clockwise into the tree.

282
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,340
But he wasn't having much luck.

283
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,460
The normal approach to coring
the tree wasn't working.

284
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,330
It becomes harder and harder for him
to turn this thing into the tree and

285
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,193
eventually

286
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,680
the bit of his drill
broke off in the tree. Oh

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,080
this isn't just any drill.

288
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,660
He ordered it from Sweden and
the whole time he's thinking,

289
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,790
if I can't get this thing out of the tree,

290
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,750
that would mean the research
project would be lost for the year.

291
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,250
So at this point,

292
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,300
kind of lumbers back the
mountain and dejected.

293
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,360
He managed to find the district ranger
and told him the problem guys might

294
00:17:57,061 --> 00:18:01,780
drill. It got stuck in the tree,
what should I do? And they tell him,

295
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,740
don't worry about it done. We'll just
cut the tree down. This is one tree.

296
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:07,740
There are dozens of
these trees all around.

297
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,880
So they start slicing into the tree.

298
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,540
It takes awhile to cut it
down cause it's really dense.

299
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,830
Knots are old and eventually the tree

300
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,480
falls over. Then they cut some slabs
out of the lower part of the tree.

301
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,050
Curry gets one of these slabs back
to his lab, throws it on a big desk,

302
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,400
finds a magnifying glass because the
rains are really small and he starts

303
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:37,790
counting one, two, three. As he counts,

304
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:42,700
he's making little pin holes or pencil
marks every 50 year, a hundred years,

305
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,530
three 17 by the end of the first day,

306
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,250
he gets back to a thousand years like
the dark ages where in Europe eating raw

307
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:54,194
pasta

308
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:00,910
day to 2006 by the middle of the
day he gets back to like Jesus,

309
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,900
Roman Empire, gladiator, Centurion.

310
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,170
But even at that point he was only like
half [inaudible] wait, he finished.

311
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,870
He kept counting. We can begin to see
that we were getting over 4,000 years,

312
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,230
over 4,500 over 4,600 and we
ended up around 4,900 years.

313
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,410
4,844 annual rings in
it and at that point,

314
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,540
the oldest tree that anyone had
ever found was 4,600 years old.

315
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,530
In other words, he had
himself the oldest tree ever,

316
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,450
but he had killed it.
And you've got to think,

317
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,080
I've got to have done something
wrong. I bet her recount.

318
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,690
I better recount again. But no matter
how many times he counted the rings,

319
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,000
the number never went down.

320
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:53,980
[inaudible]

321
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,530
the world's oldest tree was dead.

322
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,923
Uh,

323
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,790
it was, it was truly, it was
horrifying. It was a, it was a,

324
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,370
like a family tragedy.

325
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,100
Uh,

326
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,790
people had given these trees names.

327
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,290
There was Buddha and
Socrates and Methuselah.

328
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,440
They called Curry's tree,
the promethium tree.

329
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,210
And the guy who named that particular
tree was so angry that he wrote a magazine

330
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:29,000
article where he called Don curry
a murderer all across the country.

331
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,290
There is a tremendous uproar. Same thing.

332
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:37,291
What about killing the world's
oldest living organism?

333
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,650
Ma, I thought we were just saying
it was the oldest living tree. It's,

334
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,840
it's both. It's the oldest tree
and it's the oldest organism.

335
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,790
It wait, wait, wait. You mean that
the oldest continuously living

336
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,320
okay.

337
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,270
And [inaudible] shrub mushroom, eh. Oh,

338
00:20:58,271 --> 00:21:01,520
you making it. Are you sure
about this? This head with,

339
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,980
this is the oldest living, continuous
individual alive on the planet.

340
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:09,760
I know what I said. This tree was older
than any other tree on the planet,

341
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,680
older than the oldest sponge,

342
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:15,910
which is like 1500 years old and
older than the oldest animal.

343
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,510
Just some sort of oyster,
which is 405 years old,

344
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,570
older than any other living
thing on the entire planet.

345
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,413
Oh God.

346
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,330
Where do we go? Here we go from there.
So where does that leave you, Mr. Curry.

347
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:38,440
So what happened to him? Well,
right after this happened,

348
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,810
Currie pretty much stopped
doing research on trees.

349
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,140
He basically studied salt flats
for the rest of his career.

350
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,180
[inaudible]

351
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,730
big treeless salt flats.

352
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,910
And aside from that little Nova
clip that we played before,

353
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:54,580
he hasn't really ever gone
on record talking about this.

354
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,850
So it's hard for us to say like
how we really felt about it.

355
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,140
There was this one moment he was
being interviewed by a TV reporter,

356
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,090
like about his salt flats research.

357
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,140
And this would have been in the 19
probably the late eighties early nineties

358
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,200
years and years after
the whole tree incident.

359
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,360
All of a sudden out of a clear blue sky

360
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,370
[inaudible]

361
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,770
the television reporter asked him, oh,

362
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:21,370
aren't you the curry who
killed the world's oldest tree?

363
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,680
He was completely empty.

364
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,960
[inaudible] yeah.

365
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,540
Curry just turned his back and ran away.

366
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:36,990
[inaudible]

367
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:41,630
who is it that's the same? It's just
we're off. Somebody on the other hand, he,

368
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,840
he did have the incredible ms switching
to kill the oldest living organism on

369
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:46,740
our planet. Yeah,

370
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:51,630
but this is 25 years later and he's
still getting hassled about this tree.

371
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,690
[inaudible] we're talking
about one tree here. Well No,

372
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,940
we're talking about the tree here. Right,

373
00:22:56,941 --> 00:23:01,941
but thing about a tree that lasts
for four almost 4,000 more than that.

374
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:08,400
5,005 almost five years. Is
that the, it is a repository.

375
00:23:08,401 --> 00:23:13,140
It is a talisman for 5,000 years of
earth history. But I mean would it be,

376
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,610
would it be any less bad if the tree
were three and a half thousand years old?

377
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,360
This is just one more
old thing. No, it is.

378
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,840
It's the oldest of all taking like the
Guinness Book of World Records. Oh,

379
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:27,330
you keep making me into like a
Ripley's believe it or not guy,

380
00:23:27,331 --> 00:23:30,140
but no really what
you're being, no, no, no.

381
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,370
There's a when you've been around
longer than everybody else,

382
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,130
there's a certain percentage
of your experience. Yeah.

383
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,920
Well I'm older than you.

384
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,670
I walk in here and I look at you
and I feel pity for other things.

385
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:46,010
You don't know [inaudible]
with the treatment of

386
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,560
film in a right blade,

387
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:55,150
but it must have been around as your
board and Pat Walters right about a month

388
00:23:55,341 --> 00:24:00,341
or you the round line and we're happy
to say that since our original broadcast

389
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,130
at the story, a new oldest
living tree has been found.

390
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,020
It's also a bristle cone pine also in
the white mountains and its current age.

391
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,980
According to Dr. Peter Brown of the Rocky
Mountain Tree Ring Research Group is

392
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,220
just about 5,060 years old,

393
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,730
which makes it actually older than
don Curry's tree when it was cut down.

394
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,640
So Don Curry, if you're out there
listening from the afterlife,

395
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:27,470
you can now rest in peace. We'll
continue in a moment. Little brains, man.

396
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,390

412
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,940
And now to keep us in our oopsie mood.

413
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,930
Here's another Cupertino oops
from language expert, Ben Zimmer.

414
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,600
So back in October, oh six Reuters,

415
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,890
the news wire had an article
about honeybees. And uh,

416
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:49,120
there was some very interesting sentences
in this article about honeybees.

417
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,860
For instance, did you know,

418
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:56,130
quote Queen Elizabeth has 10 times the
lifespan of workers and lays up to 2000

419
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,460
eggs a day. That's why
she's a very nice girl,

420
00:26:00,461 --> 00:26:02,980
but doesn't have a lot to say because
there's all these eggs dropping on the

421
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,190
floor with it's highly evolved social
structure of tens of thousands of worker

422
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,990
bees commanded by Queen Elizabeth.

423
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,860
The honeybee genome could also improve
the search for genes linked to social

424
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,590
behaviors. So every time
a clean reference came in,

425
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:17,710
they were commanded to that
particular queen. Whenever the words,

426
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,680
the Queen appeared in this
article, they had to be the queen.

427
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,740
So the queen was being
replaced with Queen Elizabeth,

428
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,470
unfortunately in an article about honeybee

429
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,003
[inaudible]

430
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,453
Ma'am

431
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,070
[inaudible]

432
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,750
this next, Ooh, singular. Ooh, wouldn't
it be, I mean, if you have one, oop.

433
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,130
Wouldn't never heard that, right?

434
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,940
No sister. A new clean edge. Oop. This
next one, it raises the question of,

435
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,820
I guess you'd say, of moral balance.

436
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,180
The question that I don't think any of
us would want to have to answer comes to

437
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:59,460
us from our producer Lulu Miller.
Okay, so set up this story a,

438
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:04,461
this story happens and where it's in a
little town in northern Michigan called

439
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,870
Myo 7:00 AM just drove through
the Delaware water gap.

440
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,120
That's me on my way out
there from New York.

441
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,280
The Sun is rising and it's about an
800 mile drive and is just gorgeous out

442
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:22,670
here. Listen to you lush and
I'll enter the outdoors. No,

443
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,070
yeah, I know,

444
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,060
but I'm just one of those people by
windows and when I get out into nature,

445
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,490
bear dive, feel my place in
the [inaudible] world. Anyways,

446
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,880
it's crossed into Myo. What was the
reason you were going again to see a bird?

447
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,600
A very, not just rare,

448
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,830
not just the kind of bird birders
get obsessed about this is a bird.

449
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,120
This is what they call a life bird. Oh,
life. Birders wait their life to see.

450
00:27:49,121 --> 00:27:52,840
It really only found right
here. What's the bird called?

451
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,620
The Kirtland warbler. Now have you,
have you seen apparently before? No,

452
00:27:56,621 --> 00:28:00,040
I've never seen one. This is my
first trip up here. This right here.

453
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:00,550
Where are you?

454
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,230
We're just outside of the town on the
edge of the forest about to go in and I

455
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,020
was standing with about 15 people
who've come from everywhere.

456
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,790
You folks coming from to see this bird
Toledo. I'm from South Carolina. Yeah,

457
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:16,480
we're from Oregon, Wyoming.
We'll walk out to a spot,

458
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:21,100
try to stay single file park ranger leads
us down a path into a little clearing

459
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,440
and pretty immediately in the
background there. Way Back there.

460
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,700
The guy from Ohio spots of
Kirtland. Huh? There you go.

461
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,780
Good tiny yellow bird
back there. Right there.

462
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,400
Up High and the Jack Pine Tree.
Oh Great. To sing it like crazy.

463
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,600
The lady from Dayton starts clapping.
Can you describe what you're seeing?

464
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,340
I see a lovely bird with a
gray back is a guy from Oregon,

465
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,960
Jim Coleman, blue gray bag,

466
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:53,760
and his wife read us smaller than a rob
and brilliant yellow in the sunlight.

467
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,120
It's just an absolutely
radiant bird. Yeah.

468
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:00,750
Is this worth the trip tomorrow
again? Oh, you bet. I don't know.

469
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,320
It just makes me thankful
that I'm here. Yeah, so,

470
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,770
and it makes me break for
them. My wife is here.

471
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,920
I know this is something she's
wanting to see a lot. For a long time.

472
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,650
Jim Actually starts to tear up.

473
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,130
It's a very special bird. Hold my hand.

474
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,480
He had a guy and that's what
this story is really about.

475
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,810
How special is this bird? Meaning
well, how much is a species?

476
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,830
Um, well here's the backstory. Okay.

477
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,130
In the early seventies the
warbler almost went extinct.

478
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,340
The reason why it thought was because
of a little creature called the Calbert.

479
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:48,080
I want to go in. Okay. That's
just the sound of them.

480
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,340
It's a parasite. You know
when someone who is this guy,

481
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,360
this is Chris Mensing fish and wildlife
biologist with the u s fish and Wildlife

482
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,640
Service, and we're standing
in this cage full of Calbert,

483
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,420
but it looks like we've got
six males and one female.

484
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,710
Let me grab a couple who just
reached out and grabbed two of them.

485
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,830
You can get it that the
males, oh yeah, go ahead.

486
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:15,000
Imagine a tiny little gnarly crow
got really sharp little. Yeah.

487
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,630
But with this blunt dagger like beat,
very drab body. I'm very doll to,

488
00:30:19,631 --> 00:30:23,560
here's what the Calbert does to the
warbler while the warbler is out of its

489
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:25,780
nest, like getting an
alarm or something. Yeah.

490
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,830
The Calbert lay is one of its own
eggs in the nest to make room for it.

491
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:31,480
So the warbler doesn't
know anything is up.

492
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,680
It pushes out one of the warblers
eggs. Oh yeah. Out of the nest.

493
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,370
[inaudible] and the timing is such that
the cupboard egg will hatch first and

494
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,960
will double its size in 24 hours. So
by the time that the host birds hatch,

495
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:46,540
that Colberg may be up
to four times the size,

496
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,660
and when they start begging for food
foods, the parents, the loudest,

497
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,230
most aggressive chick is going
to get fed the cupboard chick.

498
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:56,830
So the warbler mom ends up shoveling
food into this Calbert chicken. Yep.

499
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,280
Oftentimes it gets so much food
that another Warburg chick will die.

500
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:04,720
So when the cowbirds first showed up in
this area in late 18 hundreds early 19

501
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:07,030
hundreds the warbler population
just started plummeting.

502
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,650
This huge drop by 1971 or
only 200 males on earth.

503
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:12,190
Wow.

504
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:16,300
So what do you do? Are you asking me? Hmm.

505
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,950
Um, I guess you get it. Yeah.

506
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,290
Kill the cow. Birds. Um,

507
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,170
this is one of 54 traps and new
one that we just built this year,

508
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,810
which is why we're out in this cage. It's
actually a cowbird trap. Oh, she did?

509
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,530
Yeah, she, yeah,

510
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,400
she bite me just like anyone that's
yet someone larger grabbing you.

511
00:31:32,401 --> 00:31:35,670
They don't appreciate it too much. And
so anyone know how to kill, I kind of do.

512
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:39,540
Yeah. The rassic compression is the term
we use. We basically squeeze the bird,

513
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,430
suffocating and preventing
it from breathing just with
your hands. There's no,

514
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:47,690
Yup, Yup. Yeah. You have to do
that. Yeah. Like all the time. Yeah.

515
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,160
Did you see this? No,

516
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,940
but 1972 fish and wildlife service sets
up a bunch of traps a few years at about

517
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,780
12,000 dead cow birds. Later it work

518
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,153
[inaudible]

519
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:10,390
kind of the population stopped dying off,

520
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,630
but then it didn't start bouncing
back. What's going on? Yeah.

521
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,720
Why aren't we seeing bigger numbers
now that we're catching the competence?

522
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,840
That's Rita Helgeson.

523
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,080
She worked with the forest service back
in the eighties and we thought, well,

524
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,860
if we finally concluded it must be
just there is not enough happening.

525
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,980
10 like they don't have enough
trees. Is that right? Well, no,

526
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,940
there are plenty of trees,

527
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:35,450
but the thing about warblers is
they like a specific kind of tree.

528
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,340
They like them very young.

529
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:43,730
[inaudible] I could feel it at
the same. They like I'm young now,

530
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,620
but they like young trees
is what you're saying? Yup.

531
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:49,340
And there aren't young trees in
this place? No. It's really weird.

532
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:51,260
When when they started
looking around this forest,

533
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,050
they notice all the trees
were really, really old.

534
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,340
Why wouldn't there be
young trees? Well us.

535
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,160
Oh, you can

536
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,420
[inaudible] hey, smokey bear. Let's see.

537
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,000
When humans began to settle in this
area of Michigan in about the 1880s they

538
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:14,600
brought with them at certain
human disdain for fire,

539
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
could perforate forest fires.

540
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,750
The fire is exactly what's needed
up there to make new trees. Yeah.

541
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,630
This ecosystem is a fire
ecosystem. That's Chris.

542
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,760
It Burns because when these trees burn,

543
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:32,120
they release their seeds and
make room for new trees to grow.

544
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,960
It is a fire ecosystem. It
is made to burn. So I asked

545
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,980
do you again, what do you do?

546
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Do you start fires? Would that be the
solution that would be the solution. Wild.

547
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,570
So the forestry started doing
what we call a prescribed burn.

548
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,150
Basically says Rita, they burned
down a little patch of forest,

549
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,180
a few acres to regenerate it and one
windy spring day in 1980 at a place called

550
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:57,960
Mac Lake. The forestry service started a
fire that they probably shouldn't have.

551
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,850
Okay. My name is Dick Lord. At
the time of the Mack lake fire,

552
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,900
I was part of the ignition
crew for the prescribed burn.

553
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,560
What is an ignition crew?
Uh, they light the fire.

554
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,260
So at 10 in the morning they can his crew
go out into the woods when the plants

555
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:19,170
start setting up perimeters and they
begin lighting, a few stands of shrunk.

556
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,640
I was driving home, that's Bob Burner.
Best name ever for firefighter.

557
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:28,620
I could see forest service starting
to do a burn, and I thought,

558
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,570
this is not a good time. It was
windy. They didn't have the man power,

559
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,140
and I said, well, I'll probably be getting
called out here. The name. Basically,

560
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,320
we did not realize that the weather was
going to change as rapidly as it did and

561
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,380
the wind came up suddenly,
something nobody could predict,

562
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,640
and it took the fire across the road
into a standard mature Jack Pine.

563
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,640
[inaudible] flames, probably
a hundred 150 feet year solid.

564
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,740
It's like a roaring train.

565
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,720
Boys guys jump into their bulldozers
trying to plow trenches alongside the fly,

566
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,610
pinch at all, and you can feel the heat.

567
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,260
It was really out of our control
hitting the tops of the trees rolling.

568
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,780
I knew at the rate it was traveling
that nobody's going to be a major

569
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,003
catastrophe

570
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,880
within six hours. It had
burned over 20,000 acres.

571
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,920
It's one of the fastest moving fires ever
documented. Yeah, we're through here.

572
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,080
[inaudible] as you can see, it was
all black. These are two guys. Hi Bob.

573
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,990
I'm like, oh, houses in the
area that got burnt murder.

574
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,270
The guy down there in the corner, yeah,

575
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,590
grabbed it off there and dropped the
black chard. Their houses were okay,

576
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:48,480
but 41 houses were destroyed all the
way up to the lake. She's completely,

577
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,280
Yep. Nothing Green. No.

578
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,840
Like something out of a moonscape fires.

579
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:58,500
You could see everything gone and the
worst part about it for all of us,

580
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,850
that's three to help us. Then again,

581
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,150
one said it killed one in the
foreign service employees,

582
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:08,151
a very young wildlife technician who
was very well loved by his coworkers.

583
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,970
A guy named Jim Swiderski. You
know Jim was a good friend?

584
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,853
Yeah.

585
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,430
As well as an employee
declared. Again, Jim's boss.

586
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,950
He told me that Jim had been
a postman for a few years,

587
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,780
but just loved birds so much that he
took a huge pay cut to come and help

588
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,760
protect the warbler. Basically
what happened was, oh, okay,

589
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,250
the fire overran him. Oh,

590
00:36:35,251 --> 00:36:39,390
the press was having a heyday just tearing
into the forest service from what had

591
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:42,930
happened in the towns. People were
very angry at the forest service.

592
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,170
How could you do this? We just,

593
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,790
as they were told not to wear their
forest service uniforms in town. Gosh,

594
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,810
it was so terrible in the
forest itself. You know,

595
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,240
there was nothing there.
It was completely silent.

596
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,510
But a year later,

597
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,030
a little bit of green started to poke up
and the next year a little bit more and

598
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,450
eight to 10 years after that Mac like
Bern just seemed like every word you

599
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:11,290
turned around, you'd stop for, listen. No,

600
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,560
hardly five or six birds. The tremendous,

601
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,240
that was the, the answer to the
mystery. The fire, you know,

602
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,200
if you look at a population graph,
that's Christmas thing again.

603
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,570
After that Mac lake burn
population went like that,

604
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,450
he points his hand straight
up. So it's pretty dramatic.

605
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,260
And today the numbers are
up to almost 4,000 birth

606
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,170
and growing singing like crazy.

607
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:44,050
Now that the birds are
back, but a man is gone.

608
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,540
When you walk around this town,
a question lingers in the air.

609
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,200
Your wife over before your
mum worth the life of a bird.

610
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,030
Take a woman. Look at her.

611
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,523
No,

612
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:06,960
in my opinion it isn't. This is Ed Faucet.

613
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,950
I W I wouldn't trade your life for a
bird and sitting with him and his wife,

614
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:11,690
Mary Jane,

615
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:16,500
a man in a diner and no matter
where you go in this town,

616
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,940
but the government doing people don't
tend to be huge fans of the warbler.

617
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,380
It's just a small bird. I've been up
here since 68 I've never seen one.

618
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:30,260
Did you ever see one? No, never have I
seen it in and back to Ed. I just got,

619
00:38:30,261 --> 00:38:30,961
I say to you,

620
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:35,961
what would you think about it if your
father or were killed for a bird?

621
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,080
Be Pretty hard to accept when,

622
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,470
but if you zoom out one human
life versus the end of a species,

623
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,100
you know how many warblers
there are in the United States,

624
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,380
there's something like 37 species of
warblers are the real number is actually

625
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,770
closer to 60 wow. That's
kind of ridiculous.

626
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,790
And that's not all they ask you. When
are you done? And we really say never.

627
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,360
Chris explained to me that they have to
keep killing the Calverts and they have

628
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:06,670
to keep doing burns, these smaller burns.

629
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,260
But every single year if we let things
be, the bird would be extinct. Wow.

630
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,100
That's the hard thing about this job
is knowing that we're never done.

631
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,320
How many people are working,

632
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,350
how much you're probably
looking at hundreds of people.

633
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:25,060
Well over $1 million a year spent.
All of this began to really sink in.

634
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:30,120
I'm one of my last mornings
out there. All right.

635
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,990
It is five in the morning. It was
the annual Kirtland warbler. Census.

636
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,410
We're birders from all over the world
show up to help count how many warblers

637
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:45,100
there are out there. Is it like there
is a warbler stepped up. Steps up.

638
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,760
There is a warbler. Yeah, that's
actually exactly how it works.

639
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,770
I was paired up with
this guy, Dave Mendez.

640
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:53,560
We're going to kind of walk through
the middle of these transects.

641
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,620
We're going to come up. He's like, he's
kind of a dude, dude. He's an older guy,

642
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,410
got a beer and works for
an electrical contractor.

643
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,070
Told me he's got a man room and man
room. You know most guys that got sports,

644
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,540
but I've got Kirtland's warbler
pictures up on the wall. Nice.

645
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,990
So I went into it thinking like, this'll
be really cool. We'll march along.

646
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,890
We'll count it. I looked at the
map. It was a mile maybe of a walk.

647
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:17,680
We'll be done in 20 minutes.
Well, okay, maybe not.

648
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,580
We're walking through the
forest on our top and they did.

649
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,810
We set off dense brambly
forest. Still Dark.

650
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,250
That was a hermit thresh. Okay. Let me
just play you a quick little time lapse.

651
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,330
20 to seven right now the sun's just
coming up and it's getting a little muggy

652
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:40,970
out here. That was the
curtains. Oh yeah. Yeah.

653
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,900
We can't count them though.
He's in that intersection.

654
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,940
Seven oh seven heard one way
back that way. Yeah. Yeah.

655
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,180
There it is again. Yeah,

656
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:55,000
but I'm not gonna mark them in because
I don't know exactly where he's at.

657
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,600
Seven 33 there we go.
Yeah. Yup. Right there.

658
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:04,410
Did you counter? No, no, no, no, no, no,
no. We want to be a lot more accurate.

659
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,250
We want to triangulate them. Nine
56 and all's well and the warbler.

660
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,820
Woods couple of anther bite
me. Yeah, they hurt down there.

661
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,030
They do a little bit.
Yeah. Get out of there.

662
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:16,760
[inaudible]

663
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,600
10:45 AM I know that
there's a bird out there,

664
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,290
I can still hear that
burden way back there.

665
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,590
So we ended up staying out there
for seven and a half hours.

666
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,700
Just marked one, right? Yep.

667
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,550
I've only mark one and I don't mean
sound like I'm making fun of Dave.

668
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,320
I mean he's doing his job well,

669
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,710
but at some point in between the fire
ants and taking four hours to confirm this

670
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,910
one bird, he's going to
be right off right here.

671
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,540
I just started thinking
about all the effort.

672
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:51,530
It takes Rosa trees over from us and I
can't see him. I just suddenly thought

673
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,133
[inaudible]

674
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:58,210
it's missing Fussy, fragile little
bird and it hasn't evolved. Who Cares?

675
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,990
I mean this is not worth it.

676
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,650
And so I started asking
people who protect the bird,

677
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,250
why I do that with so much
money and it's all for a bird.

678
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,110
And I could see it maybe
if it was for some,

679
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:15,290
but it's just one warbler of 18 million
different kinds of warblers like why do

680
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:20,570
it? Oh, we do it cause we, we should,
you know, we're stewards of the land.

681
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,700
That's Chris mincing
again. Cowbird killer.

682
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,530
It's for future generations and well,
here's the firestarter Dick Lord.

683
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,433
You know,

684
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,600
the Kirtland's warbler was listed under
the endangered species act and we had a

685
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:40,390
charge under the law to do what
we could to recover its existence.

686
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,610
And that's the only thing
that I can say that, you know,

687
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,170
we had to do what the
law required us to do,

688
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,230
so we should do it and the
law tells us we have to do it.

689
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,900
Vincent and that question is a little
wasteful for firemen worth the life of a

690
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,540
bird. And that guy, ed at the
diner, it just duck in my mind.

691
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:07,250
And I realized I couldn't leave this town
until I talked to the people who lost

692
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,910
the most and I just skated. Introduced
yourself full name. Yeah, sure.

693
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,810
Robert Sweaters, ski age 54
Kathleen Sweaters, Ski Florence,

694
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,650
Wider Ski. The mother, mother and
the mother. The guy died. Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,250
I guess that's it. What ice
tea or water or anything.

696
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:24,780
We're all sitting around
the kitchen table.

697
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,340
There's a lot of dogs and bureau over
there. Kim's brother-in-law's there too.

698
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,350
So off Kevin, Kevin Debris and I
asked them to tell me about Jim.

699
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,700
Pretty Guy. Soft spoken.

700
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,760
Smart is quite a character.

701
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,650
Yup. They told me at
first they were furious.

702
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:45,850
They should have never ever sent him
in there. Angry at the forest service.

703
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,900
Angry about this bird.
No. Very angry. Now,

704
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,890
three decades later, I say you keep
that a little vertical. Exactly. Really?

705
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:59,600
Jim's younger brother Robert said that
the thing he wanted the most is for the

706
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:02,970
Kirtland's warbler to become
the state Burke by that.

707
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:04,270
That would be the ultimate, Huh?

708
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,310
That would be the biggest accomplishment
ever would be that be in a state bird.

709
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,100
Well I guess I'm, I'm,

710
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,540
I guess in some ways I'm surprised
like I didn't mean to come here with

711
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,231
expectations,

712
00:44:16,231 --> 00:44:20,280
but in some ways I thought if it was
my family that I would hate that bird,

713
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,250
but I would just hate that
bird. No, it's not the bird.

714
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,180
I mean that bird didn't do
anything to any of us. You know,

715
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,830
if we can keep it going, I
mean that's what he out to do.

716
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:35,070
Let's keep it going. They
think about Jim's death.

717
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,410
Any of the military guys
like the death of a soldier,

718
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,180
where would you be setting right now?

719
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,020
We would have lost all those soldiers
in world war one. World War Two,

720
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:46,830
he died protecting us. You
know, it's only one species.

721
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:50,100
Well then this could be another species
in another species, in another species.

722
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,490
Next thing you know, he'll walk out
in the morning and it'll be quiet.

723
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,490
Thank God for the Teddy Roosevelt and
the boys that made our national parks.

724
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:08,290
Imagine what if we didn't have those? It
costs money. It's painful, blah, blah,

725
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:12,490
blah. You gotta have the guts to do that.

726
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,570
And Jim was really that kind of
guy. Wow. That is convincing. Yeah,

727
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,950
but I mean, do you agree
for us? And I asked the mom,

728
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,360
what can I say? The bird
took become and back,

729
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,680
but the life is gone.

730
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:32,780
So why bring it up again? It's done. It's,

731
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:37,580
you can't bring it back. So
you have to live by that,

732
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:39,110
but there's always a hole in your heart,

733
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:45,320
something that none of us
will ever forget forever.

734
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,890
Don't ask me any more questions, please.

735
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,123
Okay.

736
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:59,060
And then, oh good. Oh, the power went out.

737
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,770
Give me a break. Oh. Oh,

738
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:12,300
cool. We go home and get the generator.

Didn't hate him. I'm Jed. I'm Robert
Dune Dude. You and your topic remains.

759
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,890
Oops. [inaudible] final loops coming up.

760
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,360
[inaudible] it's sort of a double hoops.
I would say we start with an oops.

761
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,570
That leads to a another,
oops. That then self negates.

762
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,190
It comes to us from a fellow who within
the confines of the show we will call

763
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,271
oopsie wheeler.

764
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:56,140
So maybe we could just start with the
both of you kinda introducing yourself and

765
00:47:56,141 --> 00:47:57,460
saying who you are and what you do.

766
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:00,480
I mean just something basically
like I'm Andrea sterly. Oh me.

767
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,090
I'm Donald Sterling. This is dawn and
Andrew Sterling. They're chemists.

768
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,290
They're actually a research team here
at a University of Montana and they met

769
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:13,291
back in the 70s 1979 at the
University of California in San Diego.

770
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,770
We met and almost fell
in love at first sight.

771
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:20,530
We dated for a week. He proposed,

772
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:25,020
I accepted they got married and not
long after don got offered a job.

773
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:27,870
So they left their home in
Sunny California and mind you,

774
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,480
we lived about half a mile away

775
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,870
from the ocean. Nonetheless, they
packed up a truck with all of our stuff,

776
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,170
including about 200
plants and they moved to a

777
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:43,870
Butte, Montana, which is a
different thing altogether,

778
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:48,540
but an old mining town that barely
had a tree in the city limits.

779
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:52,510
I don't know if you want to know Andrea's
first impressions of Butte or not that

780
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:56,760
shirt. I actually burst into
tears and then started laughing.

781
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:57,730
I think we call that his [inaudible].

782
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:02,150
Yeah,

783
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:06,550
the viewing stand used to be up on the
hill over here when this was an operating

784
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,710
pit, so I actually grew up in the
town over from Butte, Montana.

785
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,070
It's kind of that town that you were
afraid to go to when you were a kid.

786
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,010
Filled with abandoned buildings, depressed

787
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,080
and actually if you walked
through town right there,

788
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:26,500
right next to the middle of town,
remember exactly where it was.

789
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,310
I remember being consistently enormous
open wound on the hill, like, oh wow,

790
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:36,450
this, this deep pit.
This is where the pit is,

791
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,520
the Berkeley pit and the guy saying,
wow is Barrett Golding. I actually,

792
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,230
I couldn't get back to Butte myself,

793
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:46,370
so I asked Barrett to go over there
and visit with a couple of engineer's.

794
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,470
So tell me who you are.
Okay, well, I'm Joe Griffin,

795
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,680
Montana Department of Environmental
Quality and I'm Nick Tucci.

796
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:55,800
I'm with the Montana Bureau of Mines
and geology and the three of them are

797
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:59,520
standing at the edge of the pit,
which is kind of hard to imagine,

798
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:00,990
especially the size of this thing,

799
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:03,900
but when you're at the edge of the pit
and you look down in what you actually

800
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:07,470
see is how can you
convey what we're seeing,

801
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,370
this enormous lake kind of, well,

802
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:15,090
it's 40 billion gallons of
water, which is a lot of water.

803
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:19,740
It's one of the larger lakes in the
United States. It's carved into this hill.

804
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,510
Yeah. The main difference though,

805
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:24,840
between this lake and one that you might
decide to take an afternoon dip in,

806
00:50:24,841 --> 00:50:26,940
is that this lake is a

807
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,120
color of the water, is red,

808
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,330
is kind of sickly red,

809
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,840
and also rains and gray and black.

810
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:39,803
Oh

811
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,230
[inaudible]

812
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:49,030
shimmers in this way that
like words can't describe.

813
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,420
And when you're standing there
you can't help but wonder

814
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,540
the question I really have,

815
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:57,600
and I'll rephrase it after I ask it
cause it's not quite, it's like what the,

816
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:03,260
what happened? What happened? Well,

817
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:05,990
it's just a, you know, the price of copper

818
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,580
in the 1920s when we were stringing up
telephone wires and electrical wires and

819
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:12,690
going through world wars,

820
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,420
a third of the copper in the
u s came out of this hill,

821
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,570
you know, the long and
the short of it is, um,

822
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,190
you wouldn't be standing here broadcasting
this or recording this without copper

823
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,380
in your wire right there.

824
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:25,340
And in his heyday, you know,

825
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:29,150
before the pit was even around
Butte was this mining boom town.

826
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,220
But by the 1940s,

827
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,360
the price of copper or drop a company
that owned all the mines and BW wasn't

828
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:36,200
doing so well.

829
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:41,201
And so they figured if it'd be cheaper
and easier to just blow the top off the

830
00:51:41,361 --> 00:51:42,194
hill.

831
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,530
Things just kept getting worse.

832
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:53,000
And by 1982 right around the time when
don and Andrea were coming to town,

833
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:54,103
going over the man,

834
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,000
mine's completely shut down when they
shut the pit in early 1980s right?

835
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,250
Here's the things, while
they're actually mining,

836
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:04,280
they keep all the groundwater pumped out
of there so that it's dry and they can

837
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:05,540
work and when they shut the mines,

838
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,240
they shut off the pumps. The
company turned off the pumps,

839
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,040
I think it was Earth Day 1982
yeah. On Earth Day after that,

840
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:20,041
the a p it started filling up with
groundwater and it took a good 10 years to

841
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:26,161
actually see a kind of a rust colored
puddling in the bottom of the pit itself,

842
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,520
but it was a puddle that was growing
and growing and growing and growing,

843
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:34,410
growing. Now here's the
thing about that water.

844
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,330
The rock around the pit is filled with
pyrite and when the water hits the Pyrite

845
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,130
in the air, the three reacts
to create sulfuric acid.

846
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,700
Oh, in turn, that's Edwin Dob.

847
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,960
Freelance writer had been for about
20 years. I actually grew up in Butte.

848
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,800
The sulfuric acid hastens the
removal of the metals from the,

849
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,100
or itself like gold and
silver and copper, copper,

850
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,920
cadmium and row sink,

851
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,520
iron sulfate, arsenic.

852
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,150
And what you end up with is
this toxic acidic disaster

853
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:13,110
and it's still rising.
The fact that, you know,

854
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:17,370
since we started working on this piece,
Jed, it's arisen like about a foot.

855
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:22,340
Um, there was an incident,
infamous incident in the mid 1990s.

856
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,830
Anybody who grew up anywhere
near Butte knows this

857
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,140
one stormy night, some
340 snow geese landed.

858
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,960
They landed on the water looking for
shelter and they of course drink some of

859
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:34,110
it.

860
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:39,110
The next day there were 342 goose
carcasses floating on the water.

861
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:44,450
They were all dead and the autopsy showed
lesions in the esophagus throughout

862
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:49,890
the digestive system. Oh, so it's like
the water ate their insights. Yeah.

863
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,460
Were you struck at all like
Alan Pon arriving there?

864
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:55,890
Did you actually kind
of go visit the mind?

865
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,890
The old mine site avoided
it like the plague.

866
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,020
We were to staunch

867
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:06,660
environmentalist in the idea of living
in a mining town was so completely

868
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:10,160
foreign. And when they first showed
up in Butte, dawn and Andrea,

869
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,590
or they were kind of struggling to fit
in at the university because they're

870
00:54:13,591 --> 00:54:16,830
trying to study this, a little
microorganisms sponge in Bermuda,

871
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,370
but they're in Butte and
locked Butte, Montana.

872
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,310
To make matters worse when they
took off for a year on Sabbatical,

873
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,100
our college accidentally
unplugged our refrigerator,

874
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,540
destroying all of our
samples on desperation.

875
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:35,160
Definitely had no funding. We
decided we just needed to start over.

876
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,440
But one day a scientist named Bill Chatham
came into their lab with a piece of

877
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:44,790
wood and on this wood there was
some green, slimy stuff and he says,

878
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:48,930
you won't believe this, but I found this
stick with the slime on it in the pit

879
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,300
floating about a foot below the surface
of the water. No. Here's the thing.

880
00:54:54,301 --> 00:54:56,220
I mean that lake is, this is like,

881
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,330
this is the most deadly place
you can imagine. I mean,

882
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,260
nothing grows here. Nothing should
grow here. Nothing. Absolutely not.

883
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:07,440
Not even anything but nothing.
Yeah. Less than nothing.

884
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,640
Maybe absolute nothing like
negative numbers of nothingness.

885
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,000
It's more than nothing is an
active getting rid of thing.

886
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,030
It's an a gating nothingness. You
know how there's love and hate.

887
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,440
This is not a lack of
love. This is hate. Okay?

888
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,280
But they got together
with some colleagues.

889
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:26,880
They looked at the slime and
they realized against all odds

890
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,220
the stuff was alive, life, an acid mine,

891
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:35,370
waste life that no one
had ever studied before.

892
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,050
It really is what started everything
we've been doing now. Gosh,

893
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,090
for the last 15 years

894
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:49,070
[inaudible] so far we found
virtually hundreds of compounds,

895
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,510
organisms that were growing,

896
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,310
organisms that make molecules
that can fight viruses,

897
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:59,060
several turn out to be good in our
Andi cancer screen, like cancer,

898
00:55:59,061 --> 00:56:04,061
really per click acid in
Berkeley ammonites and the
Berkeley Assa Towel is now

899
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:08,180
published. Tons of papers. I mean
their work has just taken off,

900
00:56:08,181 --> 00:56:10,130
so it's been pretty exciting research.

901
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:19,370
But then they told me this story
that totally took them by surprise.

902
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,010
It was about a year after they'd first
started looking at the Pittwater.

903
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,980
We found this sort of a
sticky, opaque, thick,

904
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:31,930
gooey black organism. Then
they noticed that weirdly,

905
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:35,650
if you put this little guy into a
thing of the water from the pit,

906
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,880
it actually absorbs the metals in
Pittwater. What does that mean?

907
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,750
Like they're taking the
metals out of the water.

908
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,510
They become little metal sponge. Yes.

909
00:56:43,511 --> 00:56:45,790
But so they're cleaning the water
is what you're saying? Yeah.

910
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:48,970
And there's lots of people that work
with micro organisms to try to clean up

911
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,860
metal, laid in water. But usually these
things take in maybe like, I don't know,

912
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:55,430
10, 15% of the metal.

913
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,910
This little guy will actually
absorb between 85 and 95%.

914
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:01,600
Whoa.

915
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,560
So they got really curious about it and
they started trying to figure out where

916
00:57:05,561 --> 00:57:09,280
it had ever been seen before we had it
identified and they eventually discovered

917
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:13,420
that the only place this
yeast had ever been found was

918
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:15,683
where?

919
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,180
Well, in the rectal swabs of geese.

920
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,863
Oh, okay.

921
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,840
You mean like the snuggies
that landed on the water? Yeah.

922
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,593
Hmm.

923
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,670
The geese left a little, uh,

924
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,330
a little something behind

925
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,533
[inaudible].

926
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:53,200
So on wheeler, more
