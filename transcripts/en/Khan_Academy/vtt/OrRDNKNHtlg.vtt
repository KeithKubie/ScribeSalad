00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.750
Let's explore a bit how the
price of an option can vary,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.680
or how it can relate to
the actual expiration date.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.730
So what I'm going to do is
compare two similar options

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.550
with the underlying stock
being General Electric.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.660
And they're going to be
the same in every way,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.880
except one is going to have a
further out expiration date.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.480
So let's compare this
call option right here.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.430
So this is a call option on
GE with a $17 strike price.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.800
So it's the option to
buy GE stock at $17.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.640
And it has an April,
2011 expiration.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.086
So it's going to expire,
or the last day of trading

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:38.460
that you could
trade this option,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520
will be the third
Friday in April.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.310
Let's compare that with an
option that has the same strike

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.690
price, but has a
December, 2011 expiration.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.710
So we're going to look for $17
strike price right over here.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.830
And you can see right when
you compare the options

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.110
that the one that has a further
out expiration cost more.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.520
This one costs $3.25, while
this one only cost $2.36.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.870
And the reason why
it costs more is

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.530
because you get to retain
the option for longer.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.720
So you could imagine, $17.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.050
Let's say that $17
is right over here.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.000
Let me draw a
hypothetical stock chart.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.750
So let's say that $17
is right over here.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.260
And so you could
imagine, let's say,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.012
that you have both
of those options.

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:32.470
Or you have the option to have
either one of those options.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.540
And let's say that the stock
does something like that.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.040
Well, it's going
to be in the money.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.880
You have the right, if you own
either one of those options,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.080
you have the option to
buy the stock at $17

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.120
and then sell it at
whatever price this is.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.280
Maybe this price over here
is like $20 something.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.700
So you would make money.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.850
But if you have the option
with a closer expiration,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.650
with the April,
2011 expiration, you

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.830
have to exercise the
option right now.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.050
You would have to
exercise it right now

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.680
and close out the option.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.539
If you had the longer dated
option, you could do it.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.090
You could do the
exact same thing

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.690
that this owner of an
April, 2011 option has.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.090
Or you can hold the
option and maybe see

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.350
if the stock continues to go up.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.070
Or you could imagine
a downside scenario.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.910
Maybe the stock does
something like this,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.380
where it goes out of the money.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.200
Someone who holds the closer
dated option, the one that

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.910
expires first, they'll be
completely out of the money.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.260
The option would be
worthless on this date.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.280
But if you have the
longer expiration,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.952
if your option does not
expire until December of 2011,

00:02:42.952 --> 00:02:43.910
then you could hold it.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.620
And maybe, maybe the stock
will do something nice.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.750
There's some probability
that it will one day

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.650
become in the money.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.880
I want to make it clear.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.660
Even if you have
this situation here,

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.100
and you hold the
longer dated option--

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.710
you have the option that's
going to expire in December--

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.230
you still would not
want to exercise it.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.630
Because there is
someone who would still

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.240
enjoy all of this
optionality of the future.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.980
So what you're better off
doing, instead of exercising

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.690
the option, you're better off
selling the longer dated option

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.630
right over there.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.070
And you should be able to
capture at least as much profit

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.360
as you would from exercising the
option, plus capturing whatever

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.990
value the buyer sees in
the future optionality.
