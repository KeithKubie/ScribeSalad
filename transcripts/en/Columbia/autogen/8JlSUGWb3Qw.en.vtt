new ways that just were undreamed-of
just a few years ago the sense of

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.050
just a few years ago the sense of
 

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.280
just a few years ago the sense of
education as a key element we're all

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.290
education as a key element we're all
 

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.860

we're becoming more interconnected these

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.330
we're becoming more interconnected these
 

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.440
we're becoming more interconnected these
are the terms that we use what does it

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.450
are the terms that we use what does it
 

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.510

look like do you think if all things go

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:26.520
look like do you think if all things go
 

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.250
look like do you think if all things go
reasonably well of course there'll be

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.260
reasonably well of course there'll be
 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.400
reasonably well of course there'll be
some some problems along the way and

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:31.410
some some problems along the way and
 

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.840
some some problems along the way and
maybe there'll be big problems but if

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:32.850
maybe there'll be big problems but if
 

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.750
maybe there'll be big problems but if
everything keeps going with the forces

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760
everything keeps going with the forces
 

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.810
everything keeps going with the forces
now at work what does the world look

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.820
now at work what does the world look
 

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:44.030
now at work what does the world look
like in let's go out 20 25 years 20-30

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040
like in let's go out 20 25 years 20-30
 

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.420
like in let's go out 20 25 years 20-30
now I want to get us to think about what

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:50.430
now I want to get us to think about what
 

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.630
now I want to get us to think about what
do we need to do in order to prepare for

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640
do we need to do in order to prepare for
 

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.090
do we need to do in order to prepare for
this world but give us a picture of

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100
this world but give us a picture of
 

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.270
this world but give us a picture of
these forces continued at work what does

00:09:59.270 --> 00:09:59.280
these forces continued at work what does
 

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.820
these forces continued at work what does
the world look like in in a quarter

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:01.830
the world look like in in a quarter
 

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.320
the world look like in in a quarter
century from now Joe do you want to

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.330
century from now Joe do you want to
 

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.200
century from now Joe do you want to
start on that well let me begin by

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.210
start on that well let me begin by
 

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.120
start on that well let me begin by
saying you know one of the one of the

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.130
saying you know one of the one of the
 

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.470
saying you know one of the one of the
real problems is that economic

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480
real problems is that economic
 

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.830
real problems is that economic
globalization has outpaced the might say

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:15.840
globalization has outpaced the might say
 

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.530
globalization has outpaced the might say
the political globalization the extent

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540
the political globalization the extent
 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.700
the political globalization the extent
to which we are able to deal with the

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:22.710
to which we are able to deal with the
 

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.820
to which we are able to deal with the
problems that closer integration

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:24.830
problems that closer integration
 

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.870
problems that closer integration
presents as we become more

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880
presents as we become more
 

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.830
presents as we become more
interdependent there is more need for

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:29.840
interdependent there is more need for
 

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.690
interdependent there is more need for
collective cooperative action and we

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700
collective cooperative action and we
 

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.430
collective cooperative action and we
don't have the democratic institutions

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440
don't have the democratic institutions
 

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.720
don't have the democratic institutions
to deal with that so if you started

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:38.730
to deal with that so if you started
 

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.070
to deal with that so if you started
listing some of the problems as you look

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080
listing some of the problems as you look
 

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.620
listing some of the problems as you look
forward for the next two three decades

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:45.630
forward for the next two three decades
 

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.250
forward for the next two three decades
you realize the profit that the

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:49.260
you realize the profit that the
 

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.870
you realize the profit that the
difficulties we have of you dressing

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880
difficulties we have of you dressing
 

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.590
difficulties we have of you dressing
them one of the problems is the growing

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600
them one of the problems is the growing
 

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.230
them one of the problems is the growing
in most countries around the world the

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240
in most countries around the world the
 

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.180
in most countries around the world the
you know citizen makes in the lack of

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:03.190
 

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.150
education that that that it doesn't take

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160
education that that that it doesn't take
 

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.040
education that that that it doesn't take
a lot of money to provide universal

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.050
a lot of money to provide universal
 

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.699
a lot of money to provide universal
primary education and yet that money is

00:11:12.699 --> 00:11:12.709
primary education and yet that money is
 

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:18.670
primary education and yet that money is
not forthcoming so so there is growing

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680
not forthcoming so so there is growing
 

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.530
not forthcoming so so there is growing
inequality in most countries the world

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:20.540
inequality in most countries the world
 

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.259
inequality in most countries the world
we talk about technology and the

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:23.269
we talk about technology and the
 

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:26.439
we talk about technology and the
Vantage's that it provides and yeah and

00:11:26.439 --> 00:11:26.449
Vantage's that it provides and yeah and
 

00:11:26.449 --> 00:11:29.920
Vantage's that it provides and yeah and
it's been a big part of the success of

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:29.930
it's been a big part of the success of
 

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.860
it's been a big part of the success of
for instance India but much of Africa

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:32.870
for instance India but much of Africa
 

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.170
for instance India but much of Africa
doesn't have access to the technology or

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:35.180
doesn't have access to the technology or
 

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.319
doesn't have access to the technology or
to the educate have a level of education

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:38.329
to the educate have a level of education
 

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:40.360
to the educate have a level of education
take advantage of the technology so they

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:40.370
take advantage of the technology so they
 

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.120
take advantage of the technology so they
have been falling falling behind so

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.130
have been falling falling behind so
 

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.430
have been falling falling behind so
that's one aspect the growing inequality

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440
that's one aspect the growing inequality
 

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.350
that's one aspect the growing inequality
a second problem is the financial

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360
a second problem is the financial
 

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.699
a second problem is the financial
turmoil the IMF was created as an

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:54.709
turmoil the IMF was created as an
 

00:11:54.709 --> 00:11:58.629
turmoil the IMF was created as an
institution to address the problems of

00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639
institution to address the problems of
 

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.460
institution to address the problems of
globally integrated financial markets

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:00.470
globally integrated financial markets
 

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.620
globally integrated financial markets
but it hasn't done it effectively and

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.630
but it hasn't done it effectively and
 

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.790
but it hasn't done it effectively and
didn't anticipate the problems of global

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800
didn't anticipate the problems of global
 

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.220
didn't anticipate the problems of global
imbalances didn't anticipate the

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.230
imbalances didn't anticipate the
 

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.439
imbalances didn't anticipate the
problems of the subprime workings and

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:11.449
problems of the subprime workings and
 

00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:14.889
problems of the subprime workings and
the implications of that and so one

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:14.899
the implications of that and so one
 

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:18.749
the implications of that and so one
could see a pattern of repeated

00:12:18.749 --> 00:12:18.759
could see a pattern of repeated
 

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:22.240
could see a pattern of repeated
financial crisis we had one in 97 just

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.250
financial crisis we had one in 97 just
 

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.860
financial crisis we had one in 97 just
10 years ago we're having them again

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:23.870
10 years ago we're having them again
 

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.769
10 years ago we're having them again
it's clear we have financial problems

00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:26.779
it's clear we have financial problems
 

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:31.840
it's clear we have financial problems
and thirdly I think you can't not talk

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:31.850
and thirdly I think you can't not talk
 

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:33.939
and thirdly I think you can't not talk
about the global environmental problems

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:33.949
about the global environmental problems
 

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:39.030
about the global environmental problems
climate change and while Keota was a

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040
climate change and while Keota was a
 

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.470
climate change and while Keota was a
important step in the right direction we

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480
important step in the right direction we
 

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.800
important step in the right direction we
have to remember that it left out three

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:44.810
have to remember that it left out three
 

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.600
have to remember that it left out three
forced the sources of emissions the

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:46.610
forced the sources of emissions the
 

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.559
forced the sources of emissions the
developing countries the United States

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:49.569
developing countries the United States
 

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:53.740
developing countries the United States
deforestation and even within the new

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:53.750
deforestation and even within the new
 

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.079
deforestation and even within the new
limited areas that addicts something the

00:12:56.079 --> 00:12:56.089
limited areas that addicts something the
 

00:12:56.089 --> 00:12:58.360
limited areas that addicts something the
targets were not as ambitious as the

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:58.370
targets were not as ambitious as the
 

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:03.820
targets were not as ambitious as the
world needs from what you say Joe

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:03.830
world needs from what you say Joe
 

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:08.450
world needs from what you say Joe
you say I I can't think about what 20 30

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:08.460
you say I I can't think about what 20 30
 

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.430
you say I I can't think about what 20 30
looks like because I see such immense

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440
looks like because I see such immense
 

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.800
looks like because I see such immense
problems looming ahead and the lack of

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:17.810
problems looming ahead and the lack of
 

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.080
problems looming ahead and the lack of
institutional ability to address them at

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:21.090
institutional ability to address them at
 

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.740
institutional ability to address them at
this point that until those are

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:24.750
this point that until those are
 

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.380
this point that until those are
addressed I just can't anticipate in

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:27.390
addressed I just can't anticipate in
 

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.550
addressed I just can't anticipate in
other words yeah it's not just

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560
other words yeah it's not just
 

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.890
other words yeah it's not just
institutional it's buying set I mean

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:30.900
institutional it's buying set I mean
 

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.580
institutional it's buying set I mean
it's a question of we've created this

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:34.590
it's a question of we've created this
 

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.240
it's a question of we've created this
you might say one economic world yeah

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.250
you might say one economic world yeah
 

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.530
you might say one economic world yeah
but we aren't thinking that way

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.540
but we aren't thinking that way
 

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:44.000
but we aren't thinking that way
particularly the United States and would

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.010
particularly the United States and would
 

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.270
particularly the United States and would
you say that would you is it your view

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.280
you say that would you is it your view
 

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.320
you say that would you is it your view
that the institution's we have now

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:50.330
that the institution's we have now
 

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.330
that the institution's we have now

have the answers because a lot of the

00:51:59.980 --> 00:51:59.990
have the answers because a lot of the
 

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:02.200

complex global problems and I just

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:11.870
complex global problems and I just
 

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.960
complex global problems and I just
wanted to give one example because I

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:13.970
wanted to give one example because I

different from a normal way of problem
 

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:24.340
different from a normal way of problem
solving and it involves the question of

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:24.350
solving and it involves the question of
 

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:26.680
solving and it involves the question of
extreme poverty and the goals that we've

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:26.690

and so you need a whole interconnected

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720
and so you need a whole interconnected
 

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.260

is a global Orchestra and the question

00:52:59.500 --> 00:52:59.510
is a global Orchestra and the question
 

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.210
is a global Orchestra and the question
is can you get any sound out of it that

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:01.220
is can you get any sound out of it that
 

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:06.790
is can you get any sound out of it that
is an awful and it seems to me it seems

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:06.800
is an awful and it seems to me it seems
 

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.390
is an awful and it seems to me it seems
to me that the answer starts in a little

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400
to me that the answer starts in a little
 

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.720
to me that the answer starts in a little
bit of an odd way which is the world's

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:13.730
bit of an odd way which is the world's
 

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.810
bit of an odd way which is the world's
actually agreed on a number of goals it

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:16.820
actually agreed on a number of goals it
 

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.800
actually agreed on a number of goals it
agreed specifically on targets for

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:19.810
agreed specifically on targets for
 

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:22.050
agreed specifically on targets for
reducing child mortality

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:22.060
reducing child mortality
 

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.570
reducing child mortality
maternal mortality it's already agreed

00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:24.580
maternal mortality it's already agreed
 

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.390
maternal mortality it's already agreed
to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions in

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400
to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions in
 

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.610
to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions in
something called the UN framework

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:29.620
something called the UN framework
 

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.370
something called the UN framework
convention on climate change it's agreed

00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:32.380
convention on climate change it's agreed
 

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.430
convention on climate change it's agreed
to slow the loss of biodiversity and

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440
to slow the loss of biodiversity and
 

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:36.900
to slow the loss of biodiversity and
something called the convention on

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:36.910
something called the convention on
 

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:40.290
something called the convention on
biological diversity and so on my view

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:40.300
biological diversity and so on my view
 

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.870
biological diversity and so on my view
is that the right starting point for

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880
is that the right starting point for
 

00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.540
is that the right starting point for
this diverse world is to take seriously

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:45.550
this diverse world is to take seriously
 

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:49.170
this diverse world is to take seriously
the things we have agreed to as things

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:49.180
the things we have agreed to as things
 

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.180
the things we have agreed to as things
that we've actually agreed to now it's a

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:51.190
that we've actually agreed to now it's a
 

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.820
that we've actually agreed to now it's a
little bit of a bootstrap operation but

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:53.830
little bit of a bootstrap operation but
 

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.940
little bit of a bootstrap operation but
so is law and so is government you have

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:56.950
so is law and so is government you have
 

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:59.670
so is law and so is government you have
to believe that it's important when you

00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680
to believe that it's important when you
 

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.950
to believe that it's important when you
make agreements to actually honor those

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960
make agreements to actually honor those
 

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:04.110
make agreements to actually honor those
agreements and then work towards the

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:04.120
agreements and then work towards the
 

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.470
agreements and then work towards the
goals that you've set and so my way of

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480
goals that you've set and so my way of
 

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.540
goals that you've set and so my way of
thinking is not to look for a global

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:09.550
thinking is not to look for a global
 

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:11.730
thinking is not to look for a global
government or a global political

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:11.740
government or a global political
 

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:14.610
government or a global political
solution alone but rather to keep our

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:14.620
solution alone but rather to keep our
 

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:17.910
solution alone but rather to keep our
focus on shared global commitments that

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920
focus on shared global commitments that
 

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.150
focus on shared global commitments that
are explicitly stated and then we're the

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:21.160
are explicitly stated and then we're the
 

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.640
are explicitly stated and then we're the
private sector the public sector can all

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:23.650
private sector the public sector can all
 

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:28.560
private sector the public sector can all
add their pieces to the solution so when

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:28.570
add their pieces to the solution so when
 

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.000
add their pieces to the solution so when
you ask what's the role of the private

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.010
you ask what's the role of the private
 

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:32.730
you ask what's the role of the private
sector finally if you're thinking about

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:32.740
sector finally if you're thinking about
 

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:36.150
sector finally if you're thinking about
the issue of extreme poverty it may be

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160
the issue of extreme poverty it may be
 

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.380
the issue of extreme poverty it may be
to donate your medicines for deworming

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:40.390
to donate your medicines for deworming
 

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.030
to donate your medicines for deworming
children or to make sure that people

with AIDS have the access to
 

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.590
with AIDS have the access to
antiretroviral medicines when large

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:46.600
antiretroviral medicines when large
 

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.110

companies do that often in partnership

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:49.120
companies do that often in partnership
 

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.910
companies do that often in partnership
with the public sector you can get

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920
with the public sector you can get
 

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.670
with the public sector you can get
remarkable results but without the gold

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680
remarkable results but without the gold
 

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:55.470
remarkable results but without the gold
that we ought to do that and taking

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:55.480
that we ought to do that and taking
 

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.480
that we ought to do that and taking
seriously the goal that we ought to do

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:57.490
seriously the goal that we ought to do
 

00:54:57.490 --> 00:55:00.210
seriously the goal that we ought to do
that we we won't get anywhere no one

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:00.220
that we we won't get anywhere no one

will know how to fit their part into a
 

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.400
will know how to fit their part into a
larger setting so let me put it a

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:05.410

different way we need to make

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:07.210
different way we need to make
 

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.630
different way we need to make
