00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This was a tricky question. It's 15 it turns out.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The path stays the same. I haven't punished left turns enough. Let me just try this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If I were to go forward, forward, forward, left, forward, forward,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we accrue a total cost of 1, 2, 3, 13, 14, 15.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You can arrive at the same 15 by taking the 6 steps it takes to the goal

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and add the extra 9 penalty it takes just for the turn itself,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is 10 minus 1, and you get 15.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let me look at the possible other path, which would take the loop over here

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and avoid the left turn altogether--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The path around this loop over here has a cost of 16, which is more than 15.

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We still prefer the left turn.
