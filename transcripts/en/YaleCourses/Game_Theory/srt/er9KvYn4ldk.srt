1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,270
So we're gonna do a new topic today.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,810
We're going to talk about evolution.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,610
We're going to run the connection
between evolution and game theory.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,460
All right, now that is going
to be a, uh, an extra rank.

5
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:26,680
I already emailed you about this.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,220
There's going to be an extra reading on
this with the people who want it. Uh,

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm gonna,
uh,

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,320
th there's a reading packet that's
available to anybody who wants it.

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,820
I emailed you all the websites where you
can order that weeding packet and find

10
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,280
and figure out where to pick it up.
It's not compulsory,

11
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,530
you don't have to look at that reading
packet. It's just, it might help.

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:49,720
In addition, as with last Wednesday,
since some of the material here is new,

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,590
I have written a handout that goes
with this lecture and that handout will

14
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,380
appear magically this afternoon
on the website. All right,

15
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,560
so you have to do things today are fast.
Don't worry.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,280
There's a handout that goes
with it. All right, so why,

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,700
why look at evolution in
the context of Game Theory?

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,680
There are really two reasons.

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,370
The first reason is
because of the influence

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,700
of game theory on biology.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,360
It turns out that in the last few decades,

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,860
there's been an enormous amount of work,
dom in biology in particular.
