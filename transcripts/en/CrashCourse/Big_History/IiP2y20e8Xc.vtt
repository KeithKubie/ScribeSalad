00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.600
Hi, I’m Emily Graslie and welcome to Crash
Course Big History.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.569
Today we’ll be discussing why the history
of life on Earth is not just a distant curiosity

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.020
for people who happen to be interested in
dinosaurs and trilobites, but one deeply wrapped

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.100
up in what it means to be human and a part
of an ancient and fragile biosphere.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.760
The history of life on Earth is a tale that
spans from three point eight billion years

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.890
ago with the appearance of the first single
cell organisms.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.670
It starts with a very young Earth, charts
the rise of complexity in the biosphere, and

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.400
links our story to the rocks and flames of
the inanimate cosmos.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.850
The evolutionary epic is a story of fascinating
beasts and dramatic changes.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.899
It is pieced together, similar to human history,
by the hunt for evidence in order to construct

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.359
a timeline of events.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.859
Much like historians, it is the job of palaeontologists
to interpret that evidence.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:46.030
And a lot of that timeline remains a mystery.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.860
Presently, we’re at a stage comparable to
early Renaissance scholars rediscovering the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.589
history of the Roman Empire from long lost
documents, except we are using fossils and

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.999
evolutionary biology to explore the depths
of an obscure past.

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:04.750
(1) Humans have only been around for two hundred
fifty thousand years, or 0.00006 percent of

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.810
the evolutionary epic.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.439
(2) What’s more, we are descended from ancestral
species that lived millions and millions of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.340
years ago, right back to the origin of life,
and their story is our story.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.170
And it’s one that can teach us a lot about
our lives today and the many pitfalls and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:28.799
perils of our future.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.030
Since the Cambrian explosion of multi-cellular
species five hundred forty-one million years

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.689
ago, there have been 5 major mass extinctions:
The First - the Ordovician extinction four

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.090
hundred and fifty-five million years ago was
caused by a rapid freezing period, followed

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.510
in quick succession by a warming period killing
off many inhabitants of the Earth that could

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.749
not adapt fast enough.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.560
Then the Devonian extinction three hundred
and seventy five million years ago was caused

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.840
either by an asteroid impact, nutrient pollution
from evolving plants, a decrease in carbon

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.950
dioxide due to plant dominance, volcanic activity,
or all of the above.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.759
The Permian extinction two hundred and fifty-two
million years ago may have been caused by

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.500
an asteroid impact, a natural increase in
carbon dioxide, or the prevailing theory:

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.170
super-volcanoes blocking out sunlight.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.830
The Permian is called the “Great Dying”
because it was the worst extinction of species

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.270
in the past 541 million years.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.710
The Triassic extinction 201 million years
ago was also likely due to volcanic super-eruptions

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.950
or an asteroid impact.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.420
And the Cretaceous extinction 65 million years
ago, which wiped out most dinosaurs and led

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.770
the way for an explosion of mammals, was caused
by an asteroid.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.770
We are now in the middle of the Sixth Mass
Extinction.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.230
It is a disaster caused by us.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.600
Out of all the mass extinctions that have
happened since the Cambrian explosion, the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.830
Sixth Mass Extinction is the first that has
been caused by a single species- and it’s

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.830
our fault.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.010
But it’s not because we are evil, or diabolically
powerful.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.310
But because we share the lessons of each generation
to future generations in exquisite detail.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.280
And those lessons stack up and we get better
and better at exploiting our ecosystems.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.010
This sixth extinction event isn’t a recent
thing either.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.560
Humans started the uptick in extinctions almost
immediately.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.340
When we immigrated out of Africa 64,000 years
ago, away from the African megafauna that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.340
had evolved alongside us, we began an evolutionary
slaughter of non-African species that wiped

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.910
out the majority of megafauna on every continent
we visited.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.590
Easy pickings for human hunters fell before
us in Europe, Asia, North America, and especially

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.720
Australia.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.820
Everything from woolly mammoths in Eurasia
to giant kangaroos in Australia seem to have

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.490
gone extinct shortly after humans arrived
there.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.870
This was not out of any malice or extraordinary
strength, but because our skills were highly

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.240
adaptive, and we were talented at getting
what we needed to survive.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.780
We can hardly blame our ancestors for not
worrying about biodiversity or doing studies

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.490
of animal populations 60,000 years ago.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.710
When talking about the Sixth Mass Extinction,
you’re going to hear a lot about how this

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.000
is the first one caused by a single species.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.970
And by contrast with the Ordovician, Devonian,
Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous -- that’s

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.970
more or less correct.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.880
But there is another extinction event that
we don’t talk about enough.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.760
Allow me to take you back in time before the
Cambrian explosion, well before multi-cellular

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.430
species ever existed, about three billion
years ago.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.130
Single cell organisms were the only life on
Earth, dwelling in the oceans and evolving

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.380
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.760
Very slowly, over millions upon millions of
years, bacteria rose nearer to the ocean surface.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.140
They evolved to convert sunlight, water, and
carbon dioxide into energy.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.680
It was photosynthesis.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.750
And the waste product of this process was
highly reactive oxygen.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.430
Over the next billion years, photosynthesizing
bacteria slowly increased the level of oxygen

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.970
in the atmosphere.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.640
Not all single-celled life was capable of
withstanding the harmful effects of oxygen,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.910
and many different species, all potential
ancestors for more complex life, died off

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.910
in droves.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.060
While a mass extinction of bacteria may not
appear as dramatic as an asteroid wiping out

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.570
dinosaurs, it is significant because these
highly successful genera squeezed out many

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.600
other species by simply being well-equipped
to extract energy and resources from the environment.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.560
Humans, through the use of our collective
learning, are very similar.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.350
We are so adept at getting what we need out
of the environment, that we are leaving very

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.820
little room for other species.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.220
At the core of this is scarcity, and the limited
amount of energy in the Universe upon which

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.310
all complexity depends.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.870
Very often the success of one species must
come at the expense of another.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.070
However, that is not all there is to the equation,
since there are also many interdependencies

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.320
in an ecosystem that can easily be upset.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.040
For instance, those photosynthesizing bacteria
in the oceans are still there capturing carbon

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.410
dioxide and releasing oxygen.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.900
And if human-induced acidification of the
oceans were to kill off much of this bacteria,

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.450
carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would
rise even faster than they are now, frustrating

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.560
our attempts at combatting climate change.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.540
That is why the prospect of a Sixth Mass Extinction
is so scary.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.380
While extinctions happen all the time and
are an essential part of evolution, if certain

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.500
species are removed from an ecosystem, the
entire house of cards can come crashing down,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.580
threatening even humans.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.670
While The Great Oxygenation took hundreds
of millions of years of slow gradual change,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.450
human-led extinctions are happening in a much
smaller fraction of time, about 250,000 years.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.880
That might seem like a long time, but the
rate seems to be accelerating with each rise

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.060
of human complexity.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.590
As devastating as human foraging was to many
megafaunal species, once humans created agriculture,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.110
we started changing entire ecosystems to suit
our needs.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.950
Human population numbers and density began
to rise dramatically, meaning more resources

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.950
were consumed.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.431
Forests were cut down to make way for crops
and pasture.

00:06:20.431 --> 00:06:23.760
Predators that were a threat to humans and
livestock were hunted down.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.220
And over-hunting and over-fishing by our exploding
populations became a growing concern.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.360
But if we can assign a date to when these
extinctions became a mass extinction, the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.800
year 1500 is a pretty good candidate.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.620
Around this time, the age of Western explorations
had begun.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.010
Humans travelled the world, started colonising
new areas and building farms, and began hunting

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.450
new species to extinction with improving technology.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.740
We introduced new invasive species and diseases
that destabilised entire ecosystems.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.230
We started a global homogenisation of flora
and fauna, introducing our domesticates and

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.699
off-shoots like rats and rabbits into environments
where they still compete with native species

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:00.550
that had evolved there for millions of years.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.460
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.980
After the next rise of complexity, industrialisation,
things skyrocketed even further.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.290
Human populations have continued to climb
from just shy of a billion people around the

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:18.190
year 1800 to 7 billion today, and with projections
that the human population will reach 9.5-10

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:19.310
billion by 2050.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.410
With increased populations and increased industrialisation,
the drop of biodiversity continues.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:30.410
Since 1500, we are aware of somewhere between
330 and 620 major vertebrate species that

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.410
have gone extinct.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.410
But that number may be as high as a thousand,
and the majority of that happened in the past

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.410
century.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.410
And it isn’t just extinctions that are worrying.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.030
Since 1960, the wild vertebrate population
that still exists has been cut in half.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.810
With fewer numbers comes a greater risk of
extinction in the near future, as genetic

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.230
diversity decreases and populations weaken.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.949
Today, we use about 40% of the total land
area of the world for human purposes, and

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.330
only 15% of that land is preserved for environmental
protection.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.970
The remaining 45% is still eligible for further
human development.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.449
This is not enough to protect many threatened
species.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.460
Habitat loss is the primary problem for 85%
of the species considered endangered today.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.460
(1) The oceans aren’t faring any better:
unsustainable and unregulated fishing and

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:12.570
pollution kills off animals like sharks, tuna,
whales, sea turtles, and thousands upon thousands

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.810
of species that are dependent on coral reefs.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.260
(2) This doesn’t even count the vast expanses
of unexplored oceans, and the untold number

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.020
of yet undescribed species that may be affected.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.510
If this trend continues perhaps 75% of all
multi-cellular species could go extinct,

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:32.050
and in a thousand years, the majority of life
on Earth will be our domestic animals: dogs,

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.930
cats, cows, sheep, crops, and animals that
adapt to the environments we’ve created.

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.959
Soon, raccoons may rule the earth!

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:40.050
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:44.579
The biosphere is a complex tangle, and it’s
true our global history is full of extinctions

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:46.490
- and, in fact, is driven by them.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.899
It might seem we ought to just preserve the
ones we need for our own survival, and forget

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:51.910
the rest.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:56.070
But if one species which seems to have no
direct importance to us were allowed to go

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.040
extinct, it could potentially set off a domino
effect that brings down an entire ecosystem.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.529
Once ecosystems start collapsing, a ballooning
human population of billions and billions

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:09.279
of people might suffer more than just a little
inconvenience.

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.709
Our human population, especially the poorest
of us, would experience some real threats

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:16.339
to our food supplies, health, and our own
livelihoods.

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:20.149
It’s not quite so easy to recover from our
mistakes, either.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:24.559
After a major extinction event, it usually
takes the biosphere about ten to fifty million

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.399
years to fully recover.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:30.199
Damage could be done within a few centuries
that would take millions of years to undo.

00:09:30.199 --> 00:09:34.839
As you might expect, one thing that makes
the Sixth Mass Extinction even worse is carbon

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:39.360
emissions, which has a planetary boundary
of 350 parts per million before it starts

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.600
causing permanent problems.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.870
It’s a boundary we have already crossed.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.230
Today we are hovering around 400 parts per
million.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.079
The average global surface temperature will
increase, affecting every ecosystem on the

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:53.959
planet, but with continued emissions, the
question is how high will it get?

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:58.680
The best case scenario, or our goal at any
rate, is 2 degrees this century.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.759
Even that slight increase in so short a time
could lead to the extinction of an estimated

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.769
33% of all species.

00:10:04.769 --> 00:10:09.110
It will result in increased water shortages,
recurrent dust bowls like the ones seen in

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:14.980
North America in the 1930s, an uptick in climate
refugees particularly from the Pacific, and

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.040
sky-rocketing food prices that will afflict
the world’s poor while their populations

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.319
continue expanding.

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:24.319
If the average global temperature gets any
higher, the effects are even worse.

00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:28.910
At four degrees, which less optimistic forecasts
think we’ll reach by the end of the century,

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.129
it may become impossible to grow crops in
some regions of the world, and freshwater

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:35.959
will become critically scarce for billions
of people.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:40.769
Bubbles of carbon and methane currently trapped
in frozen soil, like in Siberia and on the

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:45.529
ocean floor, could escape from the thawing
ground and start a runaway greenhouse effect

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.050
that even our cutting back on emissions could
not stop.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.050
At six degrees hotter, in the long run we
may be looking at an extinction of Cretaceous

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.470
or even Permian proportions.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:55.629
Another “Great Dying”.

00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:57.089
Does history repeat itself?

00:10:57.089 --> 00:11:01.770
With humanity, history is certainly not repeating
itself given our uniqueness, but the outcome

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.050
of our activities might be the same as the
Permian Extinction.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.480
A similar disaster today could not only stall
the rise of complexity, but destroy all the

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.029
complexity humans have created in the past
250,000 years, or worse, silence the rise

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:17.079
of complexity on Earth forever.

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:20.879
Looking at the entire evolutionary epic, it
is just as well to think about what our legacy

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:21.879
will be.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:25.480
I would hate to be classed by our struggling
descendants and our geological record to be

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.639
on par with an asteroid, a super-volcanic
eruption, or even photosynthesizing bacteria-

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:34.720
and that’s because we have something that
asteroids, volcanoes, and bacteria do not.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.009
We have the ability to reflect and change
our behaviour.

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:42.949
And if we fail and cause just as much disaster
as those apocalyptic scenarios, our failure

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:47.740
is doubled because, at the end of the day,
for one brief and shining moment, we had the

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.270
power to stop it.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:12:13.660
See you next time.
