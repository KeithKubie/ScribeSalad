00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; Sean: Just to remind people here who, perhaps,
haven't seen our earler videos with you, Brian. 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.550
So, you worked at Bell Labs and at AT&amp;T.
I mean you did research there. You

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.139
were looking to the future! How right were you?
How wong were you? Can you tell us?
&gt;&gt; BWK:Yeah, so I was

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.630
at AT&amp;T.  I went there for a couple of
summers, starting in the in the late

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.349
1960s and I stayed there, essentially
full-time, until 2000. I was in Bell Labs.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
So at the time AT&amp;T was a very big
company. It was well over a million

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.070
people. It was the biggest company in the
country and it provided communication

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.890
services - telephone - for essentially all
of the United States. And Bell Labs was

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
the research arm of that. So that's
the part that in theory is looking at the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.340
future, trying to improve the services
that they have and build the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.780
technology, in all kinds of ways, that
will make it easy for -- or make it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
possible to improve -- telecommunications
services. And so AT&amp;T did things like

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.739
the transistor and the laser and
miscellaneous other things that were

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.579
useful. And also a lot of computing-related 
things as they gradually

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.890
realized that computers were here to
stay. And that a lot of mechanical things

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.070
like relays, and so on, could be replaced
by electronic devices and then

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.880
controlled by programs, running on
general-purpose computers. In some sense

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
the Golden Age for me was probably the
1970s. I had just gotten out of School

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.670
and with the early days of computing
there were a lot of really interesting

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.710
work going on and that was when UNIX was
developed, in the  early 1970s, and the C

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.640
programming language and a variety of
other things. And it's also when I played

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.210
with programming languages as well. So
that was definitely a good time. Sort of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.350
behind your question, I think, is: "Well,
how good were you at seeing the future?"

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
And the answer is: "Pretty awful!".  I think
most people are pretty awful at seeing

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.560
the future and I'm quite - I could hardly
deny it so I'm perfectly willing to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.020
admit it - I don't think we had and I
wouldn't say all my colleagues and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.540
friends at Bell Labs. had much of a clue of
how the world would change. We I guess

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.190
knew about Moore's Law. Moore's Law, I
think came from I think he published

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.020
that paper in 1965 based on a fairly
a short period of data, like maybe five

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.070
years. And I don't think - certainly not I -
but I don't think many people realized

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.810
the implications of an exponential rise
in capability at a fixed price, if

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.590
applied for 40 or 50 years. I don't think we
realized any of that 
&gt;&gt; Sean: So, nobody believed it?

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.330
Nobody took it that seriously for this
period of time?
&gt;&gt; BWK: I don't know whether I would

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.150
say: "Nobody believed it", but I don't think
people realize the implications.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.350
Certainly I did not realize the
implications and we were, I think, often

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.080
surprised when we discovered that
something we had done had actually been

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.850
noticed in the outside world. I remember
at one point Dennis Ritchie saying to me

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.110
something like: "We have arrived!",  because
he had found in the New York Times, which

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.440
was still running classified ads for
programmers, they'd wanted a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.110
programmer who knew UNIX. And this was, I
would guess, in maybe late 70s or

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.870
something like that. And this was us [saying]:
"Boy, what we've done has actually had some

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.680
influence in the outside world", in a way
that was completely unpredictable.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.580
&gt;&gt; Sean:  So is there anything you can think
of that you think should have made it but didn't?

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.980
I'm kind of putting you on the spot here!
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yeah! that's definitely on the spot.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.050
It's hard to say. One gets the feeling
that a lot of things that were obvious

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.040
to us have been kind of lost in going
forward. One [is] UNIX, the operating system;

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.120
C the programming language. Many of the
tools. Those all had a flavor of

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.070
minimality, of being small and compact
and good for their particular purpose,.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.110
and not with too many bells and whistles
and very carefully written, and so on. And

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.970
as Moore's Law came along and we got
more and more processing power and more

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.970
and more memory capacity people sort of
forgot the merits of simplicity, perhaps.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.610
And so things became rather more baroque
or rococo or - pick your architectural

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.630
period - and I think that that is in some
ways to everyone's detriment that

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.430
systems are very complicated. The other
thing is that at one point there was

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.730
really only one - let's call it UNIX -
system and so things were fairly

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.470
compatible. And another
thing that I think we've lost is

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.450
compatibility -  that it's harder to get
things to work together perhaps than it

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.240
was. But in some ways perhaps that's
necessary. You think the big change in a

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.930
lot of things has been the rise of
networking: the idea that computers are

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.669
not self-contained things any more but,
rather, they are devices that talk to

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.240
other devices using a variety of
networking technology - Internet itself.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.220
And of course increasingly phones. The
phone system. And in fact there's no real

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.340
difference between the phone system and
the Internet in some sense, it's kind of

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.050
an accidental separation that will
disappear over time. And as different

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.190
things talk to each other what
happens there gets more and more

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.970
complicated. There are more ways that things
can break. You need standards but the

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.060
standards aren't necessarily there. And so,
yeah, I think that's the place where we

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.860
need the most improvement in some sense.
It's ways to make things work better

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.419
together and make them simpler and I
guess those are related. 
&gt;&gt; Sean: I think there's

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.440
a kind of irony, as well, that
you've got this massive phone company

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.640
effectively pushing forward on computer
technology, and now the many computer

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.750
people use is  the phone in their pocket! 
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yes, right, I think that's again something

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.430
that people didn't predict. There's a
famous story that a consulting company

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:47.200
in the United States, McKinsey, did a
study for AT&amp;T and told AT&amp;T that there

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.240
was basically no market for cell phones;
that people didn't want portable phones.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.130
And this I think is a triumph of how
consultancy can go wrong and yet not

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.289
suffer for it. in any sense. But AT&amp;T
didn't back that stuff as well - a lot of

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.350
the early work on mobile telephony was
done at AT&amp;T.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.780
Absolutely. They figured out this the
notion of cells and how you would pass

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.440
conversations from one cell to another
something that's completely invisible to

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.169
people today but all of that was in fact
invented originally at AT&amp;T. And then of

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.900
course evolved tremendously by other
people over the years. And again cell

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.950
phones today profit from Moore's law.
That you've got incredible power in a

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.279
very, very compact device, would not have
been possible

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:40.009
thirty years earlier.
&gt;&gt; Sean: And the last thing they're used for 
     is phone calls
&gt;&gt; BWK: It's hard to say.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.789
You're hinting that people don't use
their phones to talk and I think that's

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.929
true. As far as I can tell
students that I deal with in the United

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:52.309
States use their phones primarily for
texting each other and perhaps for

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:56.589
checking their Facebook pages - or
whatever the modern equivalent is.

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:01.699
And this is so foreign to me that I don't
actually know how to use a phone in many

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.809
ways. I had an extended discussion with
Dave [Brailsford], earlier this morning, about how you

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:10.369
deal with with phone numbers and whether
you need a 44 and not a zero or is it ... ?

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:15.079
Hopeless! And that was the reason I had trouble

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:22.959
communicating with him this morning. So
culture shock in some sort of way.
