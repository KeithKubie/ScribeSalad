00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.490
In October 2018, the Pacific Ocean brewed
one of most intense hurricanes ever recorded,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.320
AND it hit one of the most remote places in
the world.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.980
With so much force, it eliminated an entire
island overnight.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.849
But this isn't the first time an island has
vanished.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.510
It's part of a trend, so what's behind it?

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.320
The island we’re talking about is East Island,
located about 890 km northwest of Honolulu,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
Hawaii.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.970
It may not seem like much - only 11-acres,
but it’s part of one of the world’s largest

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.849
protected marine areas.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.270
The region was home to diversity rarely found
anywhere else on earth.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.280
It was a nesting ground for over 95% of the
Hawaiian endangered green sea turtle population

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.200
and about 200 critically endangered Monk seals
visit the area each year.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
Or used to?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.899
And considering there’s only 1,400 of these
monk seals left in the state, it’s a big

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:50.899
deal.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.660
East island is now a mere 46 meter patch of
sand and scientists estimate about 95% of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.769
the islet is underwater.

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.850
Scientists don’t know if this critical habitat
will bounce back anytime soon, and are very

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.250
concerned, since islands just don’t disappear
overnight, right?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.600
It takes years and years of erosion.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.790
But islands are disappearing faster and it’s
becoming more common.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.860
Scientists have observed entire islands swallowed
whole from sea level rise in a matter of a

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.299
few short years.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.600
From 2007 to 2014 alone, 6 low-lying islands
in Micronesia vanished without a trace.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.530
Those were uninhabited, but as recently as
2017, people of the Carteret Islands of Papua

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.680
New Guinea are leaving their island homes
for higher ground.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.840
As they avoid the rising sea levels, they
also face dying trees, scarcity of food, and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840
freshwater.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.700
They aren't the only ones either.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.110
The Maldives, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Republic
of Kiribati, and Torres Strait Islands are

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.860
all being affected by rising sea Island nations
across the globe are facing these same obstacles

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.020
because they’re the most vulnerable to the
results of climate change

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.799
But wait, East Island didn't disappear from
sea level rise, that was the fault of Hurricane

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:02.799
Walaka.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.701
Well there’s a connection, because sea level
rise can actually make the consequences of

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:11.720
hurricanes worse.Higher sea levels means stronger
storm surges, which create higher floods of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.050
water that move further inland.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.082
Like the one that hit East Island that came
from Hurricane Wakala.

00:02:14.082 --> 00:02:19.020
Hurricane Walaka was actually one of two major
tropical storms in the pacific; one on each

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.600
side of the ocean that reached Category 5
at the same time meaning they were forming

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.100
over 250 kilometer per hour winds.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.130
Not only is this intense, but it’s highly
unusual behavior.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.960
On top of that, Hurricane Walaka was much
further north than most hurricanes travel.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.840
Scientists speculate that’s because the
Pacific’s waters are warming.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.850
See, typically hurricanes are near the equator
because that’s where warmer waters are.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.900
Tropical storms form when warm air rises from
warm water, causing low air pressure underneath

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900
it.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
Nearby, higher pressure air will then push
into the low air pressure, and that new air

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.320
becomes warm and rises up.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.160
Nearby air will then come in and take the
warm air’s place as it rises.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.020
In the upper atmosphere the warm air cools
down and creates clouds.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.110
This becomes a swirling system of hot and
cold air being fed by the ocean’s heat and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.620
water evaporation.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.000
In theory more energy is released into the
storm when there is a larger temperature between

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.700
the warm water and upper atmosphere.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.370
Although climate scientists debate and can’t
directly link storms to climate change, they

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.790
all agree that warm waters also cause stronger
storms.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.580
And let’s face it, the pacific ocean is
getting mighty toasty.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.720
It turns out that 2017 was a record-breaking
year for ocean waters.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.870
But hurricanes are not just getting severe
in some far off distance place in the Pacific,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.770
we can see the intensity from the Atlantic
as well.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.750
The recent North Carolina hurricane dropped
over 75 cm of water on parts of North Carolina

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.540
and many areas were flooded and blocked off.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.090
As for East Island, we’ll see how it fairs.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.040
NOAA will monitor the islands progress to
see how the animals respond to their habitat

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.250
loss, and what they find will help them manage
the species.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.980
Some monk seals can already be seen lifting
themselves up on the small patch left behind.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.620
So yes, sea levels are rising, hurricanes
are getting worse, and they’re wiping places

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.690
off the map.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.370
While we can’t witness what’s going on
beyond our backyards..it’s all happening

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.370
right now, even if we can’t see it.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.380
Islands may be disappearing, but you know
what won’t vanish?

It’s a doozy.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.090
Also the strongest hurricane ever recorded
in history was Hurricane Patricia back in

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.660
2015 which reached up to 346 kilometer per
hour winds.
