00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
Alright, so this video may not be appropriate for kids, and it is

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
uh.. It's disturbing, on several different levels.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.050
Especially if you're a man... So you know on

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.070
Smarter Every Day I try to keep everything very intelligent and respectful, but this

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.100
video is crazy. Like, you need to think about whether or not you want to watch this.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.120
Because now that I know this happens, I have nightmares.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.150
And they're not good.. [laugh] They're not good nightmares ok?

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.170
So you just think about whether or not you want to know this information. Do you want to know it?

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.210
OK... Introduction.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.710
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.240
- Talk to me. Give an introduction right now.
(Destin) Hey it's me Destin welcome to Smarter Every Day. I'm in the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.980
Amazon rainforest. [little girl squeal]
- [laughter] [clapping] Yes!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.330
- Speaking of the penis tree, what this guy does

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.360
he uh.. yeah. It's the.. pretty much the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.390
third most venemous spider in the world.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.430
Phoneutria fera

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.430
 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.450
I'm gonna stay this far away.
- They're really agressive.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.470
Should we see how aggressive they are?
- Alright, most likely it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.490
gonna hop down, but let's see if we can get him to rear up.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.510
- Oh.. Oh no he's like..
(Destin) Holy cow, he's fast.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.530
- Who's gonna put it on their face then?
- Nooo.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.570
- You go ahead.
- Yeah.
- Will also cause a condition called a priapism in males.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.570
(Destin) Priapism. Oh yeah, ice water enema to fix that? Yep.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.620
OK this spider is called the Brazillian Wandering Spider, and if you heard what Phil said, he said

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.640
it causes this condition in males. I assume that means not in females.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.650
And there's only a couple of things I can think of that can happen to a male but not to a female.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.700
Anyway, we'll come back to that.
- If you look underneath that front leg,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.730
you see how it's got banding? Black, white and black.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.800
Can you see that from this angle? See that?
- Yes.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.830
- So, when it gets really mad it flips those up in the air and then you can see that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.880
black white black white. That's kind of a warning signal.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.920
(Destin) It's called a wandering spider?
- Yeah.
- Because he doesn't make webs?

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.960
- Correct
(Destin) Alright, well I'm done with the third most venemous spider

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.980
in the world.
- Is she done with you?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.020
- That's the question.
(Destin) OK you're on a jungle walk, an entomologist tells you that this spider

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
can affect the penis. Obviously the first thing you do is you get the books out, find out

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.110
priapism is a medical emergency involving the penis,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.160
which is terrifying. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna go to this hospital, we're gonna

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.180
go find a urologist. We're gonna ask him what are the causes of priapism, and number two

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.220
and more importantly, what are the fixes for priapism. So we're gonna go in here,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.240
I know it's funny, hahaha, Destin's talking about a penis, but think about it. If you're a male

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.260
or you know a male, you need to know this information. So, if I have to

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.280
take the hit, I'll do it. I'll try not to blush, but if he's a urologist chances are he's either really

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.310
funny or really boring, so.. I don't know. Let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.340
Missed the door. Dr Sergey Ananyev? Am I saying that right?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.420
- That's right.
- And you are a uh.. let me get this.. urologist?

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.440
Which is a...
- Glorified pecker checker. [laugh]

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.480
- Excellent, OK so show me what we're doing here. What is going on

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.540
with the erection?
- Well, erection is a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.560
by-product of both nerves and blood vessels working

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.600
together once a man gets excited. Our penises consist of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.620
two chambers that have one way valves. Those two chambers are called

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.640
cavernosal bodies, and they communicate to each other.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.670
- They communicate with each other like hydraulically?
- As in, yeah sideways yeah like

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.700
fenestrations.
- Is it priapism or preeapism?
- It's priapism,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.740
and priapism by definition is a prolonged erection

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
that is unwanted, that usually lasts four hours or longer.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.770
- OK so what does that have to do with a spider in the rainforest?

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.800
That's why I'm hear talking to you.
- The spider in the rainforest, once it gets hold

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.840
of you, is able to stimulate and effect

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.860
a certain pathway which on the molecular level effects

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.910
nitric oxide. You'll have this nitric oxide release, which is a molecule.
- Right.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.940
- That would in turn stimulate another molecule, that will then

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.990
relax the muscles inside the penis.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.010
- So the nitric oxide is what activates whatever this is..

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.020
- It's a step in the ladder, yeah. To eventually relax the muscle

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.070
of the penis to allow the blood flow in.
- OK so it's a valve.

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.090
- Uh, well yeah nitric oxide is just the molecule that helps open the door for

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.150
a valve but yeah. What you'll actually do is you have.. they're in a way

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.180
one way valves where the blood flow goes in once a man is excited

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.240
for whatever reason.
- Yeah?
- Whether a partner or a spider. [laugh]

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.340
- OK.
- Once the blood flow goes in the one way valves will close and the blood can't come out.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.370
- You just made me think about something really strange. So, I'm an engineer

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.400
and when I was at school we had to do this equation in something called

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.430
differential equations. And it was inflow and outflow.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.440
And so the rate of inflow vs the rate of outflow determined the internal

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.470
fluid inside.. so there is a differential equation, you can express it

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.480
like mathematically to determine the rate

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.500
of which that will do what it does. OK there's math

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.520
on the screen, I'm starting to get a little bit more comfortable now. So, the design of the penis is pretty interesting.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.550
It's like two balloons that are stacked side by side and you have an input and an output into the system.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.600
If you throttle these flow rates you can generate this expanding control

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.610
volume and that's the erection. Now Dr Ananyev will install these prosthetic devices

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.620
into men who suffer from ED. It happens to men of all ages by the way.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.650
So he decided to demonstrate how this biomechanical system works in the body by just

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.700
showing us one of these devices. So this prosthesis that you.. This is what you do right?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.750
You insert these into the human body right?
- It's one of the many things we do.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.780
- These are the caverns right?
- These are the two cavernosal bodies. When one

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.800
gets excited, there's an increase in blood flow to both of those bodies.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.840
And I will demonstrate it by the virtue of this mechanical pump.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.850
- So you've got a hydraulic pump and you're squeezing it.
- That's right.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.880
- So you're pumping that there, and that's taking fluid from

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.890
there..
- From the reservoir, which would be your blood stream.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.900
To the end organ, which would be the two cavernosal bodies in the penis.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.930
- OK, so that's how..
- And then a one way valve that keeps the

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.980
blood from outflowing.
- Gotcha. So once that

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.020
happens, then.. you know..

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.070
sexual activity happens and then..
- You feeling a little uncomfortable Destin?
- [laugh] I am a little uncomfortable.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.080
You actually deal with uncomfortable situations all day long every day, don't you.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.120
- That's my defense mechanism yeah.
- That's fantastic. So the outflow, is this?..

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.150
You have it in the same valve here, so how does it happen in the human body?
- In the human body

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.180
when a man reaches a climax, certain chemicals

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.220
are released that are allowing those valves to open.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.250
In the case of priapism what'll happen Destin is that you will have an increased

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.290
blood flow, but instead of climaxing

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.330
and allowing those one way valves to open and allow the blood flow

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.350
back out, the blood stays in for a prolonged amount of

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.390
time as I mentioned about four hours or longer. And when that happens the blood inside

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.430
these cavernosal bodies becomes what we call ischemic, which means deprived

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.440
of oxygen, and as it becomes deprived of oxygen and clots it

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.470
becomes very thick. That in turn makes the problem worse because

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.520
it's a lot harder for now the thick blood to get out even if the valves were working.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.530
- So what do you do?
- There are a couple of ways to

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.560
fix the problem.
- Yeah?
- You would start off by trying to take a cold shower.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.620
I'll see if I can get some more tape for Mr Skeleton

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.650
- Does it cause permanent damage? Like people can..
- If you do not reverse it

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.650
within about four hours it can usually lead to

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.680
irreversible scarring and permanent loss of erection.
- Can you die?

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.710
- Usually.. I have not in my limited experience seen

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.720
anybody die of priapism but you can definitely suffer. So if the cold shower

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.740
and then the medications do not work, the next step of the process is to actually

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.790
drain the engorged blood

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.850
inside the penis, with a needle.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.870
- With a needle?
- That's right.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.910
- So.. You showed me the two caverns, there's a cavern on each side, so you have to

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.950
drain them independently?
- No you do not. Those caverns communicate, so..

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.960
- They have a..
- There is one good thing about this. Yeah usually you'll be able to

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.020
drain it from one side while the other

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.050
side spontaneously...
- Deflates? Is that the term?
- Yep.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:40.090
That would be the term.
- How big is that needle?

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.120
- It's big enough to hurt. A lot of times you would talk to the patient about numbing

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.150
of the area, but by that time you have to stick them twice, and they're fairly uncomfortable

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.200
so what you end up having to do is go at approximately mid shaft

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.240
and stick the needle all the way inside their cavernosal

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.260
body, and then drain what would have the consistency

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.330
of tomato paste by that time.
- Really?
- Or grape jelly.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.360
- Does.. Oh my goodness.
- You would have to do this multiple times.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.390
A lot of times if the blood is really clotted you will end up having to actually

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.410
remove the clot and then inject sterile salt water in there and then irrigate

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.460
it back out. Once you irrigate it out, it can come back within

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.500
5-10 minutes, and you would actually repeat the process, and for the poor

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.520
folks in who the condition keeps returning you have to go to more drastic measures.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.560
- [nervously] Like?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.570
- Like going up in size, and instead of a needle, using a scalpel. Most of the time

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.590
they would require sedation or sometimes a trip to the emergency room. What you would actually have

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.610
to drive the scalpel through the head of the penis..
- Are you serious?
- And ream it

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.630
90 degrees.
- Are.. are you being serious right now?
- Yeah unfortunately

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.660
- Really?
- Mm hmm.
- And so then that fluid would come out

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.680
that open.. [Heavy breath intake]
- It would actually create what we call a shunt

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.680
by virtue of a big size. That shunt will

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.710
allow the blood..
- I'm having trouble breathing right now. [laugh] This is bad!
- Yeah

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.720
- So, at that point how do you..
- That's why I hate spiders.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.760
- [laugh] Good gracious! Oh man! There's really nothing more

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.780
to say is there?
- No.
- So actually in the head?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.810
- That's right.
- Or is it called the glans? It's called the glans right?
- Yes that's the proper name, glans penis.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:24.840
- Glans? So.. Does it.. Obviously there's damage, there's

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.870
permanent damage because of that. There can, but there's definitely gonna be permanent damage without it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.900
- Last thing, how often do you see this problem? Obviously not from spider bites but..
- Well it depends

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.940
on the community in which you are in, but we'll probably see it two or three times a year.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.980
- So it's pretty rare.
- It's fairly rare and you would usually be able to

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
identify one by the risk factors whether it's a

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.040
predisposing disease like a sickle cell or overdose in medications

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.070
that help you get to a happy place to begin with.
- Oh I see. Well thank you very much for your time,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.110
I appreciate it. Yep. Take it easy. OK in summary I hope you don't feel

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.150
like I was being rude or crude or disrespectful at any point in this. This is a serious issue

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.200
and I hope I got the information into your brain in a pretty interesting and fun way. Speaking

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.260
of serious I'm still not working on Fridays for pay, I'm furloughed.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.310
So that's a pretty big deal as a dad. So I'm more than happy to tell you about my sponsor.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.340
Audible.com/smarter. Audible.com they have audio

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.370
books and you can go to audible.com/smarter and get a free one. They want me to tell

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.410
you about a book you can listen to that has something to do with the video, but I don't think we want to hear the

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.440
word erection one more time if we can avoid it. So, I'm gonna do you one better. Love.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.450
There's a book by C.S.Lewis and actually read by C.S.Lewis on audible called

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.500
The Four Loves. There's one word in english, love. In Greek there's four.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.540
There's eros, there's agape, filia and storge. Eros

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.560
is erotic love, think about the video, but these other three are very interesting. Particularly

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.580
storge, I didn't know about it. So once I understood the four loves my interaction with

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.620
people in my life changed. It was very interesting and I think it's good for you to at least explore that.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.640
Anyway, audible.com/smarter you get a free audio book.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.690
You're smart. You know what's up here. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:05.730
Have a good one. OK so how long does it take.. I mean how long will this last?

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.750
Several years in a man?
- That depends on the wear and tear.
- [snort]

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.800
You're awful.
- That's not a joke.
- I got it. I can't.. I can't

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.830
do this. [laugh]

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.830
 

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.840
This... is a tree that grows in the rainforest

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.850
And it has odd shaped things on it.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:28.350
 

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.880
The end.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.930
