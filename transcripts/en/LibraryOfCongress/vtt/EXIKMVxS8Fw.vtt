00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.450
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: Good afternoon.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.660
It's wonderful to welcome
this really great gathering

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.640
through our Americas Award, which
we've been giving here since 1992.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.940
So the Hispanic division
and the Center

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.680
for the Book have been
collaborated with the Consortium

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.600
of Latin American Studies

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.240
to give this really
wonderful award for children.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.750
It is my great pleasure
to also announce

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.900
that this begins Hispanic Heritage
month at the Library of Congress.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.380
And the Hispanic Heritage
calendar's outside,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.270
so please pick it up
on your way out.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.000
Because we have many wonderful
events for Hispanic Heritage.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.830
And now it is my pleasure
to introduce Guy Lamolinara

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.510
from the Center for the
Book, who is our cosponsor.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.330
[ Applause ]

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.630
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
Thanks, Georgette,

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.930
and thanks to everybody here.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.800 position:56%
I'm really so pleased to be
representing the Center for the Book

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.930 position:56%
in the Library of Congress, which
is cosponsoring this wonderful event

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.670
with the Library's
Hispanic division.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.730
And we've done that, as
Georgette said, for many years.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.680
For those of you who don't know
about the Center for the Book,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.760
we're a small public-private
partnership organization

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.340
within the Library of
Congress and our mission is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.590
to promote books reading,
libraries and literacy.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.020
And we do it here at the
National Center in Washington,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.550
but we also have 52 affiliated
state centers for the Book.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.650
We have one in DC and we also
have one in the US Virgin Islands.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.020
So if you are interested
in what your local Center

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.500
for the Book is doing, you can just
Google Center for the Book and type

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130
in the name of your state and
you'll see where your Center

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.600
for the Book is and the
programs that they do.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.260
These programs promote your
state's literary heritage,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.790
so they're really great
organizations.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.110
Another thing the Center for the
Book does is we play a major role

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.130
in the National Book Festival.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.800
We oversee the Library of Congress
literacy awards and also the Poetry

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.350
and Literature Center, which is
the home of the US poet laureate.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.060
And I also want to thank
Georgette Dorn and the staff

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.490
of the Hispanic division for
including us in this great event,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.410
as well as the Consortium
of Latin American Studies.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.970
On the half of the Center for the
Book, I congratulate the authors

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.320
and illustrators for their
extraordinary achievements.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.790
And thanks to Denis Woltering who
is the strategic program manager

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.910
of Tulane University Center
for Latin American Studies

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.020
who organized this event.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.510
Please welcome Denis Woltering.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.780
[ Applause ]

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.470
&gt;&gt; Denis Woltering: Thank you,
Guy, and thank you, Georgette

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.460
and the Hispanic Division
and thank you, Catalina,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.600
and everyone that's helped

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.870
to sponsor this program
over the many years.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.410
I'm very excited to be here,
2017 Americas Award Winners.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.140
This year we had over
75 submissions.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.650
And I'm very pleased over
the years, the submissions

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.780
of books titles has grown,
that's a really great thing.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.350
We like to keep seeing
that number grow.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.530 position:56%
The committee this year had a really
wonderful time discussing the books.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.150
It's been really interesting,
really fun being able to connect

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.960
with the committee this year
over Skype calls on three

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920
to four different Sundays
during the springtime.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.160
It takes up a lot of time
but a lot of fun time.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.120
So I'd like to thank the committee
that's here and will be helping

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.970
to present at the program.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.510
And you'll see their names here.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.940
So I'd also like to
explain a little bit.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.750
In your program here, you'll
see we've developed the program

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.520
over the many years.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.910
And it talks a little bit
about class, the Consortium

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.920
of Latin American Studies Programs,
which this program is a product of.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.480
It's one of our proudest -- our
projects that we are most proud of.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.610
It's a project that CLASP has
sponsored since the early '90s.

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.290
And Julie Klein, the founder
of the award, is here.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.740
We're very thankful that she
was able to join us here today.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.640
And the Consortium of Latin
American Studies Program consists

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.580
of over 50 different centers
for Latin American studies

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.990
at different universities
across the country.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.270
We all do different types
of outreach programming,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.810 position:56%
academic programs on Latin
America, the study of Latin America.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.250
And this program has really
been a great way for us to reach

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.100
out into the community
using children's

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.890
and young adult literature.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.690
This program especially would
like to thank the universities

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.930 position:56%
of Florida International University,
Stanford University, Tulane,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.810
the University of Florida,
University of New Mexico,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.650
University of Utah, the University

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.170
of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,
and Vanderbilt.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.560
I'd like to mention that my
colleague Colleen McCoy here

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.960
at Vanderbilt and myself
both coordinate this award.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.250
I know it's a lot of different
people involved in this,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.500
but we're very excited
and we're all very happy

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.560
for this year's award winners.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.970
So I would like to
introduce our chair

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.510 position:56%
of the committee, Ms. Denise Croker.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.430
[ Applause ]

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.540
&gt;&gt; Denise Croker: Thank you, Denis.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.680
I have the privilege of speaking
about the commended titles

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.870
and letting you know how
special and wonderful they are.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.380
This year we have a number of books
that explore the hidden histories

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.330 position:56%
of Latin America and their
influence here in the United States.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.510
Once again, Margarita Engle brings

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.450
to life the little-known
historical events from Cuba

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.180
in her poetic novel, Lion Island,
about Chinese indentured servants

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.490
and others who escape
persecution to find refuge in Cuba

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.560
in the late 19th century.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.830
They become warriors of words,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.750
proving that violence is not
the only way to gain liberty.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.880
The Princess and the
Warrior is another great work

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.770
by previous Americas
Award Winner and author

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.850
and illustrator, Duncan Tonatiuh.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.090
The author draws from vibrant
cultural history and symbolism

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.250
from the Azteca, to retell a
romantic legend of two volcanoes,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.280
evoking storytellers
from times long past.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.290
Lowriders to the Center of the
Earth, written by Kathy Camper

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.830 position:56%
and illustrated by Raul, III,
features Lupe, Elirio, and El Chavo,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.540
who take a rollicking
ride to the underworld

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.890
as they search for their lost cat.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.640
With puns, mariachi lyrics,
and lingo of the lowriders,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.400
this is an unforgettable journey
to the realm of the Aztec past.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.240
Another hidden history
is found in the School

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:01.310 position:56%
That the Aztec Eagles Built, written
by Dorinda Makanaonalani Nicholson.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.370
It's the inspirational World
War II story of Angel Bocanegra,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.910
a dedicated teacher from
Mexico who volunteers

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.860
for the fighting pilots,
the Aztec Eagles.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.480
His promise to return to his
community and build a school are

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.200
as inspirational as
the military missions.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.830
Shame the Stars, by Guadalupe
Garcia McCall is a Romeo

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.980
and Juliet story set against the
backdrop of the border troubles

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.950
of 1915 between native Tejanos
and the white Texas Rangers.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.690
With authentic newspaper
clippings and original poetry,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:45.590
this is another book that shows the
power of speech to right injustice.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.860
Juana and Lucas, written by Juana
Medina, is a more whimsical book.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.630
An illustrated journey through
Bogota, Colombia, through the eyes

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:58.030
of quirky Juana and her
furry amigo, her dog Lucas.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.490
Juana, too, learns
the power of words

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:05.110
and how languages open
doorways to other cultures.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:09.390 position:56%
Another common theme running through
these books is the power of art

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.860
and how it can represent the
history of people, which is found

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.950
in Rainbow Weaver, written
by Linda Elovitz Marshall

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.820
and illustrated by Elisa Chavarri.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.040
With her Mayan weavings that are
made from repurposed plastic bags,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.470
young Ixchel is able to pay for
her own books and her schooling,

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.060
which emphasizes Ixchel's
agency and her ingenuity.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.980
In Radiant Child, author Javaka
Steptoe reveals the biography

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.870
of street artist Jean-Michel
Basquiat,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.630
while showcasing his developing
work from childhood on,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.360
making it accessible to
even the youngest reader.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.850
Margarito's Forest, written
by Andy Carter and illustrated

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.890
by Allison Havens, tells us
the story of Don Margarito

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.430 position:56%
and his lifelong commitment to
plant trees in his native Guatemala.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.350
This trilingual book,
with English, Spanish,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.250 position:56%
and captions in the indigenous local
Mayan language, combines artwork

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.190
of a professional illustrator
and the children

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.960
of Don Margarito's village.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.450
Another thing we see in our
committed titles is the power

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.830
of emotion and standing
up for yourself.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.170
In the Memory of Light,
written by Francisco Stork,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.550
main character Vicki learns to
trust in others, trust in herself,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.670
and stand up for herself to her
family, who seem to only care

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:39.400 position:56%
about career, success, and the
monetary side of the American dream.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.370
Inspired by the author's
own experiences,

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.050
this young adult novel provides
a powerful message of acceptance

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.980
and empowerment for anyone
struggling with depression.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:56.510 position:56%
In Meg Medina's Burn Baby Burn, Nora
Lopez also faces problems at home

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.740
and violence in the streets of
summertime 1977 New York City,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.520
when disco was king, temperatures
were hot, and frighteningly,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.320
son of Sam was on the loose.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.810
This novel confronts
problems of first

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.520
and second generation Cuban
immigrants, families members

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.440
who love each other but who do not
see the world from the same lens.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.820
And finally, the theme of
immigration is the last theme

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.540
of these commended titles, next
seen in the children's book,

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:35.020 position:56%
Somos como las nubes, We are Like
the Clouds, written by Jorge Argueta

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.850
and illustrated by Alphonso Verano.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.640
The dreamy poetry and images in
this book contrasts beautifully

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.370
with the harsh realities
of migration

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.250
from Central America to the north.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.450
The migrants become a family
of stars and move miraculously

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.290
across the miles like the
clouds, como las nubes.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:05.400 position:56%
And finally, we have Mama the
Alien, written by Rene Colato Lainez

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.890
and illustrated by Laura Lacamara.

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:12.480
When Sophia looks at her
mother's old drivers license,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.550
she discovers that her
mother is an alien.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.850 position:56%
And she first imagines that her
mother must come from another planet

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.410
and that she's got alien friends

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.810
who will soon visit
her in a flying saucer.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.920
This clever book compares or
clarifies the important topic

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.640
of immigration and the process
of becoming a US citizen.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.410
In the author's note she
remarks, I want readers to know

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:41.320
that immigrants may be referred
to as aliens, but this only means

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.190 position:56%
that they come from other countries.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.230
We are all citizens
of the planet Earth.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.110
And so we celebrate these titles

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.890
and we congratulate their
authors and illustrators.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:54.510
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Maria Sheldon: Good afternoon.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.190
The cultural richness
in our country is based

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.830
on everyone's participation.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.970 position:56%
It's such an honor to invite a woman
that represents not only the culture

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:27.210 position:56%
of the Caribbean but the elegant way
asking how she helps us understand

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.240
what it means to be
a global citizen.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:34.900
Canada, the US, Middle
East, Trinidad, and Tobago.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.650
She invite us all to reflect in the
richness of the Caribbean language

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.610
and implore us to open our
hearts as we create empathy

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.680
with a global citizenry
where we're all impacted.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.620
Nadia Hohn, author
of Malaika's Costume,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.500
it is such an honor to
have you right here.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.510
Thank you.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:13:02.850
[ Applause ]

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.910
&gt;&gt; Nadia Hohn: [foreign
language] My hope is one day

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:11.610
that this book will
be in Spanish as well.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.180
I close my eyes and dance.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.110
I am a beautiful peacock.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.510
Each feather shimmers green,
gold, turquoise, and brown.

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.720
Grandma say, girl, it is
definitely [inaudible].

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.210
I think I messed that up.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.090
Trying to do it from memory.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.260
It's like grandma say, girl,

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.830
I think you is definitely
my granddaughter for true.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.850 position:56%
So I want to start first by thanking
the grandmothers, the mothers,

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.070
the fathers, the grandfathers
in my family,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.730
the ancestors who made the
biggest migration of all.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:58.460 position:56%
Of course, there's the
trans-Atlantic slave trade centuries

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:00.450
ago and over the centuries.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:08.050
And recently in the past century,
having gone from Jamaica to Panama

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.720
to help construct the canal,
from Jamaica to Cuba to work

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.620
in sugarcane, to go to UK,
to go to the United States,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.530
like my grandfathers did, and my
great uncle and my grandmothers,

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:24.120 position:56%
and also to Canada where I was born.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.780
So I want to thank all of them
because that I found was part

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.370
of the inspiration for this story.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.260
So the story takes
place in the Caribbean.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.310
Malaika is living with her grandma,
and mom has left to go to Canada

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.680
to work and send money back
home to support the family.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.670
So it's also carnival time and the
first carnival since mom has gone.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:50.980
So now Malaika's left with waiting
for this money that's supposed

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.690
to come for the costume,
and it doesn't come.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.370
So what is she going to do?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.210 position:56%
And that's what this story is about.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.440
But it's also about a
lot of other things too.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:05.100
And as I mentioned, migration
is a theme that runs through it.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.870
I also want to say thank you but
make mention of the inspiration

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.710
which is Trinidad's carnival.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:17.690
The carnival in Trinidad
is quite well known.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.230
And there are Caribbean
carnivals all

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.290
over the actual Caribbean
but also the diaspora.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.700
So there is one here.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.540
There's one in Toronto.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.840
And this is the kind of
festive atmosphere that I grew

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.860
up with knowing going to
the carnival each year.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.070
So actually there's a woman
at the back I have to mention,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.980
because she's actually
from Trinidad.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.830
And I saw her on the plane.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.900
And then I saw her here.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.010
So I said, you need to come.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.610
So she's the representative
from Trinidad.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.200
So thank you to Trinidad and to the
beautiful culture that's been given

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.500
to us.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.880 position:56%
And just understand that when
people leave their countries behind,

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.660
they don't leave everything behind,
the bring their cultures with them.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:04.800 position:56%
So I also want to thank and dedicate
this book as I did in the story

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.410
to the students I taught at the
Afrocentric Alternative School.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.480
It's the first publicly-funded
school,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.450
Afrocentric school, in Canada.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:18.560
So I wrote the story thinking
of ways that I can make sure

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.230
that books look like
the kids that I teach.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.630
And I actually wrote this
for a class assignment.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.360
So it took about six years for it
to actually become a physical book.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.260
So it gives me great pleasure
to have it here in my hands.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.830
And I also want to
thank the Consortium

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.690 position:56%
for Latin American Studies Programs.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.840
Thank you for thinking
of the Caribbean as well.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.910
And also our stories
are very similar.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.970
We have a common thread of having
similar histories of colonization

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.010
and slavery and imperialism
and that sort of thing.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.570
And how those have played
out in different ways

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.210
in the global economy, as the
economies of these regions

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.840
and how they actually come down
to people making very personal

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.640
and heartbreaking decisions.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.920
So I just want to close with this.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.970
I close my eyes and I am in front
of you at the Library of Congress

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.460
in Washington, DC, presenting

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.530
and also accepting an
honor for this book.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.750
And at the start of this year --
I like to do visioning boards.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.460
I don't know if you do that.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.740
But I just like to visualize and
put a picture to the things I want.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.780
And two of the things that stand
out to me, I wanted to come

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.240
to Washington, DC,
Baltimore, Philly.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.540
I put them all together.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.860
So I'm going to Philly tomorrow --

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.260
or sorry, Baltimore tomorrow
and Philly in October.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.860
So that's coming up.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.700
But I also wanted to win an award.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.770
And I'm so glad it's this
award because the theme

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.210
of migration is so important.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:01.140 position:56%
We've all migrated if not ourselves,
our parents or people before us.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:05.500
And you think about the things
we brought to this country.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.670
I have some cousins here
who also they live here,

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.260
the US is their home.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.970 position:56%
So I want to just thank you for
taking the time to acknowledge this.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.710
And thank you so much
for being here.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.510
And thank you for this honor.

&gt;&gt; Paula Mason: Thank you.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.220
Hello, my name is Paula Mason,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.670
and I'm a public librarian
in the Milwaukee area.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.700
And I'm on the selection committee.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.450
It is with great honor that I
introduce author Reyna Grande

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.920
and her outstanding title,
The Distance Between Us,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.900
adapted for young readers
and based off

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.190
of her 2012 award-winning memoir.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.080
Reyna provides readers
with an intimate look

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.010
at the multifaceted effect

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.660
that modern-day immigration
has on young people.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.550
We first step into her
shoes as a child left behind

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.780
with her grandparents in
her hometown in Mexico.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.390
We feel the emotional impact that
this has on Reyna and her siblings,

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.690
who dream of reuniting with
her parents, and in particular,

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.270
with the father that she knows only

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.320
as the man behind the
glass of a picture frame.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.670
Later, she undergoes the fraught
experience of crossing the border

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.020
without documents into a land
that offers promise of dreams

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.480
to be realized but not without
substantial strife and struggles.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.510
Throughout all of this,
Reyna provides young readers

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.560
with a compelling and
bracingly honest narrative

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.510
as she forges her own identity

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.920
and strives towards her
academic and personal goals.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.050
While for some her book
provides an important look

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.910
into an experience
distinct from their own,

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:02.910
for so many other readers,

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.860
aspects of this timely
memoir will resonate deeply

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.840 position:56%
with their own first-hand experience
of immigration and their families.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.600
Thank you so much, Reyna, for your
wonderful gift you've given us.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.510
Thank you.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.500
[ Applause ]

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.900
&gt;&gt; Reyna Grande: Hello, everyone.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.370
It's great to be here
with you today.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.700
Thank you so much for this honor.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.430
And I would like to dedicate
this recognition to the Dreamers.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:42.500
Because these are child immigrants
who came to America the way I did.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.520
And my story is so
similar to theirs.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.310
With the difference that
I was very fortunate

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.770
to be given the opportunity
to legalize my status.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.440
And that is something that
I'm really fighting for them

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.250
to also have that same opportunity.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.980
So I want to dedicate
this recognition to them.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:06.190
Because they, like me, have
also had a lot of trauma.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.140
They've had a lot of heartbreak .

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.710
And they took so many risks
and made so many sacrifices

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.170
to be here in this country.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.880 position:56%
And they continue to give their best

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.190
to make this country
a great place to live.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:30.330
As you heard, my book is about
the often not acknowledged effect

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.740
of immigration, which is the
disintegration of a family.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.170
And that is the book
that I wanted to write

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.710
about how immigration
impacts not just the parents,

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.450
not just the children,
but the entire family.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.540
And everything that happens
affects the families.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.770
But also there's an inheritance
of trauma that gets passed

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:53.630
down to the next generation.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:58.560
And that is something that I myself
am struggling with as a parent is,

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.290
how do I not pass on my
trauma to my children?

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.350
And I am very grateful actually
for everything that I went through,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.890
even though I'm still suffering
from all of those things.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.530
Because now as a parent,
when I look back on my life,

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:18.050
I'm very grateful that, you
know, I was the one who went

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:19.600
through family separation.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.940
I was the one who had to
watch my father walk away,

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.460
my mother walk away.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.980
I was the one who risked
my life to cross the border

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.690
so that my own children
never have to do that.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.570 position:56%
And now I'm able to give my children
something that I didn't have,

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.690
which is a parent that
stays with them.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.850
And to me, that is what
makes it all worth it.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.520
And that's why when I look back
on my life, I am very grateful.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.950
Because I feel that, you know,
it's worth what I went through,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:53.770
so that my children get a shot at
the American dream without the pain

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.380
that I went through to
have that same opportunity.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:04.710
So I want to thank everyone
for recognizing these stories

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.890
of immigrants who contribute
so much to this country.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.540
And it's important for us
to acknowledge everything

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:17.250
that we have done to make
this country what it is,

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:22.290
which is a really wonderful
country where opportunities exist.

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:26.100
And I want to make sure that
we all continue to fight

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.860
to make this a country
where everyone is made

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.230
to feel that they belong.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.800
And where everyone is made
to feel that they are enough.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.830
Because we are enough.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.630
Thank you so much.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:50.390
[ Applause ]

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.640
&gt;&gt; David Campos: Hello,
my name is David Campos,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:58.160
and I am the newest member
on the award committee.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.070
When I was first asked to
participate, I was pretty excited,

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.380
because I was a former
second-grade teacher.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.860
And so I love children's
books, as you can imagine.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.550
And so from September up till
about December, I was so excited

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.980
because I would see the mail
truck, and it's like, oh,

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.280
I know I'm getting something.

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.950
Or I'd come home and there would
be a package on my front door.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:28.900
Ada's Violin, which is the award
winner today, came in a big box,

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.310
and I'm not sure why,
but it was in a big box

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.650
with lots of stuffing in it.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:37.110
And as I opened it, I
was immediately drawn

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.540
to the absolutely beautiful colors.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.420
They just pulled me in.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.030
And I did what every good
second-grade teacher would do,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.600
they do a book walk.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.980
So I did a book walk through it.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.820
And I just couldn't wait
to start reading the story.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.250
And it was very meaningful to me.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.840
I just absolutely fell
in love with the story .

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.500
So without further ado, I'm
going to present two awards.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.110
One is to the author, Susan Hood.

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.300
And if you'll please come on up.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:11.240
[ Applause ]

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.770
Thank you so much.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:16.240
And I'd like to go ahead and
present the illustrated award

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.800
as well, Susan -- excuse me.

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.510
Sally Wern Comport.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:26.500
[ Applause ]

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.040
&gt;&gt; I do want to take a
moment actually and present

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.310 position:56%
to you something that's been a
tradition through the Americas Award

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.070
that Julie Klein started.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.320
And we give a weaving
that's been woven

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:46.970
and it represents your
weaving of stories.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.190 position:56%
So this is direct from our
kachacha [phonetic] language scholar

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:52.490
from Guatemala.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:26:01.690
&gt;&gt; Susan Hood: Thank you so much.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:06.410
Okay, [foreign language] to
the awards committee, CLASP,

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:09.750
and the Library of Congress
for recognizing Ada's Violin,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.940 position:56%
for this wonderful award, along
with Alexandra Diaz's The Only Road.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.370
And congratulations to
all the other honorees.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.290
I know much of your work and it's
a joy to be with you here today.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:24.580
I'd love to tell you that I
discovered the recycled orchestra

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.750
of Paraguay, but that
would be fake news.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.670
All the credit goes to my Simon &amp;
Schuster editor, Christian Tremor,

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.350
who caught the 60 Minutes news
report about the orchestra

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.950
and thought it might
make a good picture book.

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.100
He asked if it held any interest.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.590
Did it. I never followed the old
adage, to write what you know.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:48.410
I write about what surprises me,
what I want to know more about.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.270 position:56%
Well, this story didn't surprise me,

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.640
it dazzled me, knocked
me for a loop.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.060
I was all in.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:58.440
I'm so grateful to Christian,
my agent, Brenda Bowen,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.560
and Simon &amp; Schuster for the
opportunity to share Ada's story

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.690
with young readers
and for pairing me

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.410
up with my spectacular
illustrator, Sally.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:10.820 position:56%
Library, school, journal, culture,
artwork for the book's transcendence

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:15.670
and nothing short of
brilliant, and I heartily agree.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.500
When I thought about
how to tell this story,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.420
I decided there were two ways to do
it: the easy way and the hard way.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.720
Guess which way I chose?

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.160
The easy way would've been to
read the many, many press reports

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.810
about the orchestra for background
information, make up a kid,

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:34.030
and write a fictional book
based on a true story.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.390
But for me, that approach would
diminish the story's power.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:43.360 position:56%
If written as fiction, readers would
likely dismiss it as unbelievable.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:49.010
Would you believe that anyone could
make a violin from a baking pan,

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.040
a stick of lumber, and a fork?

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.840
Or -- well, there was a picture
of a clarinet that was made

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.150
out of drainpipes,
buttons, and house keys.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.480
I think we've all improvised
kitchen sink bands,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.410
but you can't play
Beethoven on them.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.850
The orchestra plays Beethoven,
Bach, Mozart, and the Beatles

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:11.790
so beautifully, they're in demand
all over the globe and play

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.490
for world leaders,
including the Pope.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.620
You just can't make this stuff up.

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.910
So the orchestra's story is
astounding because it's all true.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.120
So for me, it had to be nonfiction.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.370
I had to find a way to reach
kids in Paraguay and get them

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.120
to tell their story
in their own words.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.610
Well, what's so hard about that?

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.630
I couldn't afford to
travel to Paraguay.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.930
I'm an author.

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:39.140
And remember, these kids
live on the landfill.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:44.220
So there's no postal service,
almost no electricity.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.700
I had no idea if anyone
had a telephone

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.860
or access to email or Skype.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.460
The biggest problem for me was that
I don't speak Spanish and no one

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.800
in the orchestra speaks English.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.500
After selling my editor on a
nonfiction approach, I thought, oh,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:03.450
boy, Susan, what have
you gotten yourself into?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.970
As I tell kids on school visits,
don't be afraid to ask for help.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.140
My first step was to
hire a translator.

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.440
And I'd like to give a shout

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.770
out to Shelley McConnell who's a
Connecticut teacher from Mexico.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.500
I could not have written
this book without her.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.550
My second step was to reach out
to the producers of 60 Minutes,

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.640
who were delighted with the
idea of a possible picture book.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.270
They put me in touch
with Favio Chavez,

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.310
the conductor of the orchestra.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.950
And it turned out that he did
have access to email and Skype.

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:34.140
So I did several rounds
of interviews with him

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.450
and later with Ada online.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.830
It was quite a process.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.240
Writing the questions.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.540
Translating them.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:43.750
Waiting for a window when the
orchestra wasn't on tour in Mexico

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.090
or Germany or Colombia or Japan.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.720
It was often weeks and sometimes
months before I would hear back.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.250
And then of course, their
answers had to be translated back

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:57.010
into English for me, and then
that generated new questions.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:01.010
So we'd have to start the whole
long process all over again.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:02.490
But it was worth the wait.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:08.920 position:56%
Ada told me that she thinks of each
garbage truck as a box of surprises.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.280
That statement and the optimism
behind it knocked me out.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.030
Digging into this story was like
unearthing my own box of surprises.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.390
It was truly life-changing.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.190
I try not to take things for
granted, but let's face it,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.080 position:56%
I have clean running water and
electricity at the flick of a wrist.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.210 position:56%
There's green grass outside my door.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.790
My family and I don't think twice
about phone service, air-condition,

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.510
transportation, police,
firefighters,

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.350
public schools, or
garbage collection.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:41.590
Or something as simple and
life-changing as shoes.

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:45.280
Ada's world is far
from an isolated case.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.080
People live in garbage dumps all
over the world: Mexico, India,

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.010
Philippines, and on and on.

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.700
Last May, more than 100 people were
killed on a landfill in Ethiopia

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:59.160
when their homes were buried
by an avalanche of trash.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.550
In the middle of my interviews with
Ada, disaster struck there too.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.930 position:56%
The river that runs through the town
flooded causing hundreds of families

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.420
to evacuate their tin shacks.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.340
What had been a mountain of trash
became a sea of toxic garbage.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.960
And yet despite all of this, Ada
and her friends remain hopeful,

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.940
resilient, and dedicated to
making music for the world.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.230
At a time when the national
endowment for the arts is

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.550
under siege in our
country, Ada's story sings

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.360 position:56%
of the lifesaving power of the arts.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:37.570 position:56%
Degas once said, art is not what you
see but what you make others see.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:43.310 position:56%
And it's clear that music made these
aimless forsaken kids something

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:48.080
to focus on, something to strive
towards, and something to hope for.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.320
For many it was the only
beauty in their lives.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.870
They learned how to
play their instruments.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.410
And they learned a few other
things as well: focus, discipline,

00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.590
dedication, respect for
themselves and for each other.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:06.060
And music is literally helping
them rebuild their lives

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.560
and their community.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.540
Profits from their concerts and
proceeds from this book go back

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.900
to Paraguay where the
families use the money

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.550
to build brick houses
out of the flood zone.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.290
Ada was right, there
was indeed a box

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.650
of surprises waiting
in the landfill.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.450
Buried in the trash was music.

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.080
And buried in these kids was
something to be proud of.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.880
Gracias.

&gt;&gt; Sally Wern Comport: I'm going to
have to ask for assistance here to.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.920 position:56%
I am not a wordsmith, I'm an artist.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:54.690
I'm the illustrator
for Ada's Violin.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:02.050
And so I don't have a lovely
written talk for you, because,

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.930
like I said, I'm about pictures.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.210
So I need to show you slides.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.230
I can tell you this.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.630 position:56%
Simon &amp; Schuster called me and said,

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.040
are you interested in
illustrating a book?

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.340
And we want to send you
a trailer about this book

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:27.800
that will be written,
is yet to be complete.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:32.280
I didn't have a manuscript but I
had about a three-minute trailer

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:37.330
that had me weeping from the start.

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.900
The music was so beautiful.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:46.110
The story, while limited and
abbreviated, was so moving

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:52.310
and so positive in terms
of the impact of what music

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:59.470 position:56%
and a teacher brought to these
students that were living on a dump.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:05.200
So what you do when you're
illustrating is you try

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.210
to bring yourself to that space.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.090
Well, I waited for the story
after I said yes immediately,

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.660
and I waited for the manuscript.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.240
And then I got Susan's manuscript.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:21.430
And what can I say?

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:28.100
To be introduced through the lens
of Ada was the most amazing way

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:34.450
to take this story and feel
as though you could try

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:38.370
in the best way possible
to be sitting there

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.670
with them, to be with them.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:51.360
So I'm going to take you
just plainly to the studio.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.000
So there's a studio space,
and this is where it begins.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:04.010
In Annapolis, just shy of here,
which means I was not familiar

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:06.060
with South America either.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.890
So it's how do you feel?

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:14.330
What these people feel, it is
important to immerse yourself in.

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.870
There's more studio.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.770 position:56%
So you can see, it's kind of a mess.

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:22.810
So I had a little bit of
a dump site in my studio.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.460
But it also is where
the creative comes from.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:31.120
So the inspiration comes from
thinking about the materials

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:37.260
that might be around, thinking
about the color, the temperature,

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:42.170
the smell, all of that, and
immersing yourself in it.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:49.690
I went to the Spanish grocery store
in my community, took photographs

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:57.920
of all the things, to try
to create a garbage dump

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.570
that we could just slightly
think was beautiful.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.660
Because there was nothing beautiful

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.380
about the photographs
that came from this.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:14.490
And try to find the art, the color,

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:21.560
the things that represent what
this culture might have seen,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.110
whether it be labels or color or --

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:27.950
and then to see the
instruments themselves,

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:32.090
amazing pieces, works of art.

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:39.460
And the inspiration for the images
is completely because of the story,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.830
because of the sculptures that were
made, crafted by one craftsman,

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.770
a carpenter in the village.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:53.690
And when you see where he lives and
how inspiring his story alone was,

00:36:53.690 --> 00:37:00.920
it helps you to see the ripples in
the pond that happen from an idea.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:07.610
And hopefully it translates
to the world that way.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:10.730
That was what was apparent
in the film.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:17.670 position:56%
When I do a book, I will choreograph
it throughout in the palette,

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.480
so that when you look at the
thumbnails of the first sketches

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.370
that were done for this book,
you want to walk through it

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.140
as if you're walking
through the story and come

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.860
out with the inspirational
feeling that I had

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.140
when I read Susan's
incredible manuscript.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:39.720
And it starts with more of the
paper, more of the collaging.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.530
It inspired all of the
images, was the story itself.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.770
Every book that's done
is done hopefully

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.860
from my studio inspired
by what I'm looking at.

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.050
So I would not draw the same
book that I was drawing for this

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:59.160
if it was another author
or another story.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.280
But I wanted you to feel
heat when you looked

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.300
at these kids practicing outside.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.440
And I wanted you to
feel their emotion

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.250
when they thought about
getting on stage.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:17.090
So I grabbed the nearest studio
assistant I had and said, Lindsay,

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:19.630
you're very, very afraid.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:26.510
And here my two Arian and
Lindsay, you're really thrilled

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:36.160
to be performing in a world
stage with this amazing band.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:43.210
So hopefully that is coming
from the story in the images.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:48.350
I can barely do the
inspirational story any justice.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:53.890
But I'm very grateful for this
honor and for this organization

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.390
and what you bring to the world.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.510
So thank you for the
honor and the invitation.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:07.500
[ Applause ]

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:18.810
&gt;&gt; Emily Chavez: Good afternoon.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.090
Very afraid of dropping
-- okay, now it's safe.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:31.490
It is an honor to present this
Americas Award to Alexandra Diaz

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.240
for The Only Road,
this book right here.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:39.320
I'm Emily Chavez, a member
of the review committee,

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.980
and I am the outreach coordinator
for the UNC Duke Consortium

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:47.350
and Latin American
and Caribbean Studies.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:48.650
Thank you.

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.590
And I'm a former English teacher,
high school English teacher.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:40:00.040
So this book was just a book that
I had the pleasure of reading.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.950
After I read it, I really
couldn't stop talking about it

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.750 position:56%
or telling everyone I knew about it.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:11.860
It is a powerful portrayal of why
young people, so many young people,

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:16.760
have traveled to this country alone
from their countries of origin

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.630
to this one, and how they do so.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:22.520
I see this as an empathy-building
novel.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.140
Jaime and Hella are the main
characters and they leave Guatemala

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.710
to travel to Mexico, meeting
friends and others along the way.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:38.190 position:56%
They are teenagers and they are
cousins who wrestle with exhaustion,

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.260
grief, hunger, and longing
throughout their journey.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:46.200
Jaime and Hella are also
playful, hopeful, curious.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:51.690 position:56%
And the novel does not shy away
from the many threats and injustices

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.570
of the migration journey
from Guatemala,

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.070
through Mexico, to
the United States.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:01.540
Yet, Alexandra Diaz has
written it in such a way

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.600 position:56%
that makes it appropriate for middle
school and high school readers.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.880
Many communities and schools
across the US have seen

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.660
and experienced the change in
recent years, more kids coming

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.090
from Guatemala, El
Salvador, and Honduras.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:19.220
Many arriving as unaccompanied
minors who may

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.750
or may not be reuniting with
families here that they know.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:26.530
At the peak of this
migration pattern,

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.410
27,000 unaccompanied minors arrived

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:36.760
from Central America
to the US in June 2014.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.180
This book is timely.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.480
It's needed.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.300
And an awesome resource for so
many students, both those who want

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.810
to learn more about Latin
American youth migrating to the US,

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:50.400
as well as young Latin
American immigrants who want

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.370
to see themselves in the pages
of the books that they read.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.730
This is a book about
choices and the lack thereof.

00:41:57.730 --> 00:41:59.900
This is a book about survival.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.320
This is a book about connection.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.700
So I'm very happy to
introduce Alexandra Diaz,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.510
the author of The Only Road.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:15.500
[ Applause ]

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:27.940
&gt;&gt; I also want to give you
a weaving from Guatemala.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.410
So thank you so much.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:30.710
&gt;&gt; Fantastic.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.010
&gt;&gt; Alexandra Diaz: [inaudible]
I just forgot to print it,

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.620
so I needed my notes
from my computer.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.190
I'm going to put this on now.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:41.400
I don't know how to wear it,
but I'm like feeling very loved.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.650
Thank you.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:52.840
So I want to say thank you so much
for the opportunity to be here.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:57.600
I'm Alexandra Diaz, the
author of The Only Road.

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.750
People have asked me if I've
been to Washington, DC before

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.000
and if I've been to the
Library of Congress.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And I always feel like
saying, yes, I have.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.430
But I actually do not remember
being in the Library of Congress.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:15.510 position:56%
So I feel it was one of those things
that happened as a teenager that,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.490
you know, this is this,
this is that,

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.970
and I didn't pay attention enough.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.340
Which is a shame.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.740
But, you know, at the same time,
it means that my opportunity

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.360
to be here is that
much more memorable.

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.400 position:56%
I took the tour and I could just see

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.630
and feel all the books
that were here.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:39.370
And to be a part of that,
it's this feeling like,

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:41.980
can life even got any better?

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:43.980
Because it's a huge honor.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:51.320
And I have read the works of, you
know, my fellow award winners,

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:54.050
and I keep thinking, they
must've made a mistake

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:58.850
because their books are so fabulous
and so wonderful, why am I here.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:03.130 position:56%
So I thank CLASP for thinking of me.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.870 position:56%
I thank Simon &amp; Schuster for
sending the book, for encouraging me

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.750
to write it, everyone
who is involved.

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.310
I'm sure I'm going to forget
somebody and so I'll stop there

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:18.780
and just say, everyone is thanked.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:24.880
This book, The Only Road,
is a very timely book

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.960
with a personal connection.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:30.100 position:56%
I am the daughter of Cuban refugees.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:35.890
And I grew up hearing stories about
Cuba and what it was like not to --

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.250
not only to live there
but also to leave there.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:46.450
Leaving your family, your
friends, your home, and not knowing

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.420
if you could ever go back.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.860
So both of my parents
left as teenagers.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:56.970
They left with nothing but $5
and two changes of clothes.

00:44:56.970 --> 00:45:01.860
They were not allowed
to take anything else.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:07.010
Those who were caught smuggling
additional items were imprisoned.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:11.530
And people who spoke against
the government were executed,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.110
sometimes even publicly.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.760
So I grew up with these
stories, hearing about what it's

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:23.980
like to leave your family, leave
your home, and leave your country,

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:28.440
because it's the only way that
you have a chance of surviving.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:35.460
When the opportunity came to write
this modern-day immigration novel,

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.050
I immediately jumped at the chance.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.610
I'm like [foreign language]
I have to write this.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.690
Because it's what my
parents went through.

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:45.740
It's what so many children
are going through right now.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.110
And you ask yourself, well,
why are they doing this?

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.010
You know, why are you putting
yourself in such a danger?

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:56.110
And the thing is that
there is no other choice.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.570
People are doing this because
there is no other option.

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:06.000
I did take the easy route and made
a fictional story with this book.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.490
But still wanted to base it
on real events, real people,

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:17.100
and real things that are going on.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.660
I wrote this book two years ago.

00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:23.430
And at the time, immigration
was a very hot topic.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:29.480
I had no idea that it would
become so much more controversial

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:35.060 position:56%
and so much more of a hot topic
given the political situation today.

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:43.660
But I also wanted to bring -- so
not only did I want to have a novel

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:48.610
that shared what was realistically
happening, but I also wanted

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:51.650
to bring a novel of hope.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:56.690
So spoiler alert.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:57.990
They live.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.050
And you know, there are
a lot of opportunities.

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:05.850
A lot of bad things can happen,
but there are still a lot

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:10.660
of opportunities and a lot
of reasons to help them

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.000
to strive and want to continue.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.210
And I truly believe that
if you don't have hope,

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.690
you don't really have a life.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:25.160
So even when things get really
bad and you're struggling

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:29.020
and you don't know how you're going
to survive, it's holding on to

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.710
that hope and holding
on to that feeling

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:37.680
that maybe things will change,
maybe things will be better.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.460
Maybe you have to make decisions

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.010
that you may not have
wanted to make.

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:45.770
But you know, it is for the better.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:49.620
I mean, like Reyna was saying,
that she was so glad she made

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.570
that journey because now she
has that hope for her children.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:54.730
Her children don't have
to go through that.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:48:01.850
So I did want to make sure
my novel was realistic

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:06.640
but still kept that
light of a promise.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:11.790
So even when you have no choice,
there is always a different path.

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:16.080
So again, thank you so much
for allowing me to be here.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.380
I am just so honored.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.800
And my mom is not here.

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.100
I love my mommy.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.050
And she was the one who
always encouraged me

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.460
to write and keep writing.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:34.580
She is my biggest fan and I
love her to bits because of it.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:39.220
So I certainly wouldn't have been
able to be here if it hadn't been

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:44.010
for her and her strength and her
unconditional love of what I wanted

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:48.860
to do, and never once telling
me I had to get a real job.

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.510
So thank you very much.

00:48:52.510 --> 00:49:03.040
[ Applause ]

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.860
&gt;&gt; Colleen McCoy: Thank
you so much, Alexandra.

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:06.160
Well said.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.460
Thank you all for coming.

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:09.800
Thank you to the Library of
Congress once again and all

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.930
of our supporters, our review
committee members, and of course,

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:14.970
our authors and illustrators.

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:19.360 position:56%
At this time we'd like to invite you
to join us for a reception and also

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.950
to meet and greet and maybe get
a book signed with our authors

00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:25.100
and illustrator here today.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.920 position:56%
Reyna, Nadia, and Alexandra will be
at the table right here to the back.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.230
And then just through this
doorway, will be Sally and Susan.

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:36.320
Susan will be ducking out
shortly to catch a train.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:40.150
So if you have to go chat with her,
I recommend you visit her first.

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.430
Thank you all again and
hope to see you next year.

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:48.950
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
