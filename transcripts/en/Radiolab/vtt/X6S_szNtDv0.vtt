00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.341
Hey,

2
00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:05.060
this is jad very proud to present to you guys starting today here on radio lab

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.790
and mini series from producer Molly Webster.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.220
<v 1>It's been the Michael [inaudible] as a fish [inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.270
go to four saw

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.740
[inaudible].

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.560
Hi voided to carry you all.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280
Love you. How old are you?

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.970
<v 0>Hi, I'm Molly Webster.</v>

10
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.980
The last time

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.360
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.190
<v 0>I dunno, I'd say three years I've been,</v>

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.283
yes.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.833
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
<v 0>[inaudible] doing a lot of reporting about how humans make more of themselves,</v>

16
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.420
right? Like science stories, ethical stories.

17
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.110
And we came up with this idea that, you know,

18
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.460
rather than me reporting only on reproduction for the next 10 years or radio

19
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:14.980
lab, that what if we just put them all together in a series.

20
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.000
And so we're about to do that for the next month.

21
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.780
We're going to do this series and the name of the series is

22
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.330
ahead.

23
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.650
<v 2>D</v>

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.450
<v 0>I know you're thinking why I'm gonna ask you a question. You can say no.</v>

25
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.160
What do you think about the word gonads? Goon donuts. Oh,

26
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.390
that's crazy question. It's almost like that word moist.

27
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.690
It gives you like a little, yes.

28
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.480
That word does have certain connotations. What do you think of? Go?

29
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.500
Isn't that nuts? It's a slang term for balls, balls, testicles, testicles,

30
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.080
balls. Definitely balls. Definitely walls you got going on.

31
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.020
It's like just using like stupid boy humor.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.760
Almost like toxic masculinity situation.

33
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.420
You just think like sweaty balls in male jokes pretty much like kick you in the

34
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.610
Nads. Great. Would you think it has anything to do with ladies? No.

35
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.820
No, no. Oh No. Did you know that? Um,

36
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.030
ladies actually have gonads also.

37
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.330
The gonads are both testes and ovaries. Oh really?

38
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.240
That it's actually for men and women. Really?

39
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.940
I did not know that. I did not know that. I did not know that

40
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.000
90% of the people I talked to didn't and all that. They didn't know it.

41
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.720
Who would've thought?

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.720
Women and men both have gonads culture stolen the word native mail.

43
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.570
And I think it's time we reclaimed this word like as a citizen,

44
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.180
as a human, as a lady, as a science lover.

45
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.640
I'm taking the word back.

46
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.223
<v 2>Go.</v>

47
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.611
<v 0>Oh, okay.</v>

48
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.611
So this is episode one and this whole series like kind of came into being,

49
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.670
um, with a single phrase. All right. The duck is in the house

50
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.623
from this guy.

51
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.720
Can you say for me your name and how you identify yourself?

52
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.570
I'm [inaudible], I am an ovarian biologists,

53
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.210
so I have a, a research laboratory, uh, at Yale University School of medicine.

54
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.600
So [inaudible] he is the one who said that. Yeah, go on. Ads are magical.

55
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.093
Oregon's,

56
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.690
they are ads are magical. Oregon

57
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.093
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.810
<v 0>so octane is Turkish. You know, I was a curious kid. He grew up in his temple.</v>

59
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.580
I was at trache as a child and as name and I was 10 years old.

60
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.210
I would, you know, you know, look into universe in disguise and,

61
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.540
and trying to understand or, you know, make,

62
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.960
make sense out of this whole thing.

63
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.260
What was it about the sky that attracted you? It was the concept of infinity.

64
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.090
You know,

65
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.090
we're just living a mundane life on this planet without thinking of anything but

66
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.120
our routine concerns. But at the same time, I mean,

67
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.130
you've got this vast space around this and most of you have no clue.

68
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.130
We live oblivious to that fact.

69
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.110
And I would lose a sleepover that when I was a kid. Yeah.

70
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.640
Fast forward act take goes to medical school in Turkey. He becomes a doctor,

71
00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:59.340
specifically an ob Gyn. So I had to deliver a lot of babies,

72
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.800
a probably 20,000 or so.

73
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.870
That's like bursting a small town. And then you know, having,

74
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.270
after having made 20,000 delivery, I said, you know, perhaps, uh,

75
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.820
this is not my calling. I want us to be a little bit more, uh,

76
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.110
more towards the beginning of the process. You know,

77
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.320
when you're an obstetrician, you're dealing with the finished product. Right.

78
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.921
Well,

79
00:05:22.921 --> 00:05:26.280
I just think that's a crazy statement because most people think babies are the

80
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.960
very beginning of the process.

81
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.470
I'm not sure what gets more beginning than like a small baby popping out of a

82
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:35.520
lady that feels, feels like the starting line. We started something.

83
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.740
But in [inaudible] case there was like some sense that most of the decisions,

84
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.490
most of something had already been decided by the time the baby gets out.

85
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.140
And that whole process is a, uh, fascinating.

86
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.020
So we dragged him into the studio to talk about the same magical gonads

87
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.390
basically just to figure out why are they magical.

88
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.360
I'm interested how you settled on word. Yeah. What did I say? You know,

89
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:04.280
I think magical for many reasons. One is their origin, you know, they,

90
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:09.281
and he told me what he learned when he started studying this stuff was that the

91
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:14.501
origin of the gonad like its creation is sort of the beginning because it starts

92
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:20.000
with this whole saga that is so involved and so extreme that the baby itself

93
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.010
does kind of feel like an afterthought.

94
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.130
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

95
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.020
<v 0>he calls it the great migration.</v>

96
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.890
The great migration octane got me into the story.

97
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.840
And so Andy up calling a bunch of people about it.

98
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.490
In my lab we have a slogan that says gonads or go home. We have tee shirts.

99
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.140
You don't, you do.

100
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.200
We have a tee shirt that is blanche Capel professor in cell biology at Duke

101
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:46.530
University Medical Center.

102
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.090
She essentially studies all the parts of the story we're about to tell you.

103
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.800
Okay,

104
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800
so to place this story in time that begins that about oh two or three weeks.

105
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.750
And humans. I bet. Let's say day 24 just to be safe,

106
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160
which basically means a sperm fertilized an egg 23 days ago.

107
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.800
It could be a petri dish, it could be sex, who knows,

108
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.170
but inside this woman's uterus,

109
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.230
there is a little organism that has been growing for 24 days.

110
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.450
What does the embryo look like at that point? That's my comrade in arms.

111
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:19.750
Pat Walters, who's the editor of the series, Gosh,

112
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.390
I don't know how to describe this very well to you. I could send you a picture.

113
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:27.440
Does it kind of look like a tadpole? Exactly. That's not so wrong.

114
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.000
It looks like a tadpole and if you look at very early embryo,

115
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.080
it's like curled up. There's a tail, got a little tail. There's like the,

116
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.390
the sort of ball of the embryo that's like forming the developing body and then

117
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:44.180
it has this like sweep of a tail that's coming off and if you zoom into the

118
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:47.510
tail, you'll see a little region.

119
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.750
It's called the Allen Toe is called the Allen Toe is,

120
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.850
which is the trash bag of the embryo

121
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.910
before the embryo has an excretory system.

122
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.260
It dumps things that it doesn't want in the Allen toes.

123
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.230
Urine flows in and out there.

124
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.380
It's where gas exchange with the mother happens.

125
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.940
So kind of a terrible place. It's like a foreign planets.

126
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.510
This isn't actually part of the embryo itself. No,

127
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:18.070
it's sort of in the hinterlands.

128
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.260
The Allen Toast I always imagined was is, is the

129
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.340
<v 3>where Harrison Ford was camped out in blade runner 2049 which is like that vast</v>

130
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.300
dust desert. Super Orange dust. Yeah.

131
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.070
And there's like um,

132
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.210
<v 0>windstorms and and like wind blowing over the desert.</v>

133
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.370
I imagine it like that.

134
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.550
And it's here where you find some cells,

135
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:52.600
these very specialized cells, germ cells, the germ cells, germ cells.

136
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.140
These are the,

137
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.140
that are going to go on that great migration and put the magic in the Gonad.

138
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.690
They, they're very interesting cell type there.

139
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.590
They're set aside very early in embryogenesis. And how many are there?

140
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.521
They're like a thousand.

141
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:13.950
It's not that 2000 or I think they're something like 40 wheat. That's it. Or,

142
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.550
yes, 40 biblical number. And the irony here is,

143
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:21.780
is these cells sort of like huddled at the edges of this wasteland,

144
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.990
might actually be the most important cells in the body.

145
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.880
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

146
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:32.080
<v 0>because after the embryo grows, after the baby gets born,</v>

147
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.120
after that baby goes through puberty, and one day maybe decides to have a kid,

148
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.400
these cells which are present at the very beginning,

149
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.720
these cells are in charge of making a next generation of you.

150
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.750
<v 5>I mean, that's the meaning of life, right? That's the origin of life.</v>

151
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:53.610
These cells, everything else, and we think it's brain, heart, et cetera.

152
00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:58.290
But I think everything else is there to support.

153
00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.970
The survival of the germ cell

154
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 0>are the stem cell of the species, right?</v>

155
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:07.570
So stem cell means a cell that can create other cells and originator cell.

156
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:11.600
We have stem cells for lungs, stem cells for heart stem cells for neurons.

157
00:10:11.601 --> 00:10:14.420
These cells are the only cells that can make on their own.

158
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.900
All the other kinds of cells, they can make a whole person. So it's a,

159
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.650
they have a remarkable underlying pluripotency. Mm.

160
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.610
Do you think they know that? While that's a,

161
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:28.910
I mean that those are very difficult questions to answer. I don't know.

162
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.000
I think germ cells know they're really special cells,

163
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.910
but I don't think they know what they're going to become.

164
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.270
We can ask the question if they're so special,

165
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:40.600
why do they start out in the trash? Yeah, that seems like a bad place.

166
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.770
You would think it's very curious that the germ cells arise near that position

167
00:10:44.771 --> 00:10:49.771
and it's unclear why or you hide your most precious object in the trash dump as

168
00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:56.140
I'm the, I'm like, this is like God, like the best GV mission.

169
00:10:56.141 --> 00:11:00.430
Impossible like murder on the Orient Express.

170
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.550
Maybe that's the plan. I don't know in all seriousness,

171
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.300
but for some reason scientists don't know exactly why.

172
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:11.080
It seems like evolution has decided to set these cells aside at the beginning of

173
00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:11.890
development,

174
00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:16.560
which means they have to make a journey back to the middle of the embryo where

175
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.980
their destinies will be revealed. And if they make it there, we make it there.

176
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.440
If they don't [inaudible].

177
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.890
Okay. Okay. So, so they hang around this dusty wasteland for a few days,

178
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.890
huddled against the elements. I wonder what that's like for them.

179
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.030
I imagine if I was in that situation, I would just like be like wondering how I,

180
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:42.790
this was my lot in life. Is this some sort of cosmic joke guy?

181
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.390
The sense, I have a sense I made the important, but I'm just here.

182
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.980
Don't know why in the wasteland.

183
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.180
So they hang out like that for a couple of days. And then

184
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.883
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

185
00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:01.900
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

186
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.900
<v 0>there's a call the here call it maybe smell call. Let's see here.</v>

187
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:11.310
There's a signal there called into action and so the cells start migrating.

188
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:15.330
They literally move. Wow. What, wait. So how does this sell? March?

189
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.890
They actually extend Filopodia, uh, which are little, a cell like feet.

190
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.200
Okay. Is it like a pops out two feet and then it goes walking? Um,

191
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.780
cells send out extensions and that extension has a little adhesion molecule on

192
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:33.480
it, like a little sticky spot. So when it puts its foot out,

193
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:37.480
it can pull the rest of the cell up to it. So they take a hike,

194
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.500
hike, hike, hike.

195
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:46.930
And interestingly the germ cells seem to be holding hands like a long string of

196
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:51.910
paper dolls and they touch each other. It's as though they are.

197
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:57.270
The whole crowd is like going together and after a bit of a hike they get to the

198
00:12:57.271 --> 00:12:59.710
wall of the embryo which is like, I don't know,

199
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.520
pulsating math and somehow this is a very blurry period.

200
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:05.840
I have to say they

201
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.260
push their way through the wall and on the other side

202
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.780
it's just chaos there.

203
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:21.940
It's like a foreign plants because what's happening is I knew that the embryo is

204
00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:24.860
just like dividing, dividing, dividing, dividing, dividing.

205
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.890
You know the whole embryo is developing very fast at this stage trying to start

206
00:13:30.141 --> 00:13:34.110
forming parts like once a form Oregons and wants to form a nervous system are

207
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:38.090
all kinds of signals flying around to tell the gut to form and to tell the liver

208
00:13:38.091 --> 00:13:41.150
to form. Blood cells are popping up neurons,

209
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.590
you know all these signals are flashing all around and yet the germ cells,

210
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.360
their job is to block it all out.

211
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.910
They migrate right down the middle of the embryo at the midline.

212
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.080
Almost like where you could think like a spine would be through a forest of

213
00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:03.430
signals going around in the embryo and the signals are prom farting.

214
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.980
Trying to temp them like, hey, be a liver cell,

215
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.510
be a liver cell, come be a liver, be liver, and sometimes these cells and like,

216
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:18.070
hmm, wait, do I want to be all over? Am I a liver?

217
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.210
No, wait, something tells me as you keep marching, it seems scary, doesn't it?

218
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.480
Yeah, yeah. They go through a battle, Hey,

219
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.580
do you know if they ever lose one along the way?

220
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.760
Like the chain is going and they're trying to like don't differentiate or

221
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:37.680
differentiate this. Like the fourth one from the end ever go like, Ooh,

222
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.560
just become a stomach. And they're like, oh crap, we lost Stan.

223
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:48.010
Keep hurry, hurry. It probably happens.

224
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.940
But they try to stay focused together and they tried to resist all of those

225
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:55.910
signals that could divert them from their destiny.

226
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.940
They want to stay uncommitted.

227
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.800
<v 7>These might be the last cells in the developing mammalian embryo to give up</v>

228
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.280
their world. Of Possibilities.

229
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.600
<v 0>This is David Page.</v>

230
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.950
He is the director of the Whitehead Institute biologist at MIT,

231
00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.850
<v 7>if you see what I'm saying. So basically when a,</v>

232
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.940
when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, to go back to the,

233
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:25.560
that beginning, um, the resulting cell called a Zygote,

234
00:15:25.561 --> 00:15:28.410
the fertilized egg has the possibility,

235
00:15:28.411 --> 00:15:33.411
has the potential to become every type of cell on the body and as one cell

236
00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:37.680
becomes two and two become four and so on and so on,

237
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.860
eventually some cells give up that broad range of possibilities and become

238
00:15:43.351 --> 00:15:47.790
committed to narrower occupations and specializations. You know,

239
00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:52.590
we have at least 200 or 300 specialized cell types that make up our body.

240
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.650
All the other cells make the transition from possibility to reality.

241
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.080
And those migrating primordial germ cells are the last cells to give up a wide

242
00:16:03.421 --> 00:16:04.440
range of possibilities.

243
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.520
<v 0>Oh, I liked it in further. Like pugnaciousness.</v>

244
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.340
<v 7>Yes, yes.</v>

245
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.430
<v 0>Okay. So getting back to the band of 40, we're back in the thick of things with,</v>

246
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.930
you're marching through the middle of the embryo being like pelted and torn at

247
00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.690
fighting off all these other six nols. And they do this for one day,

248
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.190
two days, three days, right? Four,

249
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.390
five. I imagine they get tired as they go. Six,

250
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.660
seven Oh eight.

251
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.920
But the signal that they're following is getting stronger.

252
00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.110
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

253
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.340
<v 0>and then pretty soon</v>

254
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.350
over the horizon on kind of either side of the path,

255
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.800
they start to see these mountains,

256
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:06.110
urogenital ridge is going to emerge as sort of a mountain off the back wall of

257
00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:07.734
the body cavity.

258
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:09.830
<v 1>Yeah. Um,</v>

259
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:15.990
[inaudible]

260
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.260
<v 0>so they're still marching down this path. They're following the signal.</v>

261
00:17:19.261 --> 00:17:22.800
The mountains are getting closer and closer, and then at some point,

262
00:17:22.801 --> 00:17:27.060
the path in front of them splits, it goes to the left and it goes to the right.

263
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.300
And half the cells would go to the left and half the cells would go to the

264
00:17:30.301 --> 00:17:32.640
right, regardless of what direction they go in.

265
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:37.670
They end up at the base of a mountain and the mountain is a mass of like a dense

266
00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:44.181
mass of cells and they come right up to the edge of the mountain wall and

267
00:17:45.061 --> 00:17:46.470
they're able to just like

268
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:50.340
push those cells

269
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.160
<v 2>aside and like squeeze in</v>

270
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.460
<v 0>to the interior of the mountain.</v>

271
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.673
<v 4>[inaudible],</v>

272
00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.420
<v 0>which is an entirely new space.</v>

273
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.920
So the germ cells enter,

274
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.790
enter the Gonad. Oh, this is the gonad? Yeah.

275
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:22.230
This is the place that will either be an ovary or testes in which I mean it

276
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:25.530
hasn't been figured out, which it is. No. At this point it could go either way.

277
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.120
I think about this place as a cathedral and the cathedral,

278
00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.740
it's sort of under construction and as they walk in they,

279
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.730
they probably know immediately that this is the place that's been calling them

280
00:18:38.731 --> 00:18:42.090
because that's signal that they've been following. It's everywhere.

281
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.340
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

282
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.870
<v 0>maybe when they get to the Gonad,</v>

283
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.800
the whole cell is surrounded by the signal and that tells the cell to stop.

284
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.970
But this is just a guess. What do you think it's like for the,

285
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.230
for the germ cells, like sort of,

286
00:18:55.231 --> 00:18:59.310
they've been going on this walk and then they get to a place that says,

287
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.940
stay here. So I wonder what the stay here like.

288
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.060
I Dunno feels like, oh, I think it feels like home.

289
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:11.770
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

290
00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.290
<v 0>after marching for almost two solid weeks,</v>

291
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.820
they finally arrive. They recognize this is where they belong.

292
00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.330
But everyone I talked to said probably still at this point,

293
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.170
they don't even know what lies ahead for them or even why they're there.

294
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.210
We're anthropomorphizing, but why not? Um, David Page again,

295
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.210
<v 7>I would suggest that the primordial germ cells,</v>

296
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.280
they have been instructed to migrate to the genital rich,

297
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.630
but they don't know why and they don't know what they're gonna do. Um,

298
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.320
when they get there, they have not a clue,

299
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.930
<v 2>but the clue is coming.</v>

324
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.300
<v 0>Okay, so to pick up on the action,</v>

325
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:52.770
the tribe of 40 they find themselves in this cathedral like space technical

326
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.960
name, the mess and effort Gonadal region,

327
00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.410
I'll call it the house of Gonad [inaudible]. They're in this beautiful space.

328
00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.730
They don't know why,

329
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.810
but what happens is immediately when they enter,

330
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.290
they are surrounded by somatic cells.

331
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.520
I imagine these cells as like friendly monks.

332
00:22:13.521 --> 00:22:16.700
Just gliding around in red roads.

333
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:21.730
Their job is to just protect you and make sure that nothing bad happens to you.

334
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.060
So these are the cells that have been calling them. I don't know.

335
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.530
That's kind of a hard question to answer because the genital Ridge had just

336
00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:33.470
started forming when the germ cells began their migration.

337
00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:36.410
So no one really knows like what was sending the signal.

338
00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:41.570
But after a few days, some people say a few weeks,

339
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.470
these somatic cells that are gathered around the germ cells will lean in real

340
00:22:45.471 --> 00:22:49.220
close and they reveal the destiny.

341
00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.500
They tell them either one of two things.

342
00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:53.363
<v 4>Yes,</v>

343
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.900
<v 0>you will become a sperm</v>

344
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.080
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

345
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.470
<v 6>or you will become an egg.</v>

346
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.773
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

347
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.090
<v 0>what exactly are these bunk cells doing though? I mean, uh,</v>

348
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.690
t to make them change. Are they like bumping them in some special way or no, no,

349
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.470
no, no. They're releasing proteins. Well,

350
00:23:22.471 --> 00:23:27.471
there are molecular signaling cascades that are controlling the male or female

351
00:23:27.541 --> 00:23:31.850
fate of the, of the germ cells and what makes them go one way or the other. Oh,

352
00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.170
that is super complicated. And we're going to get into it later. In the series.

353
00:23:37.171 --> 00:23:39.720
So for now I'll just say in mammals,

354
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.950
sexes genetically controlled by whether or not you have two x chromosomes or an

355
00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:47.510
x and a y chromosome.

356
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.020
So it's just basically like your fourth grade biology of the cells in the

357
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:55.340
Cathedral have a y chromosome though they'll say sperm.

358
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:59.780
And if the cells in Cathedral have an XX chromosome, they'll say egg.

359
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.680
So it's still basically just fate in luck as to why, which way they go. Yes.

360
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:05.030
But here's the cool part.

361
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.870
If the amongst held the germ cells that they're going to be sperm, they,

362
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.190
they basically divide a little bit and then amongst like take the germ cells and

363
00:24:13.191 --> 00:24:15.830
they put them to sleep. They sort of,

364
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.510
I dunno in tomb them in these catacombs until uh,

365
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.280
after birth and puberty.

366
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.750
But if the germ cells get told that they're going to be eggs,

367
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.710
something different happens inside of them and they just

368
00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.413
<v 1>go</v>

369
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.183
<v 0>nuts.</v>

370
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.260
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.280
<v 0>they divide, they divide quite a lot rapidly for a while.</v>

372
00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.570
Suddenly the band of 40 becomes thousand and 2000 and 10,000.

373
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.500
The monks then take each of these new eggs and embed them in the wall of the

374
00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:02.490
cathedral divide. Boom, divide, boom, divide,

375
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.830
divide, boom. They literally shove the eggs into the wall of the house of Gona.

376
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.880
Yes, and this goes on for months. As a matter of fact,

377
00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.840
their numbers probably reach around six to 10 million.

378
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.710
You're in the fifth month of pregnancy, about 20 weeks of gestation.

379
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.570
That embryonic ovaries going to have all the eggs they will ever have when it's

380
00:25:25.571 --> 00:25:29.770
only five months along with this is all still in utero. This is all in utero.

381
00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:30.550
It's happening.

382
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:35.380
It has 10 million eggs and it is still itself months away from being born. Yes.

383
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.180
Theoretically at that point,

384
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.750
that is 500 times more babies than octane ever delivered in his career in this

385
00:25:44.441 --> 00:25:49.080
one developing embryo. Fuck yeah, I know.

386
00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.071
Cause you know what?

387
00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:53.370
It just occurred to me like if you go all the way back to the beginning of this

388
00:25:53.371 --> 00:25:55.800
story, you told day 24 or whatever it was,

389
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.170
you've got this little organism forming.

390
00:25:58.171 --> 00:26:00.000
Probably the mother doesn't even know it's there yet,

391
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.840
but already there are these cells

392
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:10.970
in existence that will be the kid of the kid.

393
00:26:11.431 --> 00:26:15.840
She doesn't even know she has yet. So her grandkids are in there already.

394
00:26:15.841 --> 00:26:20.400
Is that right? So when you're pregnant with a person you carry inside of you,

395
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.840
the cells that will make the next, oh, you're right, it is granddaughter.

396
00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:31.290
It's like your grandkids are already inside of you. Inside of your unborn child.

397
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.820
Yes. That's bananas. Yes. You think the great grandkids are in there too?

398
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.600
Well, it's like all this. That's what she means by stem cell of the species,

399
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.913
because

400
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:47.490
it's the same material that makes they then they not only make the body,

401
00:26:47.491 --> 00:26:51.690
they make more eggs and sperm, they make the next generation of egg and sperm.

402
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.470
So they're so they're, so they're both making a generation,

403
00:26:55.471 --> 00:26:58.680
but then making the ability for that generation to make another generation.

404
00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:02.370
Oh my God, this is like, so it is. It's mirrors.

405
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.100
You're not only cradling like your child,

406
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:08.250
you're cradling like infinite future.

407
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.130
Homosapiens wow. Well that's the infinity. It's crazy that all that is there.

408
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.780
And you're not even a faint yet that the first thought or thought, I don't know.

409
00:27:18.781 --> 00:27:22.260
The first thing that this PR organism has been programmed to do is not, hey,

410
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:26.750
make a, make a person, make a brain, make a life. No, it's make more. Yeah.

411
00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:28.860
It's pretty gnarly. Yeah. You know, many,

412
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:33.450
many people believe that we exist just as a harbor for our germ cells until we

413
00:27:33.451 --> 00:27:37.080
can make new people like we're just their hosts in some sense.

414
00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:41.820
That's absolutely true. I mean, or as as was said a long time ago,

415
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.500
um, a chicken is an eggs way of making another egg.

416
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.490
Really? I've never heard that before.

417
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.640
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

418
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.670
<v 0>so I was in Michigan a couple of weeks and months ago and so I was in Michigan</v>

419
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:05.730
and I was kayaking on this river that has super sandy bottom and it's a pretty

420
00:28:07.151 --> 00:28:09.700
shallow, I don't know, it's like three or four feet deep.

421
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.620
And the cool thing was that, um,

422
00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.460
the salmon responding huge fish,

423
00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.780
they were like three to four feet. They were so thick around and,

424
00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:24.430
and there was so many of them that they would like Russel my kayak and I see

425
00:28:24.431 --> 00:28:29.431
something kind of in this one part of the river like by itself and I look and

426
00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.150
it's a fish.

427
00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:35.050
It's a salmon that's lying on the bottom of the um,

428
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.180
river and uh, I see like through the ripple, the water, um, some like pink.

429
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.820
So I turned the kayak around to go like look at it.

430
00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:46.480
And what I realize is the pink is not like flesh.

431
00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.320
The pink is like packed eggs.

432
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:55.690
The body was sliced open so you could see into the hollow and in the hollow were

433
00:28:55.691 --> 00:29:00.691
just like what felt like millions of these like bubble gum,

434
00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:02.590
pink drops of eggs.

435
00:29:02.591 --> 00:29:06.820
Like the entire body cavity was packed eggs.

436
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.730
And to think that parts of our body, male and female, by the way, because the,

437
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.130
the testes do this just little later, um,

438
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:19.000
in life to think that parts of our body are like that fish.

439
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:24.030
It felt like just pulling back the curtain and seeing something that I,

440
00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.630
I can never unsee.

441
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.033
Oh

442
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.023
<v 10>cool.</v>

443

One last thing before I go. Later in the series we're going to dig into sex ed.

450
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.180
And one of the things that comes up in every conversation you have about sex ed

451
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:32.200
is a book that somebody read to learn about the birds and the bees.

452
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.320
It might've been given to them or they found it like in their library book sale.

453
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:39.490
Um,

454
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.490
so we want to try and create an online sex ed library with as many of these

455
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:47.710
books as we can find for all ages.

456
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.070
So go to radiolab.org/sex ed books and tell us about a book you got as a kid and

457
00:30:55.121 --> 00:31:00.121
the reason you loved it or didn't and then we're going to add it to the chef and

458
00:31:00.821 --> 00:31:04.570
it's going to be great. Um, so that's it. That's our episode.

459
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.430
And see you next time. Bye.

460
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.410
