00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.890
Today on DNews, we’re gonna talk about hot
sex.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.030
Greetings people I tricked with the cold open,
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.720
Something odd is happening with central bearded
dragons in Australia.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.520
Suddenly there’s a lot more lady dragons
running around.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.170
And they’re bigger, bolder, and laying more
eggs.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.029
They’re also genetically identical to the
males.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.150
It turns out the sex of bearded dragons isn’t
necessarily determined by their chromosomes.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.449
It can also be determined by the temperature:
if an embryo with a male genetic makeup is

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.530
incubated at a certain temperature at a certain
stage of development, it’ll be born a fully

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.640
functioning female.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.520
This is actually surprisingly common: the
male to female ratios of many reptiles are

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.059
influenced by temperature, including most
turtles and all crocodilians.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.870
Even some fish have temperature dependent
sexual development.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.899
Usually for turtles, eggs incubated at lower
temperatures, say from 22-27 degrees celsius

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.450
all become males and eggs incubated at higher
temperatures over 30 degrees celsius all become

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.450
females.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.860
If the eggs are incubated at the sweet spot
of 28.5 celsius, the ratio will be 50/50.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.200
Crocodilian species, like the American alligator,
become female if the temperature is low or

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.539
high, and the males are spawned at the temperatures
in between.

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.909
Species like this don’t have heteromorphic
sex chromosomes like we do, temperature is

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.909
everything.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.939
How exactly temperature determines sex remains
a mystery.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.810
It appears to have an impact on aromatase,
an enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.490
Whether temperature directly affects aromatase,
the gene that makes it, or other proteins

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.369
that regulate it remains to be discovered.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.579
But for reptiles like the bearded dragon,
it’s a mix of both the chromosomes they

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.289
inherit and the temperature they are incubated
at.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.750
This may sound odd because you’re probably
used to thinking that two X chromosomes makes

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.369
a lady and an X and a Y chromosome make a
guy.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.109
Not so for the bearded dragon.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.700
First off instead of X and Y chromosomes they
have what are called Z and W chromosomes.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.219
If an unborn bearded dragon has a Z and a
W chromosome, no matter what the temperature,

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.599
it will always be female.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.049
But if it’s homogametic, if it has two Z
chromosomes, then it could be born male or

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.049
female.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.249
Of course, male, female, or male-female, they
all still get beards.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.209
Anyway double Z females are on the rise, and
the shift is cause for concern.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.099
If they outcompete the heterogametic females
because they’re more aggressive and lay

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.349
more eggs, it’ll cause a massive loss of
genetic diversity after just a couple generations.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.739
Then If temperatures continue to rise it may
lead to all female populations and if that

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.680
happens too fast life probably won’t find
a way.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.620
Just like a good party, a balanced male to
female ratio is crucial for the success of

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.620
most species.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.359
Basically if you want to be the mother of
dragons, we have to stop climate change.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.270
Man that climate change stuff is the worst.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.739
Mother Nature is one creative lady when it
comes to all the different ways sex can be

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.739
expressed.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.810
Like with flat worms and clownfish.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.810
It’s awesome.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:59.689
Check it out here.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:07.930
Is saving turtles enough motivation to take
action 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.709
on climate change?
