[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.320
CORY LEVY: So I will be
talking about teens today.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.620
Thanks for coming.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.350
Over the last month, we've
watched hundreds of thousands

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.830
of teenagers organize and
participate in massive rallies

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.180
across the country.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.580
They've done this in
the face of both pain

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.790
and serious frustration, that
adults have utterly failed them

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.770
on something very, very basic.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.790
That's keeping schools safe.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.520
Adults who have been unable
to achieve common sense,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.490
gun control following mass
shooting after mass shooting,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.820
are now placing their hands
in this younger generation.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.250
But isn't this like
the same generation

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.630
that made eating Tide
Pods a viral sensation

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.950
in recent weeks?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.960
Like, how much do
you really understand

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.170
today's young people, and
how much do you even care?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.320
For most old people, the
answer is very little.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.740
They don't care,
but you should care.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.340
This is the generation that
will create massive change

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.330
in the world over
the next 50 years.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.420
And for us to be able to
teach and influence them

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420
as they begin to
make those changes,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.730
it's super important
that we understand them.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.580
So if you'll allow
me to be your guide,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.340
I'd like to tell you a little
bit about today's teenager,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.110
but first, a little
bit about me.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.190
My name is Corey Levy.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.040
I'm in my mid-20's,
and although I'll

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.130
be using the word we while
I present this information,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.280
teams consider me a little old.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.590
So I've worked years to stay
on top of this generation.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.680
As Jesse mentioned, I started
a company called After School

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.990
while I was a teenager,
while I was 19.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560
After School is one of the
largest teenage social networks

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.970
in the US, millions of users who
are currently in high school.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.430
I'm also on the board
of Dosomething.org

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.680
which is a nonprofit, a
digital platform powering

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.139
social change for nearly
six million young people,

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.930
and today, I'm going
to help you understand

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.620
this generation a bit better.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.630
So over the last few weeks, I've
been interviewing teenagers,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.970
and with the help from
teens across the country,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.090
I've made a list of ten
things that you probably

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.889
don't understand
today about teenagers.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.430
So we'll get started.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.690
The first point is we're
heavily addicted to our phones,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.367
but we don't know our phone
numbers, which the first part,

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:20.450
you probably already know.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.290
The second part was a
little surprising to me,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.550
and how is this possible?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.010
Obviously, you know like
teens grew up with iPhones

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.260
and Androids with smartphones.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.040
They're more reliant on
them than ever before,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.340
but teenagers, they care
more about like user names.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.690
What's their Snapchat name?

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.199
What's their Instagram handle?

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.990
They don't really care
about phone numbers.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.921
When they meet new people
for the first time,

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:45.920
they're exchanging these
handles, not like, hey,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.711
what's your number?

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.080
It's like, hey,
add me on Snapchat,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.070
or follow me on Instagram.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.100
They don't use iMessage or
SMS, because Mom and Dad

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.320
can have access to that.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.540
They're texting on
Snapchat and Instagram DM,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.110
and they've probably never
used this thing the way

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.400
it was invented, which is
they've probably never used

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.890
the actual phone.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.210
They've never used
an alarm clock.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.447
They just use their phone
for that, and doorbells,

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.530
they're like, what's that?

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.370
They're totally
unnecessary, and here's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.940
how like two teenagers
that I interviewed

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.340
described their connections
to their phones.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.730
Teenagers are digital natives.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.630
They don't live in a
mobile-friendly world.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.256
They're a mobile-only
generation.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.130
Another person who is
a senior in high school

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.020
said, parents just
don't understand

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.750
why we move from thing
to thing so quickly.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.852
It's not that we have
a short attention span.

00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:46.310
It's our generation's ability
to filter through information

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.750
more quickly, because we just
get bombarded with it so much.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.640
This is point number two.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.500
Facebook is lame.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.690
We love streaks.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.840
Teens think Facebook is
for their grandparents.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.710
It's old, clunky, and
invasive, and in fact, it's

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.950
one of the reasons that
we developed our app,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.100
After School, which helps
teens connect and share

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.410
with other students
at their high school.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.870
Millions of users, we have
like a matching feature

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.167
that's connected over--

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.750
that's been used
over a billion times,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.260
with a B. We just like
released a compliment

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.080
feature in the last 24 hours,
like hundreds of thousands

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.170
of teenagers have complemented
each other with that.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.520
And what we've seen with After
School is that teens use us,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.470
because we're like a
teen-only social network

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.310
to come to use the product to
post things that they wouldn't

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.160
post on Facebook or
Twitter or Instagram,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.070
because there is an
anonymous feature to it.

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.100
We also connect teenagers
with Crisis Text Line

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.110
when they are in need of help.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.120
Crisis Text Line
is a teen hotline

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.114
that you can text 741741.

00:04:57.114 --> 00:04:58.530
Instead of like
calling a hotline,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.570
you can text with a
trained crisis counselor.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.600
We've connect over 100,000
teenagers to Crisis Text

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.770
Line via our app,
but probably one

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.120
of the most popular ways that
teens communicate is snaps.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.550
Raise your hand if you
know what a streak is,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.280
about half the audience.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.972
Teens are like obsessed
with Snapstreaks,

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:22.680
and a little bit of
what a Snapstreak is,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.480
it's when you send direct
snaps back and forth

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.700
for consecutive days.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.390
So if me and you snapped
each other today, tomorrow,

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.189
and the next day, we would have
had a three day Snapstreak.

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:35.230
And the longer you go
without breaking the chain,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.250
the longer your streak is.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.040
And teenagers today have
like streaks that have lasted

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.060
not just weeks or
months but years.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.640
Snap rewards, these longer
streaks like special emojis.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.360
So if you get 100 streak,
you get the little 100 emoji

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.230
or like a mountain emoji for
like an extremely, extremely

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.140
long streak.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.620
And there's nothing more
devastating to a teenager

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.330
than like losing that streak.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.000
When they go off to camp
for like a week or a month,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
they'll give their Snap
password to a friend,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.290
just so they can keep
their streaks going.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.300
Here's how a 16-year-old
from Brooklyn put it.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.550
Streaks are a big part
of social acceptance.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.934
Having more streaks makes
you feel way more popular.

00:06:22.934 --> 00:06:24.850
He added, I think streaks
are a way of showing

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.260
how many people you talk to.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.280
It's like a score.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.230
If you see your friends
have a lot of streaks,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.900
you're like, whoa, that guy
or girl knows a lot of people.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.860
It shows her social status to
see how many streaks they have.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.020
So Snapstreaks is something
that is incredibly

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.470
popular amongst teenagers,
and teens also love Instagram,

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.960
and Instagram Live is
particularly popular.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.990
This allows them to connect
with their followers

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.940
and their audience in real time.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.080
And another like important
trend that's popped up

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.940
is something called a finsta.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.370
Raise your hand if you've
heard of a finsta, one,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.945
two people in the audience.

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.420
A finsta stands for
a fake Instagram.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.720
So teenagers will have
two Instagrams set up,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.390
one is their main
Instagram, and that's

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.580
where their parents, their
siblings, their cousins,

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.410
their friends will follow them.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.970
And then they have
a second Instagram

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.490
called a finsta which
stands for fake Instagram.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.780
And that's where they just
have their like top friends,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.750
no parents, no teachers, no
cousins that follow them.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.897
A 17-year-old student I talked
to described her finsta.

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.980
So she goes, on my finsta,
it's the good, the bad,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.820
and the ugly.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.900
It's the more multifaceted
version of me.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.450
And many teens are aware
that like potential employers

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:44.000
and colleges will have access
to their main Instagram,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.680
so they create this second
Instagram called a finsta

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.000
to keep some of the
information private.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.120
A 16-year-old I interviewed
said, people in my IG

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.190
are always doing Instagram
Lives, usually for attention.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.290
Something I do unconsciously
is pull out Snapchat any time

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.510
anything interesting is
happening, especially

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.830
around New York City.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.070
A majority of my videos on my
phone are in Snap memories.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.680
Anytime I take a video,
it's with Snap for sure,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.430
just because it's easy to share.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.670
So teens today aren't using the
default camera on their phones.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.219
They aren't using the default
Apple or Google camera

00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:20.510
when they want to take a photo.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.840
They're going to
Snapchat, taking a photo.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.030
And then saving it, and
then debating whether or not

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.620
to send it out which was
which was surprising to me.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.030
Point number three, we're
modern-day Shakespeares.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.640
So teenagers are creating new
language every single day,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.900
and we usually start
copying them eventually.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.700
So I want to share
like some examples

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.480
of what teens are saying today.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.850
Amosc is an acronym kids
are using to basically

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.160
just means Add Me On Snapchat.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.710
Bad means good, surprising.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.340
Bruh means bro.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.000
Cringe is when something
is like gross or awkward

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.470
or uncomfortable.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:03.760
Curve, or swerve sometimes,
is to reject someone.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.100
Don't at me is like
don't call me out

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.920
or don't disagree with me.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.810
Finna is like I'm
fixing to or going to.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.080
Finsta, which I just
described, is a fake Instagram.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.140
Goat, acronym that stands
for Greatest Of All Time.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.460
Gucci, not the
brand, it means good.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.740
I'm weak or dead is
like that's so funny.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:24.930
That's hilarious.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.890
Kms is like the new fml.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:31.430
Savage is bold or strong.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.550
Low key, you want to
say something low key,

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.200
it's like secretive.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.180
And high key, that means
it's not secretive,

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.090
and it's something that
everyone should know.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:42.400
Plug, someone that can
provide them with something.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.220
Shipped, it's not like
shipping a product

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.960
but more like a relationship,
like Alex and Sierra should

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.430
be shipped-off
together means they

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.320
should be in a relationship.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.560
Straight fire is
like good or trendy.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.150
To describe your
friend group, they're

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:02.010
using both squad and fam,
and to be bitter is salty.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.060
Straight fire is
like that's also

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.520
another term they use
for good or trendy,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.382
and then sus is a term
they're using for something

00:10:09.382 --> 00:10:10.340
that's like suspicious.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.680
So you might hear
a news reporter

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.925
in a few months saying like
what Facebook did was so sus.

00:10:17.925 --> 00:10:20.550
That's a little example.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:25.240
So this won't be on the midterm,
but you should definitely

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.480
know what teens, the
words that they're saying,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:33.320
but like teens are
moving beyond words.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.900
They've made popular an array of
new communication techniques--

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.410
emojis, memes, gifs-- to
express their emotions quickly.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:44.680
If you look at any
teen's text conversation,

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.620
you will immediately notice the
difference with adults' texts.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:54.760
Teens use like tons of
emojis, gifs, memes, and this

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.110
makes complete sense.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.600
They're use to like a
flood of information,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.400
and have become
like really, really

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.849
good at processing it quickly
and conveying ideas quickly.

00:11:02.849 --> 00:11:04.390
And it's much more
efficient for them

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:08.290
to use like an emoji or a
gif and like four or 10 words

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:13.550
to describe what they
want to communicate.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.430
Teens, they don't get why
you are so close-minded.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.680
Teens think that adults
are close-minded when

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.170
it comes to things
like same-sex marriage,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.147
different sexual orientation,
mixed-race dating.

00:11:26.147 --> 00:11:27.730
And this makes sense
when you consider

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.390
they're a part of like the most
racially-diverse generation

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.320
in America.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.450
48% of them are non-white.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.610
81% of them have friends
that are a different race,

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:44.050
and 35% of them have dated
a different race as well.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.560
One teen put it, most
kids like myself,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.310
and especially ones
in urban environments,

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.140
care about the
rights of themselves

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.180
but also people that
don't look like them

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.879
or share similar attributes.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.420
And that's the reason
why we actually

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.670
go out and protest at
city hall, because it's

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.540
hard for adults who are stuck
in their ways to see when change

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:03.400
is necessary.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.400
This one may or may not
be surprising to you,

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.300
but gamers are
heroes, not geeks.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.240
Teens still love like their
movie stars, musicians,

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.970
athletes, et cetera, but
who can be a celebrity

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.070
has changed quite some time.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.460
They idolize vloggers
like Jake Paul

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.240
who has nearly 15 million
YouTube subscribers

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.590
and whose videos are being
viewed billions of times

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.610
a month.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.560
I was lucky enough to be
one of his first investors

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.030
and his management company,
when he was 17 years old.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.970
They follow entrepreneurs, like
Elon Musk and Gary Vaynerchuk

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.390
and Peter Thiel and
Mark Cuban and Tim Cook.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.750
And perhaps, like the
most interesting thing,

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.260
they've made esports
figures their heroes.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.100
Esport stadiums are being built
across the country in Vegas

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.200
and Houston and Dallas,
and pro video game players

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.760
have these massive
followings, like

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.860
major corporate sponsorships.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.810
And they compete in
these huge arenas

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.440
and make way more money
than like regular athletes.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.600
There's a 26-year-old
named Ninja.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.780
Raise your hand if
you've heard of Ninja.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.320
Two people has heard of Ninja.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.540
He's the most popular
gamer on Twitch

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.200
and earns more than half
a million dollars a month

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.200
just by playing video games.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.390
Fortnite is a
massive game that's

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.570
superpopular amongst teenagers.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.840
Ninja just played Fortnite in
front of 600,000 people viewing

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.190
it at the same time.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.120
Drake, the rapper, came
on and played with him.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.410
JuJu Smith-Schuster, a
Steelers wide receiver,

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.430
came on and played with him.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.750
This is something that is just
at the very, very beginning

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.626
and continuing to blow up.

00:13:49.626 --> 00:13:52.000
One team put it, while athletes
and movie stars are still

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.720
famous the idolization of
entrepreneurs, like Gary,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.940
and YouTube vloggers and
influencers has completely

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.860
changed the perception.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.280
The fact that an entrepreneur
came out with a shoe

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.490
and sold it out to kids
in seconds is unreal.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.430
High schoolers are paying more
and more attention to esports

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.390
and so is the world.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.180
For example, Fortnite or Ninja,
the best player in the world,

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.125
played with Drake
JuJu Smith-Schuster

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:17.920
and then a rapper, Travis
Scott, as I mentioned earlier,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.200
had over 600,000 people
viewing it at the same time.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.240
Fashion is still really big
amongst today's young people.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.240
Streetwear reigns supreme.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.840
Teens today differentiate
themselves in many ways.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.450
When it comes to fashion,
teens increasingly

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.570
choose like streetwear
brands, like Supreme and Vans,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.630
over mainstream
brands, like Nike.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.630
Supreme has this particular
kind of outsider appeal

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.910
for teenagers, even though
the brand launched in 1994,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.210
in New York City, as a
skateboarding and clothing

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.100
company.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.850
It caters to the skate
and hip hop cultures,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.270
and to just youth
cultures in general,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.890
and it's become an absolute
obsession for teenagers.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.360
When teens hear about
a new shoe or product

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.870
launch on Reddit or other
social media, hundreds of teens

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.720
will line up in New York to get
their hands on their product

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.980
before it sells out.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.540
And a lot of teens
are entrepreneurs.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.070
They'll buy it
and then immediate

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:19.370
flip it for extreme
markups, and big finance

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.990
is starting to pay
attention to this.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.220
The Carlyle Group
invested in Supreme

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.430
and valued the company at
over a billion dollars.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.500
We have no interest in
working at big companies.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.420
So most teens have
very little interest

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.940
in working for
major corporations,

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.230
even tech ones, like
Amazon and Facebook.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.730
They've seen their
parents and older siblings

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.760
struggle in the workforce
and become unhappy,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.400
despite these high paying jobs.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.190
Teens today are more
entrepreneurial than older

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.310
generations and have less
patience for bureaucratic work

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.280
environments and crave
more independence.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.310
72% of them said they wanted to
start a business one day, which

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:04.910
is pretty fascinating.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:08.780
Number nine, you've left us
with a big mess to clean up.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.240
Teens have grown
up watching reports

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.210
of a broken political
system, devastating climate

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:17.624
change, mass shootings at
schools, homegrown terrorism,

00:16:17.624 --> 00:16:18.290
and ongoing war.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.340
It's no surprise that like
68% of this generation

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.300
feel the US is headed
in the wrong direction,

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.410
and 44% are worried about the
way that things are going.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.590
This was more than any other
generation interviewed.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:36.150
And lastly, teens think that
we'll have a bigger impact

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.640
than you think.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.160
It's easy for adults to
think that teens today

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.780
are pretty reckless.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.420
Much of what we read
or hear in the media

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.210
focuses on the
negatives, like teens

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.130
trying to pull off
crazy stunts on YouTube,

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:51.530
which I'm sure you
have seen, or teens

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.290
infatuation with the JUUL.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.650
Raise your hand if you've heard
of the JUUL, one person again.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.340
The JUUL is a sleek e-cigarette
that can be used indoors

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.850
without attracting attention.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.050
And don't get me wrong,
like the massive popularity

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.410
of this JUUL of e-cigarettes
is something that we

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.089
should be concerned about.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.000
But the JUUL is something
that is massively

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.260
popular amongst teenagers,
but these types of behaviors

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.680
are really not much
different than what we

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.569
were like in prior generations.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.450
And one teen described it
as just like the generations

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.870
before them, teens will always
want to rebel against the norm.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.787
We're not worse.

00:17:30.787 --> 00:17:32.870
It's just that you see it
more, because everything

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.850
is being recorded.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.090
So focusing on these
negatives makes us lose

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.920
sight of the bigger picture.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.730
What thousands of hours of
observing teens has shown me,

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.180
what many studies show,
is that today's teens,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.210
they have a strong work
ethic and balance-forward

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.370
thinking with old-school,
traditional values.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.490
So when adults think
about this new generation,

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.990
we should be open-minded.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:03.770
Teens are multifaceted, and it's
going to take some time for us

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.360
to like stick with a name
for this next generation.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.760
But when I asked
teenagers, like,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.070
tell me if you can
name your generation.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.030
What would you name it?

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:12.863
Here were some of the
responses that I got--

00:18:12.863 --> 00:18:17.990
The Viral Generation, The
Founders, iGeneration,

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.380
Digital Natives, Gen Mobile,
Generation Next, The Connected

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:23.480
Generation, et cetera.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.694
So these were some of the names.

00:18:25.694 --> 00:18:27.110
These are some of
the names that I

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.879
got when I asked a bunch of
teenagers, how would you--

00:18:29.879 --> 00:18:32.420
if you could name it, name your
generation, what would it be?

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.510
But regardless of
what they're called,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.400
I think one thing
is really clear,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.340
and that is that we
shouldn't underestimate

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.890
today's teenagers.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.330
Yes, they use phones
in different ways

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.940
that we probably would
have never imagined.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.000
They idolize these esports
stars that we've never heard of,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.401
and they can be pretty quirky.

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:53.900
But they're already showing us
that they're going to step up

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:58.640
and tackle like major challenges
in ways that other generations

00:18:58.640 --> 00:18:59.570
haven't.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.130
Last weekend, like
March for Our Lives,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.120
was one example that was
organized by teenagers.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.170
It brought over 800,000
people to Washington DC

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.500
and countless more to
hundreds of sister marches

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.700
across the country.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:19.430
This is more than the Inaugural
Women's March, the Million Man

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:24.770
March, and what else,
the March on Washington

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.540
for Jobs and Freedom.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.020
800,000 was the
biggest march ever.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.160
And today's teens, they have
energy, they have passion,

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.080
and they have a
no-nonsense attitude

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.420
about fixing the problems
that they've inherited.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.680
And if what they've
accomplished in the last month

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.550
is any kind of
indication, we old people

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.500
are in pretty good hands.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.230
So thank you for listening
to these ten points.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.160
Hopefully, you learned
a little something today

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.140
in the 20 or 30 minutes
of time that I had,

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.510
and I'm happy to
answer any questions

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.090
that you have on today's
generation of teenagers.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.090
AUDIENCE: So I know
that online bullying

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.340
is a uniquely bad problem
for this generation,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.840
and I was curious what
your social network is

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.105
doing to mitigate that problem.

00:20:20.105 --> 00:20:20.730
CORY LEVY: Yes.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.190
So online bullying is a
very, very serious problem

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:27.410
for pretty much any
big social network.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.070
One of the things that we
do is proactive moderation.

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:34.100
So most social networks
do reactive moderation.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.690
When someone posts a message
to Twitter or Facebook,

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.220
it gets seen by everyone.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.290
If it is a negative
message, it may

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.610
get taken down after the fact.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.900
With After School, we
do product moderation.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.890
So when someone
writes a message,

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.350
it has to get seen by
moderation in order for it

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.270
to get seen by others.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:58.370
So that's one of the steps
that we take in After School,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:00.950
and we hope that other social
networks will follow and just

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:06.020
increase moderation and yeah.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:07.180
What's up in the back?

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.170
AUDIENCE: So streaks
definitely seems

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.080
like a pretty ingenious
gamification to encourage

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000
more usage and so forth.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.460
Any other examples of those
sorts of gamification elements,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.690
whether in your social network
or others that you've seen?

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.390
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so in
other social networks,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:27.242
obviously, likes is something
that teens care a lot about.

00:21:27.242 --> 00:21:28.700
One of the things
that I've noticed

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.490
is that when a teenager
posts something on Instagram,

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.330
they will wait for like
five or ten minutes,

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.020
and if it doesn't get some
threshold number of likes,

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.690
they'll delete the post.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:44.730
So likes is something that is
incredibly important to them,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:50.210
and Snapstreaks is probably the
best example of gamification

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.390
that I've seen over the last
several years of following

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:54.770
this generation.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.910
If Snap didn't have Snapstreaks,
I think teens would use it

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.620
way, way, way less.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.330
And best friends, they
have another thing

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:03.470
called best friends.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.750
I don't know if y'all know
what Snap best friends are,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:11.766
but if you snap someone a bunch,
they'll have a little emoji

00:22:11.766 --> 00:22:12.890
next to that person's name.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.492
And each emoji may mean that
y'all are each best friends

00:22:15.492 --> 00:22:17.700
with each other, one of you
is best-- if it's a wink,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.991
it's one of you its best
friends with the other person,

00:22:19.991 --> 00:22:22.220
but the other person's
not best friends with you.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.670
So Snap's probably done the
best job of gamification,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.720
and those are two
examples of that.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.594
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that 70% of teens

00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:33.010
want to have their own business,
if I heard you correctly.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:33.676
CORY LEVY: Yeah.

00:22:33.676 --> 00:22:36.080
AUDIENCE: I wonder
if this is related,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.150
what do they think
of colleges, college

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.040
debt and nontraditional
[INAUDIBLE] things.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.240
Do they also think
differently than like people

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.050
did in the past?

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:43.925
CORY LEVY: I'm sorry.

00:22:43.925 --> 00:22:45.170
Could you speak up?

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:47.420
AUDIENCE: So I heard recently
that so many people have

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.878
college debt that
there's basically

00:22:48.878 --> 00:22:52.820
there's a prognosis of people
who are freshmen this year,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.897
40% will default on
student loans eventually.

00:22:54.897 --> 00:22:57.480
So I wonder if there's also some
very interesting ideas, stuff

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.832
like how to not end
up being in debt.

00:22:59.832 --> 00:23:01.790
Maybe they do something
different for a college

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:02.610
education.

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.200
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so I think
that most teens are still

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.050
following that traditional
path of going to high school,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:12.320
graduating, going to
college, incurring this debt.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.820
And then quickly
realizing when they

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.920
graduate that they
weren't trained properly

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.180
to enter the workforce.

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.840
So I don't think
we're there yet.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.420
I hope one day that
we do get there,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.800
where teens realize that
paying $200,000 over the course

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.920
of four years for
random X degree

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.190
may not mean that they're going
to get a high-paying job to pay

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.600
that off.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.000
So I think teens, they care
so much about themselves

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.740
and their friends
that they don't really

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:48.120
know much about what that
means, what college means

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.700
and what going in debt
means, so yeah, not yet.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.200
AUDIENCE: Also, do
you think there's

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.410
a big difference between high
schoolers and middle schoolers?

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.510
They use social media
in a similar way today?

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.551
CORY LEVY: So high schoolers
and middle schoolers

00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:03.710
are completely different.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:06.530
Some parents don't let
their middle schoolers

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.340
get Instagram or Snapchat
until they reach a certain age.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.775
Some of the middle schoolers,
they're using Musical.ly.

00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:17.150
They're starting their own
slime businesses on Instagram,

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.150
where they make
slime and sell it.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:22.490
Middle schoolers,
I've seen like a bunch

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.770
of entrepreneurial
characteristics,

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:26.690
but I don't know
them super well.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.990
But yeah, I do see
pretty big differences

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:32.150
from middle school, high
school, and college,

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:34.460
in terms of network use.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:36.530
AUDIENCE: I have heard
about the detachment

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.230
from tech overall is the trend.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.320
Would you say that it's
not a trend for teenagers

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.520
but for older generation?

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.540
CORY LEVY: What is the trend?

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.165
AUDIENCE: A detachment
from technology.

00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:48.000
CORY LEVY: Oh, detachment
from technology.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.650
So I think teens, they're
very self-aware that they're

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.980
addicted to their phones.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.490
If you go to a high school
and watch people during lunch,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.190
like everyone will be like this.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.640
Yesterday, we were with
a group of 80 teenagers,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.490
and we were looking
at their Snap scores.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.950
Snap score means when I send
one Snap message, I get a point.

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.190
When I receive a Snap message,
I get an additional point.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.650
One teenager, and this was
kind of like the average,

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:20.150
had over 600,000
points, which means

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.204
the average was like she had
her Snapchat for a year or two

00:25:23.204 --> 00:25:24.370
or three or whatever it was.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.230
She was sending 14 snaps
an hour, 24 hours a day.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:32.630
So I think teens are very
self-aware that they're

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.520
addicted to their phones,
but they don't really care.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.630
I think when you go to
college, that's maybe

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:40.130
when you start to
figure out, how

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.440
do I manage my time
differently, and how can I

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.050
be more productive?

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:51.479
But today's teenagers are pretty
much like this all of the time.

00:25:51.479 --> 00:25:53.770
AUDIENCE: What do you think
teenagers' perception of VR

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:54.635
is today?

00:25:54.635 --> 00:25:56.260
CORY LEVY: Teenagers'
perception of VR?

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.490
I think some of the
longer tail of teenagers

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:04.300
are super interested
in it, and I

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.110
think they'll be like the early
adopters to the technology.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.470
But the devices are expensive,
so it's kind of tough for them

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.600
to get their hands on it.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.810
But yeah, I think the
younger generations generally

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.050
set those trends,
and I think VR will

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.300
be really big amongst them.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.820
I think there's a question
to the right of you.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.560
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know a bit
more about the After School app

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.160
and how you think you won over
their trust to post things

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.250
like you showed us.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.390
And also like how you
convince them that it's worth

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:38.707
their time to spend on the app.

00:26:38.707 --> 00:26:40.290
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so
the first question

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.610
on how we kind of
win over their trust.

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.967
I think we built a
product for teenagers.

00:26:45.967 --> 00:26:47.050
Most people don't do that.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:50.200
Most people just build
a product for everyone,

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:54.000
and so our product was
built like just for them.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.670
So they know when they
download the app that there's

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.170
a verification process.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.030
They need to get past
a few number of things

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:03.400
to prove that they're a
teenager and that they

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.410
attend that high school.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.370
So there's a level of
safety that they feel.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.870
Like, when I'm
joining this network,

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.890
I had to jump through all these
hoops to prove I was a student,

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.170
and so I think that
they like that.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.000
One high schooler was
telling me that they

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.820
posted some photo
on Facebook, and it

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.260
was like to impress a girl.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.680
And the grandmother commented,
oh my god, you're so cute,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.380
and that was like the last
time he used Facebook.

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.700
So I think people, teenagers,
are attracted to After School,

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.020
because it's just for them.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.103
There are no grandparents.

00:27:33.103 --> 00:27:35.285
There are no teachers
on the platform,

00:27:35.285 --> 00:27:38.480
and it's a place where they
can just feel comfortable.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.790
So yeah.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:42.324
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the question
is how did you convince them

00:27:42.324 --> 00:27:43.240
it's worth their time?

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.880
Like, they have a bunch of other
stuff going on in high school.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.710
CORY LEVY: Yeah.

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.780
That's a great question.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.905
How do we convince them
that it's worth their time?

00:27:49.905 --> 00:27:54.920
I don't have a perfect
answer to that question.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.400
Our app's grown 100%
through word of mouth.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.330
I think there's probably like
a really big demand needed

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.930
for teenagers to
be in this place

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.670
where it's just them
and their friends.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.310
We all had that, or at least I
had that when I was growing up.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.240
I had Facebook to go to
when I was in high school,

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.110
and there were no teachers
or parents on Facebook.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:16.550
It was just me and my
high school buddies.

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.390
So I think there is a big
demand to create a space where

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:22.450
it's just them
and their friends,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.420
and Snapchat kind of helps
a little bit with that.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.580
Although, parents are
joining Snap a lot right now.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.320
But yeah, so I think just
creating that space just

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.010
for them.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just
had another question.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.781
Did they say anything
about when they

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:39.220
think Snapchat is going to die
out or Instagram is going to?

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.870
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so I think
there is this kind of circle

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.440
that we see.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.410
Where Facebook, they started
with the college audience.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:50.091
Their audience kind
of grew up, and then

00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:52.090
they started to build for
like a wider audience,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.250
and then, they neglected
their original audience.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.310
And neglected young
people, as they

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.230
wanted to just gain
more users and get

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.702
bigger numbers for investors
and their business.

00:29:03.702 --> 00:29:06.160
So I think we're starting to
see a little bit of that right

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.020
now with Instagram
and Snapchat, where

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.520
their parents and
their grandparents

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.530
are starting to join
those platforms.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:16.150
That will drive the teens
out something different.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.180
Teens response to Instagram was,
well great, if my grandparents

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.620
and parents are
on this, I'm just

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.869
going to create this second
Instagram that they're not

00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:24.230
going to know about.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:28.090
With Snapchat, it's a
little bit harder to do,

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.510
but with Snap's new update, if
y'all are familiar with that,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.900
that's like lowered the
engagement, I imagine,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.190
massively amongst teenagers.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.510
And the ones that I
talked to are like, yeah,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.610
with the new update, I
don't use Discover anymore.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.200
I don't-- they're on it less.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.410
So I'm not sure that was
the best update for Snapchat

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:46.380
with respect to teenagers.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.600
AUDIENCE: So how do you prevent
the parents or grandparents

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.134
to come to After School?

00:29:51.134 --> 00:29:53.050
CORY LEVY: So how do we
prevent the old people

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:55.720
from infiltrating our network?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.370
Basically, it's a
verification process.

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.730
So when you log
into the app, you

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:04.390
show us you're school ID
or verify in a certain way.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.120
And that's similar to how
Facebook, when they started,

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.644
you had to verify with
your dot edu address

00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:12.310
to prove that you are
a college student.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:16.090
We do things similar.

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:19.660
AUDIENCE: So compared with this,
I feel that Google is so old.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.460
Do any of you--

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:25.134
how many usage of your
audience actually use Google?

00:30:25.134 --> 00:30:26.800
CORY LEVY: How many
actually use Google?

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.260
Well, they love Google,
because it helps them

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:35.440
with their homework, but
yeah, its the default web

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.490
browser for them.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.344
So I think they're using
it from just probably how--

00:30:40.344 --> 00:30:42.260
or at least how I used
it in high school which

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.482
was like if I want to know
anything, go to Google.

00:30:45.482 --> 00:30:46.690
It helps me with my homework.

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.232
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:47.232 --> 00:30:49.231
CORY LEVY: And that's
probably, I would imagine,

00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:50.960
what they attribute
Google to the most

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.820
is like the thing that
helps me with my homework.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:57.740
AUDIENCE: What's the one thing
that you believe about teens

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.009
that nobody else believes?

00:30:59.009 --> 00:31:00.550
CORY LEVY: That
nobody else believes?

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.180
Well, I think teenagers--

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.950
I think adults think
teens are rebels,

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:11.130
and I think that they're too
addicted to their phones.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:15.739
They're going to mess up
the whole next generation,

00:31:15.739 --> 00:31:16.780
and I disagree with that.

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.250
I think that today's teenagers
are more capable than ever

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.430
to make change, and
we're seeing examples

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:29.890
of that with this March for
Our Lives demonstration.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.960
Just to say that like
a few teenagers planned

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.810
this massive rally, you
would have never thought

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.240
that was possible five
years ago or ten years ago.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.280
But with social media, with
Twitter, with Facebook,

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:43.120
with Instagram, et
cetera, you're able to--

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.510
one kid in a school is able
to make this massive change.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:49.236
So I think this is like the
first really big example

00:31:49.236 --> 00:31:50.860
of this, but we're
going to see so much

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:55.640
more of this in the days,
weeks, and years to come.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.570
So and I imagine
if you interviewed

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.320
a bunch of old people,
they'd be like, no,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.200
they're definitely
not, but that's

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.090
one thing I disagree with.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.250
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you could speak more

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.830
to like the method of
collecting this information,

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.160
and if you have any
tips that you've

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.200
learned from methods that
worked well versus others that

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.889
might have been misleading.

00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:21.180
CORY LEVY: To collect this
information about teenagers?

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:21.520
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.485
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so
that's a great question.

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.780
Teenagers have
different personas.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.300
They're around their friends,
it's one way they act.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.340
When they're around adults,
they act incredibly different.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:40.000
So it's really challenging
to get real, true information

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.140
about teenagers.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.300
So a couple of ways we
do it is, one, we luckily

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.900
have this app that millions of
teenagers are communicating on.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.360
So we're able to pick
up trends in language

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.779
that they're using just from
the posts that they write.

00:32:52.779 --> 00:32:54.820
Additionally, we have like
a bunch of ambassadors

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.320
across America, and we
ask them to help us.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.150
Hey, text this to your friend.

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.820
Text these questions
to your friends.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.280
Take a screen shot
of the people you

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.860
follow, the people you
subscribe to on YouTube,

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.020
so we can see like who
the big vloggers are.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.890
So it's really tough.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.640
Sometimes, we'll get adult
answers from teenagers,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.310
and they'll be like
a capital letter.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:25.350
They'll speak very formally, and
then other times, we'll get--

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:28.720
let's see.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.490
I think I maybe put--

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.670
well, I guess I capitalized
most of the things,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.800
but like the way that
kids are replying to me.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.570
You could tell it was like
they're doing this like they're

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:38.778
texting one of their friends.

00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:42.190
It's like totally incorrect
grammar, misspellings

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.829
everywhere.

00:33:42.829 --> 00:33:45.370
And that's kind of one of the
indications of like, all right,

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.320
this person is being
really real versus

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.530
if they were typing like
real professionally,

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.195
but yeah, it's hard.

00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:54.250
It's really, really hard.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.386
People are biased,
but yeah, in short,

00:33:56.386 --> 00:33:57.760
a couple of things
that we do is,

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.830
one, we use our own
platform, and two,

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:01.390
we have a group of
teen ambassadors

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.590
that will go and ask
the questions for us.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.830
So it's a teenager
talking to a teen,

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.580
not an old person
talking to a teen.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.964
AUDIENCE: So one question,
what happens after graduation

00:34:10.964 --> 00:34:12.130
to the After School account?

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:13.780
CORY LEVY: For After School,
what happens after graduation

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.950
is they're kicked out.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:16.699
Eventually, we'll build
a college product,

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:21.239
but to keep the network
just high schoolers,

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.280
we have to kick them out.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.440
So we've kicked out
a million plus users.

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.903
One last question.

00:34:26.903 --> 00:34:29.218
AUDIENCE: Do you
see-- so you said

00:34:29.218 --> 00:34:31.070
that there was some
entrepreneurial spirit

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.413
among the teenagers, some
of the selling slimes.

00:34:33.413 --> 00:34:35.868
That's probably why my
daughter is learning to smile

00:34:35.868 --> 00:34:38.323
and is only eight years old.

00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:42.742
Did you see any promising
entrepreneurial spirit

00:34:42.742 --> 00:34:46.179
like some ideas a teenager--

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.598
CORY LEVY: Yeah, so
her question was,

00:34:48.598 --> 00:34:50.139
she has an 8-year-old
daughter that's

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:51.810
making slime and selling it.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:55.989
And is this generation-- do I
see any ideas from teenagers

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.195
that are trying to make change?

00:34:58.195 --> 00:34:59.542
And I see it every day.

00:34:59.542 --> 00:35:00.250
It's really cool.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.830
There's one 18-year-old
that I'm working

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.435
with that's trying to make
vegan chicken nuggets to make

00:35:07.435 --> 00:35:08.500
us all be vegetarians.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.480
And trying to build
like a teen brand

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:14.840
and make being a
vegetarian cool.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:18.280
And yeah, so that's just one
example of a teenager being

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.720
like this is a real problem.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.380
And he's taking matters
into his own hands

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:30.040
and trying to create the vegan
version of McDonald's, and I've

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.170
seen that dozens of times.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.490
So it's inspiring.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.850
Thank you all for listening,
and hopefully, you're

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.620
a little bit more knowledge
on today's teenager.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.570
