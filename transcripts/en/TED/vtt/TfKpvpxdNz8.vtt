00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:17.486
Alright, I want to tell you how I got
my superpowers through fatherhood.

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.807
I was working a job I hated, OK?

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.713
And I don't know if anyone here
ever worked a job they hated.

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.840
Has anyone here
ever worked a job they hated?

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:26.865
(Laughter)

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:28.585
OK, good, because I'm not alone

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.752
and I have something to confess;
I don't want you guys to judge me.

00:00:31.776 --> 00:00:34.133
This feels like a safe space,
is it a safe space?

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:35.315
Audience: Yes.

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.505
Glen Henry: OK, I was working
the job I hated,

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:39.451
my manager and I were not getting along.

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:42.143
I was sitting in my car,
looking in the rearview mirror,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.712
trying to figure out
which friend I could call

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:46.935
to call in a bomb threat,

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.022
so I didn't have to go
back in the building.

00:00:49.046 --> 00:00:50.047
(Laughter)

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:53.038
OK, this was having
a lot of issues for me,

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:54.886
I was having a lot of issues at my job

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.672
and I'd come home every day from work

00:00:56.696 --> 00:00:59.211
and my wife would ask me
the same question.

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:00.768
And when you hate your job,

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:03.299
this is the worst question
anyone could ask you.

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:06.283
She'd say, "Hey babe, how was your day?"

00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:08.045
(Laughter)

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:09.237
And I'd say,

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:10.831
"Why you bringing up old stuff?"

00:01:10.855 --> 00:01:11.856
(Laughter)

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.752
I just left it, I don't want
to think about that place again.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:19.291
See, we were spending about
40 percent of my income on childcare.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.604
We had one child.

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.664
And we were pregnant
with our second child.

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:27.188
And we were trying to figure out
how we were going to fix this whole thing

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.037
of this money situation, and she said,

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.497
"Hey, babe, I've got a great idea."

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:32.855
I said, "What's up?"

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:35.482
She said, "I think you'd be
a great stay-at-home dad."

00:01:35.506 --> 00:01:37.212
(Laughter)

00:01:37.236 --> 00:01:39.672
I was like, "Why would you say
something like that?"

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:40.697
(Laughter)

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.966
She said, "Because babies like you."

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.498
(Laughter)

00:01:44.522 --> 00:01:45.911
I was like, "No, they don't."

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:47.673
She was like, "No, they do like you.

00:01:47.697 --> 00:01:49.355
And I think it would be great

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.736
for our children to see what love
looks like, coming from a father."

00:01:54.143 --> 00:01:55.563
I was like, OK.

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:58.047
(Laughter)

00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:00.627
So, I had issues with this,

00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.302
because I haven't seen a lot
of stay-at-home dads before

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:06.545
and I thought men would judge me,
so get this, I said this --

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.069
please don't be offended -- I said,

00:02:09.093 --> 00:02:11.427
"Uh, you know, that sounds boring.

00:02:11.744 --> 00:02:14.855
And what do stay-at-home moms
do all day, anyway?"

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.117
Audience: Ooh!

00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:22.378
She smiled at me a smile
only a woman full of knowledge can smile

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:23.744
(Laughter)

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:26.633
and said, "Well, this
should be easy for you.

00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:29.482
And it will save us some money,
it seems like a no-brainer."

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:30.551
(Laughter)

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.204
Fast-forward six months,

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.440
I'd been a stay-at-home dad
for about a week.

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:35.696
(Laughter)

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.061
I was standing in my bathroom,
looking into the mirror

00:02:39.085 --> 00:02:40.656
(Laughter)

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.831
crying, tears --

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.648
(Laughter)

00:02:43.672 --> 00:02:45.339
running all down my face.

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:46.931
(Laughter)

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:50.553
My one-and-a-half-year-old
was banging on the bathroom door --

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:52.432
because I locked them out, you know --

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:53.457
(Laughter)

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.586
crying, tears running down his face.

00:02:56.252 --> 00:03:00.466
And my newborn was in the bassinet,
crying, tears running down his face.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.783
I looked at myself
in the mirror, and I said ...

00:03:03.807 --> 00:03:06.302
"Which friend can you call
to call in a bomb threat?

00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:07.779
We've got to get out of here."

00:03:07.803 --> 00:03:09.918
(Laughter)

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:13.149
See, I had traded my manager
for my children.

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:14.972
I didn't know what I got myself into.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:18.378
I thought I knew everything
about being a stay-at-home parent,

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:20.468
and in fact, I knew nothing at all.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.782
Because even though my manager was --

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:27.147
well, at least my children
were a lot cuter than my manager,

00:03:27.171 --> 00:03:29.108
they were just as demanding.

00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:31.815
(Video) Child: Wipe my butt.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.077
Papa, wipe my butt.

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:35.307
(Laughter)

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:38.109
Wipe my butt.

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:45.125
(Laughter)

00:03:45.744 --> 00:03:47.903
GH: What had I gotten myself into?

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:50.927
I thought I knew everything
about being a stay-at-home parent --

00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:52.150
in fact, I knew nothing.

00:03:52.174 --> 00:03:54.650
I thought that all I had to do
was feed them,

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:56.800
change their diapers, and they'd be fine.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:03:59.396
Like, I really thought that's it.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.063
"Sesame Street" on TV,
keep them distracted,

00:04:02.087 --> 00:04:05.030
apple sauce in a bowl,
milk in a bottle, they'd be fine.

00:04:05.054 --> 00:04:07.205
But if you leave children alone,

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.618
they'll get into
just a little bit of mischief.

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:11.462
(Video) Child: Hi.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:14.551
GH: Where is the powder?

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:17.085
Child: I don't know.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.594
GH: Well, where did you put it,
where did it --

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:22.363
Who did it?

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.299
Child 1: No, you did it!
Child 2: No, you did it!

00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:28.363
Child 1: No, you did it!
Child 2: No, you did it!

00:04:28.387 --> 00:04:30.514
(Laughter)

00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:34.149
GH: You know what else I thought I knew
about being a stay-at-home parent?

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.751
I thought that all I had to do
was take them to the park once a week,

00:04:37.775 --> 00:04:41.609
because if I took them to the park
once a week, they'd be fine.

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:43.394
In fact, I knew nothing at all.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.879
OK.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:49.014
If you take kids to park every day
then that means they get dirty every day.

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.649
If they got dirty every day,
they need baths every day,

00:04:51.673 --> 00:04:54.037
if they got baths every day --

00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:57.180
I just don't think you understand, see,
having two kids under two,

00:04:57.204 --> 00:05:01.113
you end up changing
over 20 dirty diapers a day, OK.

00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:04.474
And if you give them a bath,
that's just more nakedness.

00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:05.799
(Laughter)

00:05:05.823 --> 00:05:07.966
And a higher probability
of getting peed on,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.987
and no one likes getting peed on,
even if it's from a baby.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:12.168
(Laughter)

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:14.344
But I read this article by Father Lee

00:05:14.368 --> 00:05:18.693
which cites a survey done by two
detergent companies, Omo and Persil.

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:21.712
And they did this study and it said,
that at two hours a day,

00:05:21.736 --> 00:05:24.624
prisoners get more
outside time than children.

00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:28.711
That convicted me and so we went outside.

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:29.885
(Video) (Music)

00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.122
(Laughter)

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:43.906
GH: See, I knew nothing
about being a stay-at-home parent,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.249
and once I embraced the fact
that I knew nothing,

00:05:46.273 --> 00:05:48.091
I began to learn from my new managers.

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:49.312
And I always was told

00:05:49.336 --> 00:05:53.178
that as a stay-at-home parent,
you get no sleep.

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:55.283
Or as a parent in general,
you get no sleep.

00:05:55.307 --> 00:05:58.196
But that's not true,
because if you sleep when they do,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.823
you actually can get some sleep.

00:05:59.847 --> 00:06:01.686
(Laughter)

00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:05.201
You know what else I thought
as a stay-at-home parent?

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:08.463
I though I knew that the best way
to teach kids right from wrong

00:06:08.487 --> 00:06:09.641
was to discipline them,

00:06:09.665 --> 00:06:12.601
because that would make sure
they understood right from wrong,

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.680
the pain, the fear --
that would teach them.

00:06:14.704 --> 00:06:18.379
But the truth is, the best way to teach
my children right from wrong

00:06:18.403 --> 00:06:19.559
is to teach them.

00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:22.409
Take out a whiteboard and draw pictures
and make connections

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:23.894
that they can understand.

00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:25.385
That was the best way.

00:06:26.868 --> 00:06:30.210
A lot of these images you're seeing
are coming from my YouTube channel,

00:06:30.234 --> 00:06:31.417
"Beleaf in Fatherhood."

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:34.149
I document the misadventures
of being a stay-at-home dad.

00:06:34.173 --> 00:06:37.198
And it's not perfect,
it's just showing that I'm trying.

00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:38.961
And I'm not trying to be an example

00:06:38.985 --> 00:06:42.212
but just proof that it's possible
for whoever else is doing this.

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:46.291
You know what I also knew
about being a stay-at-home parent?

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:48.077
I knew that children needed love,

00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:50.244
but I just didn't know
what love looked like.

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:53.047
(Video) (Music)

00:06:57.932 --> 00:07:00.106
GH: It turns out putting
diapers on your head

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.218
and play-fighting
until the kids fall asleep

00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:03.836
is a great way to love your kids.

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:07.649
So, I was learning a lot,

00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:09.664
but it's not all fun and boogers, is it?

00:07:09.688 --> 00:07:11.689
(Laughter)

00:07:11.713 --> 00:07:14.832
I asked a group of stay-at-home parents
what's the hardest thing,

00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:18.077
the thing they underestimated most
about being stay-at-home parents,

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:20.847
and they said that the loneliness
was one of those things.

00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.498
Not having someone else to talk to,
feeling inadequate,

00:07:23.522 --> 00:07:25.450
feeling selfish for wanting me-time.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.069
And nursery rhymes suck.

00:07:28.418 --> 00:07:29.815
(Laughter)

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.323
Like, really, "Mary Had a Little Lamb"
is cool the first couple of times,

00:07:33.347 --> 00:07:35.824
but after all these years on repeat,

00:07:35.848 --> 00:07:38.605
you wonder why Mary
just ain't make herself a wool skirt

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:40.861
and have lamb chops,
you know what I'm saying?

00:07:40.885 --> 00:07:42.418
(Laughter)

00:07:42.442 --> 00:07:45.537
The one thing I underestimated most
was the emotional fatigue.

00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:48.625
See, I was an artist,
so I'd write songs for other artists.

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:51.591
Because that's how I made money from home.

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:55.130
But when you're with your kids all day,
you become emotionally tired.

00:07:55.575 --> 00:07:58.473
And that means all your creativity
comes from your emotions,

00:07:58.497 --> 00:08:00.489
so you’re just tapped out, you're done.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.567
So you become done with time.

00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:07.399
Nap time, time-tables, time-out,
time like to cook,

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:09.875
with all types of time, you're just done.

00:08:09.899 --> 00:08:11.470
You had no time for anything.

00:08:11.494 --> 00:08:15.169
And some people are done with their spouse
as a stay-at-home parent.

00:08:15.193 --> 00:08:17.200
Because the spouse just doesn't get it.

00:08:18.113 --> 00:08:20.946
I was talking to a friend
of mine, he said,

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.545
"Man, I come home from work,

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:27.077
drawers are open, clothes
hanging outside the drawers,

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.228
the kids are still in their pajamas ...

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:32.611
And it can't be that hard to have
dinner ready when I get home, right?"

00:08:32.635 --> 00:08:34.572
(Laughter)

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.723
Start to freak out,
you know what I'm saying?

00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:38.183
(Laughter)

00:08:38.207 --> 00:08:40.334
He was trying to confide in me --

00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:41.523
(Laughter)

00:08:41.547 --> 00:08:44.024
I said, "You have no idea
what you're talking about."

00:08:44.048 --> 00:08:46.672
(Laughter)

00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:49.339
She wakes up every morning,
tired from the night before,

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:52.268
baby attached to her breast,
dropping this kid off at school,

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:53.831
and taking this one to the park.

00:08:53.855 --> 00:08:55.332
Laundry piles up to the skies,

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:58.166
he has a conversation on the phone
for an hour with your mom

00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.372
about God knows what,

00:08:59.396 --> 00:09:01.379
takes the dog you wanted for a walk ...

00:09:01.403 --> 00:09:02.404
(Laughter)

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:04.666
And nobody died, bro.

00:09:05.022 --> 00:09:07.729
She kept your kids alive
all day, that's hard."

00:09:07.753 --> 00:09:10.085
(Laughter)

00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:13.188
I have become an advocate
for stay-at-home parents.

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:14.660
Why?

00:09:14.684 --> 00:09:17.350
Because finally, I was
standing in their shoes.

00:09:17.898 --> 00:09:20.375
Because when you're standing
in someone else's shoes,

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.666
you see the world
from a different perspective.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.263
And when you start to take steps,
it feels like baby steps, wobbling.

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.823
But then they turn into stomps.

00:09:28.847 --> 00:09:32.183
And you start making footprints
for the next generation to walk in.

00:09:33.085 --> 00:09:35.577
See, we're walking
on a certain path, as parents.

00:09:35.601 --> 00:09:36.910
We're all in this together.

00:09:36.934 --> 00:09:39.840
No one can deny that family
is one of the biggest foundations

00:09:39.864 --> 00:09:41.022
in anyone's life.

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:42.732
And we're all walking on this path,

00:09:42.756 --> 00:09:45.941
and we're pulling these thickets
out of the way, and these thorns,

00:09:46.346 --> 00:09:48.506
making it easier for the ones
coming after us.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.561
It turns out, parenting
has a lot more to do with landscaping.

00:09:53.204 --> 00:09:54.354
And learning.

00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.131
More than teaching.

00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:00.796
And the best thing to do
is to show up for class.

00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:05.328
Be present is what I learned
as a stay-at-home dad.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.348
And let your presence be a gift.

00:10:08.372 --> 00:10:09.522
(Video) Shh.

00:10:09.952 --> 00:10:13.674
(Door unlocking)

00:10:15.306 --> 00:10:16.456
Hi!

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:18.998
(Children giggling)

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:22.972
(Laughter)

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:25.324
GH: This was me, coming home
from tour one day.

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:29.436
I thought that the father
was supposed to pursue the child.

00:10:29.785 --> 00:10:32.674
But it turns out the father
makes himself present.

00:10:33.144 --> 00:10:35.405
And the children run after him.

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:37.962
And that right there is a superpower.

00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:41.453
And that right there,
my friends, is everything.

00:10:41.477 --> 00:10:42.628
Thank you.

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:44.992
(Applause)
