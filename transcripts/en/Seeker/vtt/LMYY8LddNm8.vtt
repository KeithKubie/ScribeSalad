00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.450
Our immune system is an incredible thing.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.760
It's a complex, disease-fighting machine,
capable of fending off attacks from bacteria

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.760
and viruses.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.590
But what happens when that same incredible
system stops fighting diseases, and starts

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.820
attacking you?

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.520
Lupus has been around for a very long time.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.990
Symptoms were first described back in the
nineteenth century, specifically a butterfly

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.160
rash that appears on the face.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.820
It was later discovered that lupus causes
many, seemingly unrelated symptoms.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.320
But although we've known about the disease
for years, there's still much about lupus

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.850
we don't fully understand.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.090
I'm Ali Duarte, I'm a physician and researcher.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.240
I'm also the co-director of the Lupus Program
here at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.840
Lupus is an autoimmune disease so this means
that your immune system that is in charge

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.490
of defending you against microbes sort of
bacteria starts to attack itself.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.579
It's, for example when you have a dog that
protects you against all the bad guys and

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.270
then this dog starts to bite you.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.500
Autoimmune diseases aren't uncommon, and there
are many different types.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.619
Even lupus has four variations.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.639
But for now, we'll be focusing on this type,
systemic lupus.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:10.149
And that's because...

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.369
When people talk about lupus they're usually
referring to systemic lupus the type of lupus

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.480
that affects the internal organs.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.260
So, what would cause the immune system, or
the body's guard dog, to turn against its owner?

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.759
We don't know.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.579
Which, is kind of the story behind lupus.

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.030
There's a lot we don't understand.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.659
But, thanks to specialists like Dr. Duarte,
we know a lot more than we used to.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.369
So what do we know right now is or what we
think is that there is a genetic component

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.860
and an environmental component.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.380
In order to begin to show the symptoms of
lupus, two things need to happen.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.579
First, since lupus isn't contagious, you have
to have a genetic predisposition to the disease.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.630
The genetic factor that causes lupus is currently
unknown, but doctors do know that certain

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.779
demographics are more at risk than others.

00:01:55.779 --> 00:02:00.899
So Lupus is a disease typically of young women.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.320
It affects a women 10 times more frequently
than males.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.420
And you usually see the disease between the
ages of 20 and 50.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.480
Because of the much higher rates of female
patients, researchers suspect that the disease

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.210
is associated with the number of X-chromosomes
one has, since women have 2 x-chromosomes

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.489
and men usually have only one.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.379
But simply having the genetic predisposition
is only the first part of the puzzle.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.390
And then if you were born with this a very
active immune system and you are exposed to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.830
the right stimuli which can be maybe a drug
or can be the UV light or something that we

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540
have any identified yet it starts and perpetuates
the disease.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.360
So what happens to your body when it encounters
a trigger?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.860
Well in lupus what happens is that something
like UV light may trigger cell death.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.049
So these cells start to die and they'd release
DNA and the DNA then is taken by one of the

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:03.280
cells of the immune system called dendritic cells, and then these cells take the DNA and expose it and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.049
activate other cells called lymphocytes
so the T cells or the B cells.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.030
Normally, immune cells would just get rid
of a dead cell and move on.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.109
But in lupus patients, these cells are slow
at clearing the death cells and start to create

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.430
an antibody against the cell's DNA.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.680
Which is a big problem, because there are
a lot of healthy cells in your body that have

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.560
that same DNA, which these immune cells now
want to destroy.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.670
This results in chronic inflammation and potentially
damage to internal organs like the kidneys

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.800
or brain and can even lead to
 organ failure and death.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.700
So even though we haven't we haven't had a
significant drug break through discoveries

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.360
in the last 60 years we have learned how to
manage the disease better and in the last

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.780
Just over half-a-century ago patients were
expected to live a few years

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.120
Now, lifespans are close to average.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.879
Of course, there are still many unanswered
genetic questions.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.879
Lupus affects African Americans 3 to 4 times
more than caucasians, for example, and there

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.439
is no identifiable genetic reason why this
should be the case.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.529
And while there is strong evidence that environmental
factors could be the culprit, the environmental

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.249
triggers aren't fully understood.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:11.160
So, while outcomes for patients diagnosed
with lupus are much better than they have

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.800
ever been in the past, when it comes to exactly
how the disease works, the answer is still usually...

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.980
We don't know.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.340
So, while more women are at risk of developing
lupus than men, men tend to have worse outcomes.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.410
Like other aspects of the disease, this is
another unknown, but there are some theories...

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.270
Maybe one of the components is just that males
take longer to go to the doctor and they may

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.740
just delay going for looking for care so that
may change the prognosis of the disease

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.820
So, maybe get a checkup every now and then, ok?
