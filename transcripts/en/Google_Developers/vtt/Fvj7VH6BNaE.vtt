BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.400
interesting developer community.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.240
SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.320
has asked this question.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.631
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:10.128
JENNY MURPHY: This is primarily
a question and

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:11.800
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.050
would like to ask questions.

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:21.690
ERIC: All right.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.455
Hello and welcome to Apps
Script Office Hours.

00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:24.850
I'm Eric.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.500
ARUN: I'm Arun.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.720
ERIC: All right, and we're
back again this week.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.480
This is our weekly broadcast
where we kind of give you an

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.040
update on what's new in Google
Apps Script and answer

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.520
questions from you guys.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.930
If you're watching it on
YouTube, you can also join the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.300
Hangout via the Google
Developers Live event page and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.420
join in and ask us questions.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.500
Or if you're a little shy or you
don't have a web cam, you

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.930
can ask those questions on the
Google Moderator that's

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.900
embedded right under
the event.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.350
All right.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.915
So how's it going, Arun?

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:50.970
What do we got for today?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.560
ARUN: Well, this is the first
Hangout where I'm actually

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.525
speaking, so that's exciting.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:57.330
Uh, I think the last time
I did with Jan, I

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.920
didn't say a word.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.670
ERIC: A silent partner?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.220
ARUN: That's right.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.930
ERIC: Yeah.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.020
ARUN: So this is my fourth
week here with the Dev

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.220
Relation team here
in New York.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.070
I'm working specifically on Apps
Script with Eric, Kalyan,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.690
Ikai, and Jan.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.210
Very excited to be
on the team.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.280
And have a lot of great
things going on.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.040
Coming up to speed on the
product, getting to know the

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.540
community, so yeah, excited
to be on the team.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.390
ERIC: Yeah, it's been
great to have you.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.330
Actually, you have already
been the public

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.120
face of this team.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.540
ARUN: That's right.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.260
So I was over in DC on Friday
at the DevFest there.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.960
It was actually quite
an exciting event.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.770
It was an all day event.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.450
It was actually combined with
the Startup DC event as well.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.230
So we had over 150, almost
200 folks come in.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.310
Don Dodge from Google
keynoted.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.090
And then there were a few
other Googlers there

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.020
presenting as well.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.390
And I was there representing
Apps Script and gave about a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.180
45 minute talk along with a
gentleman from Unisys, Steve

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.420
Cousin, who's a VP of
technology there.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.050
So I was actually pretty
well received.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.260
DC has a very interesting mix
of folks with folks in the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.180
nonprofit area, folks in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.950
government, consulting services.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.470
It's a good mix of technologists
there with a lot

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.780
of good questions.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.520
And not a lot of them had used
Apps Script before, so it was

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.110
good for them to kind of
see and ask a lot of

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.950
questions as well.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.630
ERIC: Yeah, that's great.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.510
Is there a bit of a different
vibe there in the community

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.590
compared to the West Coast
or here in New York?

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.550
ARUN: Definitely
from New York.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.360
I think I haven't been to the
West Coast that often.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.800
Specifically not for technology
travel based for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.410
technology events.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.260
But in New York, I feel like
folks are potentially using

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Google Apps at work.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.860
Folks are definitely using Gmail
and other things for

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.700
personal use in DC.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.290
It was for the first time I
think they had seen a live

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.030
Apps Script demo.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.500
ERIC: Oh wow.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.030
ARUN: So that was exciting
to deliver that.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.730
ERIC: That is great.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.240
ARUN: And the power and the
message of Apps Script kind of

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.170
came through, right.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.910
JavaScript--

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.690
pure JavaScript--

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.300
extended with the Google APIs,
running in the cloud, and you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.170
code it in the browser.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.940
You don't have to install an
Eclipse plug-in, or SDK, or

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:05.650
anything like that.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.470
So it's actually
quite powerful.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.320
And I got through.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.880
ERIC: Yeah, that's cool.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.310
I know we're actually gaining a
lot of Google Apps customers

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.550
in different governments
around the country.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.330
So I can definitely see how
being involved in the DC

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.580
community, having Apps Scripts
kind of fits in nicely with

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.600
people who are already on
the Apps infrastructure.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.110
ARUN: That's right.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.385
That's right.

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:22.660
Yeah.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.940
So it was exciting.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.510
Interesting questions
came up as well.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.360
So as pretty frequent Apps
Scripters, we kind of forget

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.610
about some of the tendencies of
developers that come from

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.570
other platforms, right.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.620
So an interesting question that
came up was, how does

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.730
source control work?

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.560
I'm used to Subversion.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.040
I'm used to Git.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.110
So Apps Script actually has a
built-in basic but pretty

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.920
functional source
control system.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.070
Right, so you can
version things.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.600
You can deploy different
versions for a web app or a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.990
library, for instance.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.280
So you can actually be working
on a development instance,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.820
test that out, and then be able
to roll back or publish

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.790
the latest version.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.900
So we kind of talk
through that.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.220
You can actually share the
project with multiple

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.370
collaborators as well.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.730
So it's got some built-in
capabilities.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.200
And obviously it's
on the cloud.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.070
So you don't have to worry
about copying it down and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.330
backing it up and things
like that.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.079
So walking through
things like that.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.920
We obviously had to clarify
when does App Engine make

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.290
sense, and when does Apps
Script make sense.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.360
It has the unfortunate thing
that they both start

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.670
with the word Apps.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.540
And I actually followed an
event on App Engine, so

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.860
there's an extra confusion.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.630
But what I think really made
sense to folks is if you're

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.120
using any of Google's products
as an underlying data source

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.680
or service like Maps, or
Translate, or Finance, or

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.510
tapping contacts, or
spreadsheets, or Gmail,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.135
definitely App Engine
makes sense--

00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:55.980
I'm sorry, Apps Script
makes sense.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.880
App Engine gives you a lot more
bare metal control when

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.820
that makes sense and you needed
a local IDE with the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.540
right tooling and things
like that.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.880
So there's a balance there,
but kind of walk people

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.290
through that.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.750
ERIC: Definitely seems like
maybe it has a little bit to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.930
do with how intense your
application is.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.420
If you need to do a highly
customized, highly performance

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.970
based activity, App Engine
might be a better source.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.210
But if you've just gotta plug
some data from here to there--

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.400
which I feel like a lot of
programming is, right?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.950
I got this.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:21.910
I need to move it over here.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.010
I need to take one and
turn it into ten.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.820
Those kind of basic operations
is a great strong point for

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.180
Apps Script.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.050
ARUN: Yeah, for sure.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.660
So that resonated pretty well.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.070
ERIC: That's cool.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.590
ARUN: Yeah.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.580
ERIC: That sounds like
a great time.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.615
We're glad to have you on
the team representing.

00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:37.370
ARUN: No, it's great
to be on the team.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.150
ERIC: Speaking of user events,
we have another

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.570
Hackathon coming up.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.420
ARUN: That's right.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.740
November 13, in Los Angeles.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.940
Ikai, myself, I'm sure a few
other folks from the team,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.940
including the engineers on the
product will be there.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.280
So if you're in the LA area,
definitely come out there.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.270
We would love to
see your ideas.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.660
Have access to the actual folks

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:58.830
that work on the product.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.010
You can log issues.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.470
But very rarely do
you get access

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.490
to the actual engineers.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.480
So if you're on the West
Coast, come on

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.950
down, November 13.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.190
ERIC: Yeah, definitely
a rare treat.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.960
We just did the one previously
in Austin.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.240
Had a lot of great people come
out, kind of spanning the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.350
range of experience.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.520
And more people in business,
more people that are

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.940
developers.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.430
And it was really great just
to set aside time.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.500
Apps Script is one of these
things that everybody I kind

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.200
of follow on social networks,
they're always like, I gotta

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.660
spend a weekend and
just learn this.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.640
And they probably--

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.980
your weekends fill
up pretty fast.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.510
And Apps Script, I'm sure,
loses out to the beach or

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.900
spending time with family.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.010
ARUN: Especially if you're
in California.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.916
ERIC: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.850
So I think it's great to
have these hackathons.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.070
It's a good excuse to take the
time, to learn this thing

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.270
you've been meaning to learn,
and actually apply it.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.050
And to have us there kind of
giving instruction, answering

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.920
questions, so much easier to get
started than if you were

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.440
just alone with some
documentation.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.000
And we try and make
the documentation

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.690
as good as we are.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.195
But there's nothing
like coming out.

00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:55.820
ARUN: Yep, absolutely.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.925
And I'm sure there'll
be some prizes.

00:06:56.925 --> 00:07:01.370
If Ikai is involved, I'm sure
he'll bring some schwag.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.340
So yeah, you should be there.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.460
ERIC: That's great.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.080
ARUN: Excellent.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.540
Do you want to do the
release notes?

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.600
ERIC: Yeah, so our release
notes this

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.290
week are pretty simple.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.720
We just had one bug fix.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.843
It was an issue where some
files couldn't be copied.

00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:19.390
The docs list dot copy
method didn't work.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.190
I believe it was on
presentations and a couple

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.365
other file types.

00:07:23.365 --> 00:07:25.380
So yeah, that's one
that we addressed.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:25.770
It's fixed.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.100
It's out there.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.170
But yeah, this release notes
page, if you haven't been

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.720
following it, it's on
our documentation.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.930
It's a great way to stay abreast
of kind of when new

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.950
features are added to
Apps Script and when

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.100
bug fixes are made.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.500
Unlike, I guess, other kind of
development platforms or

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.500
environments, we don't have
like hard release numbers,

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.770
like you need to upgrade
from 2.0 to 3.0.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.130
We just roll out features and
fixes kind of on a rolling

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.470
basis, usually like one
per week or so.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.295
So this is where you tune it
and find out what's new.

00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:53.765
ARUN: Yeah, that's actually one
of the things that convene

00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:54.460
here on the team.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.190
That's everything from the
editor where you write the

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:02.540
code, to the API's where you use
it to write against your

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.810
code, the platform on top of
which the actual app runs,

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.060
everything's on the cloud.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.820
In some ways, it's kind of
set it and forget it.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.930
And then I've already
experienced this where I'll

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.810
come back to a project a week
later and things look a little

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.320
bit prettier, faster.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.800
And it's a great feeling.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.000
It's a true feeling, it's
a great feeling.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.080
ERIC: Yeah, it's nice to take
some of that burden off, like

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.650
staying on top of the releases
and deprecations.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:31.970
ARUN: Right.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.390
And I used to use a
lot of Eclipse and

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.530
Visual Studio before.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.870
And when updates come out, I'm
always deciding whether it's

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.169
the right time to upgrade.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.590
Am I going to break something?

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.179
So we do a lot of that internal
testing to ensure

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.740
that everything is maintained
compatibility wise, and things

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.245
only get better, and faster,
and more stable.

00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:53.490
ERIC: Here, here.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.240
ARUN: Awesome.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.150
ERIC: Cool, let's see if there's
anybody who's in the

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.390
live hangout, just in case we
have any immediate questions.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.400
Looks like it's just us.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:05.810
ARUN: All right.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.350
ERIC: That's all right.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.390
Well, we have some questions
here on our moderator page.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.550
So let's see what we
got going there.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.930
ARUN: All right.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.840
So the first one, I think a
couple folks have kind of

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.910
brought this up recently.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.180
It's a link to a question
in Stack Overflow.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.530
I'll actually go there.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.870
I think it's around--

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.260
let me blow this up
a little bit--

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.380
so it's around large code files
that when you're editing

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:37.010
it, you know, sometimes when it
goes up to 18,000, 20,000

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.670
lines of code, the
UI freezes up.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.820
Potentially this gentleman
here has figured out that

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.760
maybe there's a megabyte
limit for script size.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.510
So it's something that a couple
folks have reported.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.850
I've actually put a link in
there for an issue tracker

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.140
link where I think people had
reported this earlier in the

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.890
spring and summer.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.530
Seems a little sporadic
from what I've heard.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.300
I'm not sure if--

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.615
ERIC: Yeah, I mean, first
of all, that's

00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:02.650
a serious app script.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:04.000
20 lines, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.550
Apps Script, that is
a serious user.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.560
Thank you for using Apps Script
at this level and we

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.800
definitely want to make
sure it works for you.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.740
And so yeah, I have heard other
reports in the past that

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.800
people saying that as your code
size grows, the editor

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.510
gets more sluggish.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.647
I think it has to do with the
way we're sending your code to

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:19.450
and from the server.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:20.930
But that's definitely something
we should address,

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.140
because we want to make
these kind of complex

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.720
applications possible.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.890
But yeah, and to the second
point that you put there,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.120
really, if you're this user,
and you found this problem,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.850
which is obviously a bug, it's
probably not something you're

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:33.500
doing wrong.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.050
It's probably not something
our average

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.340
user can help with.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.870
It's probably going to save time
to head straight to the

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.710
issue tracker.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.540
Just open a bug report
with us.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.960
This is the kind of thing where
on Stack Overflow, you

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.420
know, the community is going to
see it, but probably not be

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.150
able to solve your problem
as easily.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.730
ARUN: Right.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.470
ERIC: So do open an issue
tracker item.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.520
And you can do both, because
maybe some users have found a

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.490
workaround, and you want
to ask for workarounds.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.320
But as far as getting it fixed,
the issue tracker is

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.880
where you're going to need
to come to kind of--

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.610
ARUN: And definitely
star issues there.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.400
It helps us see which ones are
popular and most demanded by

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.732
our community.

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:09.110
So definitely we'll
take a look at it.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.640
It may also have to do with--
you know, we do a lot of

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.030
things around autosaves.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.890
We do a lot of things
to help you.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.985
But in some cases, that
might trip us up.

00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:20.900
ERIC: And I think something that
he had mentioned in the

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.190
comments there was about
using libraries.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.690
We do have library support in
Apps Script that allows you to

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:27.260
somewhat more componentize
your code.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.590
You know, have a reusable
library that you import, but

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.980
isn't actually in the
editor at that time.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.380
Now, obviously, if you have your
code written in a way, it

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.790
could be hard to disentangle
it into separate libraries.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.540
But that can be way that if from
the start, if you kind of

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.010
build in a more modular
approach, like, OK, I'm going

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.860
to put all of my Gmail
logic into this file.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.715
And maybe later, you could
bundle that up into a library

00:11:47.715 --> 00:11:50.710
that then makes it easier to
create these large projects.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.710
And even better, later on when
you're creating a new project,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.610
you could bring in all that
same functionality without

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.470
having to do a big copy
paste or a rewrite.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.640
So libraries may help
in the short term.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.690
But obviously long term, you
should look for ways to make

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.220
sure that you're not crashing
your editor.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.370
ARUN: Another thing that I've
noticed when files get real

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.760
long is a lot of static data.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.970
So seed data, or sample
data, or other sort

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.470
of helper test data.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.490
If possible, move it into a
spreadsheet, or ScriptDb, or

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.050
something along those lines
so that the number of

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.180
characters goes down.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.240
It's unlikely that there's 18
kilobytes, 18 K lines of

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.630
logic, but we'll see.

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.775
We'll take a look at this one
and ping our engineering team

00:12:33.775 --> 00:12:35.180
and see what we can find.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.120
The good thing is a lot of these
things do result in logs

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.330
on our side that we can
see any spikes or

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.950
any abnormal behavior.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.270
So hopefully we can
pin it down.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:45.575
ERIC: All right, great.

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:47.474
And one of the things, that
when you do file an issue

00:12:47.474 --> 00:12:49.050
tracker item like this, as you
mentioned, we have these

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.280
internal logs.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.600
And really, in order for us to
kind of pinpoint your specific

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.450
problem, it helps if you include
in your bug report,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.090
what the project key is for
that script project.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.010
So that's something that you
could find under, I think it's

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.840
File, Project Properties, or
Project Settings menu.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.760
And in there, it will list
your project key.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.940
And that just helps us in our
logs, kind of target right in

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.900
on what the error message it.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.020
ARUN: Great.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.400
The next one is from
Ontario, Canada.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.360
This one is, "want to have
access to geolocation data

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.800
collected either through UiApp
or HTML service form." So any

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.700
plans for this?

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.820
And then, also a link to the
same request in Stack

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.330
Overflow, which I think points
to an issue or enhancement

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.680
request in issue tracker.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.560
So this one, actually the past
nine years, I was working at a

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.640
mobile software company.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.380
So geolocation is very near
and dear to my heart.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.290
So I'm very interested
in this one as well.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.090
ERIC: Yeah, by the this, does he
mean the kind of automatic

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.730
where your browser, once you
approve a certain website,

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.810
will send geolocation data?

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:48.310
ARUN: That's right.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.140
Yeah, so this is part of the
HTML5 spec that a lot of folks

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.270
are now starting to use which
is the navigator dot

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.040
geolocation, and in most
browsers, I think it's a

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.330
little pop up that says it's
asking for your location.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.160
You approve it.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:09.220
And the browser can get-- if
the hardware supports it--

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.000
get a geoposition based
on the callback.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.500
ERIC: Gotcha.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.590
Yeah, so I think one of the
limitations around this today

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.350
is that the two different ways
we have of presenting a UI or

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.940
a web page to the user is the
UiApp and the HTML service.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.770
Both of those today are
on HTML4 standard.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.770
So they're not on HTML5
at the moment.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:30.920
So if you're using some of
these more advanced HTML5

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.130
APIs, they're probably
not going to be

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.370
supported right now.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.540
But obviously HTML5 is a big--

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.450
we love it here at Google.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.220
So we're looking on how to get
that enabled for these two

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:45.650
services, probably the HTML
service directly.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.750
But until then, if you're trying
to use some of these

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.416
newer more exotic APIs,
it might not be there.

00:14:50.416 --> 00:14:50.780
ARUN: Right.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.320
And I think that [INAUDIBLE], I
think, pointed out that this

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.750
is probably Caja.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.830
That's the culprit here, at
least for the HTML service.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.690
And he's absolutely right.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.330
And I wouldn't call it a
culprit, because Caja helps us

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.610
quite a bit.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.270
And then for the folks that
don't know, Caja is basically

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:10.030
the pre-processing engine before
anything HTML services

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.580
spit out to the browser.

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:16.190
And that's to sanitize the code
so that there's nothing

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.020
malicious, even unintentionally,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.030
that gets pulled in.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.360
So when you reference a third
party JavaScript library, even

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.330
though you may have the best of
intentions, that JavaScript

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.260
library may have other
dependencies, which may bring

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:32.210
in cookies, things that
we may not want on the

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.730
script.google.com domain, which
is where your code is

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.340
served out of.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.970
Obviously, that's a great
benefit from Caja.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.300
But there are some limitations
that we have to deal with.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.600
And we're trying to find
the right way to go

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.366
forward with that.

00:15:45.366 --> 00:15:47.520
ERIC: Yeah, that's
a great point.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.730
Sometimes we blame the Caja
for certain things.

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.360
But it gives us so much that
it's a give and take.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.950
ARUN: All right.

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.440
Here's a good one. "Is there any
way to add, modify, delete

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.940
shared contacts on a Google Apps
domain via Apps Script?

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.780
What about other administration
of Google

00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.876
Apps?"

00:16:07.876 --> 00:16:12.260
ERIC: Yeah, so we do have some
domain level services in our

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.600
documentation.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.830
Actually, I think we can
browse through them.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.010
ARUN: Yeah, so let me actually
pull that up.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.590
ERIC: So if it's under default
services and then the domain

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:21.160
subcategory.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.800
You can see we have one there
called user manager.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.670
I think user manager should
allow for some of this.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.520
But I don't know the
exact details.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.290
Let's find out.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.520
ARUN: Yeah, this is actually
one of the interesting use

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.120
cases for Apps Script is for
large enterprises and service

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.590
integrators that deploy many
domains or automate a lot of

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.760
the provisioning aspect
of things.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.670
This is a great way for them to
create users from a legacy

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.660
LDAP system or spreadsheet,
move people around.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.000
So it's actually been
quite powerful.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.045
So I've seen some really
cool use cases here.

00:16:55.045 --> 00:16:59.000
So I think this gentleman here
is asking about being able

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.060
to-- let me go back
and look at this.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.150
ERIC: I think it was a
deleted user, right?

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.839
ARUN: Right, so being able
to add, modify, or

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.145
delete shared contacts.

00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:08.770
ERIC: Oh, well actually, I
guess that's different.

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:09.790
OK.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:10.280
You're right.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.690
My bad.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.720
So this domain users is
actually adding a

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.810
user to your domain.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.410
But there's a different thing
in the domain, which is in

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.060
your Gmail contacts.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.480
There's your local contacts.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.150
And then there's the
shared contacts.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.530
And that's a bit different.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.660
I don't know if we support
the shared contacts.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.060
I believe I looked into
it in the past

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.870
and it wasn't supported.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.370
That these contact groups that
we have available in this

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.410
contacts app are only
your local contacts.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.090
But that's something we
can double check on.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.310
And I think for questions like
this, to go to Stack Overflow

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.590
is great, because you ask
us here on the spot,

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.430
we're like uh-- uh--

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.240
Right now, this is a thing we
can look up and get back to

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.560
you on, too.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.235
ARUN: Great.

00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:50.110
Yeah, definitely post this
on Stack Overflow.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:52.900
And if it's already there,
we'll go find it.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.080
The next one is from Holland.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.860
"Will the setStyleName method
be activated in GAS as in

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.530
GWT?"

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.870
ERIC: So, we're getting
international here with our

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.420
questions, which is awesome.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.760
So for the UiApp, we're
basically building on top of

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.360
the Google Web Toolkit
technologies.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.120
Which do allow you to control
styles in a more complex way.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.410
I think, though, there are
certain elements of the style

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.760
setting from Google
Web Toolkit we

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.070
don't have in UiApp.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.970
I don't remember the exact
history behind it.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.120
But if that method is not there
today, I'd probably say

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.910
it's not going to be
there tomorrow.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.650
Again, I can talk to the
engineers again and see what

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:28.740
the reasoning was.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.260
But in a lot of cases, I think
we decided we wanted UiApp to

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.740
mostly be a simple solution
for simple problems.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:37.140
I think it mostly is that.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.210
And if you're really looking for
more complex styling, more

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.930
complex behaviors, the new HTML5
service that we talked

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.570
about is really where you can
go to kind of just do

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.860
everything customized.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.400
But for little incremental
features that maybe will make

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.900
UiApp a little easier
to use, it's

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.590
something we can talk about.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.460
So yeah, file this in the issue
tracker as a feature

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.480
request if it's not there.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:57.890
ARUN: All right.

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.306
Here's another one
from Canada.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.200
Oh, where'd it go?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.990
ERIC: I think it jumped
up there.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.340
ARUN: Oh.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.680
Someone just [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.580
it up.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.810
So this one is a link to
Stack Overflow as well.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.630
This one is specifically
around security.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.840
I think security in a few terms,
I think, access to the

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.480
actual code, how siloed is the
ScriptDb instance itself?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.370
And then, the hacking
aspect of things.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:27.870
So this is all round
generalizing to "how secure is

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.910
a web app code and his
ScriptDb data?"

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.150
ERIC: So it looks like he talks
about a few different

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.690
parts there, right?

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.230
The code of the web app, the
data in the database, and

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.560
then, I guess, chances
of hacking.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.960
So, we obviously take security
very seriously here at Google.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.270
And we do a lot of things
to make sure that when

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.010
something's yours, and it's
private, it's not

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.170
accessible by others.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.150
So the chance of someone
hacking it, I'd

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:51.180
say, is very low.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.575
We prevent that explicitly.

00:19:52.575 --> 00:19:54.070
And we look out for it.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.600
Now, for the other two,
how about the

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.780
code and the ScriptDb?

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.380
There are some sharing models
built in that could maybe

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.640
affect this.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.910
Now, for the actual code of
your web app, you can keep

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:03.450
that private.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.265
There's no reason you have to
make the public to anybody.

00:20:05.265 --> 00:20:08.030
When you publish as a web app,
they'll be able to see the

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.270
executed version of it.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.670
ARUN: That's right.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.020
ERIC: But not the
source itself.

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.250
ARUN: Yeah, think of that as if
you had written it in PHP,

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:17.590
or .NET, or Rails, it's
basically the rendered version

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.230
of your code and logic.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.945
ERIC: Now, the only kind of
caveat to that is that when

00:20:21.945 --> 00:20:26.020
you're using a library, even
when it's part of a web app

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.160
that's being served to a user,
today that library needs to be

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.450
public even to the user
using your web app.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.165
So the code of the web itself
can stay private.

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:35.790
But any libraries it uses
need to be public.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.780
Now, that said, you don't need
to necessarily broadcast where

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.340
this library is and how people
can see it's code.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.730
But the code in a library does
need to be made public for

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.640
someone to use it.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.770
So that's one thing
to keep in mind.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:49.640
But in general, we do recommend
that you take

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:53.000
anything that's private, like
passwords or special

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.500
connection parameters--

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.230
don't put them in code, because
code can be viewed a

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.980
lot more easily than the project
properties, or the

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.500
script properties as
they're called.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.340
So these script properties allow
you to store little key

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.380
value pairs of data that even
when someone has read only

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.410
access to your script, they
still can't see them.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.990
Only the code is readable.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.150
But the actual properties
aren't.

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.480
So that's really the best
place to put any sort of

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.970
information that you wouldn't
want even the guy who sits

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.070
next to you at work to see.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.560
ARUN: That's right.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.040
That's right.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.490
It's fair.

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.540
It's sort of like a config file,
and [? IAMO ?] file, and

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.025
other environments.

00:21:27.025 --> 00:21:30.080
It allows you to tuck away
name value pairs.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.560
So that's good.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.425
What about the data in
the ScriptDb itself?

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.380
What's the scope of it?

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.860
ERIC: Yeah, so the ScriptDb
is all scoped to

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.190
that particular script.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.270
Every script gets a ScriptDb
when you create it.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:46.310
And it can only be accessed
within that script.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.270
So if somebody else has another
script, they won't be

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:51.290
able to poke in and get
into your ScriptDb.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.740
Now, that said, in your web
app, it doesn't matter.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.840
All users of your web app have
access to the same ScriptDb.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.640
They don't get their
own ScriptDb's.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.070
So if one user stores
his data--

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.820
if one user gives you his data
and you store it in ScriptDb,

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.120
and another user gives you his
data and you store it in

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.780
ScriptDb, they're going to
be side by side there.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.710
So if you perhaps make a mistake
in your code, and when

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.800
you're showing a table of
records, you show records from

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.660
both users, when you
really should only

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.380
show that user's record.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.160
You could potentially get
data out there that way.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.690
But that's really due to more
of a logic or programming

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.670
mistake in your code than kind
of the underlying model.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.020
ARUN: And that's a similar
problem with MySQL or any

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.790
other storage mechanism
that you may use.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.010
ERIC: That's right.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.000
ARUN: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.850
Great.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:35.835
That's a really good question,
and I think there are already

00:22:35.835 --> 00:22:37.800
some good answers on Stack
Overflow as well.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.440
ERIC: Yeah, we have a great
community there that loves to

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.360
pitch in their answers.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.180
ARUN: Great.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.660
All right, so let's see--

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.900
ERIC: It looks like there's
a problem with

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.620
our hangout, maybe.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.760
ARUN: That's interesting.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.760
All right, well, we will try to
rectify that the next time.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.230
ERIC: Yeah, I guess that makes
sense why nobody joined today.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.600
ARUN: That's unfortunate.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.270
Well hopefully you'll find the
replay of this still useful.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.255
I think we went through a lot
of useful things today.

00:23:05.255 --> 00:23:06.060
ERIC: Yeah, luckily
we had a ton of

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.100
questions on the moderator.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.280
And sometimes it's great just
to even ask the questions of

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.150
the moderator, because then
you can give us a link to

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.890
Stack Overflow, how
to look things up.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.250
So that's pretty cool.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:15.860
ARUN: Great.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.640
ERIC: So let's just refresh
that page one more time to

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.070
make sure we don't have any
last minute questions.

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.540
ARUN: Yep.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.990
Let's see here.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.760
OK, we talked about that.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.440
Talked about that.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.694
Let's see.

00:23:28.694 --> 00:23:29.890
I think that's it.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:30.970
ERIC: All right.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.800
That's great.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.823
All right, so I think we had
some great questions today.

00:23:33.823 --> 00:23:35.840
And we'll be back next week.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.770
We haven't scheduled it yet.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.420
But we'll probably be back
in the morning next week.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.830
But yeah, keep watch
on developers.googl

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.280
e.com/live/drive, where you'll
see all the Drive and Apps

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.450
Script office hours.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.560
And then you can find out when
we're coming up next.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.720
ARUN: Excellent.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.300
Thank you.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.210
ERIC: All right, thanks
everybody.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.240
We'll see you next week.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.440
ARUN: Bye bye.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.000
