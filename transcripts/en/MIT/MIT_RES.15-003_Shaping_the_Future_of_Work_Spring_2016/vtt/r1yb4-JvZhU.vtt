00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.730
Today we're speaking with
Liz Shuler, the secretary

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.090
treasurer of AFL-CIO.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.530
Liz is not only the
chief financial officer

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.370
for the AFL-CIO, she
has a special interest

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.790
and responsibility in
working with young people

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.860
to introduce the
Labor Movement to them

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.770
and to learn from
them about what

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.330
they would like to see the Labor
Movement of the future look

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.830
like.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.420
So I'm the secretary
treasurer, which

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.220
is the chief financial
of the AFL-CIO.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.610
We have 57 affiliated unions.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.310
And I actually
came up through one

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.910
of those unions,
the International

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.400
Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.220
as a rank and file member.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.530
And my responsibilities
here are to manage the money

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.440
and make sure that we're
using the dues money wisely

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.140
and building
program, making sure

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.200
that our finances are in order.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.970
But in addition to
that finance hat,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.720
I also work to engage,
educate, mobilize young people

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.610
in our movement, particularly
focused, as a woman officer,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.500
in making sure that we are
engaging women in our Labor

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.550
Movement and really speaking
out on issues that affect women

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.480
in the workplace, and then
in terms of innovation,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.410
what can we be doing
as a labor movement

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.780
to change as the workplace
changes and evolves?

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.570
And that can include anything
from workforce development

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.810
and training to issues
around the on-demand economy.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.405
There's so much happening
in the world of work.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.200
Well, the young people
in the Labor Movement--

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.140
I was a young person when
I first started in my union

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.600
at 23 years old--

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.280
often feel that they
don't have as much

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.010
of a voice in our
Labor Movement.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.190
And I wanted to figure out a
way to change that and make

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.700
their ideas and opinions and
thoughts and approaches woven

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.160
into the fabric of
what we do every day.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.380
So we started a young worker
program we call NextUP

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.890
about six years ago.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.850
And the intent was
to figure out ways

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.490
to get young people engaged
in their own unions,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.870
but also making connections with
young people outside the Labor

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.280
Movement so that we're
all working together

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.540
to advance the interests of
young people in this economy.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.530
And we've been building
young worker groups

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.720
all across the country
through our AFL-CIO structure.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.840
So in most major cities and
pretty much every state,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.360
we have a young
worker group that's

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.380
giving voice to young people.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.990
They're leading in
politics, in legislation,

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.020
in organizing, and
really being a voice

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.900
and a presence for
the Labor Movement

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.790
in their local communities.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.320
I'm really proud
of the work they've

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.100
done to put together a young
worker economic platform

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.060
so that they can
hold politicians

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.110
accountable on the issues
that matter to young people

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.200
in the economy.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.220
And of course, front and
center is job opportunities,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.620
making sure that when people
graduate from high school

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.510
or even graduate from
college that we have

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.620
good jobs waiting for them.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.770
And often, we know young
people are grappling

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.230
with a lot of student
loan debt when they've

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.770
gone through college
and how are our elected

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.720
officials responding to that
and really connecting the Labor

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.950
Movement to the issues that
matter to young people?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, the course is a real
opportunity for young people

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.660
to connect on what is the future
of work going to look like?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.790
What are we doing as working
people to influence that?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.680
And in the labor movement,
of course, front and center

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.070
is collective bargaining
and how can we

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.420
strengthen collective
bargaining and how

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.120
does the role of collective
bargaining influence

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.720
work in general?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.610
We know the unionized
workforce has been shrinking,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.820
but in a time of the greatest
inequality we've seen,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.750
it's more important than ever
that we grow the Labor Movement

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.690
and get our fair share of
that growth in the economy.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.620
And so I think for
young people who

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.160
are looking at what can I
do to influence, what can I

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.020
do to help, taking a course
like this, educating themselves,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.870
but then also taking
that education

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.930
and moving it into action.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.800
And I think when I
talk to young people,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.210
they often feel
powerless and don't

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.140
see the Labor
Movement as a vehicle

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.280
for that kind of action.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.570
And so I think the
message is that yeah,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.040
there are opportunities.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.290
There are places you can
go to exert your power.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.330
And the power of coming
together in the power

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.690
of collective action, nowhere
is that better on display

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.950
than with the Labor Movement.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.500
Young people in
the Labor Movement

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.500
have a very unique perspective.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.600
They often are some of the
only young people in their peer

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.570
group that have
a decent job that

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.030
pays benefits, that gives
them the training they

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.260
need without going into debt.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.760
So I think that they can do a
service to other young people

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.880
who may not know those
opportunities exist

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.620
by lifting up the possibilities
of what the Labor Movement can

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.660
offer.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.530
They also have a
unique perspective

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.090
on what's happening
in the economy.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.820
As we know, this generation
has suffered disproportionately

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.820
with the lack of opportunity.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.440
The unemployment numbers
have hit them, I think,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.890
at double the rate of the
average who's out of work.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.320
And we want to come together
as a society to figure out,

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.710
what kind of jobs do we
want to see in this country

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.380
as we go forward in the future?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.690
Do we want low-road,
f jobs or do

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.090
we want opportunities to
really support your family

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.850
and put food on the table?

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.810
And I think young people are
feeling that so acutely and so

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.770
they have ideas and
thoughts to share

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.380
on how we can
rebuild the economy.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.380
So I think that this
is a great opportunity

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.260
to bring people together,
have their voices heard,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.380
make sure that we're getting our
politicians' attention on this

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.060
because those
elected officials are

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.620
the ones that write the
rules and pass the policies.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.740
And so if we're going to rewrite
the rules of the economy,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.586
we need to get more
and more young voices

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:44.460
in that conversation.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.900
I think there is
so much opportunity

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.950
at this moment in
time as, of course,

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.300
the workplace is
changing and evolving.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.870
So is the Labor
Movement and so is

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.500
the progressive
infrastructure in the country.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.690
And I think the message
is that we don't just

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.680
have to sit back and
wait for change to happen

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.450
and feel like we can't
be a part of that change.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.260
I think it's important that
you see the Labor Movement

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.120
as a vehicle for that
possibility of bringing

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.160
people's voices together.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.860
And as an institution,
we can do that.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.600
But we can't do it alone.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.970
We need to be working
together in collaboration

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.420
and in partnership with
all kinds of organizations.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.840
And the more people we bring
together, the more powerful

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.820
our voices are.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.000
So I think for young
people who are looking

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.280
for an avenue and a way to
make change, certainly look

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.690
to the Labor Movement, but
look in your communities.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.650
Look at all the
different organizations

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.040
that are lifting up
voices in different ways.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.970
Look at your local
businesses, for example.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.780
We often think that
labor and management are

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.790
at odds with each
other, but could we

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.350
be more powerful if we
were working together

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.680
in collaboration on the
things that matter to creating

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:13.020
better jobs, high-road,
high-wage jobs?

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.580
And so I think that
young people will

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.740
play an integral and important
role in making that happen.
