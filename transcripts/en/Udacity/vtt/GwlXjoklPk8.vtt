Like the others, Skinner thought that we evolved such that we have the vocal

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:08.151
apparatus to be able to learn language. And in fact Skinner though that we

00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:11.866
learn language just like we learn any other behavior. And that's why he calls

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:16.524
it verbal behavior. We are surrounded by verbal communities and they teach us

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:21.620
the sounds and words that are effective in that community. And you'll notice

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.702
that parents use imitation and reinforcement when teaching their children how

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:29.896
to talk. That's right Johnny, you said water, good job. So in addition to

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:34.667
reinforcement, you may also be punished for language. For example, perhaps you

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.393
said a curse word in front of somebody you shouldn't have and you got in

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:42.328
trouble for it. If you speak differently to your friends than you do to your

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:45.760
parents or your grandparents, you would have what Skinner would say, audience

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.097
control. Meaning you're reinforced to speak in a certain way in front of some

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:52.811
people, and speaking that way in front of others, you could actually be

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:58.833
punished. If language were discovered, then why didn't Jeannie learned how to

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.839
speak. Well actually, we saw that Jeannie did try to speak, and was imitating,

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.275
but she was punished for it, remember, her dad barked at her. Therefore she had

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:12.083
limited language skills. Finally we're going to ask again why is it very

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.743
important and we hope that we can get some practical applications from a

00:01:15.743 --> 00:01:21.383
theory. And it turns out theory of Skinner in verbal behavior using principles

00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:25.352
of operand conditioning has been very effective in teaching children with

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:30.276
autism how to speak. And they even use these theories to teach individuals with

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:32.500
intellectual disabilities how to speak.
