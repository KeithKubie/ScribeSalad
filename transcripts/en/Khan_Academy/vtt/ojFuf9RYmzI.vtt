00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.392
Voiceover:So we've got 3 Y
squared plus 6 X to the third

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:05.754
and we're raising this
whole to the fifth power

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:07.632
and we could clearly
use a binomial theorem

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.592
or pascal's triangle in order
to find the expansion of that.

00:00:10.592 --> 00:00:13.400
But what I want to do
is really as an exercise

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.730
is to try to hone in on
just one of the terms

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.249
and in particular I want to
hone in on the term that has

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.720
some coefficient times X to
the sixth, Y to the sixth.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.240
So in this expansion some term

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.833
is going to have X to
the sixth, Y to sixth

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.776
and I want to figure
out what the coefficient

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:32.000
on that term is and I
encourage you to pause

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.320
this video and try to
figure it out on your own.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.400
So I'm assuming you've had
a go at it and you might

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.075
have at first found this to
be a little bit confusing.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:42.821
I'm only raising it to the fifth power,

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.349
how do I get X to the
sixth, Y to the sixth?

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:48.149
But then when you look at the actual terms

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.677
of the binomial it starts
to jump out at you.

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:51.445
Okay, I have a Y squared term,

00:00:51.445 --> 00:00:53.413
I have an X to the third term,

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:55.701
so when I raise these to
powers I'm going to get,

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.981
I could have powers higher
than the fifth power.

00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:00.389
But to actually think about which of

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.765
these terms has the X to
the sixth, Y to the sixth,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:05.461
let's just look at the pattern in,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.581
in I guess the actual expansion

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.605
without even thinking
about its coefficients.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.592
And we've seen this multiple times before

00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:16.653
where you could take your
first term in your binomial

00:01:16.653 --> 00:01:21.485
and you could start it off
it's going to start of at a,

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.517
at the power we're taking
the whole binomial to

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:25.909
and then in each term it's going

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.473
to have a lower and lower power.

00:01:27.473 --> 00:01:29.589
So let me actually just
copy and paste this.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.021
So this is going to be, so copy

00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:37.245
and so that's first term, second term,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:38.605
let me make sure I have enough space here.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:46.070
Second term, third term,
fourth term, fourth term,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.570
fifth term, and sixth term it's
going to have 6 terms to it,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.539
you always have one more
term than the exponent.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.939
And then, actually before I
throw the exponents on it,

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.027
let's focus on the second term.

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:02.555
So the second term, actually
I'll write it like this.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:06.339
So the second term's
times 6 X to the third,

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:10.651
let me copy and paste that, whoops.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.395
So let me copy and paste that.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:16.483
So we're going to put that there.

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:18.955
That there.

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.291
And that there.

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.803
And that there.

00:02:23.803 --> 00:02:27.667
And then over to off your screen.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.395
I wrote it over there.

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.157
We'll see if we have to go there.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:33.131
And then let's put the exponents.

00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.875
So this exponent, this is going to be

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.251
the fifth power, fourth
power, third power,

00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:44.819
second power, first
power and zeroeth power.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.932
And for the blue expression,
for 6 X to the third,

00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:51.339
this is going to be the
zeroeth power, first power,

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:58.067
first power, second power,
third power, fourth power,

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:02.830
and then we're going to have
the fifth power right over here.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.643
Then and, of course, they're each going

00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:06.435
to have coefficients in front of them.

00:03:06.435 --> 00:03:07.531
They're each going to have

00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:08.827
coefficients in front of them.

00:03:08.827 --> 00:03:10.499
So there's going to be a
coefficient in front of this one,

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.747
in front of this one, in front of this one

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:13.291
and then we add them all together.

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:14.779
But which of these terms is

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:15.988
the one that we're talking about.

00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:18.451
Has X to the sixth, Y to the sixth.

00:03:18.451 --> 00:03:22.211
So here we have X, if we
take Y squared to the fourth

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.079
it's going to be Y to the
eighth, so that's not it.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.773
if we go here we have Y
squared to the third power,

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.927
that's Y to the sixth and here you have

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:34.674
X to the third squared,
that X to the sixth.

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:36.511
So what we really want to think about

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.535
is what is the coefficient,
what is the coefficient

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:44.341
in front of this term, in
front of this term going to be?

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:46.445
Essentially if you put it
in this way it's going to be

00:03:46.445 --> 00:03:48.743
the third term that we
actually care about.

00:03:48.743 --> 00:03:50.679
So what is this coefficient going to be?

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.399
Now we have to clear, this coefficient,

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.287
whatever we put here that we can use

00:03:54.287 --> 00:03:57.993
the binomial theorem to figure
out isn't going to be this,

00:03:57.993 --> 00:04:01.785
this thing that we have to,
I guess our actual solution

00:04:01.785 --> 00:04:03.939
to the problem that we
posed is going to be

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.858
the product of this coefficient

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:09.178
and whatever other
coefficients we have over here.

00:04:09.178 --> 00:04:11.451
Cause we're going to have 3 to
the third power, six squared.

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.394
So we're going to have to
figure out what that is.

00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:16.002
But let's first just figure
out what this term looks like,

00:04:16.002 --> 00:04:17.442
this term in the expansion.

00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:20.642
What this yellow part actually is.

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:22.418
And there's a couple of
ways that we can do that.

00:04:22.418 --> 00:04:25.490
We could use Pascal's triangle
or we could use combinatorics.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.979
If we use combinatorics we know that

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:34.523
the coefficient over here,
this is going to be 5 choose 0,

00:04:34.523 --> 00:04:36.466
this is going to be the coefficient,

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:41.850
the coefficient over here
is going to be 5 choose 1.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.170
We've seen this multiple times.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.386
You could view it as essentially

00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:49.269
the exponent choose the the top,

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:51.729
the 5 is the exponent that we're raising

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.401
the whole binomial to and
we say choose this number,

00:04:55.401 --> 00:04:57.385
that's the exponent on the

00:04:57.385 --> 00:04:59.157
second term I guess you could say.

00:04:59.157 --> 00:05:02.337
So this would be 5 choose 1.

00:05:02.337 --> 00:05:05.953
And this one over here, the
coefficient, this thing in yellow.

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:11.987
This is going to be 5, 5 choose 2.

00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:14.321
5 choose 2.

00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:16.915
Now what is 5 choose 2?

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:22.953
Well that's equal to 5
factorial over 2 factorial,

00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:29.961
over 2 factorial, times,
times 5 minus 2 factorial.

00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:32.023
So let me just put that in here.

00:05:32.023 --> 00:05:37.775
Times 5 minus 2 factorial.

00:05:37.775 --> 00:05:40.007
And this is going to be equal to.

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:45.071
Let's see 5 factorial is
5 times 4 times 3 times 2,

00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:47.831
we could write times 1 but
that won't change the value.

00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:50.199
Over 2 factorial.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.328
Actually let me just write that

00:05:51.328 --> 00:05:53.263
just so we make it clear
it is times 1 there.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:56.551
2 factorial is 2 times 1 and then what

00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:59.530
we have right over here,
this is 3 factorial,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.937
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:06:02.937 --> 00:06:05.536
So let's see this 3
can cancel with that 3,

00:06:05.536 --> 00:06:08.325
that 2 can cancel with that
2, the 1's don't matter,

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:12.632
won't change the value and
then 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:17.568
So that is just 2, so we're left
with 5 times 2 is equal to 10.

00:06:17.568 --> 00:06:19.792
So that's going to be this
number right over here.

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:21.424
This is going to be a 10.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:24.704
Now another we could have done
it is using Pascal's triangle.

00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:29.188
We could have said okay
this is the binomial,

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.544
now this is when I raise it to

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.208
the second power as 1 2
1 are the coefficients.

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:35.376
When I raise it to the third power,

00:06:35.376 --> 00:06:38.407
the coefficients are 1, 3, 3, 1.

00:06:38.407 --> 00:06:40.795
When I raise it to the fourth power

00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:45.416
the coefficients are 1, 4, 6, 4, 1

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:48.027
and when I raise it to the fifth power

00:06:48.027 --> 00:06:50.631
which is the one we care
about, the coeffiencients

00:06:50.631 --> 00:07:03.994
are going to be 1, 5, 10, 5
or sorry 10, 10, 5, and 1.

00:07:03.994 --> 00:07:05.849
And we know that when we go,

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:07.930
this is going to be the third term so

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.840
this is going to be the
coefficient right over here.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.896
1, 2, 3, third term.

00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:14.016
So either way we know that this is 10.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.737
But now let's try to answer
our original question.

00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:16.792
What is this going to be?

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.808
What are we multiplying times
X to the sixth, Y to the sixth?

00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:22.544
And now we just have to essentially
rewrite this expression.

00:07:22.544 --> 00:07:27.632
So it's going to be 10
times 3 to the third power,

00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:33.480
3 to the third power, times
Y squared to the third power,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.272
which is Y squared to the third
power is Y to the sixth power.

00:07:37.272 --> 00:07:38.992
Y to the sixth power.

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:45.511
Times six squared so
times six squared times X

00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:48.864
to the third squared which
that's X to the 3 times 2

00:07:48.864 --> 00:07:53.608
or X to the sixth and so
this is going to be equal to.

00:07:53.608 --> 00:08:05.928
Let's see it's going to be
10 times 27 times 36 times 36

00:08:05.928 --> 00:08:07.536
and then we have, of course,

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:12.617
our X to the sixth and Y to the sixth.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:14.856
So this is going to be, essentially,

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:18.160
let's see 270 times 36 so let's see,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.358
let's get a calculator out.

00:08:19.358 --> 00:08:22.144
270, I could have done it by
hand but I'll just do this

00:08:22.144 --> 00:08:26.591
for the sake of time, times 36 is 9,720.

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.920
So that's the coefficient right over here.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.019
It's going to be 9,720 X to
the sixth, Y to the sixth.

00:08:35.019 --> 23:59:59.999
9,720 X to the sixth, Y to
the sixth and we're done.
