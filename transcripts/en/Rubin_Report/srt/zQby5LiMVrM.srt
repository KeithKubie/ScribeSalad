1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,590
joining me today as a biologist,

3
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:11,591
a former professor at evergreen state
who is now a professor in exile Bret

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,270
Weinstein.
And welcome back to the Rubin report.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,720
Thanks for having me back on
professor and exile life friend.

6
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:19,790
That's what it says on your Twitter bio,

7
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,910
which means it's your most
defining characteristic right now.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,570
That has become the the tenor of my life.
All right,

9
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:30,050
so I went into the Rubin report archives.

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,850
They're very much like the Jedi archives.

11
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:35,900
I went into the Ruben report archives
this morning that you were on this show

12
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:40,880
originally on May 30th, 2017. So
that's about a year and a half ago.

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,510
It was just as the Evergreen
Brouhaha was beginning.

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,000
You, you still were
employed at the time, uh,

15
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:52,910
which probably seems like a lifetime ago.
Um,

16
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:56,960
so I think first maybe we should just
play a little catch up from then.

17
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:59,540
I just to be clear, you, you have
been on the show one since then.

18
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,860
You are on with your brother Eric.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,790
And we did a little bit about
evergreen in your life, but I saw,

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:08,570
I've thought first let's just do catch
up on, on what happened, where you're at,

21
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:09,440
where you're going,

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,500
and then we're going to do sort of new
territory and we're going to cover a

23
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,660
lotta biology and all that.
Great.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
So May 30th of 2017 would be
exactly one week into the riots.

25
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:27,591
The protests at my classroom that became
relatively famous happened on May 23rd

26
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:30,150
so one weekend I was sitting in this chair

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,010
and that feels like a lifetime ago,
doesn't it?

28
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,870
I mean it feels like it for me and
I think less has happened to me,

29
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,160
although it's been a pretty
busy year and a half.

30
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,210
The transformation of my life and
Heather's life in that period has been so

31
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,620
dramatic that it's hard to even relate.
You know?

32
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,290
I've never had so much happen in a year.

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,650
Yeah. So, okay. So for people that
don't know anything about the story,

34
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,720
and I suspect there's very few
watching this at the moment,

35
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,260
can you give me like the
92nd recap of what happened?

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,050
So can that be done in 90 seconds?
Let's see.

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,150
It can be done with with carnage.

38
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,870
I'll say I feared this question more
than any other because there's so much

39
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:10,710
detail in the story. It can't
be covered properly. Give,

40
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,980
give a cliff notes version
that basically as an explainer,

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,040
equity and inclusion movement got started
on my campus as it is on virtually

42
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,880
every campus.

43
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,710
And the new president of
Evergreen threw fuel on the fire.

44
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:31,450
He used the division over that issue
to accomplish things he could not have

45
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,740
accomplished otherwise.

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,280
I tried to block his moves to dismantle
the excellent part of Evergreen's

47
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,580
teaching model, which Heather
and I were using to full effect.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,120
And I became effectively enemy number one
of this equity and inclusion movement.

49
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,960
They arranged a protest at my classroom.
Very dramatic.

50
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,240
50 students showed up
demanding my resignation.

51
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,680
Not a single one of them was a
student I had ever encountered. Um,

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,000
but in any case,
they made a terrible error.

53
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,850
They filmed their confrontation with me.
They uploaded it.

54
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,750
I now know to Facebook somebody
else in the public, uh,

55
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,130
picked those videos up and broadcast
them in the world, watched me,

56
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:18,380
tried to reason with them.
And uh,

57
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:23,490
that set things in motion where evergreen
started using me as an excuse for its

58
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,420
problems.

59
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:30,420
It blamed me for what happened there
for the drop off in enrollment for all

60
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,400
sorts of things.
And uh,

61
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,170
I started engaging with the public about
what was taking place at Evergreen, uh,

62
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,230
issues of freedom of expression,

63
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,260
free inquiry on college campuses and
increasingly a evolutionary biology,

64
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:49,080
which, you know, people, uh,

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,960
did not initially really understand that
that was the focus that I had not uh,

66
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:55,240
freedom of speech issues.

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,910
Now increasingly that's what
people want to talk to me about,

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,280
although we going to get to plenty of
that because I know that's what you're,

69
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,160
your real focus and passion is.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,180
And it's sort of funny that now
you've been thrust into this. Um,

71
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,810
but in effect you were protesting
putting racist policies on campus.

72
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:20,230
Is that fair to say? Yes, and
this is one of the, I think,

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,770
hardest lessons for people to learn.
People,

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
good people get the idea that you can
spot the right side by certain heuristics.

75
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,410
And you know,

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
there's been a historical fact of
oppressed people tending to be people of

77
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,220
color,
et cetera.

78
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,300
And so people have gotten lazy about
recognizing who's in the right.

79
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,860
If you follow a principle to its
logical conclusions. In other words,

80
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,650
if you're against segregation,
for example, as I am,

81
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,130
then when the segregationists are telling
white people to leave campus or asking

82
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:02,770
them to leave campus, then you are
committed to standing against segregation.

83
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,900
And when you do stand against segregation,

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,700
the world goes crazy
because people who are, um,

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,880
being lazy about recognizing which side
is defending the principle that they,

86
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,070
they subscribe to, uh, they fall out
in the wrong place. And so anyway,

87
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:22,390
yes, it is your principles and adherence
to them that gets you in trouble. Yeah.

88
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:22,811
Okay.

89
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:27,720
So you then show up in this studio a
week after this whole thing goes down.

90
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,330
It was your first public
interview about any of this.

91
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,100
What did you think at the time was
going to happen by talking about this

92
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,510
publicly or, or what was your hope at
least by talking about this publicly?

93
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,240
Well,
you know,

94
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:48,241
initially my hope was to expose the
foolishness at evergreen and save the

95
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,510
college from its own
worst instincts because

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,380
your audience may not care
terribly deeply about this,

97
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:04,670
but for a small number of people,
for 4,000 students at a time,

98
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,970
Evergreen was actually a wonderful
experiment in which it was possible for

99
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:13,570
people who hadn't had tremendous,
uh,

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,990
educational advantages before they got
to college to have an experience that

101
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,610
couldn't be reproduced anywhere else.

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,270
Evergreens model was so unique that if
you ended up in the right classrooms with

103
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:27,520
professors who really cared, it was,
it was like no other place. And,

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,280
and you were given incredible,
uh,

105
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,710
freedom as a professor to do what
you wanted with these kids. Right.

106
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,850
I believe that the position that Heather
and I had was the freest academic

107
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:44,170
position in the country
and maybe on earth. Wow.

108
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,940
I mean, really more freedom than a
tenured professor at Harvard has.

109
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,900
And that was, let's be honest, it
was both a blessing and a curse.

110
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,140
If you decided to use
that freedom for good,

111
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,350
if you decided to figure out how to
innovate structures that didn't exist

112
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:02,350
anywhere else, you could do it
and nobody could tell you not to.

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,360
On the other hand, if you
decided to, uh, you know,

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,340
take the rest of your career off and
you know, teach with one hand while you,

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,460
you know, dealt with your hobbies,
you could also get away with murder.

116
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:16,510
And so that happened as well. And
you know, there was a tension every,

117
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:20,290
every good professor at evergreen grumbles
about the fact that there are a large

118
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,690
number of people who,
uh,

119
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,280
are holding positions there that they
don't really value. And you know, the,

120
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,300
the phrase that we,

121
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,610
that we typically used in private on
the faculty was that Evergreen paid in

122
00:07:33,611 --> 00:07:38,080
freedom, which meant, um,
that it didn't pay well.

123
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:39,280
It wasn't a good paying job,

124
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:44,080
but the ability to have a blank
canvas and decide how you were,

125
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,150
you know,
what you wanted to teach and in what way,

126
00:07:46,151 --> 00:07:50,920
and to innovate new mechanisms and take
students off campus for a week or two or

127
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,510
10.
Um,

128
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,860
that freedom was a very
valuable commodity,

129
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:59,650
that Evergreen undervalued
the whole time it should have.

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,890
It should have leveled with people that
it was hiring and it should have said,

131
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,470
look,
this job is not going to make you wealthy,

132
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:08,440
but it can make you very happy if you
have the temperament that really wants to

133
00:08:08,441 --> 00:08:09,460
figure out what's possible.

134
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,300
So as this was unfolding and now you went
public and you also did Rogan and you

135
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,700
were on Tucker Carlson where you said,

136
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:21,701
I'm deeply progressive because suddenly
you were sort of getting crap from your

137
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,760
side, so to speak, and you were getting
embraced by perhaps a different side.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,300
And I do want to get a little more into
that now because it shows what a sort of

139
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:32,710
crazy realignment politically
we've had these days. Um,

140
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,200
were you shocked how deep it
went? So you went public, you are,

141
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,490
you are giving the facts,

142
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:41,480
you were exposing sort of the corruption
and how it went all the way up to the

143
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:45,350
administration and all that.
I think from that first interview we did,

144
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,660
I think you thought that there would
be a course correction in your,

145
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,310
or at least there was a chance for a
course correction and at least the way I

146
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,480
read the last year,

147
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,540
at no point was there a slow down or any
reflection from the administration and

148
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,080
the rest of it,
they just went in on it.

149
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:01,670
Yes.

150
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,670
I am completely shocked by the fact
that the world's recognition of just how

151
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,300
awful things were at evergreen did not
force an acknowledgement that something

152
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,050
was wrong.

153
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:20,050
So I would not have been surprised if
evergreen had backed off cynically if they

154
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:26,150
had privately said, actually we were on
the right track, we were misportrayed and,

155
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,780
but we nonetheless have to acknowledge
what the world is saying to us.

156
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:34,340
The fact that that did not happen at all
still shocks me and I can't explain it

157
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,820
because you have a president who
is widely understood to be a,

158
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,410
is there a polite word for bonds?

159
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,580
He's bonkers. He's is one of my favorite
words. Yeah. I like bananas too,

160
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:53,500
but bonkers whackadoodles Yang. But in
any case, we have a president who was,

161
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,610
I mean, look, he's the mad king, right?

162
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,720
He's the mad king and you've got a whole
bunch of people standing around, um,

163
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,920
accepting his authority when
in fact he's an outsider,

164
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,130
is understanding of the college,
uh,

165
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,180
or his plans for the college
are completely inconsistent
with the values that

166
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:14,980
the college was founded on.
Yeah.

167
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,100
And where are they really
accepting as Athari actually,

168
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,190
because there are moments in,

169
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,150
in the chaos of this that these videos
are posted where he can't even leave to

170
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:25,380
go to the bathroom. And it's like he
was also a hostage in this, in his own,

171
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
maybe his own like perverted
dream or something.

172
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,980
You know what I mean?
He was,

173
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,450
um, both puppet and puppeteer.
Yeah. Okay. Um, and so the thing is,

174
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:39,820
yes,
he is held hostage in those things,

175
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:43,030
but I believe he's a willing hostage in
the sense that he's trying to accomplish

176
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:46,480
something and you know, look,
it tells the whole tail.

177
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,590
Once you say what we are
doing is about equity,

178
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,470
there is a whole swath of people that
cannot figure out how they would object no

179
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:58,650
matter what it is that you say next,
no matter what your plan is.

180
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,150
If you've said that it is for
the purpose of racial equity,

181
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,630
then a whole section of the
population will just fall in lockstep.

182
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,120
What is that? What is that
psychologically do you think? Oh,

183
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,340
I know because I think we're
seeing this everywhere now.

184
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,740
This is not just something that's
happening at universities anymore.

185
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:19,190
This is happening all over
society. I wish I could. I could

186
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,190
say that it is an error in cognition
that people are seeing it incorrectly.

187
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,430
What I know for sure now as well as
anybody on earth is that the part of

188
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,740
people's minds that drives them
in the direction of silence,

189
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:37,820
of self editing,

190
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,300
of all of these things is
actually accurately perceiving
a threat that it cannot

191
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:47,870
manage. Now, I'm not looking for sympathy.

192
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,000
I do not have my job anymore.
And I miss it. It was a great,

193
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,050
however, I've landed on my feet, I'm, I
wouldn't trade my position for any other.

194
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,200
I like where I am. However, first of all,

195
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,660
there's not an infinite number
of those positions in the world.

196
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,120
So most people who are looking at
some sort of an equity and inclusion

197
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,850
juggernaut who are thinking,
should I stand up,

198
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,580
actually have to ask themselves
what happens if I do? Um,

199
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,760
do I have an economic plan
B for my family? Right?

200
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,870
Anybody who doesn't have an economic plan
B for their family. And I have to say,

201
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,010
as much as I would like evergreen to
be a place in which all the faculty had

202
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:33,850
enough skills that they
could go do something else.
If they have to, they don't.

203
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,500
Right? They can't easily move to another
college because the way they teach at

204
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:43,450
Evergreen doesn't, uh, create a CV that
will get you hired elsewhere easily. Um,

205
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,190
and so I think lots of people
are looking ahead and saying,

206
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:53,080
if I stand up and I say the
right thing now, what, what will,

207
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:57,240
what will become of me? And the
problem, the place where I, you know,

208
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:00,670
I have sympathy for anybody who sees that
and says, look, I don't have a plan B.

209
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:01,600
I don't know what to do.

210
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,020
Where I lose sympathy with them is when
they then having made that calculation,

211
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,370
rationalize what they are saying
and they join, not reluctantly,

212
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:17,371
but they become enthusiastic allies
of this movement in order to,

213
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,790
uh, basically they sell
the rest of us out. Right.

214
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,690
And in a weird way,

215
00:13:21,691 --> 00:13:25,500
they almost have to do that
psychologically to live
with themselves. Right.

216
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,011
I mean,

217
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:30,810
otherwise you realize that mean
then you are a sellout in the,

218
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,470
you know, it, it's harsh, but it's
true. But what I'm so fat, why?

219
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,260
The reason I'm so fascinated
with this is because as you know,

220
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:41,580
I've been on tour with Peterson for the
last couple months and I think this is

221
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:44,070
the number one question that we get asked.

222
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,060
People want to speak up and they
are afraid of losing their jobs.

223
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,080
And I think that's why your
story resonated with so
many people because people

224
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,630
were looking at you and going,
well, it's pretty freaking obvious.

225
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:57,950
This guy is not a racist. He's not
a hater. He's a self identified,

226
00:13:57,951 --> 00:14:00,240
left d and progressive
and all of these things.

227
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,760
And somehow he stood up to the monster.

228
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:05,460
And I think the fact that you're
still here and you're, you're at,

229
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,140
you're not employed at the moment.

230
00:14:07,141 --> 00:14:09,090
And I W I do want to discuss
that a little bit too,

231
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,950
but the fact that you're still here,
you're alive,

232
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,720
you're still willing to
talk about these things.

233
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,690
I think that's the type of courage that
people are looking for at the moment.

234
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,060
Well, you know, I do.

235
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,390
So I have to say for I know a year now,
uh,

236
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,370
I have had these interactions,
you know,

237
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:30,450
a couple of times a day somebody will
come up to me on the street and unless I'm

238
00:14:30,451 --> 00:14:34,200
in Olympia, it's always
nice. People have people,

239
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,680
even sons beard,

240
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,430
they're still coming up to actually that
has reduced that I think are not quite

241
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:43,290
sure. Yeah. There is that who I think
it is or is that Eric or is it provided?

242
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,930
I don't know. But you go buzz cut and,
and then you're Scott free then. Oh Man,

243
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:50,890
I'd be, yeah, I could go on the
Lam. They'd never find me. Yeah. Um,

244
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,100
but

245
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,810
the thing is the,

246
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,320
it raises questions.

247
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,260
The stuff that people say to me about
what they see on the outside, you know,

248
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:03,290
I get to compare that to what
the experience was on the inside.

249
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:06,920
And so I've done a lot of thinking
about what it is, is, you know,

250
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,420
is there some reason that that I stood
up when others didn't. And I think,

251
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,730
you know, it comes down to something
simple, which, you know, I'll just,

252
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll just put it out there.

253
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,220
I think people are rationalizing their
acceptance of this nonsense movement in

254
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:27,260
order to sleep.

255
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,850
And for some reason that particular
switch works the opposite way from me.

256
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,080
If I heard myself rationalizing
that I would not be able to sleep.

257
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,150
So in order to sleep I had
to stand up and you know,

258
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,880
I'm lucky, I have really good friends.
I have a wonderful brother who was,

259
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,380
you know, friends with you and
that put us in contact and uh,

260
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,470
I have something else to talk about.

261
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,140
Evolutionary biology is
fascinating to people.

262
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:00,680
They don't know how to think
about it. And there, you know,

263
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,590
just as my students where they're very
interested to hear what I have to say on

264
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,050
the subject.
So that means somehow,

265
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:09,860
even though I couldn't see it
exactly on May 23rd of 2017,

266
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,910
there was a path forward
for me, which, you know,

267
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,010
it could come crashing down tomorrow,

268
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,490
but so far it looks good and I,

269
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,350
I regret nothing.

270
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,530
Is there an evolutionary explanation
to that type of person that either can

271
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,610
sleep or cannot sleep?
Because you know,

272
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,520
people come up to all of us all the time.
Now and they say,

273
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:38,510
I wish I could speak up. I don't want
to lose my job. My wife's pissed at me.

274
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:39,770
I mean all of these things.
And they're literally,

275
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:42,400
sometimes I'm talking to people one on
one and they're whispering, I mean this,

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,520
this,

277
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,520
this layer of fear is seriously real
and it is sitting on top of people.

278
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:54,671
So is there an evolutionary explanation
why at the moment it seems that a very

279
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:58,640
small amount of people are doing
it? Absolutely. And for me,

280
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,220
just quickly,
I would just say for me it's like,

281
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,110
I don't know if it's about sleeping,
I just,

282
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,670
I just feel like I'm doing what's right.
That's it. It's actually not more,

283
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,763
uh,

284
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,010
you know,

285
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,090
it's not more a confusing or
needs more of an explanation

286
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,050
and then that, that's just
what I'm doing. Um, yeah,

287
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,740
there are two things to say on this front.
One,

288
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:26,330
so I know we're going to talk more about
evolutionary theory later on, but yeah,

289
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,980
there is a way in which evolutionary
theory stalled 30 years ago and I don't

290
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:39,010
believe that the explanation that you're
looking for is on the table in the way

291
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,890
that you know any evolutionists
that you asked, but say, Oh yeah,

292
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:44,890
the explanation is over here,
but I do believe we can see what it is.

293
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,770
There are a lot of adaptations that
do not map well onto the individual.

294
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,940
If you look at the individual and you say,
well,

295
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,740
why would the person behave this way?

296
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,360
It seems paradoxical sometimes if
you look at something larger than the

297
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:03,090
individual and it's not the group.
This is the thing.

298
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:07,830
We've been caught in this argument about
group selection since the 60s and or

299
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:11,460
actually even earlier, but that's
where it began to come to a head.

300
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,900
If you look at the lineage that is to say
a population of people who are related

301
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,100
now talking about ancestral
ancestral populations,

302
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,220
there are many,
uh,

303
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,440
characteristics that have value
for the lineage moving forward,

304
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,860
that are hard to understand from the point
of view of the individual and many of

305
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,620
the things that we have a
really hard time explaining,

306
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:41,850
including things like
homosexuality and religion. Um,

307
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,050
many of these things are adaptations
that exist at that slightly higher level.

308
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,290
And so what I would say is an individual
who can't sleep if they're not doing

309
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:59,301
the right thing or if they hear themselves
rationalizing that individual is not

310
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:02,480
well suited to certain jobs.
Um,

311
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,860
but they're very well
suited to other jobs.

312
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,570
And the idea that a population
has an emergent nature and that,

313
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,540
you know, a division of
labor between, you know,

314
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,640
I'm not telling you that not
rationalizing is the way we should all be.

315
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,180
It may well be that we need certain
people who are very good at carefully

316
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:25,590
rationalizing certain things in
order to get jobs done. I mean,

317
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:29,280
I would imagine if you
are in the military,

318
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,370
if you were in a position
of command in the military,

319
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,540
that there are certain things that you
have to rationalize in order to win the

320
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,410
war. Now, I'm not saying
I don't like war. Uh,

321
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,270
I'm not saying that, you
know, every war should be one.

322
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,620
You know, you shouldn't enter into
a war that, uh, isn't justified.

323
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,160
But once you've entered into it,
the goal is justified.

324
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,350
Maybe you have to rationalize
certain things. You know,

325
00:19:55,351 --> 00:20:00,351
you move troops over here in order
to protect something over there.

326
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,040
Well, what are you doing to these people?
You may be sending them to their deaths.

327
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:07,500
So, you know, I even talking
about it makes it makes me
uncomfortable because, uh,

328
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,450
it's not something I would be good at.
But the point is,

329
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,920
when you look at the population and the
fact is the populations that we have

330
00:20:16,921 --> 00:20:20,610
alive on earth today are all winners,
right? These are the winners.

331
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,300
Irrespective of how you got here.
You're respective of how, uh,

332
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,260
oppressed your population
looks in relation to other,

333
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:30,470
somehow you made it to the
president. You're a winner. Um,

334
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,840
those winning populations
had many characteristics
within them and they knew how

335
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,840
to call upon these people and you know,

336
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,170
sideline those people and then switch
it up at the point you arrive somewhere

337
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:47,130
else. We're different skills are
necessary. So, um, in essence, yeah,

338
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,440
I think there's a very simple evolutionary
explanation and some of us have

339
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,330
certain skills,
other people have other skills.

340
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:55,990
And the real trick is can you figure
out the switching mechanism that decides

341
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,550
what to call on?
At what moment?

342
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,020
That seems to be the key part of
this, right? I mean, that's it.

343
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:04,180
It's like some people are going to do it.
Some people,

344
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,460
some people know they should
do it and won't do it.

345
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:10,690
Some people probably shouldn't do it
and do, do it and everything in between.

346
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,250
Well,

347
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,670
you know, you probably have
this experience too, but when I,

348
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,590
when people come up to
me and they talk to me,

349
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,970
there's just a couple of different
styles of conversation that unfold. Um,

350
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,130
you know, there's lots of
people who want to, you know,

351
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,730
apologize for what happened to me,
which I always find that odd. You know,

352
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,190
unless they were there in the room, right.
Unless it was them just never knows.

353
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,190
But I'm guessing those people have nothing
about him that you never contacted me.

354
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,730
But you know, some people want
to apologize, some people,

355
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,500
you know,
I want to thank me and some people,

356
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:46,450
there's this one thread which is I'm
facing something like this too. Yeah.

357
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,090
Can you give me some advice?
And you know,

358
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:54,040
I always say the same sort of thing
to them and it throws them, you know,

359
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:57,100
I always say, look, it's not safe.

360
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,370
You have to think very carefully about
what you're doing and don't kid yourself

361
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,050
about what you're signing up
for and you know, you can,

362
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,210
you just watch in their eyes as they,
um,

363
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,620
grapple with the fact that they
didn't get what they wanted from me,

364
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:15,880
what they want it to be told. They wanted
somebody to egg them on and say, do it.

365
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:20,470
It's the right thing. It'll work out. And
you tell them, oh, it may not work out.

366
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,930
And you know,
there's a moment of heartbreak,

367
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,931
but my hope is that the people who should
do it have to go through that little

368
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,750
heartbreak in order to
get to the other side.

369
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:36,070
And so among my various,
uh,

370
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,640
jobs at the moment is to show
people the abyss and just say,

371
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,080
look, is this the abyss
you want to jump? If it is,

372
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,170
nobody can tell you that, but
you, I certainly can. Yeah.

373
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:54,190
It would be irresponsible of me to tell
people to do something like what I did.

374
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:55,840
Because you could get,
you could get maimed.

375
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,280
Yeah. And in a way it's, it's sort
of the shows that I'm most proud of.

376
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,840
Here are the ones where I was able
to facilitate a little bit of that.

377
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,070
So it's sitting down with you.

378
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,830
It's sitting down with Lindsay Shepherd
who went through something very similar

379
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,910
and sitting down with James Damore,
these people who did not ask to,

380
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,320
to be heroes, who even if I say the word
hero, I can see you're uncomfortable.

381
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:19,690
You know what I mean?
Like the people that didn't want this,

382
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,840
but somehow it got thrust upon them.
And then,

383
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:26,080
and then they got there and then hopefully
I was able to amplify that a little

384
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:29,680
bit, which then spreads that out
to all sorts of other people,

385
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,420
which is pretty cool. So let's, let's,

386
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,760
I know I don't want to do this for
obviously the entire interview,

387
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:36,640
so let's just catch up on a couple
of things. What we'll do a bit more.

388
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:37,500
So there's one

389
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,840
thing that is, and I believe
there's a little caveat to it.

390
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,040
If you do it and you'd do it for
the right reasons, in other words,

391
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,040
you could do it cynically.

392
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,850
You could stand up against one of these
things in order to see if you couldn't

393
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,090
get famous or something. People
will see through that, right?

394
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,470
Especially the people who've gone
ahead down this road because they know

395
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:00,680
something about it. Um, but if
you do it for the right reasons,

396
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:05,540
if you're really trying to advance
the ball to challenge a bad narrative,

397
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,770
the people who have gone through
this recognize and you know,

398
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,810
it won't feed you,

399
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,110
but it is very reassuring to
discover other people who see a,

400
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,160
the corrupt narrative who understand
what happens when you challenge it. Um,

401
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,850
so anyway, if, if you're hungry
to meet other people like that,

402
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,280
uh, standing up, you know,

403
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,080
you got to figure out what they're
going to do to feed yourself,

404
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:40,490
but it does put you in contact with lots
of people who, uh, are very worthwhile.

405
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,060
Yeah. It's so interesting because
again, after being with Peterson,

406
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:46,840
it's like people say to him, you
know, I want to get a new job.

407
00:24:46,841 --> 00:24:48,070
Should I just quit my job tomorrow?

408
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:50,860
And it's like you have to seriously
think about what your options are.

409
00:24:50,861 --> 00:24:53,690
You may hate your job, but doesn't
mean you can leave tomorrow. Right?

410
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,320
You got to think about
all of this seriously.

411
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:57,790
And I think that that is the key here.

412
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So I'm curious how much of this has
shifted what you think politically,

413
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:07,480
because you do talk about politics now.

414
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,080
And I know when I had you in there for
the first time, I think I said to you,

415
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,460
we'll revisit this question because
I thought, here's a guy that's that.

416
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:17,710
I come from a very
similar political places,

417
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:22,030
him as a progressive and all
of these things. And now I
see, you know, as you know,

418
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:25,240
I consider myself a classical liberal
and I, and I love libertarian ideas.

419
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,200
Obviously we just did stand up
together last night in Bray California.

420
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:33,400
You and your brother joined me on stage
for the second half and it was mostly a

421
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,500
conservative crowd.
There were some Trump people,

422
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:37,680
there were some lefties and some liberals,
but you know,

423
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,110
mostly conservatives
and they love you guys.

424
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,310
And yet you both still identify
as lefties and the whole thing.

425
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,920
And I wonder now,
a year and a half later,

426
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,250
are you shocked at that,

427
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,280
that you are now really liked by people
that perhaps you thought were your yogic

428
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,360
opponents and now you're sort of on the
outs with the people that you used to be

429
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:05,590
allies with? Okay, that's, that's a
good question. I get one every episode.

430
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,200
Um,
I am

431
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
hardened and flabbergasted by
what I encounter on the center.

432
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,340
Right.
You know,

433
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:21,020
this is not the Republican party
that I remember from my youth.

434
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:26,230
This is a very different entity and I
think it has a lot of refugees who had

435
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:32,540
been driven out of other places and
they've grouped there because I don't,

436
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,000
because, because something over
there is making sense to them.

437
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,000
Well, as you said to me
the first time we met Dave,

438
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,780
you have PTSD for vehicle from
the, yeah. I must say we should,

439
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,310
we should return to this,
but I, I, uh, was very

440
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:48,300
heartened to hear you bring that up.
Um, during your episode with, uh,

441
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,560
with Ben Shapiro and Eric
and, and Jordan, you, uh,

442
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,330
you went through a cool exercise,
which I think deserves a place. Um,

443
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,160
with steel manning and your exercise I
think was something like where is some

444
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:07,161
place that you suspect your own thinking
might be incorrect and you brought up

445
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:11,160
political PTSD as a place
to pay attention to.

446
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,920
But let's just say I am shocked that uh,

447
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,910
the center right seems to be,
you know,

448
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:25,911
it has protective custody of liberty and
free speech and science of all things.

449
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:27,540
I mean,

450
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:32,540
how the heck did the center right ended
up ended up having custody of these

451
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:36,690
things which are traditionally things
that the writers is uneasy about on the

452
00:27:36,691 --> 00:27:39,240
left, uh, has, has
defended. But nonetheless,

453
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,400
the people who value
them are where they are.

454
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,260
I think they do have something wrong.
You, your, your initial question was,

455
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,240
has this changed my political view?

456
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:52,530
And I think one of the everybody
said it would. And I, you know, I,

457
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,620
I believe I am being honest with myself
when I say really hasn't changed my view

458
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:03,741
of what is true
politically much if at all.

459
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,830
I think because what I believe is true
isn't predicated on anything social.

460
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,491
Right?
In other words,

461
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:14,880
these are conclusions that I reached
through game theory and evolutionary

462
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:19,860
thinking and observation of the political
landscape. They're not things, you know,

463
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,000
it wasn't that I went to a dinner party
and had a good time and fell in with

464
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:28,560
their political ideas. Right? So it's
not, you know, the fact that I am not,

465
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,250
um,
welcomed in certain quadrants of the left,

466
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,430
it doesn't change anything about
what's true at all. Right. It can't.

467
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,860
So I, I understand that, but
at the same time, I mean,

468
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:42,680
you can go to, I've done public
events with you that are usually,

469
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:46,590
we're usually invited by libertarian
organizations. Um, we've done some iron,

470
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,530
ran things together and,
and a couple of other things.

471
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,860
And I think everything that we've done
publicly and when you joined me for stand

472
00:28:51,861 --> 00:28:54,710
up, the crowds all basically seem to
be on the right, as you're saying,

473
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:56,750
this sort of new, this new center, right.

474
00:28:56,751 --> 00:28:59,640
That maybe needs a better phrase
than that concenter rights.

475
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,530
It needs something sexier than
that per se. Um, but I mean,

476
00:29:03,531 --> 00:29:07,640
have you been invited anywhere by
progressive's to tell your story or to get

477
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,820
some comradery or empathy or sympathy
or Kudos or anything other than GFE very

478
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:16,304
occasionally

479
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,020
and only slightly. I mean,
the, the asymmetry is amazing.

480
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:24,820
And I must say one of the most interesting
things to me about the early phase

481
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,550
of, um, you know,

482
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,720
just public part of my life
is that initially there
was just this overwhelming,

483
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,370
uh, uh, message that came back at me.

484
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:40,480
You are a conservative or welcome to
conservatism or something like that.

485
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,540
And to the dark side I think is
what they usually do. Say that.

486
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,820
And then at the point that,
uh,

487
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,840
the phrase IDW showed up on the landscape,

488
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,900
then there was this point about,
oh, the IDW is, uh, you know,

489
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,690
right wing movement or
something like that.

490
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,890
And so there's a trajectory there.
There's something,

491
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,840
we track immediate effects pretty well
as people we can observe them and detect

492
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:05,674
them.

493
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,390
There's often a slower pattern
that is harder for us to see.

494
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,620
And so just by analogy, I find this
as true with healing, you know,

495
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:17,740
just physical healing. If you do
damage to your knee, for example,

496
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,560
there's a one month healing trajectory,

497
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,130
but there's also a one year and a five
year trajectory and they're much harder

498
00:30:24,131 --> 00:30:27,160
to spot. Um, so anyway, the,

499
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,490
the interesting thing is the challenge
of you're on the right or now,

500
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:34,990
surely you will be moving to the right.
You know,

501
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:39,490
that was just an overwhelming
message that came back. Um, but the

502
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,680
ability to talk back to that
message and say, actually, no,

503
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,760
still on the left, actually part of a
left, you don't even remember exists.

504
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:53,761
And one of my fears is that all of the
stuff that the left was correct about is

505
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:57,880
not getting properly credited now.
So to the extent,

506
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,790
I don't know if people have seen this,
a hidden tribes,

507
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:06,330
a report that came out maybe a month
ago now that says that there's this vast

508
00:31:07,151 --> 00:31:11,860
Alsace, yeah, 80% in the middle
of do agree on, you know,

509
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,970
the desirability of a fair society that
doesn't burden one population in order

510
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:18,790
to enrich another. And you
know, that we basically share

511
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,990
that basically it's only 8% actually
that buy into this hyper political

512
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:27,220
correctness and the, and the rest of that,
it's a tiny fringe, the authoritarian

513
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:32,370
left and it's a tiny fringe on the,
you know, the white nationalists,

514
00:31:32,371 --> 00:31:35,820
right. And the rest of us in the middle,
you know, we're not in perfect agreement,

515
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:37,590
we don't agree on the
order of the priorities,

516
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:42,150
but we do agree basically on what
a good society would function like.

517
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,260
And that a lot of the
gains, I mean, you know,

518
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,830
the ability to be gay and out and
function in society without that being a

519
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,470
tremendous obstacle that that's
something that, you know,

520
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,580
the left deserves credit for
racial equality. You know,

521
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,530
equity is a different beast
by virtue of the new, uh,

522
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,220
I hesitate to even call it at definition
because it's not a definition in the

523
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,500
standard sense,
but it quality.

524
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,050
These are traditional left
values and we were right about.

525
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,450
And so the fact that these things are
now no longer controversial that belongs

526
00:32:18,451 --> 00:32:20,700
in the discussion to the left
has been right about some stuff.

527
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,840
It's also been wrong about some stuff
and the right has been right about some

528
00:32:24,841 --> 00:32:28,380
stuff and it's been wrong about some stuff
and it is time for that conversation.

529
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,250
Absolutely. And that's why I
don't denigrate what it was.

530
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,310
I am upset with what it is and perhaps
guys like you and your brother and Sam,

531
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:40,430
some people that still identify as left,

532
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:45,290
these will be able to do a reclamation
project that I just don't see anymore.

533
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:49,610
I see sort of more that this thing
needs to burn. So out of the ashes,

534
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:52,670
the Phoenix can rise. That's just
maybe a little bit of a tactical thing,

535
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,940
but let's just jump back to an
evolutionary explanation for some of this.

536
00:32:55,941 --> 00:33:00,110
So I asked you about why some people can
do this from an evolution evolutionary

537
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,470
perspective, why some people are able
to step up and some people aren't.

538
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,190
What about,

539
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,810
what's the evolutionary
explanation for why this,

540
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,910
let's say 8% very loud,

541
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:14,780
but small group of people feel the
need to purge everyone. Is there,

542
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,070
is there an evolutionary,

543
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,770
because that seems it would be
almost counter to evolution.

544
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:23,300
You'd want to have more commonalities
with people and bring in a big tent.

545
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:28,070
But what I see them consistently doing is
just getting rid of everybody who dare,

546
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,420
you know, talk back to the,
to the God. Well, you know, I,

547
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,990
I wish I had known this was gonna come
up cause I would have looked it up,

548
00:33:35,991 --> 00:33:38,120
but there was, uh, there
was, uh, put me on the spot,

549
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,800
got a report that emerged.

550
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,460
Maybe it was six or eight months
ago that I don't, you know,

551
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:49,720
I haven't looked into it and it's
not my area of specialty, but, uh,

552
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:54,010
it sounded right to me. And what it
said was that there is a particular,

553
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:58,240
um,
there's a particular personality trait,

554
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,540
authoritarianism that isn't ideological.

555
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,230
It doesn't really care
whether it's, uh, you know,

556
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:10,030
defending fascism or communism,
um, what it wants to do,

557
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:11,170
his boss,
people around.

558
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,880
And that essentially what's confusing
to people is that at the moment,

559
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,650
these dyed in the wool authoritarians
are concentrated over on the left and

560
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:25,570
they're saying stuff that sounds
nominally like leftist stuff, but that,

561
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,021
you know,

562
00:34:26,021 --> 00:34:30,040
we're the winds to shift
and the authoritarians have
the moment to be over on

563
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:34,780
the right they be there. And so, uh, that,

564
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,400
that makes sense to me.

565
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,060
And what I would like people,

566
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,120
yourself included to consider is that
there is almost no point in engaging those

567
00:34:47,441 --> 00:34:48,580
people,
right?

568
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,250
This question of the importance
of liberty is settled, right?

569
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,050
The 80% of us in the middle all get

570
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,470
the fringe on the far left
and the far right are,

571
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,430
I don't want to say safe to ignore
because they can always rise up and become

572
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:10,150
important as the one on the
left is doing. Um, however,

573
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,850
that's not where the game is.

574
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,060
The game is all of the people who can't
figure out how to escape from the stigma

575
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,930
at all.
That is driving civilizations.

576
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:25,780
So all of the people who are falling
in line with what's going on on the

577
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:30,250
authoritarian left,
those are the people to reach.

578
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,440
And what you raise about,
you know,

579
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,930
let's say the audience last night
at the comedy club and you know,

580
00:35:34,931 --> 00:35:37,440
this is reliable,
this was the second one I with you.

581
00:35:37,441 --> 00:35:39,420
It was exactly the same the first time.

582
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,440
The thing that is so heartening is,

583
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,360
you know,
I can come into a room and you're right,

584
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:53,120
that room last night must've
been 95% right of center.

585
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:53,880
Yeah.

586
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,380
And first thing you tell them is here's a,

587
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,690
a progressive, I'm, I tell them
I'm a radical, right? Yeah.

588
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,010
It doesn't dampen their
enthusiasm one bit. In fact, it,

589
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,380
they're thrilled to discover that things
are not so bleak and that there is

590
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:16,650
somebody on the other side of this thing
who still talking reasonably and can

591
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,980
hear them and can see them and doesn't
think that they're racist and out of

592
00:36:19,981 --> 00:36:24,930
control. And so anyway, you know,
I know I take a lot of flack for,

593
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,470
you know,

594
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,640
interacting with the right and I am not
listening to that flack because it is

595
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:34,350
the best thing we can do is
to engage and uh, you know,

596
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:36,990
when you spot the humanity of
the people on the other side,

597
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,130
then to the extent that we differ
over something, we can talk about it.

598
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,750
All right. Well we could keep
going down this Pandora's box of,

599
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,070
of lunacy related to everything that
you've been through. But let's do,

600
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:51,530
let's just catch it up to where we are
now and we can start looking at the

601
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:54,100
future a little bit. So
you and your wife, Heather,

602
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,060
who you referenced how they're high end,
who's been on the show,

603
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,030
who's a brilliant professor as
well and, and, and has that,

604
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:02,780
that brave evolutionary
tick that you have to,

605
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,390
how'd you end up marrying a woman that
was going to have the same evolutionary

606
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,280
tickets? You, that's pretty good. Uh,

607
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,850
you really want to know the answer. Yeah,
I'm Heather and I, we were not going out,

608
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,400
but we were friends in
high school and you know,

609
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,150
I don't know that others will
understand the, the phrase,

610
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:23,151
but the one that runs in my head is
somebody goes to high school with the girl

611
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:28,020
you should marry and it might be you.
Right. So anyway, in my case, you know,

612
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:31,260
I don't know how because you
know, I was, I was a confused kid.

613
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,060
Like every other kid that age,

614
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,420
there was something about her
that seemed so very right.

615
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,880
And I have to say,
um,

616
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,940
I was right about that
best decision I ever made.

617
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,340
Was she ever pissed at you during this
because you sort of thrust her in the

618
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:52,550
spotlight too. And the fact
is both of you left your jobs,

619
00:37:52,551 --> 00:37:56,660
you got a $500,000 settlement
for two tenured positions,

620
00:37:56,661 --> 00:37:59,580
which to some people that out if I
hundred thousand dollars, I was like, oh,

621
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,570
that sounds like a lot of money.
But, but this is your life's work.

622
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:06,650
You and your wife, you've since relocated
your family and your two kids. Um,

623
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,340
so this is, this is massive. 500 grand
in the scheme of that is not a lot.

624
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,670
But was she ever sure,

625
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:15,450
uh, bothered or, or hesitant
by what you were doing?

626
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:19,050
Cause she didn't go public about
this until a bit after. Um,

627
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:23,370
she was never pissed.
Not for a minute.

628
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,250
She and I were in complete agreement.

629
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:30,210
We saw the same thing
unfolded evergreen. The, uh,

630
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:35,211
the nature of our teaching at Evergreen
was kind of interesting in the sense we

631
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:40,930
had like a little undeclared graduate
program and evolutionary biology where we

632
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:42,700
couldn't award you a master's degree,

633
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:46,270
but if you were interested in evolutionary
biology and many people didn't know

634
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:49,710
they were,
but they would take my program and uh,

635
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,270
then I would sort of nudge them
over towards Heather's program.

636
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:56,620
So we had students bouncing back and forth
and we had a community of people that

637
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,650
were, um, in our circle.

638
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,970
So the basic point is that creates a,

639
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,010
a,
an opportunity for every night at dinner.

640
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:10,600
Heather and I would compare notes,

641
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:13,780
what we were seeing at the college and
all of these things talk about, you know,

642
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,360
students, you know, what
the student's blind spot is,

643
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:20,740
what they do particularly well.
And as this unfolded,

644
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,370
Heather and I saw the identical picture,

645
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,240
or maybe the way to say it is the picture
of what was happening emerged between

646
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:32,830
us as we discussed it. And she
was, let's put it this way,

647
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,400
what put me in the bullseye
was the emails that I wrote.

648
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,170
And the thing is I said
in faculty meetings,

649
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,650
I never wrote an email that Heather didn't
look at first and tell me it's ready.

650
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,560
Um, and frankly there were a lot of emails
that I didn't send and if I made one

651
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,920
error, I believe I should have
sent every one of them, right.

652
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:59,350
Because what they do is they leave a,

653
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,170
a historical record of
what is taking place.

654
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:06,910
So the descent was in retrospect, very
clear as you went back through the emails.

655
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:10,690
Um, but anyway, yeah, Heather, Heather
was in complete agreement the whole time.

656
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,670
And I think,
uh,

657
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:18,510
the confrontation was less in keeping
with her personality traits than mine,

658
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,880
but in terms of her commitment and
her belief in what we were doing,

659
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:25,720
it was a team effort.

660
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,830
There's a lesson in
marriage right there at,

661
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,670
there's probably many lessons in
marriage. Okay. Yeah. All right,

662
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:35,570
so let's just get to where you are now.
You guys have left Washington.

663
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,840
Neither one of you are
teaching at the moment.

664
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,800
You're trying to figure out what your
future is. I assume the same with Heather.

665
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,560
What does that like,
number one and number two,

666
00:40:45,561 --> 00:40:49,940
I think a lot of people would be surprised
to know that schools have not thrown

667
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,680
offers at you.
I mean you,

668
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:55,340
you have a seriously great public profile.

669
00:40:55,341 --> 00:40:57,800
Now you are respected by so many people.
You have,

670
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,520
you have fans and not just students.
Now you have former students,

671
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:04,820
but you have fans that would love to
sign up for courses that you would be

672
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:07,940
teaching and all sorts of things where I
think most people would look at this on

673
00:41:07,941 --> 00:41:10,170
their face and think, wow,
what an asset this would,

674
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,100
this guy would be not only
intellectually but PR wise and all that.

675
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,130
That's not where we're at. It's
absolutely not. And it, uh,

676
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:19,880
it does say something and I'm,

677
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,340
I'm an outsider to whatever discussions
it is that result in nothing of that

678
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:28,420
sort coming our way, but
it is conspicuous. Um,

679
00:41:28,421 --> 00:41:33,410
so you asked what it's, what
it's like, um, you know,

680
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:34,850
I'm having a,
a,

681
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,520
a very unusual experience
in life and you know, my,

682
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,920
my life was great before any of
this happened. It's great now.

683
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,270
Um,

684
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,950
the lack of security is
frightening when I stare at it,

685
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,130
you know, Heather and I have
two kids and if we didn't,

686
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,460
we would be in a different
position. We could take, uh,

687
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,200
risks and we could afford to go
through, you know, years of austerity.

688
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,450
But as it is,
we have responsibilities and you know,

689
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,980
our kids didn't sign up for this.

690
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,000
Hmm.
Um,

691
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,560
so I mean they would've let you
saying they didn't get that gene.

692
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,920
What are you telling me? Oh no,
they're bored. But yes. Yeah,

693
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:18,430
it's our responsibility to protect
them. And so, you know, the,

694
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:20,280
the whole thing has been,
uh,

695
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,070
frightening from the point of view of
what it means for the future because

696
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,620
literally,
I don't know,

697
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:31,570
it seems like things are headed
along a path in which, you know,

698
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,610
the settlement that you mentioned is
a tiny fraction of what we would have

699
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:38,960
earned over the rest of our
careers. And of course, green,

700
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,520
a huge amount of it was burned
up paying lawyers and, uh,

701
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,670
taxes, you know, you get
all that money in one chunk.

702
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:51,320
So we got about two years of buffer
money, uh, from that, but it wasn't,

703
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,470
it wasn't like we got bought out. We, uh,

704
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,000
we could have in a state
that had punitive damages,

705
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:01,850
we likely could have one,
uh,

706
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,690
something much more like 4 million bucks
for the amount of income that we would

707
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,910
have earned over the rest of our careers.

708
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,720
And, and why did you guys not go that
route? Because I think a lot of people,

709
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:16,360
when they saw the number,
I remember when I saw the number,

710
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:18,400
I think I just saw an article
or something and I was like,

711
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,700
Whoa, Whoa, whoa. Why so low?

712
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Because Washington was one of 11
states without punitive damages.

713
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,720
It's that sense.

714
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,730
Oh, I thought you said that Washington
did have punitive damages. Oh,

715
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:31,940
I just misheard you. Okay. So
that, that uh, that caused us

716
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,210
to, uh, effectively cut
our losses and decide that

717
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:38,850
there was nothing to be done.

718
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:42,510
We did the best we could with evergreen
and cutting our ties with them at the

719
00:43:42,511 --> 00:43:44,160
point that they made
it clear. I mean, they,

720
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,620
they behaved atrociously in
negotiations for one thing.

721
00:43:49,621 --> 00:43:50,790
They dragged their heels.

722
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:54,750
They wouldn't sit down with us until we
were already back on contract for the

723
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,050
next year, fully. Assuming that we
would be going back into a classroom,

724
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:01,080
but what would it be like to walk
onto a campus that is, you know,

725
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,740
paying a PR firm to demonize you.
Right. What would that be like?

726
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,620
And we would have done it, but they, uh,

727
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,080
they insulted us in negotiations. They
offered us panic buttons. Right. As if,

728
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,760
so panic buttons in the
room. Literally. Yeah. Like,

729
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:22,280
as if the problem was that
we were panicking, um,

730
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,870
rather than that they had,
you know,

731
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,670
they could have at least they offered
you a counter baseball bat. Right.

732
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,890
Wouldn't that have been nice?
Right. Something. Um, but
they didn't, and, you know,

733
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,900
hobbling the police, the, the whole thing
was a fiasco. So we cut our losses. We've,

734
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,650
we've moved, we moved to Portland,
uh, which is wonderful. Um,

735
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,300
I know that's in some ways,
not interpretation, but
it is a marvelous place.

736
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,130
The more progressive place.
Uh, it does seem that we have,

737
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:53,100
whether you're a glutton for punishment
on to the belly of the beast. Um, but I,

738
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:57,210
you know, the beauty of
Portland, you know, there's a
beauty in, there's a tragedy.

739
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,280
There is this,
uh,

740
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,550
equity and inclusion thing and it seems
to go up to the mayor's office who

741
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:08,670
happens to also frighteningly in a
parallel to evergreen be the police

742
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,310
commissioner so he can,
uh,

743
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,570
stand down the police and,
and has done so in some circumstances,

744
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:19,380
all that video from a couple of weeks
ago with Antifa basically running traffic

745
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:20,660
in the middle of Portland.
I mean it's,

746
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,650
it's unfathomable that that's happening
in the streets of the United States

747
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:29,550
city. Right, right. It is. They
are flirting with the same, I mean,

748
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:32,460
it is the same story as
evergreen, except, um,

749
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,230
this is a major American city.
You know, to have a college, uh,

750
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:43,100
play games with literal anarchy is
dangerous enough to have a city doing it.

751
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:47,340
Uh, I shutter to think you
didn't want to think about Texas.

752
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:50,310
I really on this tour,
I got to tell you a San Antonio,

753
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:52,890
I think you'd have a field day over
there. Well, but here's the thing.

754
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:56,370
The other part of liberalism
is also true in Portland.

755
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,820
So I never encounter,
uh,

756
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,760
the Antifa madness and the mayor and his,
uh,

757
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,010
confusion. You know, it's like
the mayor of your town. You never,

758
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,300
you never run into it. What
I do run into, he's a clean,

759
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,920
uh, functional city. People
as far as I can tell,

760
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,560
are very decent to each
other. Um, you know, uh,

761
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:24,450
they make provisions for cyclists
to commute around the place.

762
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,590
So I think in some sense,
Portland is,

763
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,660
it shows exactly the conflict between
the left better instincts in its worst

764
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:35,880
instincts. And, uh,

765
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,900
I hope that it will come around to the
kind of enlightened progressivism that

766
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:45,540
used to exist rather than
the naive progressivism that
seems to have taken over

767
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,320
[inaudible].
