00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:10.176
So, Teddy Roosevelt's son,
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.,

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.279
joins the Harvard
Freshman Football team.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.351
His first game,
the other team targeted him

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.253
because he's
the President's son,

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.855
and ... nose broken.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.891
Like, right away.
Put a huge gash on his face.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.729
So Teddy Roosevelt decided
that football's fantastic

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:32.798
but maybe a little bit
too violent.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.768
Maybe we could calm it down
and, you know,

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.703
in his spare time
he was President,

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:40.573
so he ended
the Russo-Japanese War

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.442
and then was like,
"I'm also going to fix ...

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.210
I'm going to save football."

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.415
Anyway,
what was I talking about?

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.583
Teddy Roosevelt?

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.452
So Teddy Roosevelt called
this meeting

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.622
with the heads of the college
football powerhouses

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:58.357
and he was like,
"Look, guys, football.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.693
Pretty violent, right?

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.496
Love the sport,
doing a great job,

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.364
let's not kill so many people?"

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:08.868
So the head coach of Yale,
Walter Camp,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.872
who was known as the father
of American football was like,

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.009
"Um, don't talk about
my sport that way.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.279
I made this sport, and we're
not going to change it.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.681
Football is football,
suck it bro."

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:23.816
So the President was like,

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.820
"Well, this guy just told me
to suck it bro,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.222
so I think the meeting
is adjourned.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:31.858
I think the meeting
is adjourned."

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.927
And so they didn't come
to any sort of agreement

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:36.929
and at the end of that season
the newsboys were like,

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.801
"Extra, extra, read
all about it. 18 deaths."

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.736
I was going to say
serious deaths.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:48.908
There are deaths that are like
... it's kind of funny.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:57.850
"18 deaths and 159 fatalities.
Shit, fatalities means deaths.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:03.590
18 deaths and 159 super serious
injuries from football

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.093
happening now,
exclamation point.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:10.430
End quote.
Read about it. Or don't."

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.867
So Teddy invited everybody
back and he's like,

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.537
"Hey y'all, all this stuff
just happened.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.738
Walter Camp,
I see you raising your hand.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.742
I don't acknowledge you.
We have to change your sport.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:26.178
I get that it's your baby,
but sometimes your baby sucks."

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.481
If you give birth to a baby
and you're like,

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.282
"Do whatever
the (beep) you want."

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:32.217
It's going to punch people
and people are going to die.

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:35.688
Your baby needs to be raised
properly in a decent home,

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.925
and the decent home is,
"Let's make some new rules.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.828
So like, what if, crazy thought,
what if we make first down,

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:44.864
instead of five yards,
make it 10."

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:48.868
Then he was like, "What if you
took a ball and you threw it

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:52.338
instead of only just being able
to shove into each other

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.974
to move down the field?
Wouldn't that be wild?"

00:02:54.974 --> 00:02:58.944
People were like, "Wait,
you want to throw a ball?"

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:02.948
"Like yeah, it's why balls
were invited, to be thrown."

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:06.318
Walter Camp was like,
"Okay, fine."

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:13.292
So basically after that meeting
there was like a national

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:18.932
standard for what football was
and it was great.

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.970
It was all great because
of Teddy Roosevelt,

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:28.541
and like, nobody knows that.
They just think,

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.075
"Teddy Roosevelt,
oh, president."

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.044
Or actually nowadays they go,
"Teddy Roosevelt?

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.547
Oh, you mean Franklin?"
Because we're young and dumb

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.749
and nobody reads
a goddamn book anymore.

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:48.961
Woodrow Wilson was
the president of America,

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:51.130
the United States of America.
Edith ...

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:55.134
Wilson was the goddamn
president's wife.

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.972
So Woodrow Wilson,
he had 18 months left in office

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.673
and he had a ... stroke.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:04.977
His doctor was like, "Uh,
Woodrow Wilson has had a stroke.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:09.682
A big stroke.
Like we can't move y'all stroke.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.686
So what you gonna do?"
Edith was like,

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.724
"Well, who I love is this man
for who he is,

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:21.561
and who he is is a guy
who wants to be president

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.764
for some (beep) reason.
So if I don't ..."

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:29.402
Just ignore that.
If I don't ... Just ignore that.

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:31.604
"If I don't help him
be president,

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.240
what a kind of wife am I?"

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.279
The doctor was like,
"Uh, you gotta run the (beep)

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.115
country, because this
guy's out for the count."

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:45.951
So Edith was like,
"No problem, I got this.

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.554
Shut up, sit down,
I am in charge now.

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:51.023
Can I get my cheesy bread
I brought?"

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:52.224
Your what?

00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:54.360
Cheesy bread that I brought.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.895
Can we finish this part?

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:57.563
What part?

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.398
The part that we want to do.

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:00.733
I did it bad.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:03.268
We're still doing it.
All right. Oh.

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:05.838
I don't want the bread anymore.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.041
So Edith Wilson,
she told America,

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.445
"Hey guys, excuse me.
My husband,

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:18.350
the president, he's very tired
and he will be resting,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.654
he's very tired,
saying he needs to rest."

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:26.558
She even went to Congress
and was like, "Hey, no big deal.

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:29.194
I'm giving him everything
you're saying in Congress,

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:32.164
I'm giving him all the letters,
the note things.

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:35.033
So, what do you guys
think of this rule

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:38.136
or a law or thing that we're
working on?"

00:05:38.136 --> 00:05:41.006
They'd be like, "Whatever.
What do you think of this?"

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:44.076
Then she'd bring it to Woodrow
who was like, half awake,

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.179
and she'd be like, "All right,
well Congress was like,

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.015
'Blah, blah, blah.'"
He'd be like, "Uhh."

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.185
She was like, "Well, I guess
I'll compromise.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:54.654
I'm just going to ...

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:59.725
make the ...
make the decisions myself."

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.695
So basically Edith Wilson
was first female president.

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:08.167
She ran memos
between Congress and him.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.937 align:start size:81% position:19%
Congress is like,
"All right, what ...

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:17.543
what ... what is going on?"

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:20.880
So Congress picked this one
Republican senator, Albert Fall,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.450
they're like, "Albert, go see
what his true condition is.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.819
Go see what Wilson's
true condition is."

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.788
So Albert Fall shows up.

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.891
He's like, "Can we come in see
the true condition?"

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:34.627
She's not ...
stupid, she's like,

00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:38.765
"Yeah sure, come on in."
So Albert Fall comes in.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:49.975
It was like, "Yep, this is him,
making decisions every day.

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:52.945
Then I take the ...
Thank you honey,

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:56.148
and I take the papers from him
that I don't understand,

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:58.150
because I'm just
some dumb broad."

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.954
Edith's just propped up Woodrow
in bed, like waving like, "Hey."

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:05.024
They're like, "Oh okay, cool."
She's like, "Bye."

00:07:05.024 --> 00:07:07.927
And then they leave.
That's how dumb government is.

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:16.168
Elvis writes a letter to Nixon
while on the plane.

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:19.271 align:start position:0%
They land and he drops it off
at the front of the White House.

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:22.942
It was shocking. No celebrity's
want to hang out with Nixon.

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:25.278
So when he reached out
they're like,

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.114
"Elvis wants to meet with you.
This can't hurt matters.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:30.082
Don't you want to see
what Elvis has to say?

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:32.518
Why not?"
He's like, "Yeah, arrange it.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:35.220
Yeah, I want to meet him.
Let's see what's going on."

00:07:35.654 --> 00:07:39.858
Elvis comes in and Nixon
looks at him, he's like,

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:43.462
"This is kind of crazy man,
you dress really crazy, man."

00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:46.465
He's like, "Hey, you have
your getup, I have mine, okay?"

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.934
Nixon's like, "Yeah,
I'm glad you came by.

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:50.837
I want to meet you.
Good to see you."

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.439
Elvis does the hard sell
saying he needs the badge.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.075
"Well I care, man.

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.076
I care about what's going on
with these people

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.946
and I care about the hippies
and everything that's being said

00:08:00.946 --> 00:08:02.648
right now, man,
it's terrifying."

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:04.650
People that are saying
things about you,

00:08:05.251 --> 00:08:07.753
and the people that are
saying things about me.

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:10.389
That's why I'm happy
to be here, man.

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:12.191
But I need this badge.

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.992
This is so big for me,
I need it."

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:16.094
Nixon really takes it in,
kind of asks his aid.

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:18.030
He's like, "Can we do this?"

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.899
The aid comes back and says,
"I'm sorry, it's dumb.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:22.601
You cannot get this badge.
Sorry Mr. Presley you cannot.

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:26.572
You have no qualifications
in our mind to have this badge."

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:30.976
"Sorry brother,
I'm loving it."

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.712
Nixon decides to give him
this badge.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.981
So Elvis goes back
to get photos taken,

00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:38.050
but then Elvis is a licensed

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.186
and registered federal
narcotics agent.
