00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400
so what does that really tell you not a
 

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.880
so what does that really tell you not a
whole lot because the impact factor

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:12.890
whole lot because the impact factor
 

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.950
whole lot because the impact factor
needs to be put in the context of the

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960
needs to be put in the context of the
 

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.680
needs to be put in the context of the
subject categories in this example this

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:17.690
subject categories in this example this
 

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.080
subject categories in this example this
is a social science journal has an

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:20.090
is a social science journal has an
 

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.909
is a social science journal has an
impact factor of five point zero one

00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919
impact factor of five point zero one
 

00:18:21.919 --> 00:18:25.240
impact factor of five point zero one
seven but it's been categorized and

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:25.250
seven but it's been categorized and
 

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.799
seven but it's been categorized and
placed in two different subject

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:26.809
placed in two different subject
 

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:29.049
placed in two different subject
categories in business and in management

00:18:29.049 --> 00:18:29.059
categories in business and in management
 

00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:31.419
categories in business and in management
so if you're thinking the top journal in

00:18:31.419 --> 00:18:31.429
so if you're thinking the top journal in
 

00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:34.360
so if you're thinking the top journal in
social sciences is 17 points something

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:34.370
social sciences is 17 points something
 

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.940
social sciences is 17 points something
so this probably doesn't look very good

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:36.950
so this probably doesn't look very good
 

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.730
so this probably doesn't look very good
in comparison but in fact it ranks

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:39.740
in comparison but in fact it ranks
 

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:41.950
in comparison but in fact it ranks
number one of 72 journals in the

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:41.960
number one of 72 journals in the
 

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.409
number one of 72 journals in the
business category and it ranks number

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:44.419
business category and it ranks number
 

00:18:44.419 --> 00:18:46.780
business category and it ranks number
two of 81 journals in the management

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:46.790
two of 81 journals in the management
 

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.690
two of 81 journals in the management
category so out of context it doesn't

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:49.700
category so out of context it doesn't
 

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.539
category so out of context it doesn't
appear like much but in context means

00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:52.549
appear like much but in context means
 

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:57.880
appear like much but in context means
everything also the discipline is very

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:57.890
everything also the discipline is very
 

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.720
everything also the discipline is very
important to consider in applied

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:01.730
important to consider in applied
 

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.430
important to consider in applied
mathematics for instance there's a

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440
mathematics for instance there's a
 

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.850
mathematics for instance there's a
longer citation window the impact factor

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:06.860
longer citation window the impact factor
 

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.600
longer citation window the impact factor
is a very narrow window in

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:08.610
is a very narrow window in
 

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.180
is a very narrow window in
time is looking at citations in one year

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.190
time is looking at citations in one year
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.100
time is looking at citations in one year
to the previous two is very narrow in

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.110
to the previous two is very narrow in
 

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.380
to the previous two is very narrow in
mathematics it's not unusual for the

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:15.390
mathematics it's not unusual for the
 

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.980
mathematics it's not unusual for the
citation tale to take a lot longer so in

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:18.990
citation tale to take a lot longer so in
 

00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.460

take the aggregate data so that it makes
 

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.220
take the aggregate data so that it makes
a little bit more sense so in this case

another opportunity for an institution

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.010
another opportunity for an institution
 

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.000
another opportunity for an institution
to find out who on their staff are

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.010
to find out who on their staff are
 

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.310
to find out who on their staff are
publishing and where we capture the

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320
publishing and where we capture the
 

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.190
publishing and where we capture the
country level at the journal and also at

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200
country level at the journal and also at
 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.070
country level at the journal and also at
the level of the author any funding

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080
the level of the author any funding
 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.650

information and conference data if the
 

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.390
information and conference data if the
paper was presented there so this

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400
paper was presented there so this
 

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.490
paper was presented there so this
creates just a huge full of potential

rerelease I think the most interest
interesting thing will be the analysis

00:24:29.629 --> 00:24:29.639
interesting thing will be the analysis
 

00:24:29.639 --> 00:24:33.320
interesting thing will be the analysis
of the journal self sites what you see

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:33.330
of the journal self sites what you see
 

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.930
of the journal self sites what you see
is down at the bottom that the table

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940
is down at the bottom that the table
 

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.060
is down at the bottom that the table
will show how many of the self cites the

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.070
will show how many of the self cites the
 

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:40.369
will show how many of the self cites the
journal sites are self sites and what

00:24:40.369 --> 00:24:40.379
journal sites are self sites and what
 

00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:42.649
journal sites are self sites and what
percentage contribute to the impact

00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:42.659
percentage contribute to the impact
 

00:24:42.659 --> 00:24:45.110
percentage contribute to the impact
factor calculation so in this instance

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120
factor calculation so in this instance
 

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.789
factor calculation so in this instance
here the journals impact factor is a 1.0

00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799
here the journals impact factor is a 1.0
 

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:52.700
here the journals impact factor is a 1.0
33 but if you take at the self sites

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:52.710
33 but if you take at the self sites
 

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:54.710
33 but if you take at the self sites
it's 0.91

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:54.720
it's 0.91
 

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.659
it's 0.91

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:04.930
would look much better than a regular
two-year impact factor but but that was

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:04.940
two-year impact factor but but that was
 

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:06.940
two-year impact factor but but that was
I think a metric and a time frame that

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:06.950
I think a metric and a time frame that
 

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.389
I think a metric and a time frame that
Garfield felt was optimal and I think

00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399
Garfield felt was optimal and I think
 

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:13.749
Garfield felt was optimal and I think
that what will happen in the future

00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:13.759
that what will happen in the future
 

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:17.049
that what will happen in the future
remains to be seen i would mentioned the

remains to be seen i would mentioned the
 

00:27:17.059 --> 00:27:19.090
remains to be seen i would mentioned the
five-year impact factor at a talk that I

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:19.100
five-year impact factor at a talk that I
 

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.529
five-year impact factor at a talk that I
gave at the Frankfurt Book Fair and

00:27:20.529 --> 00:27:20.539
gave at the Frankfurt Book Fair and
 

00:27:20.539 --> 00:27:24.009
gave at the Frankfurt Book Fair and
publishers were very excited about it

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:24.019
publishers were very excited about it
 

00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:27.519
publishers were very excited about it

California pomona college and librarians
were faced with problems that they face

00:29:43.889 --> 00:29:43.899
were faced with problems that they face
 

00:29:43.899 --> 00:29:46.019
were faced with problems that they face
today even worse today than they did

00:29:46.019 --> 00:29:46.029
today even worse today than they did
 

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:48.149
today even worse today than they did
even back in 1927 and it didn't have

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:50.310
even back in 1927 and it didn't have
money and of course when you don't have

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320
money and of course when you don't have
 

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.750
money and of course when you don't have
enough money that

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760
enough money that
 

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.520

better decisions at how we should be

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:14.710
better decisions at how we should be
 

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.730
better decisions at how we should be
deciding and that's counting citations

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:17.740
deciding and that's counting citations
 

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.590
deciding and that's counting citations
and which deciding which journals to buy

and which deciding which journals to buy

and which which we shouldn't and at
right now that seems pretty trivial it

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:23.290
right now that seems pretty trivial it
 

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:24.900
right now that seems pretty trivial it
seems like it's of course you wouldn't

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:24.910
seems like it's of course you wouldn't
 

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:26.340
seems like it's of course you wouldn't
just count citations there's so many

we look at some of the maps that we've

and vice versa also how two bundles a

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000
and vice versa also how two bundles a
 

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.940
and vice versa also how two bundles a
lot of you bundles is a big issue and

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:49.950
lot of you bundles is a big issue and
 

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.650

we're actually building we almost got

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:51.660
we're actually building we almost got
 

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:53.570
we're actually building we almost got
the tool built for dealing with bundles

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580
the tool built for dealing with bundles
 

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.340

before we even started we wanted to make

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:57.570
before we even started we wanted to make
 

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.480
before we even started we wanted to make
sure that a good metric most in-form

00:33:59.480 --> 00:33:59.490
sure that a good metric most in-form

first and foremost was freely available

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:01.290
first and foremost was freely available
 

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.410
first and foremost was freely available
because we think a video metrix is only

here's a little time well we've been to
two of these things together he actually

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:20.210
two of these things together he actually
 

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:21.640
two of these things together he actually
came up with a paper before we even

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:21.650
came up with a paper before we even
 

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:23.349
came up with a paper before we even
started on eigenvector centrality which

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359
started on eigenvector centrality which
 

00:35:23.359 --> 00:35:25.690
started on eigenvector centrality which
is essentially the core it's it's the

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:25.700
is essentially the core it's it's the
 

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.760
is essentially the core it's it's the
engine that drives the algorithm that we

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:27.770
engine that drives the algorithm that we
 

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.770
engine that drives the algorithm that we
use with eigen factor and this is very

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:29.780
use with eigen factor and this is very
 

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.240
use with eigen factor and this is very
similar to the same sort of algorithm

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.250
similar to the same sort of algorithm
 

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.430
similar to the same sort of algorithm
that Google uses to rank the web so we

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440
that Google uses to rank the web so we
 

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.930
that Google uses to rank the web so we
know how powerful these eigenvector

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:34.940
know how powerful these eigenvector
 

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.940
know how powerful these eigenvector
centrality things are so i'll use this

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:36.950
centrality things are so i'll use this
 

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.650
centrality things are so i'll use this

different than that so there was a there

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680
different than that so there was a there

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:32.540
this idea of looking at hyperlinks in
 

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.040
this idea of looking at hyperlinks in
the web but instead we're looking

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:34.050
the web but instead we're looking
 

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.110
the web but instead we're looking
citations and journals essentially

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:36.120
citations and journals essentially
 

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.310
citations and journals essentially
looking at what citing what there's

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320
looking at what citing what there's
 

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.350
looking at what citing what there's
there's a lot of information it's really

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:39.360
there's a lot of information it's really
 

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.930
there's a lot of information it's really
it's a beautiful story to tell and

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940
it's a beautiful story to tell and
 

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.280
it's a beautiful story to tell and
actually there's more even to learn

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.290
actually there's more even to learn
 

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:44.630
actually there's more even to learn
about that I'm sure that just the things

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640
about that I'm sure that just the things
 

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.430
about that I'm sure that just the things
that we work on so another way of

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440
that we work on so another way of
 

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.260
that we work on so another way of
looking at it I give it this way impact

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:48.270
looking at it I give it this way impact
 

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:50.540
looking at it I give it this way impact
factor puts the shutters on in and looks

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:50.550
factor puts the shutters on in and looks
 

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.490
factor puts the shutters on in and looks
at the numbers coming in and actually

00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500
at the numbers coming in and actually
 

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.290
at the numbers coming in and actually
turns out and I always so I'm giving

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300
turns out and I always so I'm giving
 

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.120
turns out and I always so I'm giving
always the good and bad impact factor it

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.130
always the good and bad impact factor it
 

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.980
always the good and bad impact factor it
turns out is it really pretty good a

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:57.990
turns out is it really pretty good a
 

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.110
turns out is it really pretty good a
reasonable approximation to some of

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:00.120
reasonable approximation to some of
 

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.790
reasonable approximation to some of
these sorts of things is not the same

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800
these sorts of things is not the same
 

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.980
these sorts of things is not the same
and we've done a lot of analysis and

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:03.990
and we've done a lot of analysis and
 

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.260
and we've done a lot of analysis and
statistic and done some statistical

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:06.270
statistic and done some statistical
 

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:07.790
statistic and done some statistical
analysis to show that they're not the

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800
analysis to show that they're not the
 

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.110
analysis to show that they're not the
same and they do should give different

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:09.120
same and they do should give different
 

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.180
same and they do should give different
information but they it's a reasonable

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.190
information but they it's a reasonable
 

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:12.920
information but they it's a reasonable
approximation and it's a lot easier to

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:12.930
approximation and it's a lot easier to
 

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.870
approximation and it's a lot easier to
explain actually the night in factories

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880
explain actually the night in factories
 

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.280
explain actually the night in factories
but I'm going to try to explain it a

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:16.290
but I'm going to try to explain it a
 

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.260
but I'm going to try to explain it a
little bit with this so again this is

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.270
little bit with this so again this is
 

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.940
little bit with this so again this is
just if I had more time I go into the

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:19.950
just if I had more time I go into the
 

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:21.950
just if I had more time I go into the
history of world is really one of the

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960
history of world is really one of the
 

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.570
history of world is really one of the
where areas that it came from it was a

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:23.580
where areas that it came from it was a
 

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:25.550
where areas that it came from it was a
sociologist that was his name was bonus

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560
sociologist that was his name was bonus
 

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.260
sociologist that was his name was bonus
H in 1972 he was interested in looking

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:27.270
H in 1972 he was interested in looking
 

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:32.030
H in 1972 he was interested in looking
at so uh networks of you know whose do

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040
at so uh networks of you know whose do
 

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.770
at so uh networks of you know whose do
important people have important friends

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780
important people have important friends
 

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.240
important people have important friends
and this sort of thing that was that was

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.250
and this sort of thing that was that was
 

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.550
and this sort of thing that was that was
his idea but yeah the words that we use

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560
his idea but yeah the words that we use
 

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.860
his idea but yeah the words that we use
eigenvector centrality and applying it

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:39.870
eigenvector centrality and applying it
 

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:41.840
eigenvector centrality and applying it
to the citation data set is what we're

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:41.850
to the citation data set is what we're
 

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.230
to the citation data set is what we're
doing and what like Johan has proposed

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240
doing and what like Johan has proposed
 

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.010
doing and what like Johan has proposed
so so Google like I said it's important

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020
so so Google like I said it's important
 

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.860
so so Google like I said it's important
websites by hyperlinks instead we look

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:51.870
websites by hyperlinks instead we look
 

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.420
websites by hyperlinks instead we look
at journals and we cite so that's that's

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:53.430
at journals and we cite so that's that's
 

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.380
at journals and we cite so that's that's
what we're doing we're essentially

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:54.390
what we're doing we're essentially
 

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.300
what we're doing we're essentially
taking a citation network we're looking

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:56.310
taking a citation network we're looking
 

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.700
taking a citation network we're looking
at the structure of the net so it's a

00:37:58.700 --> 00:37:58.710
at the structure of the net so it's a
 

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.170
at the structure of the net so it's a
model and there's there's a lot of

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180
model and there's there's a lot of
 

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.030
model and there's there's a lot of
different ways actually the best way I'm

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040
different ways actually the best way I'm
 

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.200
different ways actually the best way I'm
not going to show you is that this is

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:03.210
not going to show you is that this is
 

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.730
not going to show you is that this is
I'm doing a little experiment on you I

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740
I'm doing a little experiment on you I
 

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.650
I'm doing a little experiment on you I
want to see how many questions I have

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660
want to see how many questions I have
 

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:08.330
want to see how many questions I have
after using this old one because I'm

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:08.340
after using this old one because I'm
 

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.040
after using this old one because I'm
comparing it to this new one that I gave

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:10.050
comparing it to this new one that I gave
 

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:11.450
comparing it to this new one that I gave
it a few other places and I had less

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460
it a few other places and I had less
 

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.070
it a few other places and I had less
questions I think it might be better i'm

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:13.080
questions I think it might be better i'm
 

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.930
questions I think it might be better i'm
gonna give you this one I think it's

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940
gonna give you this one I think it's
 

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.890
gonna give you this one I think it's
still okay so the idea is if

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:16.900
still okay so the idea is if
 

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.900
still okay so the idea is if
to the library and you were to open some

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:18.910
to the library and you were to open some
 

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:20.640
to the library and you were to open some
random journal in your collections and

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:20.650
random journal in your collections and
 

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:24.590
random journal in your collections and
open some random citation follow that

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:24.600
open some random citation follow that
 

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.450
open some random citation follow that
open up that journal follow some random

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:27.460
open up that journal follow some random
 

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.400
open up that journal follow some random
citation do that again do that again and

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:29.410
citation do that again do that again and
 

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:31.020
citation do that again do that again and
if you could war do that for an infinite

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.030
if you could war do that for an infinite
 

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.510
if you could war do that for an infinite
amount of time in the library after

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520
amount of time in the library after
 

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.370
amount of time in the library after
you've done your infinite walk if that's

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:35.380
you've done your infinite walk if that's
 

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.620
you've done your infinite walk if that's
possible you come back to me or come

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:37.630
possible you come back to me or come
 

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.600
possible you come back to me or come
back to the website we have and you say

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:39.610
back to the website we have and you say
 

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:42.000
back to the website we have and you say
this is how much time I spent at science

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:42.010
this is how much time I spent at science
 

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.220
this is how much time I spent at science
this is how long i spent the journal of

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:44.230
this is how long i spent the journal of
 

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.350
this is how long i spent the journal of
biological chemistry and if it's like

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:46.360
biological chemistry and if it's like
 

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.810
biological chemistry and if it's like
1.99 that means one point ninety-nine

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:48.820
1.99 that means one point ninety-nine
 

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.720
1.99 that means one point ninety-nine
percent of all the time i was there the

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:51.730
percent of all the time i was there the
 

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.460
percent of all the time i was there the
other way look at it is it you you would

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:53.470
other way look at it is it you you would
 

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.770
other way look at it is it you you would
make a pile of journals and so you're

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:55.780
make a pile of journals and so you're
 

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.090
make a pile of journals and so you're
walking around the library you get it

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:57.100
walking around the library you get it
 

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.410
walking around the library you get it
you came to this journals through your

00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:58.420
you came to this journals through your
 

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:01.110
you came to this journals through your
random walk you put a pile and after all

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:01.120
random walk you put a pile and after all
 

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.730
random walk you put a pile and after all
your walk you look back at your piles

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:02.740
your walk you look back at your piles
 

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.340
your walk you look back at your piles
and you see how high the piles on so

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.350
and you see how high the piles on so
 

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.690
and you see how high the piles on so
those numbers that you'll see you hiding

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:06.700
those numbers that you'll see you hiding
 

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.760
those numbers that you'll see you hiding
factor our percentage of time it gives

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:08.770
factor our percentage of time it gives
 

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.380
factor our percentage of time it gives
you an idea how long maybe your users

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:10.390
you an idea how long maybe your users
 

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.360
you an idea how long maybe your users
would would be using certain journals

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.370
would would be using certain journals
 

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.010
would would be using certain journals
and so you can actually apply this not

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:14.020
and so you can actually apply this not
 

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.840
and so you can actually apply this not
just to the Thompson data set you can

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:15.850
just to the Thompson data set you can
 

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:16.890
just to the Thompson data set you can
actually apply it to your own

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:16.900
actually apply it to your own
 

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.210
actually apply it to your own
collections let's say you just have your

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:18.220
collections let's say you just have your
 

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.790
collections let's say you just have your
own little data set that you know that's

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800
own little data set that you know that's
 

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.680
own little data set that you know that's
all your users are using then what you

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:22.690
all your users are using then what you
 

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:24.480
all your users are using then what you
do is you can apply it to that data set

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:24.490
do is you can apply it to that data set
 

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:26.190
do is you can apply it to that data set
so what you do is you go to a journal

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:26.200
so what you do is you go to a journal
 

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.020
so what you do is you go to a journal

Mutual's is this is that item factor is

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.010
Mutual's is this is that item factor is
 

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:37.430
Mutual's is this is that item factor is
additive so what does that mean additive

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440
additive so what does that mean additive

the numbers of a particular set of
 

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.320
the numbers of a particular set of
journals or a bundle of journals and you

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:45.330
journals or a bundle of journals and you
 

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.570
journals or a bundle of journals and you
can add them up and that will give you

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:47.580
can add them up and that will give you
 

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.740
can add them up and that will give you
again a measurement of the value of

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:49.750
again a measurement of the value of

again a measurement of the value of
bundle or that group of of journals so

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:52.810
bundle or that group of of journals so

if you have let's say science is two and
nature's three and sells one then you

00:41:58.830 --> 00:41:58.840
nature's three and sells one then you
 

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.930
nature's three and sells one then you
have an eigen factor of six for the

have an eigen factor of six for the
 

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:03.030
have an eigen factor of six for the
group and that gives you six percent of

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040
group and that gives you six percent of
 

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.470

map of science let me show you how we do

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:14.230
map of science let me show you how we do
 

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.510
map of science let me show you how we do
the map and we have to combine this with

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:15.520
the map and we have to combine this with
 

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.980
the map and we have to combine this with
the mapping but each one of those

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.270
partitioned actually gives you an idea
of that's that's combined with the the

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280
of that's that's combined with the the
 

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:47.340
of that's that's combined with the the
mapping stuff that we do so I'll explain

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:47.350
mapping stuff that we do so I'll explain
 

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.140
mapping stuff that we do so I'll explain
that more but what you can do is just

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.150
that more but what you can do is just
 

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:55.980
that more but what you can do is just
build a here real quick so you can

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:55.990
build a here real quick so you can
 

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.470
build a here real quick so you can
actually look at where ideas we say

00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480
actually look at where ideas we say
 

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.940
actually look at where ideas we say
where ideas are coming from there's more

00:42:59.940 --> 00:42:59.950
where ideas are coming from there's more
 

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:01.800
where ideas are coming from there's more
than that but you can look at the floral

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:01.810
than that but you can look at the floral
 

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.540
than that but you can look at the floral
you can click on a journal let's see

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:03.550
you can click on a journal let's see
 

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:04.800
you can click on a journal let's see
it's hooked on nature and you can see

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:04.810
it's hooked on nature and you can see
 

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.290
it's hooked on nature and you can see
where the flow is going in one step you

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:07.300
where the flow is going in one step you
 

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.670
where the flow is going in one step you
can look at it two sets you can look at

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:08.680
can look at it two sets you can look at
 

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:10.470
can look at it two sets you can look at
after its converged you can actually

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480
after its converged you can actually
 

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.240
after its converged you can actually
look where ideas come let's saddle if

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:12.250
look where ideas come let's saddle if
 

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.620
look where ideas come let's saddle if
you can see this Kiev us yeah you can

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:13.630
you can see this Kiev us yeah you can
 

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:16.740
you can see this Kiev us yeah you can
see that this is a this is economics but

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:16.750
see that this is a this is economics but
 

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.180
see that this is a this is economics but
what you notice about economics compared

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:18.190
what you notice about economics compared
 

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.230
what you notice about economics compared
some of these other journals they kind

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240
some of these other journals they kind
 

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.210
some of these other journals they kind
of only site themselves there's all

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:21.220
of only site themselves there's all
 

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.040

sorts of I mean this I could give an

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.050
sorts of I mean this I could give an
 

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.480
sorts of I mean this I could give an
entire talk because we've been playing

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:24.490
entire talk because we've been playing
 

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.310
entire talk because we've been playing
with this for the last month and a half

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:26.320
with this for the last month and a half
 

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.020
with this for the last month and a half
two months but we've just got the

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:28.030
two months but we've just got the
 

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.910
two months but we've just got the
technology basically got the code the

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920
technology basically got the code the
 

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.120
technology basically got the code the
bugs out of it um you you so many

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:33.130
bugs out of it um you you so many
 

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:34.500
bugs out of it um you you so many
stories are popping out of this

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:34.510
stories are popping out of this
 

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.650
stories are popping out of this
reference type of representation of

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:36.660
reference type of representation of
 

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.970
reference type of representation of
analyzing flow so you can you can go

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:38.980
analyzing flow so you can you can go
 

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.400
analyzing flow so you can you can go
over any journal and it'll tell you what

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:41.410
over any journal and it'll tell you what
 

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.410
over any journal and it'll tell you what
the journal is eventually what field you

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:43.420
the journal is eventually what field you
 

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.680
the journal is eventually what field you
can also look at the flow

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:45.690
can also look at the flow
 

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.330
can also look at the flow
the floral actually tells you something

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:47.340
the floral actually tells you something
 

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:50.600
the floral actually tells you something
about not only what that time step is

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:50.610
about not only what that time step is
 

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.460
about not only what that time step is
but actually gives you projections as to

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:52.470
but actually gives you projections as to
 

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.990
but actually gives you projections as to
where because they're trends a lot of

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000
where because they're trends a lot of
 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.390
where because they're trends a lot of
times with trends so all I can show you

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400
times with trends so all I can show you
 

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.280
times with trends so all I can show you
more about this later if we have more

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:58.290
more about this later if we have more
 

00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:59.960
more about this later if we have more
time or i can show anyone afterwards

00:43:59.960 --> 00:43:59.970
time or i can show anyone afterwards
 

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.330
time or i can show anyone afterwards
that wants to look at that thank you for

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:02.340
that wants to look at that thank you for
 

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.120
that wants to look at that thank you for
turning up that down so something else

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.130
turning up that down so something else
 

00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.190
turning up that down so something else
is cost-effectiveness and we're finding

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200
is cost-effectiveness and we're finding
 

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.350
is cost-effectiveness and we're finding
that this tool is probably the most hit

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:09.360
that this tool is probably the most hit
 

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.060
that this tool is probably the most hit
tool that we get at least Roger is

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.070
tool that we get at least Roger is
 

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.130
tool that we get at least Roger is
probably the most useful for librarians

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140
probably the most useful for librarians
 

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.920
probably the most useful for librarians
that have to take into account price

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:14.930
that have to take into account price
 

00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.270
that have to take into account price
essentially there's more to it but the

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280
essentially there's more to it but the
 

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.820
essentially there's more to it but the
basic idea is that you can take the idea

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:19.830
basic idea is that you can take the idea
 

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.950
basic idea is that you can take the idea
factor and you can essentially divided

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960
factor and you can essentially divided
 

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:23.600
factor and you can essentially divided
by the price of that Journal that gives

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:23.610
by the price of that Journal that gives
 

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:27.320
by the price of that Journal that gives
you another way of valium so if we go to

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:27.330
you another way of valium so if we go to
 

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.030
you another way of valium so if we go to

hopefully this works oh look alright so

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:37.590
hopefully this works oh look alright so
 

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.590
hopefully this works oh look alright so
you're the item factor that all real

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:39.600
you're the item factor that all real
 

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:46.550
you're the item factor that all real
quick

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560
 
 

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.480

come on safety okay so there's all sorts
 

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.150
come on safety okay so there's all sorts
of cool things here but i'm just going

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160
of cool things here but i'm just going
 

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.230
of cool things here but i'm just going
to show just a little bit of

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240
to show just a little bit of
 

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.640
to show just a little bit of
cost-effectiveness so does anyone have a

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:58.650
cost-effectiveness so does anyone have a
 

00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.900
cost-effectiveness so does anyone have a
particular field they want to look at

00:44:59.900 --> 00:44:59.910
particular field they want to look at
 

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:03.590

purple bar represents that much the bar

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460
purple bar represents that much the bar
 

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.700
purple bar represents that much the bar
in the bottom is the green you start to

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:37.710
in the bottom is the green you start to
 

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.160
in the bottom is the green you start to
get an idea of the value of a particular

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.170
get an idea of the value of a particular
 

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.290
get an idea of the value of a particular
or let's say you have a budget amount

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:42.300
or let's say you have a budget amount
 

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.910
or let's say you have a budget amount
and you have let's say four million

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920
and you have let's say four million
 

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.740
and you have let's say four million
dollars to spend I'm sure we all have to

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:45.750
dollars to spend I'm sure we all have to
 

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.930
dollars to spend I'm sure we all have to
be stopped no I don't know about that

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940
be stopped no I don't know about that
 

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:51.080
be stopped no I don't know about that
but the idea is this is just we're

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.090
but the idea is this is just we're
 

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.610
but the idea is this is just we're
actually releasing well hope we're

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:52.620
actually releasing well hope we're
 

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.740
actually releasing well hope we're
developing still now what this real the

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:54.750
developing still now what this real the
 

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.630
developing still now what this real the
tool is going to do that this is kind of

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640
tool is going to do that this is kind of
 

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.250
tool is going to do that this is kind of
the first pass it but the idea is if you

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260
the first pass it but the idea is if you
 

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.200
the first pass it but the idea is if you
scroll down what are you noticing

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:00.210
scroll down what are you noticing
 

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.610
scroll down what are you noticing
immediately you're getting a lot of your

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:01.620
immediately you're getting a lot of your
 

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.980
immediately you're getting a lot of your
eigen factor almost all the i/o factor

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:03.990
eigen factor almost all the i/o factor
 

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:05.150
eigen factor almost all the i/o factor
but now you're starting to increase a

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.160
but now you're starting to increase a
 

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.400
but now you're starting to increase a
lot more on price and you're not adding

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:07.410
lot more on price and you're not adding
 

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.320
lot more on price and you're not adding
that much more Ivy factory so that

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:09.330
that much more Ivy factory so that

actually tells you that gives you an
 

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:14.150
actually tells you that gives you an
idea of what you can like when you

at bundles and there's other things that
 

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.650
at bundles and there's other things that
we're doing but when you hear

we're doing but when you hear
 

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:20.690
we're doing but when you hear
cost-effectiveness again this is a one I

cost-effectiveness again this is a one I
 

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.030
cost-effectiveness again this is a one I
could give a whole talk on is this

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040
could give a whole talk on is this
 

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.950
could give a whole talk on is this
cost-effectiveness stuff that this is

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960
cost-effectiveness stuff that this is
 

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.780
cost-effectiveness stuff that this is
this a lot of this work comes from Ted

actually have a bunch of things we're

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:53.530
actually have a bunch of things we're
 

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:54.870
actually have a bunch of things we're
released by the most exciting in my

released by the most exciting in my
 

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.300
released by the most exciting in my
opinion we have is coming up we have

00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:57.310
opinion we have is coming up we have
 

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.680
opinion we have is coming up we have
actually two or three new things coming

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:58.690
actually two or three new things coming
 

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.630
actually two or three new things coming
up we're still want to make sure we get

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640
up we're still want to make sure we get
 

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.040
up we're still want to make sure we get
it all right make sure we understand the

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.050
it all right make sure we understand the
 

00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:03.660
it all right make sure we understand the
methods and make sure there's no bugs

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:03.670
methods and make sure there's no bugs
 

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.760
methods and make sure there's no bugs
but it's coming out hopefully maybe in

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:05.770
but it's coming out hopefully maybe in
 

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.110
but it's coming out hopefully maybe in
the next we'll set three-month problem

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:07.120
the next we'll set three-month problem
 

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.390
the next we'll set three-month problem
six months or something but this is one

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400
six months or something but this is one
 

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.620
six months or something but this is one
of the things that you can do with all

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:10.630
of the things that you can do with all
 

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.960
of the things that you can do with all
these metrics that I'm talking about so

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:12.970
these metrics that I'm talking about so
 

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.630
these metrics that I'm talking about so
this is a way of taking this rich all

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640
this is a way of taking this rich all
 

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.000
this is a way of taking this rich all

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.010
his data that you deal with and trying
 

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:19.980
his data that you deal with and trying
to try to pull stories out try to

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:19.990
to try to pull stories out try to
 

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.680
to try to pull stories out try to
understand what these are all these

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:22.690
understand what these are all these
 

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:23.790
understand what these are all these
variables you're hearing all these

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800
variables you're hearing all these
 

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.050
variables you're hearing all these
different measures how do we represent

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:25.060
different measures how do we represent
 

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.120
different measures how do we represent
well that's part of the project it's not

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:27.130
well that's part of the project it's not
 

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.860
well that's part of the project it's not
just developing algorithms it's not just

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:28.870
just developing algorithms it's not just
 

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.450
just developing algorithms it's not just
messing around with fun things that we

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:30.460
messing around with fun things that we
 

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.250
messing around with fun things that we
like to work on it also want to develop

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:32.260
like to work on it also want to develop

like to work on it also want to develop
actual tools that can help you and this

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880
actual tools that can help you and this
 

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.450
actual tools that can help you and this
is this is an example of one this isn't

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:36.460
is this is an example of one this isn't
 

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:38.760
is this is an example of one this isn't
like this is actually me through this

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:38.770
like this is actually me through this
 

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.710
like this is actually me through this
google docs application but what you can

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720
google docs application but what you can
 

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.450
google docs application but what you can
do is you can you can change any of the

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:42.460
do is you can you can change any of the
 

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.590
do is you can you can change any of the
things that we talked about let's say

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:43.600
things that we talked about let's say
 

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.840
things that we talked about let's say
you want i can factor you can switch

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:45.850
you want i can factor you can switch
 

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:48.030
you want i can factor you can switch
things you can go i'll go back to

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040
things you can go i'll go back to
 

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.440
things you can go i'll go back to
article influence you can actually log

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:49.450
article influence you can actually log
 

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.210
article influence you can actually log
things so you can actually get an idea

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:51.220
things so you can actually get an idea
 

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.050
things so you can actually get an idea
you get should the other is up there you

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:55.060
you get should the other is up there you
 

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:58.410
you get should the other is up there you
can log it and that depending on what

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:58.420
can log it and that depending on what
 

00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.880
can log it and that depending on what
you're looking at and what you want to

00:47:59.880 --> 00:47:59.890
you're looking at and what you want to
 

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.890
you're looking at and what you want to
do you can get an idea so if you play

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:01.900
do you can get an idea so if you play
 

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.340
do you can get an idea so if you play
this you can watch over time how what's

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.350
this you can watch over time how what's
 

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.410
this you can watch over time how what's
happening to these journals i did factor

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:07.420
happening to these journals i did factor
 

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.700
happening to these journals i did factor
the size of the circle i should mention

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:08.710
the size of the circle i should mention
 

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.170
the size of the circle i should mention
is Ivy factor and you can also change

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:10.180
is Ivy factor and you can also change
 

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.450
is Ivy factor and you can also change
that as well so what's great is you can

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:12.460
that as well so what's great is you can
 

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.550
that as well so what's great is you can
start to see what's happening and I'm

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:14.560
start to see what's happening and I'm
 

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.240
start to see what's happening and I'm
actually showing you

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:15.250
actually showing you
 

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:16.710
actually showing you
the leaf I would say the least

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720
the leaf I would say the least
 

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.810
the leaf I would say the least
interesting but it's the top 25 journals

00:48:18.810 --> 00:48:18.820
interesting but it's the top 25 journals
 

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.250
interesting but it's the top 25 journals
when you start getting in the fields

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:20.260
when you start getting in the fields
 

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.710
when you start getting in the fields
that you know like my field I know the

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720
that you know like my field I know the
 

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:23.850
that you know like my field I know the
publishing wreck i know some of the

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:23.860
publishing wreck i know some of the
 

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.800
publishing wreck i know some of the
editors I know policies they've changed

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:25.810
editors I know policies they've changed
 

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.570
editors I know policies they've changed
and there's some really interesting so

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:27.580
and there's some really interesting so
 

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:29.370
and there's some really interesting so
especially in the field of ecology and

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:29.380
especially in the field of ecology and
 

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.200
especially in the field of ecology and
evolution with one particular journal so

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:31.210
evolution with one particular journal so
 

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:32.340
evolution with one particular journal so
actually there's there's tons of

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:32.350
actually there's there's tons of
 

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:36.210
actually there's there's tons of
journals and I and again this if you

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:36.220
journals and I and again this if you
 

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.810
journals and I and again this if you
want to show a sort of like if you know

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:39.820
want to show a sort of like if you know
 

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.060
want to show a sort of like if you know
something specific about a field I'd be

00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:42.070
something specific about a field I'd be
 

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.500
something specific about a field I'd be
interested in hearing what you you have

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:43.510
interested in hearing what you you have
 

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:45.180
interested in hearing what you you have
to say to the explanations of some of

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:45.190
to say to the explanations of some of
 

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:47.100
to say to the explanations of some of
these asteroids that are coming in but

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:47.110
these asteroids that are coming in but
 

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.480
these asteroids that are coming in but
like for example let's say just just

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.490
like for example let's say just just
 

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:49.950
like for example let's say just just
this one there's not as much interesting

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960
this one there's not as much interesting
 

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.240
this one there's not as much interesting
in this but let's just collect some of

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:51.250
in this but let's just collect some of
 

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:52.590
in this but let's just collect some of
them click on some of the medical

00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:52.600
them click on some of the medical
 

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.660
them click on some of the medical
journals and let's start back again in

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:54.670
journals and let's start back again in
 

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:58.020
journals and let's start back again in
1997 and let's watch let's maybe click

00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:58.030
1997 and let's watch let's maybe click
 

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.960
1997 and let's watch let's maybe click
on the side so explain this to me for

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:00.970
on the side so explain this to me for
 

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:02.220
on the side so explain this to me for
those that might know these drills and I

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:02.230
those that might know these drills and I
 

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:03.720
those that might know these drills and I
really don't know the story there's not

really don't know the story there's not
much happening in the late 90s and then

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:06.610
much happening in the late 90s and then
 

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.700
much happening in the late 90s and then
and then in two thousand something that

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:08.710
and then in two thousand something that
 

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:11.340

the journals in medicine something's

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:11.350
the journals in medicine something's
 

00:49:11.350 --> 00:49:13.110
the journals in medicine something's
happening and I don't know what it is

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:13.120
happening and I don't know what it is
 

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.820
happening and I don't know what it is
but it's not you can't you can do this

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:14.830
but it's not you can't you can do this
 

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.380
but it's not you can't you can do this
you can also do this at the article

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:16.390
you can also do this at the article
 

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.400
you can also do this at the article
level you can do all sorts of different

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:17.410
level you can do all sorts of different
 

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.400
level you can do all sorts of different
things but the idea again is that there

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:20.410
things but the idea again is that there
 

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.980
things but the idea again is that there
are powerful new tools out there that we

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:22.990
are powerful new tools out there that we
 

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.710
are powerful new tools out there that we
get not from just our lab that were you

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720
get not from just our lab that were you

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:34.750
of looking at this complicated data so
 

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:37.020
of looking at this complicated data so
back here so I don't know what my time

back here so I don't know what my time
 

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:38.790

is but I'm going to I'd like to jump

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800
is but I'm going to I'd like to jump
 

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.920

into so the data that we have right now

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:40.930
into so the data that we have right now
 

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.610

that's where we use it again so it can

that's where we use it again so it can

that's where we use it again so it can
be confusing but it's an idea that

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:02.430
be confusing but it's an idea that
 

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.249
be confusing but it's an idea that
science is about the flow of ideas our

the idea is that you can look at these

consider a map so the idea is to

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660
consider a map so the idea is to
 

00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:05.210
consider a map so the idea is to
simplify and highlight the data and

simplify and highlight the data and
 

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:09.530

this is you can actually zoom in and you

00:53:27.269 --> 00:53:27.279
this is you can actually zoom in and you
 

00:53:27.279 --> 00:53:28.769
this is you can actually zoom in and you
can zoom out you can look just like a

00:53:28.769 --> 00:53:28.779
can zoom out you can look just like a
 

00:53:28.779 --> 00:53:30.479

real map you can add detail you can take
detail out student and so you can see

of interesting also there's so many

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:49.089
of interesting also there's so many
 

00:53:49.089 --> 00:53:51.779
of interesting also there's so many
other things that we've had so many

00:53:51.779 --> 00:53:51.789
other things that we've had so many
 

00:53:51.789 --> 00:53:54.120

lunch conversations over the map and

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:54.130
lunch conversations over the map and
 

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:55.289
lunch conversations over the map and
things we keep finding we've been

00:53:55.289 --> 00:53:55.299
things we keep finding we've been
 

00:53:55.299 --> 00:53:56.999
things we keep finding we've been
looking at it now for at least six

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:57.009
looking at it now for at least six
 

00:53:57.009 --> 00:53:58.920
looking at it now for at least six
months and just staring at it looking at

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:58.930
months and just staring at it looking at
 

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.539
months and just staring at it looking at
and again zooming in and out and the

and again zooming in and out and the
 

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:01.769
and again zooming in and out and the
really cool thing is that you can

00:54:01.769 --> 00:54:01.779
really cool thing is that you can
 

00:54:01.779 --> 00:54:03.179
really cool thing is that you can
actually do these sorts of things over

00:54:03.179 --> 00:54:03.189
actually do these sorts of things over
 

00:54:03.189 --> 00:54:06.539
actually do these sorts of things over
time too so the the like the idea that

00:54:06.539 --> 00:54:06.549
time too so the the like the idea that
 

00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:08.519
time too so the the like the idea that
most people thought that the the science

00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:08.529
most people thought that the the science
 

00:54:08.529 --> 00:54:10.380
most people thought that the the science
was a ring well it turns out it's more

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:10.390
was a ring well it turns out it's more
 

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:11.640
was a ring well it turns out it's more
of like a new shape based on the

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:11.650
of like a new shape based on the
 

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:14.249
of like a new shape based on the
citation data and a lot of people ask us

00:54:14.249 --> 00:54:14.259
citation data and a lot of people ask us
 

00:54:14.259 --> 00:54:15.959
citation data and a lot of people ask us
well how does it come up with the fields

00:54:15.959 --> 00:54:15.969
well how does it come up with the fields
 

00:54:15.969 --> 00:54:17.370
well how does it come up with the fields
that's the one area of the algorithm the

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:17.380
that's the one area of the algorithm the

that's the one area of the algorithm the
rest of it's all algorithmically done we

journals that we see so this is a
 

00:54:22.749 --> 00:54:24.239
journals that we see so this is a
different way of categorizing than

different way of categorizing than
 

00:54:24.249 --> 00:54:25.559
different way of categorizing than
categorizing before instead of

look at your citation patterns and and

00:54:37.859 --> 00:54:37.869
look at your citation patterns and and

that's what that's what the algorithm
came up with okay I'm not going to go

00:54:40.709 --> 00:54:40.719
came up with okay I'm not going to go
 

00:54:40.719 --> 00:54:42.059
came up with okay I'm not going to go
through details but if the mapping stuff

00:54:58.299 --> 00:55:00.689
psychology psychiatry and psychology you
can look at individual fields there's

00:55:00.689 --> 00:55:00.699
can look at individual fields there's
 

00:55:00.699 --> 00:55:01.979
can look at individual fields there's
there's all sorts of things you can do

00:55:01.979 --> 00:55:01.989
there's all sorts of things you can do
 

00:55:01.989 --> 00:55:04.859
there's all sorts of things you can do
with the map but it's also a tool so

00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:04.869
with the map but it's also a tool so
 

00:55:04.869 --> 00:55:06.449
with the map but it's also a tool so
this is example there's many ways that

00:55:06.449 --> 00:55:06.459
this is example there's many ways that
 

00:55:06.459 --> 00:55:08.069
this is example there's many ways that
we're applying this as a tool and that's

00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079
we're applying this as a tool and that's
 

00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:09.390
we're applying this as a tool and that's
the difference between I think a lot of

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400
the difference between I think a lot of
 

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.290
the difference between I think a lot of
the maps that are being created we

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:11.300
the maps that are being created we
 

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.670
the maps that are being created we
right to be a tool just like a regular

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:12.680
right to be a tool just like a regular
 

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.410
right to be a tool just like a regular
map so right here this is an example

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:14.420
map so right here this is an example
 

00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.350
map so right here this is an example

stuff they don't have so you can see
 

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.990

they're heavily weighted in economics

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000
they're heavily weighted in economics
 

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.880
they're heavily weighted in economics
and political science and sociology and

areas like this but you can do this for

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:33.080
areas like this but you can do this for
 

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.390
areas like this but you can do this for
any sort of holden's you could do it for

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400
any sort of holden's you could do it for
 

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.040
any sort of holden's you could do it for
your own holdings you can see where

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.050
your own holdings you can see where
 

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:38.020
your own holdings you can see where
you're missing where you need to add but

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:38.030
you're missing where you need to add but
 

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.100
you're missing where you need to add but
you don't do you can do it throughout

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.110
you don't do you can do it throughout
 

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:40.480
you don't do you can do it throughout
all of just science you can actually

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:40.490
all of just science you can actually
 

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.850
all of just science you can actually
apply yours using these algorithms you

00:55:42.850 --> 00:55:42.860
apply yours using these algorithms you
 

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.210
apply yours using these algorithms you
can also you can apply them to your own

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:46.220
can also you can apply them to your own
 

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:47.560
can also you can apply them to your own
map if you like to make them all your

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:47.570
map if you like to make them all your
 

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:49.330
map if you like to make them all your
own map of your own holdings and look at

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:49.340
own map of your own holdings and look at
 

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:51.010
own map of your own holdings and look at
these sorts of things so that's one

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.020
these sorts of things so that's one
 

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.690
these sorts of things so that's one
thing so there's also the interactive

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:52.700
thing so there's also the interactive
 

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.550
thing so there's also the interactive
map and again I guess I'll put many of

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:54.560

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:56.210
you maybe you've already seen this but I
 

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:57.190
you maybe you've already seen this but I
might as well show it for those that

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200
might as well show it for those that
 

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:02.020
might as well show it for those that
haven't seen it this is another okay

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:02.030
haven't seen it this is another okay
 

00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:06.190
haven't seen it this is another okay
okay another example of a tool so if we

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:06.200
okay another example of a tool so if we
 

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:09.910
okay another example of a tool so if we
go to you can surf around this map

00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920
go to you can surf around this map
 

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.130
go to you can surf around this map
adding detail taking away detail you go

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:12.140
adding detail taking away detail you go
 

00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.840
adding detail taking away detail you go
into psychiatry you can see there I

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:13.850
into psychiatry you can see there I
 

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.120
into psychiatry you can see there I
can't see very well screen but you can

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:16.130
can't see very well screen but you can
 

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.530
can't see very well screen but you can
you can find first of all all this stuff

00:56:17.530 --> 00:56:17.540
you can find first of all all this stuff
 

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.940
you can find first of all all this stuff
again is free of a lever ething I save

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:18.950
again is free of a lever ething I save
 

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:20.620
again is free of a lever ething I save
on well not everything there's a lot of

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:20.630
on well not everything there's a lot of
 

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:22.900
on well not everything there's a lot of
the new stuff we haven't put up but a

the new stuff we haven't put up but a
 

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:24.310
the new stuff we haven't put up but a
lot of the things I've been on the web

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:24.320
lot of the things I've been on the web
 

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:25.870
lot of the things I've been on the web
are all there so you can check these

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880
are all there so you can check these
 

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.940
are all there so you can check these
things but you can go to education only

00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:27.950
things but you can go to education only
 

00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:29.770
things but you can go to education only
citing most afloat only comes from

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:29.780
citing most afloat only comes from
 

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.390
citing most afloat only comes from
psychiatry but not vice versa so let's

00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400
psychiatry but not vice versa so let's
 

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.600
psychiatry but not vice versa so let's
go to education what do we got there yes

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:33.610
go to education what do we got there yes
 

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.710
go to education what do we got there yes
psychology is going to psychiatry you

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720
psychology is going to psychiatry you
 

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.420
psychology is going to psychiatry you
can actually the beautiful thing again

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:37.430
can actually the beautiful thing again
 

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.670
can actually the beautiful thing again
you can add more detail you can look in

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680
you can add more detail you can look in
 

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.740
you can add more detail you can look in
more detail like you can with a map and

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:41.750
more detail like you can with a map and
 

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.180
more detail like you can with a map and
see what's connected eventually you can

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:43.190
see what's connected eventually you can
 

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.160
see what's connected eventually you can
get I'll be able to soon down to

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:45.170
get I'll be able to soon down to
 

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:47.620
get I'll be able to soon down to
individual papers and do those are

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:47.630
individual papers and do those are
 

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:48.890
individual papers and do those are
things you can also look at the top

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900
things you can also look at the top
 

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.220
things you can also look at the top
side so again that's a blast through

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:52.230
side so again that's a blast through
 

00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:53.420
side so again that's a blast through
just some of the tools that we're using

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:53.430
just some of the tools that we're using
 

00:56:53.430 --> 00:57:02.560
just some of the tools that we're using
the IPA okay whoa okay come back here

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:02.570
 
 

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:06.200
 
the summary is there is a lot of things

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:06.210
the summary is there is a lot of things
 

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.590
the summary is there is a lot of things
you can do with this these datasets they

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:09.600
you can do with this these datasets they
 

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.600
you can do with this these datasets they
are incredibly rich like I said before

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:11.610
are incredibly rich like I said before
 

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.150
are incredibly rich like I said before
there is a wealth of information but

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160
there is a wealth of information but
 

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:16.970
there is a wealth of information but
it's not easy to get those things I mean

00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980
it's not easy to get those things I mean
 

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:19.640
it's not easy to get those things I mean
if you look at in tabular form or you or

00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:19.650
if you look at in tabular form or you or
 

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.350
if you look at in tabular form or you or
you try to trying to make this it's not

00:57:21.350 --> 00:57:21.360
you try to trying to make this it's not
 

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.570
you try to trying to make this it's not
an easy and it's continually even with

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:23.580
an easy and it's continually even with
 

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.010
an easy and it's continually even with
these tool is going to be hard decisions

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:25.020
these tool is going to be hard decisions
 

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.620
these tool is going to be hard decisions
to make but but what we do in our lab is

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:27.630
to make but but what we do in our lab is
 

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:28.880
to make but but what we do in our lab is
we apply some of the things that we

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:28.890
we apply some of the things that we
 

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:30.650
we apply some of the things that we
apply in other fields especially within

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660
apply in other fields especially within
 

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.480
apply in other fields especially within
biology where we deal with complicated

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:32.490
biology where we deal with complicated
 

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:34.640
biology where we deal with complicated
data sets too and so it's really easily

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:34.650
data sets too and so it's really easily
 

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.200
data sets too and so it's really easily
transferable to the field of busy

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.210
transferable to the field of busy
 

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:38.300
transferable to the field of busy
metrics plus we have a personal interest

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:38.310
metrics plus we have a personal interest

his father I've always had an interest

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:41.910
his father I've always had an interest
 

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.790
his father I've always had an interest
in the economics of publishing in

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800
in the economics of publishing in
 

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.950
in the economics of publishing in
journals and so it's been just it's been

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960
journals and so it's been just it's been
 

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.810
journals and so it's been just it's been
a nice sort of synergy to use a cliché

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:47.820
a nice sort of synergy to use a cliché
 

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:50.210
a nice sort of synergy to use a cliché
but it's been it's been a lot of fun and

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220
but it's been it's been a lot of fun and
 

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.860
but it's been it's been a lot of fun and
most of the fun comes from working with

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:51.870
most of the fun comes from working with
 

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:54.680
most of the fun comes from working with
this group I mean really the reason why

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:54.690
this group I mean really the reason why
 

00:57:54.690 --> 00:57:56.180
this group I mean really the reason why
we if we don't think something's fun

we're on to something else and we're
 

00:57:57.510 --> 00:57:59.210
we're on to something else and we're
having a lot of fun right now but the

00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220
having a lot of fun right now but the

it's a misnomer and we should be careful

00:59:35.769 --> 00:59:35.779
it's a misnomer and we should be careful

it's a misnomer and we should be careful
about how we write it as mathematicians

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:37.460
about how we write it as mathematicians

we loosely use metaphors and that is a
 

00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:46.510
we loosely use metaphors and that is a
misnomer or on our part this time in the

charger is then use that word yes just

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839
charger is then use that word yes just
 

01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:14.599
charger is then use that word yes just
like that's good that's what kind of

01:01:14.599 --> 01:01:14.609
like that's good that's what kind of
 

01:01:14.609 --> 01:01:19.099

answer yes meditation Union guys I

01:01:19.099 --> 01:01:19.109

graduated that when I is the impact I am
 

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:35.559
graduated that when I is the impact I am
very clear I I perfectly clear what tool

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:35.569
very clear I I perfectly clear what tool
 

01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:38.599
very clear I I perfectly clear what tool
and because it's known because we're so

01:01:38.599 --> 01:01:38.609
and because it's known because we're so
 

01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:39.829
and because it's known because we're so
used to using impact factor I think

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839
used to using impact factor I think
 

01:01:39.839 --> 01:01:42.109
used to using impact factor I think
that's another advantage of you have

01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119
that's another advantage of you have
 

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:43.579
that's another advantage of you have
buffers that people are used to that and

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:43.589
buffers that people are used to that and
 

01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:45.950
buffers that people are used to that and
so that's that's that's a drawback right

01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960
so that's that's that's a drawback right
 

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.000
so that's that's that's a drawback right
back here it's new but i think you know

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:50.010
back here it's new but i think you know
 

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:52.730
back here it's new but i think you know
if it gets used it it really is a better

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740
if it gets used it it really is a better
 

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:54.680
if it gets used it it really is a better
way of evaluating it and I think you

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:54.690
way of evaluating it and I think you
 

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.660
way of evaluating it and I think you
know or other measures light and not

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:56.670
know or other measures light and not
 

01:01:56.670 --> 01:02:01.940
know or other measures light and not
just I do yeah that's a that's a near

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:01.950
just I do yeah that's a that's a near
 

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:04.579
just I do yeah that's a that's a near

been doing at the measure project that

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:06.510
been doing at the measure project that
 

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:08.510
been doing at the measure project that
the first couple of slides of stuff that

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520
the first couple of slides of stuff that
 

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.580
the first couple of slides of stuff that
you already

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:09.590
you already
 

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.440
you already
going to flash them essentially what

going to flash them essentially what
 

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:13.060
going to flash them essentially what
measure is trying to do it sits at first

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:13.070
measure is trying to do it sits at first
 

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.290
measure is trying to do it sits at first
of all it's a research project that is

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:14.300
of all it's a research project that is
 

01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:16.000
of all it's a research project that is
supported by the mellon Foundation which

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:16.010
supported by the mellon Foundation which
 

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:17.830
supported by the mellon Foundation which
has a nuclear weapons lab something very

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:17.840
has a nuclear weapons lab something very
 

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.490
has a nuclear weapons lab something very
special and I still don't understand

01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:21.500
special and I still don't understand
 

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.560
special and I still don't understand
quite how we were able to make them

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:23.570
quite how we were able to make them
 

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:26.680
quite how we were able to make them
fungal research other than that were

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:26.690
fungal research other than that were
 

01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:28.420
fungal research other than that were
very persuasive when it comes to these

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:28.430
very persuasive when it comes to these
 

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.720
very persuasive when it comes to these
matters so it's a project that

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:30.730
matters so it's a project that
 

01:02:30.730 --> 01:02:33.850
matters so it's a project that
investigates sort of the broader

01:02:33.850 --> 01:02:33.860
investigates sort of the broader
 

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.300
investigates sort of the broader
question of how can we measure scholarly

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:37.310
question of how can we measure scholarly
 

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:39.700
question of how can we measure scholarly
impact thank you get back thread the

focus on a particular metric the focus

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:41.840
focus on a particular metric the focus
 

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:44.500
focus on a particular metric the focus
is on a whole bunch of networks what are

instead of mapping signs mapping the
 

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.660
instead of mapping signs mapping the
metrics so we understand that over each

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:49.670
metrics so we understand that over each
 

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:51.910

people love number so much is that it's
 

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:04.349
people love number so much is that it's
just a lot easier to have a number of an

thousand and three they're just looking
 

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.539
thousand and three they're just looking
at two thousand and few citations of

at two thousand and few citations of

at two thousand and few citations of
2002 2001 and they divide that by the

2002 2001 and they divide that by the
 

01:04:30.849 --> 01:04:32.339
2002 2001 and they divide that by the
number of articles published in those

01:04:32.339 --> 01:04:32.349

that if you know it's the usage data you
know where they go the usage data tells

know where they go the usage data tells
 

01:14:29.559 --> 01:14:30.750

you but I'd say you don't have to do the

the rules of golf is really good test

01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:04.550
the rules of golf is really good test
 

01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:07.060
the rules of golf is really good test
for intelligence believe it or not that

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:07.070
for intelligence believe it or not that
 

01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:08.980

used to be part of intelligence tests in

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:08.990
used to be part of intelligence tests in

the 1920s if you didn't know golf you

01:21:12.370 --> 01:21:12.380
the 1920s if you didn't know golf you
 

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:17.260
the 1920s if you didn't know golf you
just found you just don't and I think

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:17.270
just found you just don't and I think
 

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:19.120
just found you just don't and I think
that applies to men diversey and the

01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:19.130
that applies to men diversey and the
 

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:20.170
that applies to men diversey and the
difficult there that's a good

01:21:20.170 --> 01:21:20.180
difficult there that's a good

measurement of intelligence I said well

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:22.550
measurement of intelligence I said well
 

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:25.000
measurement of intelligence I said well
I'll agree with that I don't go certain

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:25.010
I'll agree with that I don't go certain
 

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:27.130
I'll agree with that I don't go certain
how well someone does it matter right

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:27.140
how well someone does it matter right
 

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:28.930
how well someone does it matter right
and then look at whether this correlates

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:28.940
and then look at whether this correlates
 

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.370
and then look at whether this correlates
and say well no it doesn't correlate

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:30.380
and say well no it doesn't correlate
 

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.990
and say well no it doesn't correlate
you're right knowing the rules of golf

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000
you're right knowing the rules of golf
 

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.550
you're right knowing the rules of golf
doesn't correlate in being good at math

01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560
doesn't correlate in being good at math
 

01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.160
doesn't correlate in being good at math
like something's wrong that's cross

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:36.170
like something's wrong that's cross
 

01:21:36.170 --> 01:21:38.200
like something's wrong that's cross
validation it means that you may have a

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:38.210
validation it means that you may have a
 

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:39.970
validation it means that you may have a
hypothesis about how something can be

01:21:39.970 --> 01:21:39.980
hypothesis about how something can be
 

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:41.710
hypothesis about how something can be
measured and then you compare it to

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:41.720
measured and then you compare it to
 

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.300
measured and then you compare it to
something that supposedly also measures

01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:43.310
something that supposedly also measures
 

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:45.640
something that supposedly also measures
the same thing if they correlate right

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:45.650
the same thing if they correlate right
 

01:21:45.650 --> 01:21:48.070
the same thing if they correlate right
the chances of that are pretty low so

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080
the chances of that are pretty low so
 

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.450
the chances of that are pretty low so
you know the two big message if they

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:49.460
you know the two big message if they
 

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.310
you know the two big message if they
don't call it well actually introduce a

is what we're doing in measure give

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:54.650
is what we're doing in measure give

of experimental technology now once we

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:13.190
of experimental technology now once we
 

01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:14.620
of experimental technology now once we
have that reference data set we map it

01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:14.630
have that reference data set we map it
 

01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:16.600
have that reference data set we map it
out just to see you know what do we have

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:16.610
out just to see you know what do we have
 

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:18.730
out just to see you know what do we have
whether the characteristics what can we

01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:18.740
whether the characteristics what can we
 

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:20.050
whether the characteristics what can we
learn from how this data set is

01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:20.060
learn from how this data set is
 

01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.220
learn from how this data set is
structured and then with you a

01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:21.230
structured and then with you a
 

01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:23.020
structured and then with you a
mathematic survey at this one will

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:23.030
mathematic survey at this one will
 

01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:25.000
mathematic survey at this one will
calculate about 50 different metrics and

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:25.010
calculate about 50 different metrics and
 

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.000
calculate about 50 different metrics and
we're comparing what

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:26.010
we're comparing what
 

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:27.530
we're comparing what
their rankings but they will show you

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540
their rankings but they will show you
 

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:32.300
their rankings but they will show you
how that works ok moving on okay so the

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:32.310
how that works ok moving on okay so the
 

01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:33.770
how that works ok moving on okay so the
data normalization and just I wasn't

01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780
data normalization and just I wasn't
 

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.210

you need we wanted unique usage event so

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:40.170
you need we wanted unique usage event so
 

01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:41.750
you need we wanted unique usage event so
we didn't want statistic so we didn't

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760
we didn't want statistic so we didn't
 

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.520
we didn't want statistic so we didn't
want to know from that Journal a is you

01:24:43.520 --> 01:24:43.530
want to know from that Journal a is you

know who downloaded this article at what
 

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:51.080
know who downloaded this article at what
time at what date what kind of requested

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:51.090
time at what date what kind of requested
 

01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:54.980
time at what date what kind of requested
the issue and was that request issue

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:54.990
the issue and was that request issue
 

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:56.420
the issue and was that request issue
within the same session there's another

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:56.430
within the same session there's another
 

01:24:56.430 --> 01:24:57.800
within the same session there's another
request so that's why we have a session

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:57.810
request so that's why we have a session
 

01:24:57.810 --> 01:24:59.900
request so that's why we have a session
identifier in the exception identified

01:24:59.900 --> 01:24:59.910
identifier in the exception identified
 

01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:01.160
identifier in the exception identified
as well then there's a huge difference

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:01.170
as well then there's a huge difference
 

01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:03.920
as well then there's a huge difference
with usage statistics now this is what

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:03.930
with usage statistics now this is what
 

01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:05.510
with usage statistics now this is what
the David look like this is very messy

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520
the David look like this is very messy
 

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.050
the David look like this is very messy
we paid to full-time developers because

01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060
we paid to full-time developers because
 

01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:11.360
we paid to full-time developers because
of the look of the state ingested and

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:11.370
of the look of the state ingested and
 

01:25:11.370 --> 01:25:14.600
of the look of the state ingested and
normalize and they did a great job now

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:14.610
normalize and they did a great job now
 

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.330
normalize and they did a great job now
the final structure that we end up with

01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:16.340
the final structure that we end up with
 

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.520
the final structure that we end up with
and this is kinda relevant for the other

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:19.530
and this is kinda relevant for the other
 

01:25:19.530 --> 01:25:21.290
and this is kinda relevant for the other
kind of analysis we're going to do we

01:25:21.290 --> 01:25:21.300
kind of analysis we're going to do we

can rebuild in touch with extreme users

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:23.550
can rebuild in touch with extreme users
 

01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:25.100
can rebuild in touch with extreme users
because instead of session identifier

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:25.110
because instead of session identifier
 

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:27.590
because instead of session identifier
it's an anonymous session identifier so

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600
it's an anonymous session identifier so
 

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.720
it's an anonymous session identifier so
we know who the user is we notice the

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:29.730
we know who the user is we notice the
 

01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:31.880
we know who the user is we notice the
same user working from the same client

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:31.890
same user working from the same client
 

01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.470
same user working from the same client
so we know that a user actually went

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480
so we know that a user actually went
 

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.820
so we know that a user actually went
from document once the document you so

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:34.830
from document once the document you so
 

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:36.200

snapping this is a technique that with

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760
snapping this is a technique that with
 

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:02.229
snapping this is a technique that with
citation data you already have enough

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239
 
 

01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:07.239
 
oh no not the duration but you can

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:07.249
oh no not the duration but you can
 

01:26:07.249 --> 01:26:08.680
oh no not the duration but you can
calculate that from the clickstream as

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:08.690
calculate that from the clickstream as
 

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:09.729
calculate that from the clickstream as
well they're looking at the time

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:09.739
well they're looking at the time
 

01:26:09.739 --> 01:26:11.109
well they're looking at the time
differential but it's a date timestamp

01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119
differential but it's a date timestamp
 

01:26:11.119 --> 01:26:13.509
differential but it's a date timestamp
yeah it's a good question but you can

01:26:13.509 --> 01:26:13.519
yeah it's a good question but you can
 

01:26:13.519 --> 01:26:14.979
yeah it's a good question but you can
calculate how long they actually looked

01:26:14.979 --> 01:26:14.989
calculate how long they actually looked
 

01:26:14.989 --> 01:26:16.239
calculate how long they actually looked
at the document by looking at the

01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:16.249
at the document by looking at the
 

01:26:16.249 --> 01:26:18.609
at the document by looking at the
developers which is very interesting as

01:26:18.609 --> 01:26:18.619
developers which is very interesting as
 

01:26:18.619 --> 01:26:22.479
developers which is very interesting as
well so how do we actually so we're

01:26:22.479 --> 01:26:22.489
well so how do we actually so we're
 

01:26:22.489 --> 01:26:23.979
well so how do we actually so we're
saying with a citation that citation

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:23.989
saying with a citation that citation
 

01:26:23.989 --> 01:26:25.720
saying with a citation that citation
data leaks a citation that work ragged

that that essentially what we're doing

01:26:46.779 --> 01:26:46.789
that that essentially what we're doing
 

01:26:46.789 --> 01:26:48.160
that that essentially what we're doing
so we look at these click streams right

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:48.170
so we look at these click streams right
 

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:49.330
so we look at these click streams right
in every single click stream is a

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:49.340
in every single click stream is a
 

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:51.339
in every single click stream is a
session is a set of interactions user

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:51.349
session is a set of interactions user

session is a set of interactions user
requests like that pertain to a

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:53.690
requests like that pertain to a
 

01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:55.569
requests like that pertain to a
particular article now since articles

01:26:55.569 --> 01:26:55.579
particular article now since articles
 

01:26:55.579 --> 01:26:56.979
particular article now since articles
are published in journals right we can

01:26:56.979 --> 01:26:56.989
are published in journals right we can
 

01:26:56.989 --> 01:26:58.959
are published in journals right we can
convert each of these sequences to both

01:26:58.959 --> 01:26:58.969
convert each of these sequences to both
 

01:26:58.969 --> 01:27:00.850
convert each of these sequences to both
article sequences or journalist is

01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:00.860
article sequences or journalist is
 

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.709
article sequences or journalist is
within that session now we do with these

01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719
within that session now we do with these
 

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.120
within that session now we do with these
sequences and this is just a simple

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:04.130
sequences and this is just a simple
 

01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:06.700
sequences and this is just a simple
markov chain method is that we count the

01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:06.710
markov chain method is that we count the
 

01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:08.319
markov chain method is that we count the
number of times a journal three was

01:27:08.319 --> 01:27:08.329
number of times a journal three was
 

01:27:08.329 --> 01:27:10.000
number of times a journal three was
followed by journal one in those

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:10.010
followed by journal one in those
 

01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.439
followed by journal one in those
clickstream the account number of times

01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:11.449
clickstream the account number of times
 

01:27:11.449 --> 01:27:13.930
clickstream the account number of times
that happens right in this case journal

01:27:13.930 --> 01:27:13.940
that happens right in this case journal
 

01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:16.060
that happens right in this case journal
three years followed by a follow journal

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:16.070
three years followed by a follow journal
 

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:20.489
three years followed by a follow journal
22 times right and when we look at these

01:27:20.489 --> 01:27:20.499
22 times right and when we look at these
 

01:27:20.499 --> 01:27:22.779
22 times right and when we look at these
frequencies we can convert the

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:22.789
frequencies we can convert the
 

01:27:22.789 --> 01:27:25.390
frequencies we can convert the
probability like so in this case the

01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:25.400
probability like so in this case the
 

01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.009
probability like so in this case the
probability of someone going from

01:27:27.009 --> 01:27:27.019
probability of someone going from
 

01:27:27.019 --> 01:27:30.640

01:40:18.130 --> 01:40:18.140
these other metrics
 

01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:20.260
these other metrics
I mentioned including the eigenvector is

01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:20.270
I mentioned including the eigenvector is
 

01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:23.290
I mentioned including the eigenvector is
actually pretty large and the usage

01:40:23.290 --> 01:40:23.300
actually pretty large and the usage
 

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:25.450
actually pretty large and the usage
metrics are very reliable because they

01:40:25.450 --> 01:40:25.460
metrics are very reliable because they
 

01:40:25.460 --> 01:40:27.640
metrics are very reliable because they
all want the exact same thing regardless

01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:27.650
all want the exact same thing regardless
 

01:40:27.650 --> 01:40:29.800
all want the exact same thing regardless
of how the metric is defined in fact

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:29.810
of how the metric is defined in fact
 

01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:31.780
of how the metric is defined in fact
some of these usage metrics like usage

01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:31.790
some of these usage metrics like usage
 

01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:33.820
some of these usage metrics like usage
between us coral a better to their

between us coral a better to their
 

01:40:33.830 --> 01:40:36.610
between us coral a better to their
citation counterparts then either to the

01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:36.620
citation counterparts then either to the
 

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.320
citation counterparts then either to the
impact factor I'm sorry we're kind of

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:38.330
impact factor I'm sorry we're kind of
 

01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:39.760
impact factor I'm sorry we're kind of
hating on the impact factor here don't

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:39.770
hating on the impact factor here don't
 

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:41.890
hating on the impact factor here don't
want to be like that but the truth is

01:40:41.890 --> 01:40:41.900
want to be like that but the truth is
 

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:44.020
want to be like that but the truth is
that what this map tells us is that the

01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:44.030
that what this map tells us is that the
 

01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:47.050
that what this map tells us is that the
impact factor is a measure of stalling

01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:47.060
impact factor is a measure of stalling
 

01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.180
impact factor is a measure of stalling
the impact of scientific impact but it's

01:40:49.180 --> 01:40:49.190
the impact of scientific impact but it's
 

01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:51.370
the impact of scientific impact but it's
a very specific metric it produces

01:40:51.370 --> 01:40:51.380
a very specific metric it produces
 

01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:53.110
a very specific metric it produces
rankings that when you compare them to

01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:53.120
rankings that when you compare them to
 

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.790
rankings that when you compare them to
the rankings of all these other metrics

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800
the rankings of all these other metrics
 

01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:57.520
the rankings of all these other metrics
are kind of like an outline right well

01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:57.530
are kind of like an outline right well
 

01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:58.960
are kind of like an outline right well
these are the other hand they cluster

01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:58.970
these are the other hand they cluster
 

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:00.610
these are the other hand they cluster
very well and they're very close to

01:41:00.610 --> 01:41:00.620
very well and they're very close to
 

01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:02.470
very well and they're very close to
these which means that if you combine

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480
these which means that if you combine
 

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:04.510
these which means that if you combine
all of these together you have a sense

01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520
all of these together you have a sense
 

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:06.490
all of these together you have a sense
of impact that is much more consensus

01:41:06.490 --> 01:41:06.500
of impact that is much more consensus
 

01:41:06.500 --> 01:41:10.060
of impact that is much more consensus
sense of impact then you then you would

01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:10.070
sense of impact then you then you would
 

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:12.520
sense of impact then you then you would
have with the impact factory but we also

01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:12.530
have with the impact factory but we also
 

01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:13.960
have with the impact factory but we also
know this by the way if you look at the

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:13.970
know this by the way if you look at the
 

01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:16.330
know this by the way if you look at the
actual distribution vertically these are

01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:16.340
actual distribution vertically these are
 

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:17.830
actual distribution vertically these are
the degree metrics right and this is

01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840
the degree metrics right and this is
 

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.660
the degree metrics right and this is
page rank in between this page I can

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:19.670
page rank in between this page I can
 

01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:21.010
page rank in between this page I can
between is one of the things that they

01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:21.020
between is one of the things that they
 

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.120
between is one of the things that they
do they look at the total network

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:22.130
do they look at the total network
 

01:41:22.130 --> 01:41:24.010
do they look at the total network
structure so instead of just looking how

01:41:24.010 --> 01:41:24.020
structure so instead of just looking how
 

01:41:24.020 --> 01:41:25.630
structure so instead of just looking how
many citations you receive they look at

01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:25.640
many citations you receive they look at
 

01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.340
many citations you receive they look at
where do those citations felt from and

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:27.350
where do those citations felt from and
 

01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:29.170
where do those citations felt from and
now they is it how do they position you

01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:29.180
now they is it how do they position you
 

01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:31.150
now they is it how do they position you
in the network so these metrics down

01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:31.160
in the network so these metrics down
 

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:32.770
in the network so these metrics down
here we look at them as indicating

01:41:32.770 --> 01:41:32.780
here we look at them as indicating
 

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:34.480
here we look at them as indicating
prestige or power or something like that

01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:34.490
prestige or power or something like that
 

01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:37.150
prestige or power or something like that
up here we just count how many citations

01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:37.160
up here we just count how many citations
 

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.760
up here we just count how many citations
something receives it just popularity

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:39.770
something receives it just popularity
 

01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:41.680
something receives it just popularity
right so is it the folks way of saying

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:41.690
right so is it the folks way of saying
 

01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:43.870
right so is it the folks way of saying
it right is that you've got some bottle

01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:43.880
it right is that you've got some bottle
 

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.090
it right is that you've got some bottle
arity metrics up on top here and the

01:41:46.090 --> 01:41:46.100
arity metrics up on top here and the
 

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.400
arity metrics up on top here and the
Percy's Matt precision metrics at the

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:48.410
Percy's Matt precision metrics at the
 

01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:52.390
Percy's Matt precision metrics at the
bottom so if you scale it like that and

01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400
bottom so if you scale it like that and
 

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:53.089
bottom so if you scale it like that and
you look at

01:41:53.089 --> 01:41:53.099
you look at
 

01:41:53.099 --> 01:41:56.540
you look at
what we have really is a mat not just of

01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:56.550
what we have really is a mat not just of
 

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:58.609
what we have really is a mat not just of
these metrics the map of scientific

01:41:58.609 --> 01:41:58.619
these metrics the map of scientific
 

01:41:58.619 --> 01:42:00.169
these metrics the map of scientific
impact itself and how it could be

01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179
impact itself and how it could be
 

01:42:00.179 --> 01:42:01.699
impact itself and how it could be
measured so if you want to measure

01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:01.709
measured so if you want to measure
 

01:42:01.709 --> 01:42:04.099
measured so if you want to measure
prestige you can choose to do that

01:42:04.099 --> 01:42:04.109
prestige you can choose to do that
 

01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:05.839
prestige you can choose to do that
either in the basis of citation data or

01:42:05.839 --> 01:42:05.849
either in the basis of citation data or
 

01:42:05.849 --> 01:42:09.679
either in the basis of citation data or
or a citation it all usage data but if

01:42:09.679 --> 01:42:09.689
or a citation it all usage data but if
 

01:42:09.689 --> 01:42:11.989
or a citation it all usage data but if
you want a recent for speed right one

01:42:11.989 --> 01:42:11.999
you want a recent for speed right one
 

01:42:11.999 --> 01:42:14.179
you want a recent for speed right one
prestige as it is now you want to use

01:42:14.179 --> 01:42:14.189
prestige as it is now you want to use
 

01:42:14.189 --> 01:42:16.310
prestige as it is now you want to use
usage data if you want to procedure as
