So next, I will attempt to make my program wait for a certain period of time.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.610
To find about this, I went back to

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.890
Google, and then typed python make my program wait.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.100
One of the first links there was this

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.670
website called stackoverflow.com. Now this will soon become

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.490
one of your favorite websites as a programmer.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.830
it suggested to use something called time.sleep which suspends

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.670
the program for a given number of seconds. Okay, back to the program. Now since

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.345
I'm still in testing phase I will try to suspend the program only for about ten

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.900
seconds; we can change this number later. I also know that I have to import the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.930
time module. Okay, let's save this and run. Alright.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.001
It seems like the program is waiting for a few seconds before it

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:56.752
opens the web browser.

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:59.660

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.170

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.580
Another item bites the dust.
