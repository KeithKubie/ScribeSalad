00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.520
Conditional probability is
an absolutely basic idea

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.130
that we use all the time.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
It's the probability
that some event occurs,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.160
given certain
information about it.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.190
For example, an
insurance company

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.390
wants to know, what's the
probability that you'll

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.580
live for the next 10 years
given your medical history?

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.850
Or a typical investor
wants to know,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.740
what's the probability that
this stock is going to rise

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.315
given its stock price
gyrations for the past month?

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.940
There are people who
actually think you

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.200
could do that, the chartists.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.770
That, not knowing anything
about the nature of the company,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.280
or the business that
the stock is part of,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.160
that just by watching the price
gyration you can make a better

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490
guess on what the
stock will do tomorrow

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.770
than you could otherwise.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.610
Another good example is
for a system engineer.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.170
What's the probability that the
system is going to overload,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.837
given the recent history of
the rate at which requests

00:00:58.837 --> 00:00:59.670
have been coming in?

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930
And finally, as a joke
that I like to think about,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.819
is, what's the
probability that you're

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.920
a cat owner, given
that you're sitting

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.145
in the cat section of the Angell
Memorial Veterinary Hospital?

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.010
OK.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.866
So let's look concretely
at a very simple example

00:01:16.866 --> 00:01:18.240
of conditional
probability that's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.110
meant to be illustrative,
where we look at a die,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.481
and rolling a fair die.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.410
OK.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.790
Now if I'm thinking about
an ordinary fair die,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.170
I've got 6 outcomes
that are equally likely.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.700
The outcomes are one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
And if I ask, what's the
probability that in one roll,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.670
I roll a one?

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.310
Well it's going to be the
number of outcomes involving

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.830
my rolling a one, divided by
the total number of outcomes.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.060
It's one-sixth.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.559
The probability of any given
face of a six-sided fair die

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:49.100
is one-sixth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.580
But suppose I give you some
additional information.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.110
Knowledge about
the roll can change

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.250
the judgment of probabilities.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.860
Suppose that I tell you
that I rolled an odd number.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.390
And now I want to know
what's the probability that I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180
rolled a one?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.250
And the answer will now be that,
given that it's an odd number,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.290
the only possibilities
are one, three, and five.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.335
And so the probability
has changed to one-third.

00:02:20.335 --> 00:02:22.210
That should be a
straightforward enough idea.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.620
One way to understand
conditional probability

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.770
is as a kind of
experiment, where first you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.840
try to roll an odd
number and then you

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.680
do you decide what final
roll you're going to make.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.260
Let's look at that tree, if we
were describing it that way.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.170
So the first branch
of the tree that we'll

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.350
use to build a
probability space is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.255
to say, OK, among the six
possible outcomes, what

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:52.280
are the chances that we
rolled an odd number?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.610
Well, it's 50/50, because
there are three of each.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.680
So there's one-half chance that
yes, you rolled an odd number.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.450
In which case those are
the possible outcomes.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.130
Or a one-half chance that no,
you didn't roll an odd number,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.450
and the possible outcomes
then are two, four, and six.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.310
Now, once you're here
with one, three, and five,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.550
let's ask whether
you rolled a one.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.490
The probability that
you did roll a one,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.570
we've already
agreed is one-third.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.000
It's equally likely to be any
one of those three outcomes.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.720
Which means that it's two-thirds
that you wind up rolling

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.240
either a three or a five.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.140
And likewise, here,
the probability

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.737
if you didn't roll
an odd number, that

00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:32.070
is, you rolled an even number,
the probability that next

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.750
you'll roll a one is zero.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.930
Or that you won't roll a
one is probability one.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.310
So this is a kind
of standard way

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.390
that we have of trying to
build up a set of probabilities

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.800
for outcomes.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.350
And if we look at this
tree, well, first of all,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.180
we can use it to assign
some probabilities.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.150
Because the probability
of your rolling

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.990
a one is one-sixth,
as it should be.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.060
It's one-half times
one-third, which

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.814
is the usual way we would
calculate the probability

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:03.480
of this outcome.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.780
By the way, we could calculate
the probability of the outcome

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.800
being three or five.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.810
It would be one-half times
two-thirds or one-third.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.820
And finally, the probability
of rolling an even number

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.960
would just be one-half.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.223
One-half times one.

00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:21.510
Now, what's going on here?

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.695
Well, if you look at
this number, one-third,

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:28.240
it is what we said was
the probability of a one,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.640
given that you
rolled an odd number.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.140
So that's where this
label came from.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.490
Likewise, this
number, two-thirds,

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.700
is the probability that you
didn't roll a one, given

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.620
that you rolled an odd number.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.000
And finally, this number
is the probability

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.100
that you didn't
roll a one, given

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.450
that you rolled an even number.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:49.380
And it's certain.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.590
Let's do another example
to get this idea across.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.520
Let's go back to Monty Hall,
which we've seen before.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.470
Remember how we
have the probability

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.710
labels on these branches,
which we figured out.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.730
So if we look at this number,
one-third, what is it?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.590
Well this is where the
prize is at Location One

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.260
and the contestant
has picked Door One.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.260
And that one-third,
we figured out

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.050
that once the prize
is at Door One,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.330
in fact, wherever the
prize is, the probability

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.420
that the contestant will
pick One is one-third.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.900
This number, one-third,
is the probability

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.830
the contestant
will pick One given

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.940
that the prize is at Door One.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.440
Yeah?

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.550
Here's another third.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.650
This is, similarly, the
probability that the contestant

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.300
will pick Door Two given that
the prize is at Door Three.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.577
It's symmetric to this one.

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:42.410
But here's something a
little bit different.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.520
Here's one-half.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.170
This is the probability
that Door Three

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.860
will be opened by Carol
given that the prize is

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.381
at One-- that's that branch--
and the contestant picked One.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.080
And when the prize is at One
and the contestant picks One,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.870
Carol, we said in our
model, is equally likely

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.000
to open the two possible
doors that have goats

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.190
that she's able to open.

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.570
And so that's one-half, is
this conditional probability.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.470
The probability that
she'll open Door Three

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.300
given that we're in this
location in the tree.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.930
Given that the prize is
at One and pick is at One.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.690
So the point is simply
that we were reasoning

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.810
about conditional probability in
the very way we began defining

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.480
the tree model that we were
using to define probability

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.270
spaces in the first place.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.970
We were implicitly using
conditional probabilities

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.060
to label the probabilities that
left each vertex of the tree.

00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:41.580
And in fact, formally
speaking, what we were using

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.540
was the product rule.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.870
Which is that, the probability
that an A event occurs and a B

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.730
event occurs is
simply the probability

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.480
that the A event-- that's the
first branch of the tree--

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.090
times the probability
of B given A. That's

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.420
the fundamental rule of
conditional probabilities.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.950
That's the product rule, and
it's something to be memorized.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.060
In fact, this product
rule is not a corollary.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.320
It's really the definition
of conditional probability.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.939
So all of the
previous discussion

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.730
was motivation of the
following definition.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.510
If A and B are events
in a probability space,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.340
the probability
of B, given A, is

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.790
defined to be the probability
that A and B occur--

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.460
that is, A intersection B--
relative to the probability

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.010
of A.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.730
So that's the formal definition.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.000
So this formal definition
justifies the product rule

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.774
by definition.

00:07:40.774 --> 00:07:43.315
Because you just multiply both
sides by the probability of A.

00:07:43.315 --> 00:07:46.080
And you get probability of A
times the probability of B,

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.320
given A is the probability
of the intersection.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.330
Notice that implicit
in this definition

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.540
is, the probability of
A better not be zero.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.600
So you can't
condition on an event

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.910
that has zero probability.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.950
Probability of B given A is
only defined if probability of A

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.520
is positive.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.960
OK.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.450
If you have a tree
that's of depth three,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.920
then you need a product rule
for three consecutive choices.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.160
And it generalizes in
a straightforward way.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.322
Namely, the probability of A and
B and C-- the first branch is A

00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:18.280
and the second branch is
B and the third branch

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.630
is C-- is the probability that
you do A on the first branch,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.300
times the probability
that you do

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.620
B on the second branch,
given that you did

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.600
A on the first branch,
and times the probability

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.440
that you do C on
the third branch,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.730
given that you did A on the
first and B on the second.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.350
And this product rule
for three could, in fact,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.409
be proved simply by
substitution, using the product

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:43.470
rule for two twice.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.760
And of course it generalizes
to any finite number of sets.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.830
Another useful way to
think about probability,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:59.280
that may be a more intuitive
than the idea of choosing

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.180
to whether or not to roll
odd and then choosing

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.672
whether or not to roll a one,
usually what you think of is,

00:09:05.672 --> 00:09:07.130
you rolled the dice
and then you're

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.390
giving me some information
about what that roll was.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.370
I don't think about the
odds of rolling odd or not.

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.890
I just tell you
it's odd, and now

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.630
tell me what is the probability
that, among those odd outcomes,

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.380
it was one.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.100
So a way to formalize
that is, you

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.295
could think of
conditioning on an event A

00:09:26.295 --> 00:09:30.570
as defining a new probability
function on the sample space.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.880
Once you're given
that A occurred,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.202
I can now think that all the
probabilities of the sample

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:37.410
of the outcomes have changed.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.830
So I'll define a new
probability measure

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.300
relative to A, where all the
outcomes that are not in A

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.080
are going to be assigned
probability zero.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.640
Because they can't happen
given that A occurred.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:54.600
And all of the probabilities
of outcomes of points in A,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.060
they get their probability
raised in proportion to A.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.711
Because now A is going to
be whole probability space.

00:10:01.075 --> 00:10:02.950
Let's be a little bit
more formal about that,

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.920
to be precise.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.550
We're going to define a
new probability function.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.800
Probability sub A, on
the same sample space,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.610
where the probability
of an outcome

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.610
is zero if the
outcome is not in A,

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.290
and its old probability
relativized to the probability

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.630
of A, if omega is in A.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.360
So that's the definition
of the probability

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.610
with respect to A of omega.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.840
It's a new probability measure
on the same sample space.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.810
So to verify that this new
thing is a probability space,

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.350
you have to verify that the sum
of the outcome probabilities

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:37.130
is one.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.850
And that's a little
exercise that I

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.600
would encourage you to stop now
and work out a piece of paper.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.307
Because it's trivial,
but it's worth

00:10:44.307 --> 00:10:46.015
checking that you
follow the definitions.

00:10:46.515 --> 00:10:49.710
The claim is simply that
this new measure, probability

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.410
sub A--

00:10:50.410 --> 00:11:27.120
[NO SOUND]

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.620
--will satisfy all of
the rules of probability.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.350
Because it is a
probability measure.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.030
So for example, I have the
difference rule restated

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.280
for conditional probabilities.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:41.300
Given that probability sub
A is a probability measure,

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.170
it satisfies the
difference rule.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.140
Which means when I translate it
into a conditional probability

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.480
statement, I get that the
probability of B minus C,

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.360
given A, is equal to
the probability of B,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.060
given A, minus the probability
of B intersection C, given A.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.890
It's exactly the same as the
standard difference rule,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:05.120
except that I have it made
everything conditioned on A.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.160
And so we automatically
get all of these rules

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.430
for conditional probability that
we had holding for probability.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.630
Which will be helpful.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.760
We won't have to think
about proving them again.
