00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:18.356
What is a cartoon really?

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:19.855
Many of us love cartoons,

00:00:19.855 --> 00:00:21.401
most of us grew up reading them

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.265
or having them read to us.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.063
The fact is, cartoons have been around a long time.

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:29.082
There are all kinds of cartoons:

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.653
strip comics,

00:00:30.653 --> 00:00:32.152
comic books,

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:33.781
political cartoons,

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:34.988
single-panel cartoons,

00:00:34.988 --> 00:00:36.139
graphic novels,

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.550
web comics,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.256
animation,

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:40.671
caricature,

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:42.949
there is something for everyone.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.465
No matter the form them come in,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.471
cartoons elicit all kinds of emotions from the viewer

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:51.203
- happiness, sadness, anger, hilarity, calm -

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:54.106
and can transmit ideas in an instant.

00:00:54.106 --> 00:00:56.577
Cartoons are a universal medium enjoyed and understood

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.316
around the world and across borders.

00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:02.482
This is why they have survived so long as an art form.

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:05.450
But how can a medium that is on the surface so simple

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.438
have so much influence and at times be so meaningful?

00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:12.193
Let's look at what a cartoon is.

00:01:12.193 --> 00:01:14.702
It starts with an idea.

00:01:14.702 --> 00:01:16.068
The idea can be verbal,

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:17.002
written in words,

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.123
or it can be visual.

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:20.803
A visual idea is simply

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:22.131
a picture,

00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:22.922
a drawing,

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:24.843
a doodle.

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:28.086
These ideas come from a variety of places.

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:30.524
Cartoonists might find the idea from observing life,

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.175
reading a newspaper,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.195
trawling online.

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:36.585
It can come from a sentence someone said

00:01:36.585 --> 00:01:39.663
or a single word heard on television.

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:41.752
Cartoonists are like sponges;

00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:46.848
they soak up people, places, mannerisms, clothing, and behavior.

00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:48.593
Sometimes they might jot them down

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:51.901
in a little black book that they carry around with them.

00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.634
Other times, it is just soaked up into the cartoonist's brain

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:59.939
only to be squeezed out later when she is sitting at her drawing table.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.070
Not only does a cartoonist have to be aware

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.825
of what she is seeing visually,

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:06.819
but she has to listen to herself think.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.935
In other words, take the incoming information

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:13.533
and select it, shape it, and then use it for a cartoon.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:14.685
Now that you have an idea,

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:17.301
or something you think could be good for a cartoon,

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.034
it's time to shape it.

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:21.597
A cartoon is like a staged play.

00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:23.042
A cartoonist is playwright,

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:23.889
director,

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.098
stage designer,

00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:26.116
choreographer,

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:27.925
and costume designer.

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:29.209
A cartoon has characters,

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.989
a set,

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:30.751
dialogue,

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:31.985
even if one line,

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.127
and a backstory.

00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:36.418
The characters must be dressed to fit the idea,

00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:39.100
speak in a way that is natural and forwards the idea

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.178
or gives the punchline.

00:02:41.178 --> 00:02:42.803
Nothing should be in the cartoon

00:02:42.803 --> 00:02:47.317
that is not absolutely necessary for the advancement of the idea.

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:50.323
The image and words have to &lt;i&gt;dance&lt;/i&gt; together

00:02:50.323 --> 00:02:52.668
in a way that makes sense.

00:02:52.668 --> 00:02:55.919
It could be a graceful dance, or an awkward dance,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.323
if that is part of the humor or idea.

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:00.650
And then the execution.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.855
Some cartoonists sketch the idea with pencil

00:03:02.855 --> 00:03:06.178
then ink it with pen using a light box.

00:03:06.178 --> 00:03:07.894
Others visualize the image in their head

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:11.125
and draw directly on the paper in pen.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.900
Different kinds of pens are used:

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.431
felt-tip, mechanical pen, or a crow quill.

00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:18.529
Paper can be light-weight or heavy-bond.

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.465
Many cartoonists add gray tone, called a wash,

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:24.467
by using black watercolor and a brush.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.010
Others use a soft pencil for the tone.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.199
Color is usually created by using watercolor.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.519
A finished cartoon can then be scanned and adjusted,

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.466
and the caption can be added on the computer with Photoshop.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:41.250
New technologies are emerging for the cartoonist's use in creating her cartoon.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.397
Photoshop can serve as a tool for color and image.

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:47.545
Some may draw directly on a tablet with a stylus.

00:03:47.545 --> 00:03:50.968
The choices at this stage of creation work in tandem with the idea,

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:53.178
and often when the final caption is added,

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:55.563
it gets adjusted yet again.

00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:57.353
But, little is left to chance,

00:03:57.353 --> 00:03:59.969
except, perhaps, some of the watercolor.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.147
All these elements function in concert with one another.

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:05.993
It's almost like a dance of words, ideas, and images

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:08.643
that work together in order to make the cartoon

00:04:08.643 --> 00:04:11.235
a timeless, resilient work of art.
