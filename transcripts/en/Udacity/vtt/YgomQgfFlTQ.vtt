00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is my solution. I build a variable called "diffcrosstrackerror,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which is in my differential, that is set to the momentary crosstrack error

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
minus the previous one which I the very first time initialize to the present one.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then in the steering, I don't just steer proportionately to the crosstrack error,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but also proportionately to the differential crosstrack error times the parameter 2.

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
When I put this in and I run it, I will get exactly the output that I showed you.
