00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.960
- [Instructor] My grandfather
often tries to persuade me

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.640
that he is still groovy

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.280
but how how groovy can be be

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.410
if he still uses the word groovy?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.840
I actually like the
way that that's written

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.400
because they're saying my
grandfather often tries

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.130
to persuade me that he is still groovy

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.290
and that means kind of cool

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.070
for those of you who might be too young

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.720
to know what groovy means

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.990
bu that's a good point

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.290
but how groovy can he be

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.310
if he still uses this word groovy,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.260
so I like that,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.880
this but kind of, it's
kind of turning the tide

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.437
on the first part of the sentence

00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:33.840
and that's why you would use a but

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.860
and so, I'm leaning towards no change

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.220
but let's feel good that we can rule out

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.610
the other choices.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.340
My grandfather often tries to persuade me

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.660
that he still groovy

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.804
because how groovy can he be

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:49.550
if he still uses the word groovy?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.550
Well, because implies that the
grandfather does this thing,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.950
because of this thing,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.620
so because of how groovy can he be,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.160
that's the reason why
he tries to persuade him

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.970
or his grandfather or his grandson

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.400
that he's still groovy.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.137
No, that doesn't make sense.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:14.350
My grandfather often tries to persuade me

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.810
that he is still groovy

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.360
meaning how groovy can he be

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.210
if he still uses the word groovy.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.700
No, that also doesn't make sense

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.930
because meaning would mean

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.200
that there's some type of
clarifying that is going

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.640
of the first part of the clause

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.650
and that's not what's going on here.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.010
You actually have kind of a opposition

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.990
to the first clause, it's
kind of contradicting it

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.780
a little bit, it's like
how groovy can he be

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.200
if he still uses the word groovy?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.640
And that's why but is a
really good thing there.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.510
My grandfather often tries to persuade me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.850
that he is still groovy

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.500
since how groovy can he be

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.670
if he still uses the word groovy?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.640
So, once again, since kind
of draws a natural cause

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:55.600
and effect, since this, this is happening

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.540
but it isn't since how groovy he can be,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.960
how groovy can he be

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.900
if still uses the word groovy.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.584
That's not somehow causing him

00:02:03.584 --> 00:02:06.780
to persuade his grandchild

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.613
that he's still groovy,

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:09.970
so this also doesn't feel right at all.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.803
I really like this.

00:02:10.803 --> 00:02:12.860
These two clauses are
kind of in opposition,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.470
they're kind of contradicting it,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.240
they don't contradict but
this second clause opposes

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.640
the first one in kind of a fond way,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.030
it turns the tide back on it

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.200
by using the word groovy itself.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.670
It's actually just a fun sentence.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.240
So, we actually fill in the answer.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.540
You don't wanna forget
filling in your answer.
