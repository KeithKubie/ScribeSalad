00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:04.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
So on my foraging
journey, I met this one.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.572
It's pure sugar.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:09.175
Imagine, when you are
out there, starving,

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.543
and suddenly there is sugar.

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.279
In the middle of that
little thing there,

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.014 line:0%
you've got little insects.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.750 line:0%
The insects build
a little house,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.386 line:0%
and inside is pure sugar.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.055
Other tricks, you can
use a lot of things,

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:26.225 align:start size:84% position:16%
including water
plant, lotus plant,

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.561
and not all of them are edible,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.498 align:start size:84% position:16%
and not all of them
are edible raw.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:35.134 align:start size:97% position:3%
Some of them, you cook them,
they lose the toxicity.

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.036 align:start size:88% position:13%
You really have to
know what you're doing.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
And this is the
knowledge by the way,

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start size:88% position:13%
coming from the
Aboriginal people only.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.843
Is not my knowledge.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:48.481 align:start position:0%
This is only from the knowledge
of those 60,000 years,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:50.850
they've been living there.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start size:84% position:16%
And sometimes,
when you are there,

00:00:55.188 --> 00:00:59.858 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wondering, I'm never
wondering why I'm out there,

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:02.529
I'm wondering what is out there.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:07.133
Because, I have to make
a confession to you guys.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.568
I still don't know
why I'm walking.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:10.870
Imagine.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.806
I've ran all around
the planet, once.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.808
It's a lot of walking.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.177
And I still don't know.

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:21.280
We don't always have to know.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.750 align:start size:84% position:16%
We don't always
have to know things.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.754
But the reality, it's
not what you think,

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.355
it's what you feel.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.793
What you feel's right for you,

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:34.794
you must do.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.699
This is a really good day.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:43.770 align:start size:94% position:6%
This is like a, foof, five
star, top left corner,

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.842
we've got a little wood
house, it's like a tumor

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.111
in one type of eucalyptus.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.248
We've got a little
hole in the middle.

00:01:55.248 --> 00:01:59.419
Inside, we've got a soft shell,
like really soft soft shell,

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:03.922
and it's like a little
bed, and inside the bed

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:07.360
you've got insect, little grubs.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.097
And you chuck that in a
fire, cook a little bit,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.465 align:start size:88% position:13%
when the smokes get
out of the little hole,

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's cooked, you can eat
the bugs and the bed.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.103
Lovely.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:20.773
Top, red thing called dog balls.

00:02:21.907 --> 00:02:24.844
Really sweet and
powerful vitamin C,

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:28.414
really difficult to
find, really rare,

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.383
grow in a really high grass.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.185
You really have to have
an eye for this one.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:34.553 align:start size:84% position:16%
Really happy to
find it because that

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:36.890
will cut my hunger at night.

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:40.827
On the right corner, we've got,

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:46.899 align:start size:84% position:16%
some really, we call
that wild peach.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.334 align:start size:81% position:19%
Doesn't taste like
a peach at all.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:51.971
It's really sour, but
I like to have that

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:56.608 align:start size:97% position:3%
in my mouth, to makes my
mouth watering during the day.

00:02:56.608 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start size:84% position:16%
And finally, the
main five star food,

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.482 align:start size:81% position:19%
will help me along
the way a lot,

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:03.616
it's this one.

00:03:03.616 --> 00:03:06.052
This is the boab nut.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:09.388
The boab nut come
from the boab tree,

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.558
and this tree teach me so much.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, this is amazing
takeaway food.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.165
See this fruit?

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.802
This is the boab
nut, and inside,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.939 size:88% position:44%
you've got what I can eat.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.277 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's a lot of work, always,
involving that process.

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:35.448
So you have to smash the
little powder thing inside,

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.352
you will find 15
to 20 little nuts.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.958
And then, those nuts,
you have to roast them,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.761
on a fire, but not too hot.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.430 align:start size:88% position:13%
You have to make a fire,
take the fire away,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.766
and roast it under hot sand.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:59.905 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then only, you can
smash it between two stones,

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:02.875 align:start size:94% position:6%
and start to eat the
little white meat inside.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:06.145 align:start size:84% position:16%
So it's a lot of
process and work, but,

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.017
really good news, right?

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.653
Food that actually
I can carry with me.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.622
This is amazing thing.

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.891
Really powerful food, also.

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:23.363
Typical afternoon, in my house.

00:04:25.198 --> 00:04:28.500
End of the day, after
really hot day because

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.035
I have to say it's really hot,

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:31.837
and during this time,

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:35.374 align:start position:0%
because you've got two different
times when you can do this.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:38.411 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's during the wet
season, or the dry season.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.779
I decided to do the
dry season thing.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.415
More easy, right.

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:44.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
But that was also
the bushfire season,

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:48.520
so I will have this
pressure constantly,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.023
of having my nose in
the wind all the time

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:53.559 align:start size:84% position:16%
to smell what's
going on in the air,

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.994
because if there's a
bushfire coming in,

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.930
you need to react straight away,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.533 align:start size:97% position:3%
knowing that a bushfire
goes 40 kilometers an hour,

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:02.969
it's really fast.

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:08.274
So typically there, I've
got this flat stone here,

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:12.445 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I will be smashing the
boab nuts on the stone.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.182
That's all I will eat.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:20.085
And, of course, fishing.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:24.056 align:start size:88% position:13%
Well, those water there,
they are salty water.

00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:27.226 align:start size:84% position:16%
Brackish, as they call
that in Australia.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:29.862
So they are tidal water.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.464
On the bottom you've
got the sweet water,

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.166
on the top you've
got the salt water.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:35.834
So if you want to
drink some water,

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:38.036
you need to wait when
the tide goes down,

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:40.405
and only you can drink water.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:43.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, that's also
tricky, for fishing.

00:05:44.743 --> 00:05:46.378
Because depend of the tide,

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:49.448
you've got the type
of fish in it or not.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:53.085
So, you kind of happy
to have a fish, right?

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:56.155
So let me tell you a
story about that fish.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.824
This fish, it toxic.

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:03.295 align:start size:97% position:3%
You've got this little back
fin here, on the spine.

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:06.299
If you touch that,
not long to live.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:13.539
That's why I put a piece of
wood in its mouth, like that.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.109
So the first fish, I'm
an excellent fisherwoman,

00:06:17.109 --> 00:06:19.444
really excellent,
because I grew up,

00:06:19.444 --> 00:06:21.079
we were going, not on holiday,

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.983
we were going fishing with
my father, or my brother.

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:26.118
So I'm good at this.

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:29.955 align:start size:84% position:16%
So the first fish
that I actually took,

00:06:29.955 --> 00:06:33.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
was like a kid, this fish
was jumping out of the water,

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.295
I would be like so happy!

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:38.730 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can still see this
fish jumping out.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.902 align:start size:97% position:3%
So then later the next thing
I hear was like, splash.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:46.139
Crocodile gets it.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.208
I was like, really?!

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:51.810
How I'm going to do these thing?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.382
I'm doing all the work, and
they're going to eat all, what?!

00:06:56.382 --> 00:06:57.717
Not on my watch!

00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:01.520
So there's always
a solution, right?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.022
I been thinking a little bit,

00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:05.724
I'm going to get you guys.

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.993
I noticed that I was doing it,

00:07:07.993 --> 00:07:12.497
more I was doing a little
noise on top of the water.

00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:14.833
More they're attracted
to the noise, right?

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.569
So I will do that.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:21.106
And then, on purpose, I
would retrieve my stuff,

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:24.777
and get to my second
point, 150 meters away,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.914
and fish really quietly here.

00:07:28.914 --> 00:07:32.351
And grab my fish, and go
back to my point and say,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:35.688
haha, got one (laughs).

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:39.157
But, I'm always a fair player,

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:41.526 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I will
always share my food.

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:43.029
This is the rule in the bush,

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:46.032 align:start size:97% position:3%
this is the rule with nature,
I always share my food.

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:49.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I will cut the fish,
take the guts out,

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:52.871
cut the head, and I will
give it to those amazing

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:57.043
friends of mine, which is
the sweetwater crocodiles.

00:07:58.577 --> 00:07:59.878
How cute they are!

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.814
They're looking at you!

00:08:03.014 --> 00:08:06.752
You can't not fall in
love with those things.

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:11.324
And they are so passion,
and they are there waiting,

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.393 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you give them something,
like little puppy really.

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:19.031
They become my friend and
my soulmate out there.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:23.035 align:start size:88% position:13%
There was nobody, no
human, no sign of human,

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:25.037
only snakes, crocodiles.

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:28.274
And them...

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:34.813
So, once I get the fish, you
have to still to cook the fish,

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:36.415
so the best way to cook a fish,

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.784
and be able to eat
all of the meat,

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:42.288 align:start size:88% position:13%
is to cook in the
water, simple like that.

00:08:44.256 --> 00:08:48.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
And interestingly, I had
some salt and pepper with me,

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:50.529
never use it.

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:54.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
I love the taste of the food,
of the fiber, of nature.

00:08:56.302 --> 00:08:58.937 align:start size:81% position:19%
So sometimes, when
you are there,

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:01.473
I had a chance to wash myself.

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:02.975
Imagine.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.811
So, this is a natural soap.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.148
It's one extremity
of a eucalyptus tree.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:14.420
So, I took this, and if you
smash it between your hands,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.258 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the water, it's got the
saturation and saponin,

00:09:19.258 --> 00:09:20.960
it's actually like a soap.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.063
It's amazing, make
your hair so shiny,

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.298
and really works, really.

00:09:26.298 --> 00:09:28.934 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the good thing
also about this trick,

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:31.270
it's if you are in
a small billabong,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.740
you can actually do
that in the water,

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
and that will make a saturation
of oxygen in the water,

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:42.181 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the fish living there
will come up in the surface,

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.351
with the tummy up,
looking for oxygen.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.520 align:start size:84% position:16%
You just have to
collect your dinner.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.223
Thanks to the Aboriginal people.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:54.259
So when you are there like that,

00:09:54.259 --> 00:09:57.663
you can wash, but not like here.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:10:01.834 align:start position:0%
One day it's the left foot,
another day it's the right one.

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.236
Little bit after,

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:09.375
anyway, in my country, a good
cheese is a smelly cheese.

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:15.648
So, back to the action.

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.750
This is a typical camp.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.087
Things always two
knife, you notice?

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:23.856
In case if I forgot one.

00:10:23.856 --> 00:10:27.259
Or in case if I lose
one in an emergency.

00:10:29.094 --> 00:10:32.197 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I will never
sleep near the water.

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:34.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's the last thing
you have to do.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.002
I will actually stay there,

00:10:37.002 --> 00:10:39.472
the water is just not far off,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:43.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
collect my food,
fishing, then that day

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:46.711 align:start size:84% position:16%
I noticed some
tracks on the sand.

00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:49.982 align:start size:84% position:16%
I saw there was
some dingos around.

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:54.052 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, rather than giving the
inside guts of the fish

00:10:54.052 --> 00:10:57.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
to the crocodile, I will
leave it on the side,

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:01.560
cause I know that will be
little four legs friend

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.095
coming to get it.

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:05.730
Anyway, I finish my day,
eat, collect everything,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.767
walk off, because
those crocodiles,

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:12.705
can actually put their legs
up and walk five kilometers

00:11:12.705 --> 00:11:15.908 align:start size:94% position:6%
inland, so you better know
where you're sleeping.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:18.277
Pretty high up, right?

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:21.647 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was this typical
thing up there,

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:24.516 align:start size:81% position:19%
where crocodile
eat German people.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start size:88% position:13%
What happened, those
German people get drunk,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.557 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they are feeling
really powerful,

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.658 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they kind of
sleep near the water,

00:11:33.658 --> 00:11:36.228
thinking, you know, you're
not going to get me here,

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:38.797
20 meters from the water.

00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:42.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
They sleep in the
tent, completely drunk.

00:11:42.033 --> 00:11:45.504
The crocodiles come at night,
take the bottom of the tent,

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.541 align:start size:84% position:16%
and withdraw the tent,
get in the water,

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.111 align:start size:94% position:6%
and turn the tent, and
the guy is inside the tent

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:54.713 align:start size:84% position:16%
half-drunk, and he's
going to do spin,

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.816
washing machine spin, and he
doesn't know what's going on,

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.551
until he's dead.

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, all those stories,
I was aware of.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:05.257 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, really every single night,
I would go in safe spot.

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:10.128
And so what does it
mean, a safe spot?

00:12:10.128 --> 00:12:11.663
Where to go?

00:12:11.663 --> 00:12:13.131
Where to find my way?

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:17.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I will study those
topographic map forever.

00:12:17.302 --> 00:12:20.572 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is my skills,
I'm so good with maps.

00:12:20.572 --> 00:12:22.141
Good all maps, you know.

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:24.910
Good compass, good
on maps, all I need.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.247
Well this map, it's
actually dated 1972.

00:12:29.715 --> 00:12:32.817
Because the government
doesn't do any new map

00:12:32.817 --> 00:12:34.553
from there, there is no need.

00:12:34.553 --> 00:12:37.355 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, but the mountains
doesn't move.

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.959
So, I will study those forever,

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:44.630
because the secret is there.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.200
You have to listen to
the landscape, to be.

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:52.938
If you want to find water,
you need to be the water.

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:56.842
If I was the water,
if I was the stream,

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.744
where I will go?

00:12:58.744 --> 00:13:00.712
You have to imagine.

00:13:00.712 --> 00:13:04.884
If you want to find a fish,
you need to be the fish.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:10.956
Because you need to get in
touch with who we are inside,

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:13.225
and inside, all of us here,

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
the magical news that
I've got tonight,

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.429
that we are animals.

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.231
We are mammals after all.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.166
Half of it.

00:13:21.032 --> 00:13:22.267
And the good thing about it,

00:13:22.267 --> 00:13:25.336
is we can get in touch
with that animality.

00:13:25.336 --> 00:13:29.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
That would help us a lot
during everyday life.

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:32.011
I use that a lot.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.715
I smell, if I come near you
and I start smelling you,

00:13:36.715 --> 00:13:38.717
don't worry too much, right?

00:13:38.717 --> 00:13:41.420
Really, we've got senses.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.256
You know, the communication
between two human beings,

00:13:44.256 --> 00:13:48.994 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's only 7% on the
conversation, on words.

00:13:48.994 --> 00:13:51.763
The rest, it's invisible.

00:13:51.763 --> 00:13:54.834
The rest is smell,
attitude, feeling.

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:59.271
We use our senses, we
don't realize at all,

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:04.409
and out there, is the
only thing you can do,

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:07.913
get in touch with
your animality.

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:10.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
And when you're
starving, I remember,

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:13.552 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the Gobi Desert,
there's a precious moment

00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:17.423
where after six months
of walking, sweating,

00:14:17.423 --> 00:14:18.524
painful body.

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:23.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wake up, open my
tent, I'm in the Gobi,

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:26.531
there's nothing around me.

00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:29.935
Only sand, wind, and
type of rocky thing.

00:14:32.604 --> 00:14:34.540
Nothing too exciting.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.710
Open the thing, and
suddenly that day,

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:43.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was like a little ice
cube, melting in the sand,

00:14:45.416 --> 00:14:49.021
and I become the wind,
the sand, the rocks.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.691
I become one with nature.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:55.627 align:start size:94% position:6%
I believe today, it's
why I'm actually walking.

00:14:55.627 --> 00:14:59.698
Is to get this link, this
touch, with who we are.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:04.503
This touch with where
we've got the feet on,

00:15:04.503 --> 00:15:07.572 align:start size:81% position:19%
we are on this
planet, all of us.

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:12.043
We do not have boundaries,
we belong to this planet.

00:15:12.043 --> 00:15:14.046
This is the magic of it.

00:15:15.146 --> 00:15:18.150
Well, it's really good diet.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.186
After three weeks
I lose 12 kilogram.

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.122
It's quite quick, fast.

00:15:24.188 --> 00:15:26.792
Really, walking 12 hours a day,

00:15:28.293 --> 00:15:31.963 align:start size:84% position:16%
try to catch my
food, it was quite,

00:15:31.963 --> 00:15:34.699
really a difficult task.

00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:38.370
But, that was not to
forgot my determination

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:41.640
in this journey.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.709
How we can be so determined,

00:15:44.709 --> 00:15:47.646
how we can go for
a dream that bad?

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:51.283
Well, there is no recipe.

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.186 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because, the
currency: sweat, pain,

00:15:55.487 --> 00:15:58.390 align:start size:84% position:16%
but happiness, yes,
happiness, fun,

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:03.928 align:start size:97% position:3%
sense of humor, do not
forgot your sense of humor,

00:16:03.928 --> 00:16:07.633 align:start size:97% position:3%
is the most important thing
you will have with you,

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.967
all your life.

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.736
That's what I've got
in my survival kit.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:12.704
First, when people ask me,

00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:15.740
what you've got in
your surviving kit?

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.345 align:start size:94% position:6%
I say, "my sense of humor, do
not walk out of the door"

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:20.279
"without it."

00:16:22.213 --> 00:16:23.949
So because you need it, see.

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:26.251 align:start size:94% position:6%
When you've got this
kind of terrain to cross,

00:16:26.251 --> 00:16:27.586
this is a swamp.

00:16:28.653 --> 00:16:30.122
I need to cross that swamp,

00:16:30.122 --> 00:16:33.692
and on the bottom of that
swamp, there is water.

00:16:33.692 --> 00:16:36.194
Big hole in some places.

00:16:36.194 --> 00:16:39.765
And inside those hole,
you've got crocodiles.

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.434 align:start size:84% position:16%
And snakes, falling
from the tree.

00:16:42.434 --> 00:16:43.268
And,

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:48.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
big wild bull, frozen
bull not moving,

00:16:50.041 --> 00:16:54.479
hearing you moving through
those dry Pandanus leaves.

00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:57.916
See, the floor is full
of those Pandanus leaves.

00:16:57.916 --> 00:17:00.051 align:start size:84% position:16%
Dry ones, so whatever
you're doing,

00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:01.386
you're making too much noise.

00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:03.622
They hear you coming in.

00:17:03.622 --> 00:17:07.793
It's like playing a little
bit with the life you've got.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.764 align:start size:88% position:13%
So you have to trust
something, in one stage.

00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:14.266
You have to trust,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.235
in your,

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:19.938 align:start size:84% position:16%
capability of
melting with nature.

00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:23.908
Because I know I'm
in the right spot.

00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:26.044
I know that what I'm doing,

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:29.113
it's where I'm supposed to be.

00:17:29.113 --> 00:17:33.251 align:start size:88% position:13%
And this is the only way
to understand nature.

00:17:33.251 --> 00:17:36.188
If every one of us here tonight,

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.357
know where they belong to,

00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:42.661
it's a magical step to take.

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:47.199
So, I was in the this
building before I leave

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:49.668
for this expedition.

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:54.106
Talking with the senior
photographer editor here,

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:56.308
and she was saying
to me, well, Sarah,

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:59.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
you don't want
video crew with you.

00:17:59.811 --> 00:18:01.980
Can you just do one concession?

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.050
Imagine if I give
you a photographer,

00:18:06.118 --> 00:18:07.419
like a few days.

00:18:07.419 --> 00:18:10.589
Imagine, six days before
the end of your journey,

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:12.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
I get the photographer
on location,

00:18:12.624 --> 00:18:14.525
and photographer follow you.

00:18:14.525 --> 00:18:18.296 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was, you know, like
concession a little bit,

00:18:18.296 --> 00:18:21.366 align:start size:84% position:16%
you have to be
flexible a little bit.

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:25.137
I say, okay, let's do
this, on one condition.

00:18:26.304 --> 00:18:29.208
Has to be a cute
male photographer.

00:18:30.742 --> 00:18:33.644
Imagine, I'm out
there for so long,

00:18:33.644 --> 00:18:36.815
and she say, okay, I do my best.

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:40.986
Helicopter arrive, and this
is the person who walk out.

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.723
I do not know what this
woman didn't understand

00:18:44.723 --> 00:18:46.691
about the cute photographer.

00:18:46.691 --> 00:18:48.127
That was a woman!

00:18:49.327 --> 00:18:53.364
And I can see this woman
walking off the chopper,

00:18:53.364 --> 00:18:55.900
the helicopter, say
hi, I'm Krystle.

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.770 align:start size:84% position:16%
I look at her and
say, you're not a man.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.606
She was a bit shocked.

00:19:01.973 --> 00:19:03.675 align:start size:84% position:16%
She had a little
bit briefing before,

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:07.846
knowing that I'm not going to
be that easy to work with.

00:19:09.715 --> 00:19:12.618
And anyway, we go on
this amazing trip.

00:19:12.618 --> 00:19:16.121
She was unbelievable, all
the crazy pictures you saw,

00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:18.690 align:start size:84% position:16%
amazing picture,
that's come from her,

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.893
her name is Krystle Wright,
she's amazing photographer,

00:19:21.893 --> 00:19:23.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
National Geographic
photographer.

00:19:23.928 --> 00:19:26.865
And on the top of it,
she played a game.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:30.935 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's been really foraging
for her own food, also.

00:19:30.935 --> 00:19:34.539
She knows all about
bush tracker by now.

00:19:34.539 --> 00:19:35.374
And when,

00:19:36.474 --> 00:19:39.144 align:start size:84% position:16%
when we walked
together, at night,

00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:42.480
we exhausted, really.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.983
We make a little fire for
the sake of it, really.

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:48.286
Boil some hot water, I'll
be starving going to bed,

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:51.623 align:start size:84% position:16%
counting the days
like, four days to go.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:57.595 align:start size:94% position:6%
But at the end of the
day, when the light is off

00:19:57.595 --> 00:19:59.931
in her little tent, because
I would have my little tent,

00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:01.967
she would have her little tent,

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:06.138 align:start size:97% position:3%
the night is quiet, I would
hear some (crinkling),

00:20:07.305 --> 00:20:09.007
wrapping paper going on.

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.008
Like, what?!

00:20:11.075 --> 00:20:12.477
Darling?

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:13.678
What's going on?

00:20:13.678 --> 00:20:15.613
Oh, you don't want to know.

00:20:15.613 --> 00:20:17.748
No, I do want to know.

00:20:17.748 --> 00:20:19.584
Talk to me, at least talk to me,

00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:21.553
I can't handle this.

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:22.821
I want to know.

00:20:22.821 --> 00:20:25.791
Curiosity, it's not
one of my fortes,

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:27.292
I need to know.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:28.827
Talk to me!

00:20:28.827 --> 00:20:30.361
She said, "okay."

00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:32.030
"Flatbread with tuna."

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:38.036 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because, it was, of course
she would bring food with her.

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:40.739
She's working.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so, every night we
would have this little game

00:20:43.541 --> 00:20:45.477
going on at night.

00:20:45.477 --> 00:20:49.914
To my little, I was like,
okay, three days to go,

00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.783
Sarah, you can do this.

00:20:51.783 --> 00:20:53.418 align:start size:88% position:13%
Every night was
getting more difficult,

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.419
I was getting more starving.

00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:58.857
And one night, I hear
this unusual noise.

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:03.294
Looks like a jar,
plastic jar thing.

00:21:03.294 --> 00:21:04.129
Yeah.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.265
And I say, okay.

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:09.534
New, this is new, right?

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:11.536
She said, no, no no, no.

00:21:13.672 --> 00:21:15.139
No yeah, that's new.

00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:16.374
I never heard it.

00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:17.742
And she couldn't
speak pretty much,

00:21:17.742 --> 00:21:19.377
she had something in her mouth.

00:21:19.377 --> 00:21:20.545
And I was like, what is it?

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.546
Mm, nothing.

00:21:22.748 --> 00:21:24.783
(loud chewing)

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:26.084
Nothing really.

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:28.053
I said, talk to me.

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.121
It's Nutella.

00:21:31.255 --> 00:21:35.427
She was eating Nutella
with a spoon, seriously.

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:38.497
Anyway, she tested
my power inside me,

00:21:39.864 --> 00:21:43.134 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we will make joke about
it during the journey.

00:21:43.134 --> 00:21:45.704
She will wait, really,
at the end of the day,

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.639 align:start size:84% position:16%
to actually eat
something in her tent,

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:51.643
not tempting me or not
be eating in front of me.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.513
So the magic of those journey,

00:21:55.513 --> 00:21:59.784 align:start size:94% position:6%
the magical way of walking
through this planet,

00:21:59.784 --> 00:22:02.620
been doing this for 23 years.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.790
I walked basically everywhere.

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.126
What I can take out with me,

00:22:09.294 --> 00:22:11.929
If I have to take
one phrase out,

00:22:11.929 --> 00:22:13.831
will be this one.

00:22:13.831 --> 00:22:16.334
Let your soul touch the earth.

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:17.269
Go walking.

00:22:20.538 --> 00:22:24.308
Because this is the most
beautiful thing we can do.

00:22:24.308 --> 00:22:27.312
Get this connection
with the planet.

00:22:28.446 --> 00:22:31.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
And, feel connected,
to the universe,

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:36.655
and have faith on what
we are, as a species,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.958
in this planet.

00:22:39.958 --> 00:22:44.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because we are all connected,
that we want it or not.

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
We are this spiderweb of
people connected to each other.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.701
And only thing we can do

00:22:50.701 --> 00:22:53.404 align:start size:84% position:16%
is really understand
this connection,

00:22:53.404 --> 00:22:56.207 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we've got with each
other on the planet.

00:22:56.207 --> 00:22:58.510
And start to look after her,

00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:03.882
because after all, the
planet doesn't need us.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.484
We need the planet.

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:12.957
And this is my arrow, my
mom, my cute little mom,

00:23:12.957 --> 00:23:15.660
she will support me all
through my childhood,

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:20.565 align:start size:94% position:6%
my adult life, and she was
this really smart soul.

00:23:20.565 --> 00:23:22.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
She would say to me,
Sarah, do you want to do

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:25.103
your homework, or
clean your room?

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:28.907
Well, I had the choice, right?

00:23:30.308 --> 00:23:33.245
So she's been this really
smart, incredible mom,

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:34.579
supporting me.

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.681
And she doesn't know
a word in English.

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:38.282
She doesn't travel at all.

00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:41.352
But, she will be
there, on location,

00:23:41.352 --> 00:23:44.555 align:start size:84% position:16%
in every expedition
I will finish.

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:45.990
She'll be there for me.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.792
And on the left,
it's my assistant,

00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:52.163 align:start size:97% position:3%
slash cousin, all the family's
involved in my expedition.

00:23:52.163 --> 00:23:53.165
And one day,

00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:58.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
I did the last
bit, the last step.

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:02.174
And this looked like this.

00:24:05.576 --> 00:24:08.713
There is this heart, inside me,

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:12.083
will take me out there
walking again, and again,

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.385
and again, and again.

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.787 align:start size:88% position:13%
Because I've been doing
this for 23 years.

00:24:16.787 --> 00:24:19.791
I know, this really
strange feeling,

00:24:23.027 --> 00:24:25.996
which is like a
link with nature,

00:24:25.996 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start size:88% position:13%
a direct connection with
nature that I've got,

00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:31.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
I know I will follow
that pain again,

00:24:33.504 --> 00:24:37.342 align:start size:94% position:6%
to go back again, to
nature, with my two feet.

00:24:38.843 --> 00:24:43.014
Because I believe humans can
get along with nature again.

00:24:46.151 --> 00:24:47.886
Thank you very much.

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:50.121
(applause)
