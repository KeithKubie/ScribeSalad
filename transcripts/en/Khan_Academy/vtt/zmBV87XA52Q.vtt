00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:02.192
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.192 --> 00:00:04.577
the North had just won the Civil War.

00:00:04.577 --> 00:00:06.168
Unfortunately for Abraham Lincoln,

00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:08.923
it was two months after
he was assassinated.

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:10.225
But now the North was dominant

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.455
and essentially occupied the South.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:14.467
And we enter a period
called Reconstruction,

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:17.045
and Reconstruction can
refer to one of two things

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:18.068
and they're somewhat related.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:20.503
One is just the
Reconstruction from the war.

00:00:20.503 --> 00:00:23.368
Obviously there was a lot of
damage done on both sides.

00:00:23.368 --> 00:00:26.346
But it's usually referred
to the actual Reconstruction

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.134
of the South and to some degree,

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:30.408
kind of the reform of the South.

00:00:30.408 --> 00:00:31.855
I'm going to glaze over a lot of details,

00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:33.124
like I did in the last video.

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:35.089
I might ignore some major events

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:36.464
that you might find important.

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:38.281
And I'll get back to them, don't worry.

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:39.590
But the three big things

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.426
that happened during Reconstruction,

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:44.243
other than the fact of the
North occupying the South

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.989
and essentially, to a large degree,

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.545
suspending democracy in the South

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.813
and installing its own
politicians, its own lawmakers,

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:52.466
is that the United States passed

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.947
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments.

00:00:54.947 --> 00:00:58.764
These are known as the
Reconstruction Amendments.

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:02.469
In 1865, you have the 13th Amendment

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.395
and this abolished slavery.

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:05.469
Let me write this here.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:07.052
This ended slavery.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.155
We talked about the
Emancipation Proclamation

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:14.659
and that was essentially Abraham
Lincoln's executive order,

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.839
this was a speech he made.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:19.101
But now it became official law in 1865.

00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.518
Then in 1868, you have the 14th Amendment

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:25.482
which made everyone,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:28.772
every person born in the
United States a citizen,

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:31.101
and this includes the freed slaves,

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.005
so it's kind of like,
the slaves are now free

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:34.741
and they are also citizens.

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:39.216
And then in 1870, you
have the 15th Amendment

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.724
which gave all free men the right to vote.

00:01:41.724 --> 00:01:43.187
And obviously, now all men were free.

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:44.655
There were no non-free men.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:46.221
So, the right to vote.

00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.545
And I emphasize the men
because even at this point,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:51.857
women did not have the right to vote.

00:01:51.857 --> 00:01:54.077
The right to vote.

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:57.360
And the 14th Amendment also
introduced a due process which,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.400
I won't go into the details
here, but it essentially said,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.050
"Look, the government has
to go under a due process

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.230
"where it's subject to its
own laws when determining

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.997
"whether it can take away property from

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:13.330
"or in some way,

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.142
"infringe on rights of other people."

00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:20.940
But we'll probably do a whole
video on that in the future.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.761
But these were the real takeaways.

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:26.495
So it really brought the
former slaves, at least by law,

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:28.369
by these amendments, on equal standing.

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:30.727
But we know that in
practice, that didn't happen.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:34.396
And you fast forward to
1877, and you essentially

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:37.343
have the Reconstruction
period formally ending.

00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:39.702
The occupation of the South formally ends.

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.753
And as soon as the occupation
of the South formally ends,

00:02:43.753 --> 00:02:46.085
and democracy comes
about, you have a bunch

00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:47.461
of people coming to power.

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:48.798
And at this point of time,

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:52.489
the Republicans were
essentially the North,

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.817
and these were the people
who were anti-slavery.

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:58.678
Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.295
And the Democrats come
to power in the South.

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:04.269
And we can talk about how
the different perceptions

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.037
of the different parties change over time.

00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:10.624
But at this point, as soon
as the occupation ended,

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:14.451
and I put democracy in quotes
because even in this period,

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:18.659
the North has essentially
not occupied anymore,

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.894
but the elections, these were things

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:22.845
that were heavily contested.

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:25.445
You have both sides of
them exerting force.

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:28.986
And in particular, you
have the Jim Crow Laws

00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:30.321
being passed in the South.

00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:32.340
And they're called the Jim Crow based

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.590
on this parody in the early 1800s.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.340
It was a practice for

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.640
white men in the South at this time,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.294
or even well before this,
in order to parody blacks

00:03:46.294 --> 00:03:47.675
they would paint their face black

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:49.834
and they would act silly and all of this.

00:03:49.834 --> 00:03:52.755
And Jim Crow was the name
of one of these characters

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:55.976
that was portrayed in the early 1800s.

00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:58.420
I think it was Jumping
Jim Crow, was the name.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.072
That's where the laws come from.

00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:03.323
But the Jim Crow Laws essentially

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:06.958
segregated blacks and whites in the South.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:08.997
Even though the idea might
have been that they were equal,

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:11.220
the reality were that the
conditions for blacks,

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.604
the places that they were
separated to, were far inferior.

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:15.146
They had to use separate
drinking fountains,

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:17.684
they had to use separate bathrooms.

00:04:17.684 --> 00:04:20.259
They couldn't sit in the
same parts of theaters

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.623
or in the same parts of buses.

00:04:21.623 --> 00:04:22.730
And these lasted all the way until

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.027
the Civil Rights Movement,
all the way to the 1960s.

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:29.314
Now, at the same time that
all of this was happening,

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:33.581
you kinda had this post Civil
War boom in the economy,

00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.268
where you had this massive building

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:39.185
of the railroads and steam engines.

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:42.561
To some degree, it was the first,

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:44.472
well, I don't wanna say the first.

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:47.722
There was many ages of mass innovation.

00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:50.902
But all of these things
tend to always lead

00:04:50.902 --> 00:04:52.743
to a little bit of a bubble.

00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:55.733
And then in 1873, what
you have happening is

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.391
a lot of the governments of
the world start going off

00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.174
of the gold and silver standard,

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.879
and they go to the gold standard.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.771
And what then happens is,
is that anyone who's left

00:05:03.771 --> 00:05:06.223
on the silver standard or partially both,

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.481
the gold and silver standard,

00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:10.094
their currency would devalue.

00:05:10.094 --> 00:05:12.242
And back then, it was viewed
as an unambiguous negative

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:13.791
for your currency to devalue.

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:16.671
We can later talk about that,
there's more nuance there.

00:05:16.671 --> 00:05:18.545
So the United States
decide to follow suit.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:22.212
And actually, the big
actor here was Germany

00:05:23.142 --> 00:05:25.478
that decided to go off
of the silver standard

00:05:25.478 --> 00:05:27.167
and going on pure gold standard.

00:05:27.167 --> 00:05:29.477
And so the United States
decide to follow suit

00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:32.333
with the Coinage Act in 1873.

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.712
But this leads to a huge, they
call it the Panic of 1873.

00:05:35.712 --> 00:05:36.617
There's a couple of things here.

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:39.408
One, it completely demolishes
the price of silver,

00:05:39.408 --> 00:05:41.865
although this was already
happening on a global basis.

00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:44.416
It hurts the silver miners
and the industries associated

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:45.408
with the silver miners.

00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:47.464
But I guess more importantly,

00:05:47.464 --> 00:05:49.225
now this restricts the money supply.

00:05:49.225 --> 00:05:51.722
And I won't go into all
of the economics of it.

00:05:51.722 --> 00:05:53.841
When you restrict the money supply,

00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:56.111
you essentially increase interest rates,

00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.541
and it essentially popped
the bubble that was forming

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.002
due to the railroads and
all of the booming business.

00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:02.078
And then you essentially have

00:06:02.078 --> 00:06:04.145
the United States entering a depression.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:07.976
And that depression lasts from 1873,

00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:10.304
when the Coinage Act and
kind of this bubble burst,

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:11.971
all the way to 1879.

00:06:12.863 --> 00:06:16.266
But lucky for the United
States, after that time period,

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:18.216
after it recovered from the depression,

00:06:18.216 --> 00:06:20.567
it actually recovered
at this super fast rate,

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:22.866
and this was one of the
fastest economic growths

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:23.937
in US history.

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:27.187
You had this huge influx of immigrants,

00:06:29.797 --> 00:06:32.292
tens of millions, from Europe.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.832
And by 1890, the United States
was now the richest country

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:38.039
in the world on a per capita basis,

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.612
which is amazing because
only a hundred years ago,

00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:43.947
it was kind of this
colony of Great Britain,

00:06:43.947 --> 00:06:45.649
or part of the British Empire.

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:46.617
It was kind of this thing that

00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:49.632
the European powers didn't
view as that relative.

00:06:49.632 --> 00:06:52.999
But now it was the richest
country in the world.

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:55.873
And then you fast forward to 1898.

00:06:55.873 --> 00:07:00.186
And it starts to, essentially,
become a bit of an empire.

00:07:00.186 --> 00:07:02.978
Until this time, United
States kind of kept to itself.

00:07:02.978 --> 00:07:04.173
It wasn't really interested

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:08.516
in controlling other
nations or other people.

00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:09.516
But in 1898,

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:12.007
until 1898,

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:14.174
Cuba was a Spanish colony.

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:17.117
And there had been many revolts try

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:19.207
against the Spanish by the Cubans.

00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:20.820
And the United States, or the Americans,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.812
were fairly sympathetic to the Cubans.

00:07:22.812 --> 00:07:25.790
After all, here's another
country in the New World,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.045
again, trying to revolt
against a European power.

00:07:29.045 --> 00:07:31.247
And the Spanish were pretty infamous

00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:33.481
for cracking down pretty hard.

00:07:33.481 --> 00:07:38.480
So in 1898, while there was
a revolt against the Spanish,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.647
the United States set some

00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:43.796
ships over to Havana Harbor,

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.572
essentially to protect American interests.

00:07:46.572 --> 00:07:49.072
This might resonate a little bit relative

00:07:49.072 --> 00:07:52.574
to maybe the Mexican-American War,

00:07:52.574 --> 00:07:54.908
that we kind of send things
close to another country

00:07:54.908 --> 00:07:56.719
to protect our interests

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:59.296
and make sure nothing crazy happens.

00:07:59.296 --> 00:08:01.930
Then while in Savannah
Harbor, not Savannah,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.314
while in Havana Harbor,
you have a battleship,

00:08:05.314 --> 00:08:09.513
a US battleship called
the Maine, the Maine,

00:08:09.513 --> 00:08:11.330
that explodes and sinks.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.629
And this is an actual picture of it.

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:14.534
This is fun because we're
entering the point in history

00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.398
where pictures start to become relevant.

00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:19.550
Although, even in the mid
1860s, you had pictures.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.305
That's a picture of Abraham Lincoln.

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:24.194
The Maine gets sunk.

00:08:24.194 --> 00:08:26.893
The people who wanna
declare war on Spain say,

00:08:26.893 --> 00:08:28.907
"Hey, Spain must've blown up the Maine."

00:08:28.907 --> 00:08:31.403
Although it's still a complete mystery

00:08:31.403 --> 00:08:32.855
on what was the actual cause.

00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:34.910
Some people say it was
just a random explosion.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.097
There's even conspiracy
theorists who believe

00:08:37.097 --> 00:08:39.216
that the United States did
it to itself intentionally

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:41.474
to justify entering the
war, while some say,

00:08:41.474 --> 00:08:43.517
"Hey, no. Spain did it
for whatever reason.

00:08:43.517 --> 00:08:47.684
"It didn't like this American
fleet in Havana Harbor."

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:51.170
But regardless to say,
after this happened,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.786
it allowed, it made the
American public angry,

00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:56.133
the American government angry,

00:08:56.133 --> 00:08:58.534
and they declared war on Spain.

00:08:58.534 --> 00:09:00.632
And it was actually a
very short-lived war.

00:09:00.632 --> 00:09:02.535
They won pretty handedly.

00:09:02.535 --> 00:09:04.706
The big takeaway from
the Spanish-American War

00:09:04.706 --> 00:09:07.898
is that the United States
essentially became an empire.

00:09:07.898 --> 00:09:10.291
It started to have control
of other countries,

00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:13.396
and in particular, it had
temporary control of Cuba.

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:17.563
But it also, because it
won, it got control of Guam,

00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:22.614
which is right over there, and
it still has control of Guam.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:27.596
It also got control of the
Philippines from Spain,

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:29.923
and it maintained control
of the Philippines

00:09:29.923 --> 00:09:32.423
until the end of World War II.

00:09:33.674 --> 00:09:36.248
And it got control of Puerto Rico,

00:09:36.248 --> 00:09:38.478
which is still part of the United States.

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:39.606
It's not an official state

00:09:39.606 --> 00:09:42.119
but it is United States territory.

00:09:42.119 --> 00:09:46.286
So at this point, the United
States becomes an empire.

00:09:47.766 --> 00:09:50.439
And then you fast forward to 1914.

00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:51.801
War breaks out in Europe.

00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:56.093
I need to do a whole series
of videos on World War I.

00:09:56.093 --> 00:09:57.881
But war breaks out in Europe.

00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:00.439
Particularly, the two strongest powers

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:03.633
that are really at each
other at this time period,

00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:06.550
are the British Empire and Germany.

00:10:08.189 --> 00:10:09.871
You have this situation
where United States

00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:12.286
is trying its hardest to stay neutral.

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:15.655
Obviously, the American
people were predominantly

00:10:15.655 --> 00:10:19.003
of English descent, it's an
English speaking country.

00:10:19.003 --> 00:10:23.178
So there were some sympathies
for the British Empire,

00:10:23.178 --> 00:10:24.912
for Great Britain.

00:10:24.912 --> 00:10:27.397
But they wanted to stay neutral.

00:10:27.397 --> 00:10:30.226
But what you had happening
is that the British

00:10:30.226 --> 00:10:32.226
had a blockade of the Germans.

00:10:32.226 --> 00:10:33.818
They really had a strangle hold.

00:10:33.818 --> 00:10:36.391
And the Germans wanted to
have a blockade of the British

00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:39.805
because Great Britain was an island.

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:43.815
It was an island, it could
really maybe win the war

00:10:43.815 --> 00:10:46.216
if it could somehow strangle the island,

00:10:46.216 --> 00:10:47.676
if it could blockade the island.

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.043
But unfortunately for Germany,

00:10:49.043 --> 00:10:52.024
it did not have as strong of a navy.

00:10:52.024 --> 00:10:56.788
So you get close to 1917,
actually 1915, 1916, 1917,

00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:58.723
Germany starts to get desperate.

00:10:58.723 --> 00:11:00.522
So it sends its submarines
into the Atlantic.

00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:03.848
They say, "Well, if we can't
blockade Great Britain,

00:11:03.848 --> 00:11:07.215
"at least maybe we can
start harassing ships

00:11:07.215 --> 00:11:09.187
"or even blowing up ships that are trying

00:11:09.187 --> 00:11:11.105
"to trade with Great Britain
and that'll make people

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:14.481
"afraid to, it'll
essentially be the equivalent

00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:15.650
"of a blockade."

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.664
And at first, Germany
does some minor things.

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:21.129
But as the war goes on, it
gets more and more desperate.

00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:24.833
It gets more and more desperate,
and it starts attacking

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:27.577
civilian ships, cruise liners,

00:11:27.577 --> 00:11:30.308
Americans start dying
because German u-boats

00:11:30.308 --> 00:11:35.303
are just willy-nilly, just
essentially torpedoing ships.

00:11:35.303 --> 00:11:37.034
So the US doesn't tolerate it anymore,

00:11:37.034 --> 00:11:38.951
enters the war in 1917.

00:11:40.014 --> 00:11:42.005
Germany didn't take the
United States that seriously

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:43.037
up to that point.

00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:44.948
But it learned, and we'll
do a whole series of videos

00:11:44.948 --> 00:11:46.867
on this, that it should have.

00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:48.813
And then you fast forward to 1918,

00:11:48.813 --> 00:11:51.319
and the United States
was definitely one of,

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:53.365
the British were doing alright,

00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:55.432
but the United States
really turned the tides.

00:11:55.432 --> 00:11:57.850
No one really expected
how large of a power

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.376
they had essentially
gotten involved in the war.

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:04.694
Then you fast forward to
1918 and the war ends.

00:12:04.694 --> 00:12:07.022
The real takeaway of this, I
mean there's a bunch of these

00:12:07.022 --> 00:12:09.607
and we'll talk more about this
in depth in future videos,

00:12:09.607 --> 00:12:12.514
is that it ended some of the nations

00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:14.391
that were on the losing end.

00:12:14.391 --> 00:12:17.142
Austria-Hungary no longer was a nation,

00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:18.030
at least in this form.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.333
The Ottoman Empire no longer
was a nation in this form.

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:25.964
And as we will learn later,
there were huge reparations

00:12:25.964 --> 00:12:29.054
by the victors on Germany,
and that to a large degree,

00:12:29.054 --> 00:12:31.323
may have led to World War II.

00:12:31.323 --> 00:12:33.866
But we won't talk in depth
about that right now.

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:36.385
The other things that started
to happen at this point,

00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:38.452
in 1920 you have the 18th

00:12:38.452 --> 00:12:41.157
and the 19th Amendments being passed.

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:43.474
The 18th enacted Prohibition,

00:12:43.474 --> 00:12:47.095
where all of a sudden,
you made alcohol illegal

00:12:47.095 --> 00:12:48.791
in the United States.

00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.527
And you know the irony of it is,

00:12:50.527 --> 00:12:52.408
that's when you have all of these movies

00:12:52.408 --> 00:12:55.233
about these bootleggers and
you have this whole crime scene

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:58.932
that develops around illegal alcohol.

00:12:58.932 --> 00:13:00.631
But at the same time
the 19th Amendment was

00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:03.639
maybe a little less controversial.

00:13:03.639 --> 00:13:07.714
And the 19th Amendment, it finally gave

00:13:07.714 --> 00:13:09.714
women the right to vote.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.275
Right to vote.

00:13:13.275 --> 00:13:15.739
And one of the arguments

00:13:15.739 --> 00:13:19.549
against having women the right
to vote before this time was,

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.062
"Hey, you know, only men are
fighting for the country.

00:13:22.062 --> 00:13:23.514
"Only they have the right to vote.

00:13:23.514 --> 00:13:26.166
"Only they can be soldiers."

00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.585
But during World War I, and this happened

00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:30.981
not just in the US, this happened
worldwide in World War I,

00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:33.335
that because so many men were fighting,

00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:37.000
women really had to take
up the slack domestically.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.235
And they, essentially, were
a big part of the war effort

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.789
in terms of just working at the factories

00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:42.678
and producing things.

00:13:42.678 --> 00:13:45.005
So that was probably one
of the big things that,

00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:47.390
on kind of a global
basis, all of a sudden,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.640
women started to get the right to vote.

00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:54.299
Also, at this period,
you have in the 1920s,

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:57.862
you have another post-war economic boom

00:13:57.862 --> 00:14:00.719
that really develops into
a post-war economic bubble

00:14:00.719 --> 00:14:02.636
all the way until 1929.

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:06.070
And then you have the stock market crash,

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.673
and then I think some of us know that,

00:14:07.673 --> 00:14:12.092
after that period, the
Great Depression ensues.

00:14:12.092 --> 00:14:14.011
And the Great Depression continues.

00:14:14.011 --> 00:14:16.613
And this was a global Great Depression,

00:14:16.613 --> 00:14:18.065
and it continues all the way

00:14:18.065 --> 00:14:20.561
to the US entry in World War II.

00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:22.644
And I'll leave you there.
