00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Class matters.
You probably already know that.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.940
And not only because you’re a student of
sociology, but because you’re a person who
lives in a society.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.980
But do you know how much it really matters?

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.340
Social class is huge determinant of many of
the most fundamental aspects of modern life

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.140
– from your education, to your beliefs, as well
as your values, your occupation, your income, and
not only how you live, but also how you die.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.760
So let’s talk about how class plays out
in the lives of Americans today.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:36.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.380
Class starts to matter at the very beginning
of your life.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.640
When we discussed socialization a few
episodes ago,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.400
we talked about anticipatory socialization,
or learning to fit into a group you’ll someday
be a part of, like a gender or a race.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.880
And one type of anticipatory socialization
is class socialization,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.560
where parents convey to their children
the values that go along with being upper class
or middle class or working class.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.200
Let’s take a simple example.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.780
Suppose you’re a parent and your kid absolutely
refuses to eat broccoli.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.060
How do you respond?

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.100
Do you make them clear their plate and say
that they shouldn’t waste food?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.780
Or do you allow them to make decisions for
themselves about what they eat?

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.440
Now, you may be thinking, “What?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.000
How does eating broccoli have anything to
do with class?”

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.670
But how parents from different walks of life
approach parenting can differ a lot by class,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.500
as American sociologist Annette Lareau found
in her research on parenting styles.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.189
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to look at
how social class can affect what kind of parent
you are, or what kind you have.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.760
In the 1990s, Lareau’s research focused on observing families of elementary school students from upper-middle class and working class backgrounds.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.980
In doing this, she realized that parents had
very different approaches to how they educated
and disciplined their kids.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.820
She found that upper-middle class parents
tend to be very involved in their kid’s social
and academic lives.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.580
Think scheduled play dates, after school activities,
checking their homework assignments every night.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.180
The stereotype of a suburban helicopter mom
isn’t too far from the mark for some of these families.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.880
By contrast, working class parents – who
were more likely to have less time and money
to devote to these activities –

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.460
were more likely to be hands off in
structuring their kid’s free time.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.760
These kids might be more likely to be playing
with whoever is around their neighborhood than
going on playdates.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.560
Working class parents also tend to put a greater
emphasis on obedience and discipline compared to their
upper middle class counterparts, Lareau found.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.580
While a working class parent might tell
their kids to eat their broccoli

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.820
“Because I said so,” an upper middle class parent
is more likely to talk through decisions with their
children in an effort to encourage autonomy.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.000
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.200
So, yes, a toddler’s distaste for broccoli
and their parents’ reaction to it, can tell
us something about class.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.820
And these trends in parenting aren’t the
only difference in values and beliefs that
we see across classes.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.480
Political views tend to vary across class
groups, too,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.520
with upper class Americans being more likely to be
fiscally conservative and socially progressive, and lower
class Americans being more likely to be the opposite.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.500
Even religion varies by class.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.080
Upper income Americans are more heavily
represented in liberal Protestant groups like
Episcopalians and Presbyterians, as well as
Judaism, Hinduism and Atheism,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.920
whereas lower income Americans are more likely
to identify as Evangelical Protestants or Catholics.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.240
But beliefs and values aren’t the only thing
that vary by social class.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.000
A large component of class differences plays
out through educational attainment and its
consequences for success later in life.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.520
Education is sometimes called the “Great
Equalizer.”

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.040
The more people who have access to quality
education, the more equal a society gets.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.240
Or so the thinking goes.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.940
But whether you get a quality education varies
by the social class you’re born into.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.460
So we might be concerned that education will
have the opposite effect, and will actually help pass
inequalities from one generation on to the next.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.440
There are a few ways that social class comes
into play when we talk about education in the US.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.400
First, where do you live?

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.520
Income segregation, or the tendency for families of
similar income levels to live in the same neighborhoods,
is incredibly common in the United States.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.360
If you’ve ever gone apartment hunting in a big city,
this might not come as a surprise to you.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.000
An apartment in a “good” neighborhood,
or an area with low crime, good schools,
and better quality housing,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.360
costs way more than a home where crime
and pollution are higher and education and
job access is inconsistent.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.500
One reason that access to education
varies by class is that public schools in the
US are funded mainly at the local level,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.500
so kids who grow up in affluent neighborhoods
tend to have access to better schools, because
those communities provide more funding.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.640
So, living in a better neighborhood tends
to mean access to better educational facilities,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.940
as well as to technology like computers,
good teachers, and a wider variety of classes
and extra-curriculars.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.270
And that’s assuming you go to a public school.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.960
Upper class children are more likely to attend
private schools – and this trend continues
when we get past high school.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.340
We mentioned this last week –

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.540
children who grow up working class or
low-income are much less likely to attend college,

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.620
and those who do are much more likely to attend
public state schools or two-year community colleges.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.180
Among elite colleges, most students don’t
come from low-income families; they come from
the very top of the income distribution.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.760
A recent study of social class and college attendance
found that 38 elite colleges including five in the Ivy
League – Brown, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton, and Yale –

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.460
had more students who came from the top 1% than
the entire bottom 60%of the income distribution.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.540
Some of this inequality in college access is
helped along by the policy of preferential
admittance for so-called “legacy” students,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.260
whose parents or other family members
attended the college.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.940
Policies like this entrench class inequalities across
generations by making it less likely that those from
lower socioeconomic classes will move up the ladder.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:20.840
Plus, the social networks formed within prestigious
colleges often are the stepping stones toward jobs
and financial success later in life,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.220
which again makes it more likely that inequality
will get passed on to a new generation.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.240
And of course, political and economic power
tend to be concentrated among those at the
top of the social class ladder.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.460
Dreaming of being president when you grow
up?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.540
Of the ten presidents who have held office in the
last 50 years, 6 attended an Ivy League school
for either their undergrad or postgrad studies.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.900
Every single one had at least a bachelor’s
degree.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.700
So education can seem less like the great
equalizer in this case than the great barrier.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.819
Without a college degree, there are jobs that
are pretty much impossible to get.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.270
The jobs that you can get without a college
degree tend to come with lower prestige, lower pay,
and a greater risk of occupational dangers.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.940
Which brings us to the last class difference
we’ll be talking about today: health.

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:05.669
Social class affects how you live – but
it also affects how you die.

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:10.960
Mortality and disease rates vary by social
class, with upper class Americans living
longer and healthier lives.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.100
A man in the 80th percentile, or top of the
income distribution, lives an average of 84 years,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.900
while a man at the bottom, in the 20th
percentile, lives an average of 78 years.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.300
Women live longer than men typically.
Yay for us!

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.660
But the income gap is still similar here, with
women in the 80th percentile living about 4.5 years
longer than those in the 20th percentile.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.220
Why the huge gap?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.180
Some reasons might seem obvious – if you
have more money, you can probably afford
better health care.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.200
Or for that matter, afford any health care.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.180
Others are maybe less straightforward.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.479
For example, low income Americans tend to
eat less healthy food.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:48.440
Now, is that just a matter of different choices
made by different people, or is it a systematic
pattern that links class with eating habits?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.920
Well, oftentimes unhealthy foods are cheaper,
both in terms of money and time.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.680
Lower class Americans tend to have less leisure time
and less money to spend on cooking healthy meals.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.620
After all, it takes a lot less time and money to
pick up McDonald’s than to spend an hour cooking
a meal with expensive organic vegetables.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.280
Additionally, many low income Americans
live in what are known as food deserts,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.040
or neighborhoods without easy access to
fresh foods, like fruits and vegetables.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.120
Other systematic class differences come from
the occupations that different classes tend to hold.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.360
Upper and middle class Americans are more
likely to be in white collar, full time jobs,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.060
which generally have lower exposure to dangerous
materials and lower risks of accidents on the job.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.499
Not to mention more flexible work schedules.

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:29.020
Less danger and less stress = better health.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.060
Plus, full-time jobs are more likely to provide
benefit packages including health insurance
and paid sick days.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.340
It’s much harder to take care of your health
if you can’t take the time off work to go to the
doctor or rest and recover.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.040
But that’s the reality for many working
class Americans.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.780
Class gaps in health outcomes are clearly
about more than just having the money to
pay for better healthcare.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.460
It’s about occupation, neighborhood,
income, education,

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.600
and all the different ways that advantages like
these can overlap to determine your life course.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.580
That’s why social class matters;

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.800
it gives us a way to identify the
advantages and disadvantages that different
groups of people share,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.660
and understand the consequences of
those advantages and disadvantages.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.130
Today, we discussed three types of class differences
we see playing out in the United States.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:16.080
First, the beliefs and values parents pass
on to the next generation will vary by class.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.780
Second, there are class gaps in educational
attainment which help perpetuate inequality
across generations.

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:28.880
And finally, Americans of lower socioeconomic
status tend to have worse health and shorter
lifespans than those with higher class status.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.960
Next time we'll focus on a different aspect of
socioeconomic stratification: social mobility –

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.480
or, how your social position can change over
your life time, or across generations.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.560
