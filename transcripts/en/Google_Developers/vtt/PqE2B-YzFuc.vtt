00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.230
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
guys for joining us here

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.520
on day two at I/O here in
the YouTube Distribute Space.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.690
And we're so excited
for our final session

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.757
here with Adora, who's
the co-founder of Homejoy.

00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:13.840
And then before we get
into what Homejoy is about,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.590
your story and talking
about your journey,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.650
we want to talk about what
exactly to expect in this talk.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.430
And basically we're
going to talk about

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.290
how do you get your
product out there

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.607
once you've designed
and developed it?

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:27.440
How do you get your
first initial customers,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.490
and how you expand
on that distribution?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.491
And really, I couldn't
think of a better example

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.281
than, Adora, what you've
done with Homejoy.

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:35.700
So why don't you tell us
a little bit about Homejoy

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.129
and what it is
about as a product.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:38.920
ADORA CHEUNG: Sure.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.400
So Homejoy is a platform
that connects people

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.980
with home service providers.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.110
And we started with
professional house cleaners.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.492
So in 60 seconds you
just go to Homejoy.com,

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:51.680
you tell us a little bit
about your place, date

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.100
and time for us
to show up, and we

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.960
send someone who's
background-checked.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.350
We've interviewed
them in person,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.170
tested that they know
how to clean in person,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.310
as well as they're
insured and bonded.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.670
And they'll show up
at the date and time

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.580
you wanted them to show up.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.740
It's meant to be quick
and convenient and very

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.430
simple to use.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.638
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.610
And it seems like your
target demographic

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.580
are people who can't seem
to keep the rooms clean,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.570
like myself and my housemates.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.030
And it seems that you've
had incredible success

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.252
expanding from San Francisco.

00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:22.460
And where else have you gone?

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.160
You guys moved
internationally recently,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.630
so why don't you tell us
a little bit about that.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.720
ADORA CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.500
So we're in over 30 markets now.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.870
If you think of the top X
number of cities in the US,

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.240
we're most likely there.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.540
So our top markets are San
Francisco, New York City,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.770
Los Angeles, Miami,
and so on, so forth.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.570
And internationally,
we are in London,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.582
and we just recently
launched Berlin as well.

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:44.790
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.500
That's awesome.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.291
So take me through.

00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.980
How long has Homejoy
been around now?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.240
ADORA CHEUNG: So Homejoy
has been around for just

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.270
under two years.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.330
We started in July of
2012, and basically that's

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.400
the month where my brother,
my co-founder, Aaron,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.610
he approached me with
a problem he had,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.270
which was I'm trying to
find a house cleaner,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.610
and I can't find one.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.550
My place is a mess.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.460
So let's try to
fix this problem.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.700
MALE SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.190
So take us through
after you had the idea,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.910
you identified the
pain point, what

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.740
was day one like,
when you launched?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.690
ADORA CHEUNG: So day
one was essentially

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.830
doing research and doing a lot
of what improvements can we

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.590
make to the industry?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.490
And at that time,
we knew that it

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.090
was a very old-school industry.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.970
There was not much
technology that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.000
was being used to make-- A
lot of things that were back

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.550
then inefficient
are now efficient,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.360
because Homejoy exists.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.300
And so in the marketplace
or on a platform,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.390
you have supply and demand.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.260
You need the customers, who
actually need the cleanings,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.310
and you need the
professional cleaners,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.899
to do the actual cleanings.

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.690
And so for us, that
chicken and egg problem

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.170
is typically very
hard to solve, but we

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470
figured we could just do
the housecleaning ourselves.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.000
So one day one, we just said
we are the house cleaners.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.930
MALE SPEAKER: You
and your brother.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.010
ADORA CHEUNG: Me and my
brother were house cleaners.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.530
MALE SPEAKER: You were really
going around house to house.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.380
ADORA CHEUNG: Yes.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.880
And we would just need
to find customers.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.261
And so we went around find--

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.260
MALE SPEAKER: Why didn't
you call me on day one?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.840
ADORA CHEUNG: I wish
I knew you existed.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.881
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, my god.

00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:20.520
I would have been your best--

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.010
ADORA CHEUNG: I should have
just showed up to Google and--

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.390
MALE SPEAKER: That's right.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.342
I would have hired you on the
spot, Adora, I'm telling you.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:28.050
ADORA CHEUNG:
Coincidentally, we actually

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.979
were starting in Mountain View,
so you're actually close by.

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:32.770
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.520
I take even more offense
to that, the fact

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.742
that you didn't
contact right away.

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:38.700
ADORA CHEUNG: Good thing
you're a customer now.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.566
MALE SPEAKER: That's right.

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:40.000
That's right.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.916
ADORA CHEUNG: So yeah.

00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:44.476
The first day was all about
let's quickly put up--

00:03:44.476 --> 00:03:46.850
Within a weekend, we put up
a website, and on the website

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.750
so you could book a cleaning.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.380
It was very simple.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.240
And then we went out and tried
to find actual customers come

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.240
to our website and
actually book a cleaning.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.340
And it was very difficult.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.720
It took us some time.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.690
We did a lot of
just running around.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.440
At the time it was
summer, July, and there

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.910
are a lot of fairs
in Mountain View.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.160
And so we would literally
run around with flyers,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.640
following people and trying
to get them to book cleanings.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.330
And that wasn't initially
very successful.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.810
But there was one day
it was very, very hot.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.860
There was a fair out
on Castro Street,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.960
which was close by my
brother's apartments, which

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.270
was our office, too, as well.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.540
And we took water bottles.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.500
We iced a bunch
of water bottles,

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.755
took them out, and gave them to
people, because they were hot

00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:36.580
and they needed water.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.310
And then we convinced
them, essentially

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.720
almost guilt-tripped them
into booking a cleaning.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.490
And that's how we got our
first customers was handing out

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.610
water bottles.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.320
So we booked those cleanings,
then we went to go clean it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.550
ourselves.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.990
And what we learned almost
immediately was cleaning

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.840
is very hard, and we
weren't good cleaners.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.740
And so at that
point we essentially

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.570
decided to learn
how to go clean.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.385
And we first bought books
online to learn how to clean.

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:10.260
MALE SPEAKER: Really.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.020
Like what?

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.348
Like "Housecleaning for
Dummies," or what kind of book

00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:12.540
did you read?

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.935
ADORA CHEUNG: It's
like "Housecleaning

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:13.800
by Martha Stewart."

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.380
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, wow!

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.980
ADORA CHEUNG: And those
weren't very helpful.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.550
And so we decided actually
the best thing is probably

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.190
to just join a cleaning
company, because they

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.130
are actual professional
cleaners, and learn that way.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.260
So that's what we did.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.980
So I joined a cleaning
company in San Francisco

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.230
and learned how to clean.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.980
But on top of that, what I
got the most out of it was

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.030
I learned how a cleaning
company actually works today,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.607
or before Homejoy existed.

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:50.190
There are a number
of things, but just

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.500
to give you a couple
examples, for whatever reason,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.840
you couldn't book
a cleaning online.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.170
That seems very basic today.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.127
So we solved that problem.

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:03.710
10 years ago booking
a cleaning online

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.685
might not have
worked, because there

00:06:05.685 --> 00:06:09.470
was a lot of trust issues
and things like that.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.045
But today, with the
existence of people trusting

00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:13.920
to buy products that'll
show up at your door,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.800
they'll buy services.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.045
And a person will actually show
up at the door and do the work.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.200
So on the demand side
was we could do things

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.570
better that way.

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.450
But maybe more interesting
was on the supply side

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.040
of stuff, which is the
operations of the cleaning

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.370
company.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.040
In a cleaning company
that has 14 cleaners--

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.170
I was the 14th cleaner
at this company.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.220
And every single
day I would show up,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.590
they'd give me a stack of papers
with my customers for the day,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.032
and I would go drive out.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.740
Then those stack of
papers were basically

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.980
where the customer was,
specific notes for the job,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.336
and so on and so forth.

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:56.960
It would be four or
five clients a day.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.790
I would drive out
to all the houses,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.370
and then I would drive
back at the end of the day

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.703
and give back a stack of papers.

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:03.260
And every single
day was like this.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.435
But if you think of
this day and age--

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:06.685
MALE SPEAKER: It's exhausting.

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.100
ADORA CHEUNG: It's exhausting.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.370
By the way, it took me
an hour to get to work.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.950
And then another half an hour
to go drive to the first place.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.560
And then all that transportation
time adds up to a couple hours

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.540
where I'm not even doing any
work or going from job to job.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.690
But this is an age--
You have a mobile phone,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.010
you can just-- Why can't we be
in a world where as a cleaner

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.241
I wake up, I pull out my
phone, I see all the job notes,

00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:32.740
I see the first job I need to
go to, and I go straight there

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.864
and then just come back
home and then wake up again

00:07:34.864 --> 00:07:36.081
and do it all over again.

00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.330
I could have had an additional
job or two for the day,

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.030
essentially.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.821
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:40.610
Of course.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.290
ADORA CHEUNG: And
then internally, there

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.610
were things like the
scheduler system.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.300
What I would see was this
painful cadence of every day,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.710
they would take 14 of us,
look at all the clients,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.500
and painfully schedule
in the best way

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.840
for everybody to work
those jobs for the day.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.790
And as an engineer, the
first thing you would think

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.340
is I could do this in under
a second every single day,

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:09.500
without anybody,
sitting at a computer

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.690
by just creating
software for it.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.570
So these were kind of the things
that it seems obvious today,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:20.512
but the industry was that old.

00:08:20.512 --> 00:08:22.220
MALE SPEAKER: Adora,
I love what you just

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.770
said about trying to figure out
pain points that competitors

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.240
may have that you can
optimize by essentially going

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.700
to work for the opposition.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.840
Would you recommend
that people do

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.350
that to identify the pain
points of other competitors

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.010
within their industry
if they're not

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.970
going into cleaning, per se?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.320
ADORA CHEUNG: Yes.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:40.990
Yes and no.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:44.550
I think in a marketplace or
any business thing you go into,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.360
you always need to understand
who your customers are.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.030
And for us at Homejoy,
we have two customers.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.140
We have the actual client who's
getting the actual cleaning.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.540
And to get that experience is
very easy, because you just

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:01.214
go to the platform, and you sign
up, and you get the cleaning.

00:09:01.214 --> 00:09:03.630
Our other customers are actually
the cleaning professional

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.370
themselves.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.320
And they're here to get
the work opportunities

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.965
and to do the work, and that's
why the platform can exist.

00:09:11.965 --> 00:09:15.210
And because we're building
so many tools for them,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.020
it's very important
for us to understand

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.870
the context of which
they are working.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.780
And so it was very important,
one, for me to actually do it

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.960
myself as a founder,
but also it's

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.410
very important
for all employees,

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.780
from the engineers to
customer service reps

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.850
who work at Homejoy, to
have that context as well.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.770
And so one of the
things that you

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.945
must do within the first
month you're at Homejoy

00:09:34.945 --> 00:09:37.170
is actually go do a
cleaning yourself.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.066
And you go with other employees.

00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:43.390
And it helps, as an example,
for the customer service,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.680
then you talk to clients a lot.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.370
And so by doing the
cleaning themselves,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.090
they have context to why we
book a certain number of hours

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.140
or why, maybe, a
cleaning professional

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.610
did a certain thing or
used a certain solution.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.114
Down to even the engineers.

00:09:58.114 --> 00:09:59.530
They're the ones
actually building

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.910
the tools for the
cleaning professionals.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.920
And so knowing how
the cleaning works

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.760
and how what a cleaner does
helps them design things better

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.094
and helps them make
better decisions

00:10:11.094 --> 00:10:12.010
at the end of the day.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.490
MALE SPEAKER: Do you think
entrepreneurs nowadays

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.560
aren't the end users
of their own products,

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.020
that they're just trying
to put things out there

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.240
that they wouldn't
use themselves?

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.155
It sounds like you're tying
the loop with your team

00:10:20.155 --> 00:10:21.530
and everything you're doing.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.910
Do you feel like that's
the case for others?

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.830
ADORA CHEUNG: I think those
kind of products tend to fail.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.170
And in fact, before Homejoy, we
had spent three years working

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.310
on those type of products, the
products that we wouldn't use,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.427
but we thought
other people would.

00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:39.260
MALE SPEAKER: What were
some of those ideas?

00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:44.730
ADORA CHEUNG: We
became entrepreneurs

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.420
because our mission has always
been to make people happier.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.720
And so Homejoy's mission
is to make homes happier.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.280
And so some other ideas
kind of follow that ethos.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.220
And so the first idea was
a company called Pathjoy.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.190
And it was connecting people
with therapists and life

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.150
coaches because
our first thought

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.700
was who makes people happy?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.250
Oh, it must be these people.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.730
And so I don't doubt that
they do make people happier,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.230
but we're not the
type of people who

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.940
use life coaches and therapists.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.126
And so we just didn't
understand the ins and outs

00:11:16.126 --> 00:11:20.860
and the intricacies to build up
a good enough product for that.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.410
And so I think for three
years we essentially

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.980
went down this route
of not doing that,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.180
and Homejoy was the very
first idea, actually,

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.695
where it was a
problem one of us had

00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:33.070
and where we want
to go solve it.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:33.430
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.340
So Adora, you've
done an amazing job

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.260
of being in over 30 markets.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.980
And it's not exactly
the type of startup

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.780
where you just expand online
and hope to get users.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.590
You are literally on the
ground hiring and bringing

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.690
in customers.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.139
How do you do that?

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.930
What specific things
have you thought about

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:52.546
to distribute it to
different cities?

00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:53.920
ADORA CHEUNG: Our
plan had always

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.400
been to go into these 30
cities as quickly as possible.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.550
And it ended up being
it took us six months.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.470
And so in order to do this,
you can't change up your plan

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.240
from city to city.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.890
It has to be very consistent.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.030
So we basically had
a playbook for demand

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.560
and a playbook for the supply.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.160
How to acquire customers
and how to acquire

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.170
cleaning professionals.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.680
So on the demand side, what
we did was for every city

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.569
we went to, we just
threw a bunch of-- We

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:26.360
raised a little bit of
money by this point,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.750
so we're able to do paid
marketing, essentially.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:36.000
And so we just did a bunch
of paid marketing stuff,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.010
including AdWords
and things like that,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.800
but what turned out to be
the kicker for almost all

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.150
the markets was Groupon.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.920
Typically for local
services, Groupon

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.220
is not the best way
to acquire customers,

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.630
because there are typically
deal-seekers and things

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.620
like that.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.100
But for us, we knew
that if we could acquire

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.830
an X number of
customers in a market

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.590
and we did a very
good job, we could

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.540
rely on them to talk about us.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.660
And then that would
help spread it virally.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.880
And so that's what we did.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.236
So for every market, we
acquired through Groupon.

00:13:14.236 --> 00:13:15.860
If it was not Groupon,
it was something

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.860
that was like Groupon.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.190
And there were some
cities, like New York City,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:21.990
where it happened very quickly.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.800
In New York City, after
the first 10 days,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.070
we maybe acquired 100 customers,
and those 100 customers

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.860
became 300, and so
on and so forth.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.980
And then maybe some other
cities where it wasn't as dense

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.080
and it was slower to pick up.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.520
A couple of cities in
Texas, for example.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.090
In the suburbs it's
a little bit harder.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.110
It took a couple
months before it was.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.890
You're acquiring users, and so
there's just this linear growth

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.370
path, and then all of a sudden
there's this hockey-stick kink.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.130
And that's the inflection point
that we're always looking for.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.590
So that's what we did on
the demand side of stuff.

00:13:57.590 --> 00:14:00.590
And then on the supply
side, it was actually

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:02.250
even more straightforward.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.470
We basically opened
up a Google Doc

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.080
and started writing
down the things

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.410
we did to start San Francisco.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.210
And then we handed it over to--

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.140
MALE SPEAKER: What
was on that list?

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.890
ADORA CHEUNG: On that
list was essentially

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.710
there's a pipeline
of how we bring

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:17.870
on cleaning professionals.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:22.560
So you post a Craigslist ad,
and then you phone screen,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.460
then from the phone screen
they get interviewed in person,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.672
and then from there we
do a background check.

00:14:28.672 --> 00:14:30.130
And from there you
do a test clean.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.240
And from there you
get the first job.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.900
That first job is spot-checked.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.560
And then--

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.270
MALE SPEAKER: So you laid
out the whole process.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:35.670
ADORA CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.720
There was a process.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.750
If you think about it
as a car assembly line,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.040
you want to try to optimize
each one of those steps.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.830
MALE SPEAKER: And it all
started with Craigslist.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.580
ADORA CHEUNG: And it all
started with Craigslist.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.050
MALE SPEAKER: That's so funny.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.500
I think you're the
third entrepreneur

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.916
during this interview
series who's

00:14:46.916 --> 00:14:49.390
mentioned that Craigslist
has been their start in terms

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.437
of getting at least a
user base or a clientele,

00:14:51.437 --> 00:14:53.520
in your case, the people
who acquire the services.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:53.655
ADORA CHEUNG: Yeah.

00:14:53.655 --> 00:14:55.280
When you're trying
to acquire anything,

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.520
you want to look
for avenues that

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.640
have huge distribution already.

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.880
And so Groupon, for example,
has huge email distribution.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.850
And Craigslist, of course,
has lots of eyeballs.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:09.950
In our case is job seekers,
which was very good.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.250
So we wrote down all the steps
of how we did San Francisco,

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:16.750
then we essentially gave it to
another person we call a city

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.330
launcher.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.420
And the city launcher's
main responsibility

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:24.240
is to go in city, find the city
manager, hire the city manager,

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.610
hire the first dozen
cleaning professionals

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.740
in the area, with that
city manager teach them all

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.030
the systems that
we have in place.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.120
And then once
everything's rolling,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.740
they just exit the city
and go to the next city

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:38.430
and do it over and over again.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.580
And the great thing was while
the framework was very much

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.590
consistent from city
to city, the launchers

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:47.100
would be able to
figure out things

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.650
do even more efficiently,
or even better.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.380
And then they would
update that playbook.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.880
And now the playbook
is really solid.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.450
So when we launched London
and Berlin recently,

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.360
it was pretty
straightforward and resulted

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.000
in us being able to actually
grow even faster than we were

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.115
able to grow the North
American markets.

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:06.380
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.100
So you do get same
person who's going to,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.808
let's say, Chicago
and New York to launch

00:16:09.808 --> 00:16:11.580
Homejoy is going to
Berlin and London?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.000
Is this launcher
position somebody

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.416
you send out there
and bring back?

00:16:14.416 --> 00:16:15.240
ADORA CHEUNG: Yes.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:15.740
Yeah.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.070
The cadence was basically
every four weeks

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.170
they'd be in a new city.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.444
Every four to six weeks
they'd be in a new city.

00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:25.110
As we've talked about before, it
sounds like a pretty sweet gig.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.276
Because you just traveling
to all these great cities

00:16:27.276 --> 00:16:28.464
and meeting new people.

00:16:28.464 --> 00:16:29.880
MALE SPEAKER: That
sounds awesome.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.590
So what did it take
for you to say hey,

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.090
we need a launcher
as opposed to-- I

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.600
feel like so many developers
and entrepreneurs passively

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.090
try to put their
product out there

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:39.150
and say we're going
to hope it catches on

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.233
in these different cities.

00:16:40.233 --> 00:16:42.460
We're going to hope that
cleaners come on our site

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.660
and provide the services
in different cities?

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.020
Why did you decide to take
a more active approach,

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:50.750
and how do you decide on
that launcher strategy?

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.900
ADORA CHEUNG: More and
more active approach in--

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.370
MALE SPEAKER: It sounds like
you got an entire pipeline.

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.640
You went after the
Craigslist, you

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.600
determined you
were going to have

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.770
interviews with
all these cleaners.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.210
And it sounds like
you replicated

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.470
that process in every
city you went through.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:04.525
How did you determine that you
had to have a process instead

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:07.849
of just trying for
organic growth?

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.750
ADORA CHEUNG: I was thinking in
six or seven months from now,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.250
I want to be in
all these markets.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.180
How am I going to do this
fast and in a way that's

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.599
going to be organized?

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.420
It turns out it's not
completely organized.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.470
But in my head I was
thinking through the steps.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.020
I think it's a very logical
next step to say OK,

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.485
if you want is really
fast, then you just

00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:31.360
have to repeat something
over and over again.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.790
That's how you're
going to do it.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.350
It's the idea of just
focusing on one thing

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.990
and just doing it very well.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.880
And so that's what we did.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.575
And that's how we decided
just not to change it up.

00:17:42.575 --> 00:17:44.200
MALE SPEAKER: And
somebody who comes on

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.980
to be a launcher,
they also start

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.480
the process of
Homejoy the same way?

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.420
They clean the house
before they come on?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.460
ADORA CHEUNG: Launchers have
to clean the most houses ever.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.450
It's not that when
they start, they

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:56.639
have to learn how to clean.

00:17:56.639 --> 00:17:58.680
MALE SPEAKER: So maybe
it's not the sweetest gig.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.554
Maybe the traveling--

00:17:59.554 --> 00:18:01.180
ADORA CHEUNG: Yes.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.014
It's a lot of great traveling,
but you are cleaning a lot.

00:18:05.014 --> 00:18:06.680
MALE SPEAKER: I think
the idea of having

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.610
full understanding of
your product and trying

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.193
is something you
guys really hit home.

00:18:10.193 --> 00:18:12.905
It sounds like whenever somebody
signed up in the early days,

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:14.530
they'd sit next to
the customer service

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:15.616
reps to hear what's going on.

00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:16.616
Can you talk about that?

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:19.680
How did you decide that
was the way you should go?

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.610
ADORA CHEUNG: I think it's
mostly learning by doing.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.360
What we found is the
people that spent the most

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.350
time with the
cleaning professionals

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.140
or spent the most time just
really focusing and learning

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.840
on a specific thing is the
ones that were more successful,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.730
the ones that were
able to do more.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.350
And yeah, so when an
employee starts at Homejoy,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.409
not only do they
clean, but they spend

00:18:43.409 --> 00:18:45.200
a few hours with the
customer service reps,

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.746
they actually start taking phone
calls or answering tickets.

00:18:49.746 --> 00:18:52.370
If they're not an engineer, they
sit with the engineering team.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.828
They don't watch
them code-- that's

00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:56.700
kind of boring-- but they
go through kind of how

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.617
the engineers deploy
things and what

00:18:59.617 --> 00:19:01.200
are they working on
terms of designing

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.270
things and stuff like that.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.770
Yeah, I think everyone
understands in the company

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.350
what everyone else
does, and that way you

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.930
trust that they're always
working on the best thing

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.250
possible, and therefore you
can just focus on your thing

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.760
and not have to worry that
something else might not

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.030
be going right.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:20.940
MALE SPEAKER: So now
you built out a team,

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.660
you're in over 30
markets, you're

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.620
in the US and international.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.900
Why you take us through?

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.360
It sounds like on paper just
a very glamorous journey,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.050
but why don't you take us
through some of the battle

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.610
scars.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.720
What are some mistakes you made?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.130
What are some things
you want to avoid

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.600
so perhaps people
in the audience

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.800
could avoid those pitfalls
and work through like you did?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.440
ADORA CHEUNG: I think as you
grow, growing seems glamorous,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.620
but it's actually
very much hard work,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.610
and so you have to commit
to doing the cleanings.

00:19:54.969 --> 00:19:57.260
For example, when cleaning
professionals didn't show up

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:01.470
for jobs, employees actually
went and go do them.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.090
And so it's like a commitment
to that kind of hard work

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.900
that has to happen.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:12.090
And I think at a
large company, if you

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.420
don't have those type of
people, then it's very hard.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:20.170
And so you sort of need
to hire for this kind of,

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.910
what's the right word?

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.610
You have to create sort of
like a stereotype, almost--

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.710
who is the right
Homejoy employee?

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.200
And then hire for that.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.920
Other things are-- For us,
growing very quickly meant

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.960
that we have to
keep the quality up.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.347
Or else, in local services,
like I said before,

00:20:40.347 --> 00:20:42.430
at the end of the day, you
can throw lots of money

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.560
at acquiring customers,
but that's not

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.950
going to really work
in the long run.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.660
If you're not doing a good
job on all the cleanings,

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:50.720
you have a leaky bucket.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.390
No one's going to come back.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.770
And then all the paid
marketing's all for naught.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.900
And so as you grow
really fast, you also

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.210
have to think about how am I
going to scale quality as well?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:04.310
Or how am I going to keep
the quality at a certain bar?

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.820
And not grow faster than that.

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:10.310
And I think some of the
early mistakes that we made,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.840
or I made, was going
a little bit too fast

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.200
and getting ahead
of the quality.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.700
And then having to come
backward a little bit

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.940
and fixing those things
and fine-tuning things

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.224
and then going forth.

00:21:24.224 --> 00:21:25.140
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.166
So with that, I want
to give you a chance

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:28.790
to talk about any
last piece of advice,

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.040
you have somebody who
may be in your shoes

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.980
two years ago just trying to
get their product out there.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.896
And then we're going to
open it up to you guys

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:39.290
to ask questions to Adora.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.080
ADORA CHEUNG: I think actually
my biggest piece of advice

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:47.320
is, one, if you have a product,
I frequently see people just

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.780
hold back and not launch it.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.870
And I know that there's like
so many blog posters that

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.620
just says launch it,
launch it, launch it.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.870
But when it's your baby,
it's hard to launch something

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.467
when you don't
think it's perfect.

00:21:57.467 --> 00:21:58.550
But you should just do it.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.190
And that's what we did.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.560
We launched something that
was clearly not perfect.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.110
You just learn so much
more from customer feedback

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.260
than you ever will with
thinking the problem

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:10.330
through by yourself.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.430
And then second is don't
be afraid to expand.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.730
I think there's a lot
of focus these days--

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.090
Yes, you should get
the product right,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.930
and you should be able
delivering great experiences,

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:25.880
but it shouldn't have
to be super-perfect

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.860
before you start expanding.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.910
If your goal, if
your dream is to be

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:33.360
a huge billion or
multi-billion-dollar company,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.690
you can't just be in San
Francisco, for example.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.290
You have to be everywhere.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.824
And the customer that
lives in San Francisco

00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:41.490
is much different
from the customer that

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.880
lives in Dallas, Texas, Chicago,
Illinois, these other places.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.800
And so you have to get to those
people as fast as possible.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.430
And so it's always
think a few steps ahead.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.780
But again, not to go too
fast where you fall over.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:58.810
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.125
So we're going to open up
the audience for questions.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.422
Just project.

00:23:20.422 --> 00:23:22.366
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.970
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:38.370
So the question is how do
we decide on the markets?

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.425
So in the US it was
pretty straightforward.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.830
People would come to our
site and hear about us.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.579
And then they would
type in their address,

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:52.250
and then we'd say oops, sorry,
we're not in the area yet.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.250
Please check back again.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.030
And so we are able to
see demand that way,

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.070
from essentially
collecting ZIP codes.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.350
In terms of international,
London, Berlin, London

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:07.450
is the biggest city in Europe.

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.020
There's 12 million people
there, and it's very dense.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.790
And we felt like it
would be almost exactly

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:16.220
like New York City,
which is the case.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.790
Which we found to be the case.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.510
In terms of Berlin,
it's also a big city.

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:25.220
Has 3.4 million people there.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.440
A lot of people get
the technology thing,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.780
and so there wasn't that
barrier or that obstacle

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.590
to jump as well.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.720
And we opened up
an office there,

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.710
and there's a good
entrepreneurial community

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:43.040
there as well, and so it's
good for hiring talent.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.990
And so all these
factors combined,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.325
we decide to land in Berlin.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.250
AUDIENCE: So when
you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:12.091
I'm assuming
[INAUDIBLE] the fact

00:25:12.091 --> 00:25:13.716
that they don't have
to go [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:19.576 --> 00:25:21.200
ADORA CHEUNG: So the
question is what's

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.680
the advantage for a
cleaning professional

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:27.360
to work on Homejoy
versus another company?

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.920
I think there's two big ones.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.060
One is flexible work.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.860
In this day and age,
the rising trend

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:40.704
is people love to just
work whenever they want.

00:25:40.704 --> 00:25:42.120
Actually I think
most people would

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.590
love to just work
whenever they want.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:46.410
But there's an increasing
trend of people

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.590
working as independent
contractors.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.420
And so that's the
type of workers

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.090
we attract is people who,
for whatever reason--

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.240
We have a lot of, for
example, moms on our platform

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.730
that work as
professional cleaners.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.440
And they can work from
9 o'clock to 2 o'clock

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.390
and then go pick up their
kid for three hours,

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.390
feed them dinner, and then maybe
work another gig afterwards.

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.780
And so you can't really
find a good job that

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.530
allows that slot in
the middle of the day,

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.100
and so that's we allow.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.040
And then there are people
who-- Housecleaning

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.430
involves traveling around a lot.

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.820
The flexibility is also
in the geographical sense.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.380
For example, some people
don't like to cross bridges.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.890
Some people only want to work
in a very specific area, down

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.120
to the street.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.370
And we allow for that as well.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.040
And so we have been
able to build up systems

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.100
where every contractor,
every professional cleaner

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.450
on the platform tells us
exactly when they want to work

00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:46.660
and exactly where they want to
work, and schedule around that.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:47.950
So it's very complicated.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.790
You can imagine the
algorithms involved

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.360
in taking everybody's
variations,

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.880
but it's certainly possible.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.226
And then the second thing,
which we're getting better at

00:26:57.226 --> 00:26:59.350
and which we are very
focused and passionate about,

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.550
is building a community amongst
the professional cleaner

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.020
community.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.960
Amongst the professional cleaner
base that we have on Homejoy.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.850
And so there are
additional benefits

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.170
to working on our platform
besides just getting work.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:21.540
And so we are very
focused on helping

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.530
the professional cleaners
do well and making sure

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.920
they have a good life
and things like that.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.640
We don't publicize
those things too much,

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.925
but it's certainly something
we do in the background.

00:27:33.925 --> 00:27:35.905
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:37.885
We have a question over here.

00:27:37.885 --> 00:27:49.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] must have
been a lot of key [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:54.220
what did you learn in
the process [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:55.705
be successful [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:58.954 --> 00:28:00.120
ADORA CHEUNG: Good question.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.910
So the question is
what did I learn

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.170
in terms of hiring the
key managerial roles as we

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.930
grew over time?

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:15.470
There are some roles that
we repeated in each market.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:16.670
For example, the manager.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.940
And so we developed
profiles of who the best

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:21.440
people were in
terms of launching.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.920
So, for example,
the city launcher,

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.190
the best profile we found
was actually consultants.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.420
Like McKinsey consultants.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.165
Because they traveled
around a lot, and they

00:28:31.165 --> 00:28:33.040
were very good at just
thinking on their feet

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.837
and dealing with random issues.

00:28:35.837 --> 00:28:36.670
And very analytical.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.380
We're a very
data-driven company,

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:39.930
and so that helped a lot.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.280
In terms of the city
manager, these are the people

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.697
that they're part of
the recruiting process

00:28:45.697 --> 00:28:47.530
and they bring on the
professional cleaners,

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.190
and they're the
ones interviewing.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.290
And so we felt the best
people for that role

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:56.470
were the people who ran
housekeeping at a huge hotel.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.770
And so in every city, we
would find the top three

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.010
hotels in the city
and try to convince

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.980
the director of housekeeping
to leave and come join us.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.480
And we're pretty successful
doing that, which was great.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.450
And it helped us.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.670
It meant that we learned
how clean ourselves,

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.620
but these were the true experts
in cleaning and determining

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:22.520
who the best cleaners were.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.710
I think the things
I've learned over time

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:32.840
is as we grew from zero cleaners
to 100 cleaning professionals

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.880
to 1,000 compressions to
2,000 and so on and so forth,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.170
the operating model
changed as well.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:43.930
And so different types of people
work in different environments.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.390
So it's sort of from
zero to 100, that's

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:53.550
sort of a typical large cleaning
company, but from 100 to 1,000,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.950
you're trying to think
of not how to manage

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.920
each individual person,
you're thinking about how do I

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.740
automate some of these
things so that we

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:04.930
can manage 1,000 people at once?

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.710
And as we grow even larger to
tens of thousands of people,

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.742
we'll have to take that
into account as well.

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:11.450
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.430
So with that, I just want
to thank Adora for her time.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.590
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:14.890
ADORA CHEUNG: Thank you.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:15.190
MALE SPEAKER:
Enjoyed having you.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.490
ADORA CHEUNG: Yes.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.323
Thank you very much.

00:30:16.323 --> 00:30:18.190
Thank you for having me.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.740
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, guys.
