00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:09.767
Spray-painted subway cars,

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:11.345
tagged bridges,

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.985
mural-covered walls.

00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:15.995
Graffiti pops up boldly 
throughout our cities.

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:20.777
It can make statements about identity,
art, empowerment, and politics,

00:00:20.777 --> 00:00:24.303
while simultaneously being associated
with destruction.

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:27.318
And, it turns out, it's nothing new.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:31.615
Graffiti, or the act of writing 
or scribbling on public property,

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:34.088
has been around for thousands of years.

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.617
And across that span of time,

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:38.406
it's raised the same questions
we debate now:

00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:40.238
Is it art?

00:00:40.238 --> 00:00:42.477
Is it vandalism?

00:00:42.477 --> 00:00:47.785
In the 1st century BCE, Romans regularly
inscribed messages on public walls,

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:49.277
while oceans away,

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:53.926
Mayans were prolifically scratching
drawings onto their surfaces.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:56.646
And it wasn't always a subversive act.

00:00:56.646 --> 00:01:01.067
In Pompeii, ordinary citizens regularly
marked public walls with magic spells,

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:03.408
prose about unrequited love,

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:05.607
political campaign slogans,

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:09.558
and even messages to champion
their favorite gladiators.

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:13.577
Some, including the Greek 
philosopher Plutarch, pushed back,

00:01:13.577 --> 00:01:17.318
deeming graffiti ridiculous and pointless.

00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:19.177
But it wasn't until the 5th century

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:23.798
that the roots of the modern concept
of vandalism were planted.

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:28.468
At that time, a barbaric tribe
known as the Vandals swept through Rome,

00:01:28.468 --> 00:01:31.127
pillaging and destroying the city.

00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:35.118
But it wasn't until centuries later that
the term vandalism was actually coined

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:39.249
in an outcry against the defacing of art
during the French Revolution.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:42.078
And as graffiti became 
increasingly associated

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:44.359
with deliberate rebellion 
and provocativeness,

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.578
it took on its vandalist label.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:52.078
That's part of the reason why, today,
many graffiti artists stay underground.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:55.202
Some assume alternate identities
to avoid retribution,

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:59.519
while others do so to establish
comradery and make claim to territory.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:01.970
Beginning with the tags of the 1960s,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.956
a novel overlap of celebrity and anonymity

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:08.030
hit the streets of New York City
and Philadelphia.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.900
Taggers used coded labels to trace
their movements around cities

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.589
while often alluding to their origins.

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.580
And the very illegality of graffiti-making
that forced it into the shadows

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.639
also added to its intrigue 
and growing base of followers.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.940
The question of space and ownership
is central to graffiti's history.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.251
Its contemporary evolution has gone
hand in hand with counterculture scenes.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.381
While these movements raised their
anti-establishment voices,

00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:40.123
graffiti artists likewise challenged
established boundaries of public property.

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:41.747
They reclaimed subway cars,

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:42.929
billboards,

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:46.799
and even once went so far as to paint
an elephant in the city zoo.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.154
Political movements, too,

00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:51.276
have used wall writing 
to visually spread their messages.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:55.320
During World War II, both the Nazi Party
and resistance groups

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.013
covered walls with propaganda.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:00.721
And the Berlin Wall's one-sided graffiti

00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:03.521
can be seen as a striking symbol
of repression

00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.890
versus relatively 
unrestricted public access.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.490
As the counterculture movements

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.291
associated with graffiti 
become mainstream,

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.510
does graffiti, too, become accepted?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.022
Since the creation of so-called
graffiti unions in the 1970s

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:23.431
and the admission of select graffiti
artists into art galleries a decade later,

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:28.901
graffiti has straddled the line between
being outside and inside the mainstream.

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.622
And the appropriation of graffiti styles
by marketers and typographers

00:03:32.622 --> 00:03:35.292
has made this definition 
even more unclear.

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:38.122
The once unlikely partnerships 
of graffiti artists

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:40.171
with traditional museums and brands,

00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:42.528
have brought these artists 
out of the underground

00:03:42.528 --> 00:03:44.382
and into the spotlight.

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.812
Although graffiti 
is linked to destruction,

00:03:46.812 --> 00:03:50.683
it's also a medium of unrestricted
artistic expression.

00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:52.551
Today, the debate about the boundary

00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:55.452
between defacing 
and beautifying continues.

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:59.811
Meanwhile, graffiti artists challenge 
common consensus about the value of art

00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:02.663
and the degree to which any space
can be owned.

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:05.193
Whether spraying, scrawling, 
or scratching,

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:09.102
graffiti brings these questions
of ownership, art, and acceptability

00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:10.502
to the surface.
