[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.395
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.380
GARETH MORGAN: Great
to see you all.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.985
Stephen, great to have you here.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:15.860
First time to Google?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.690
STEPHEN ROCHE: First
time to Google, yeah.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.148
I was going to wear
my pink jersey,

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:22.030
but I watched it too much
and put in the dryer.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.030
GARETH MORGAN: Yours was
much, much, much harder

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.140
earned than mine was.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.130
STEPHEN ROCHE: Man, I
put mine in the dryer.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.505
It doesn't fit
anymore, you know?

00:00:27.505 --> 00:00:29.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:31.280
GARETH MORGAN: Well, actually,
we'll talk about that.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.930
Because it's 30 years
this month since

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.870
you got out on the
start line for the Giro,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.540
for a fantastic season.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.780
Do you remember how you were
feeling when you lined up?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.570
And were you confident
of what was coming?

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.070
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well,
in fact, lining up I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.730
was a co-leader with my
teammate Roberto Visentini, who

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.710
actually won the Giro in '86.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.045
And I had helped him to win it.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.192
But I had won the Tour of
Romandie going into the Giro.

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:04.250
And I'd won the Tour Valencia,
second at Paris-Nice,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.720
second and whatever.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.960
And I felt that I deserved
at least a level, par kind

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530
of title of leader, co-leader.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.715
And whoever is lucky enough
on the day, he can be leader.

00:01:17.715 --> 00:01:19.590
And that's how it was
for the first few days.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.200
Got the team jersey
after day three.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.270
Held the jersey for a week.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.860
And I quickly noticed
that my teammate

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.347
was following me, rather
than following the other.

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:30.930
Which was cool to
me, because at least

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.630
he was never far away from me.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.360
But at the same time,
if he had been--

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.994
I won't say intelligent enough,
but he had been more doing

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:39.660
his own game, he would have been
trying to get away and leave me

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.530
behind.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.630
So I should admit, he was
actually never too far from me.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.510
But I was only out
there the first week.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.260
Then we had a big time
trial, and I flopped.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.000
And my biggest
memory of that day

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.270
was I had the jersey
for eight days.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.500
I was being claimed as a
hero and everything else.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.410
I quite enjoyed it
and lapped it all up.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.410
And this day, after this time
trial, I came to the finish.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.910
I had lost two
minutes on Visentini.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.180
He got the jersey.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.072
I arrived in, and
nobody gave me a towel.

00:02:09.072 --> 00:02:10.530
Nobody said, Stephen,
poor Stephen.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.920
What happened?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.420
Nobody was trying to console me.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.860
And I looked across
to Visentini,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.660
and he was getting
all the adulation.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.900
All the the press and
media were all over him.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.550
And I just heard one remark
when I was going past.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.780
A journalist said to him, well,
Roberto, it's quite clear,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.560
now you've won the time
trial, that you're now

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.960
the only sole leader
of the Carrera team.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.961
So Roche now, will ride for you.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.460
But then you can
pay back then, when

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.005
you go to the tour in July.

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:43.590
And Roberto politely
turned to the journalist

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.812
and said, yeah, it's true.

00:02:44.812 --> 00:02:46.020
Stephen will ride for me now.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.670
I'm the sole leader.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.535
I've showed everybody who's
the strongest in the team.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:52.440
But I'm not going to the tour.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.280
I'm going on holidays.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.050
So I thought well, he's being
honest about it, anyway.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.260
But at the same time, we're
going to ride for the guy.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.480
And he said it quite openly
that there' no pay back.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.870
So it wasn't very fair.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.460
GARETH MORGAN: Now,
he was an Italian

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.380
in an Italian team in an Italian
race, obviously, in Italy.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.880
STEPHEN ROCHE:
Previous winner, '86.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.440
GARETH MORGAN: And
a previous winner.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.500
How did the next few
weeks transpire for

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.490
you, in terms of winning
over the Italians,

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.080
winning over the team,
and winning the race?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.920
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well, actually,
I'm still working on it.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.330
Because you can imagine, as you
said, taking the pink leader

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.120
jersey off an Italian,
riding for an Italian team,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.250
previous Giro winner, a
great Italian hopeful,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.790
it was quite
devastating for him.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.780
And the public made
me feel that they

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.750
were devastated for him also.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.180
But the very next day,
after the time trial,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.115
had to have a talk with myself.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:02.220
Had to kind of Google help, and
what can I do next, you know?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.280
And we decided that myself and
my teammate, Eddie Schepers--

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.110
my teammate and roommate--

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.240
the only guy that
was really with me,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.520
said, well, what do we do?

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.070
He's annihilated
everybody today.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.899
So he's obviously going very
deep, going into the pain zone.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.140
And normally He would have had
to recover for the next day.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.766
So if he'd had to
recover the next day,

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.640
well, the following day
was a mountain stage.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.607
So we won't be able to
catch him out at all.

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:32.565
So the next day was a
kind of transition stage,

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:34.650
a bit of a Mickey Mouse stage.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.020
So we thought, well, if
something stupid could happen,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.860
has to happen today.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.890
So we set out with
no real ambition

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.860
to upset the applecart.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.460
But if it's an
opportunity, why not?

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.320
So a break, we got away.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.590
We had no Carrera
teammates in there.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.900
So I thought, well,
it's not my place

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.300
to be there, because I
was kind of a co-leader.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.580
But at the same time,
if I got into the break,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.780
it would save my team from
chasing the breakaway down.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.790
But then there's nobody
dangerous in the group.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.796
So I have no real reason
to be there either.

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:11.570
[SIGHS]

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.630
So I was fighting with myself.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.926
So I decided, OK, well,
I can't attack, because I

00:05:16.926 --> 00:05:18.050
would seen to be attacking.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.060
So what if I just go
over the top of the hill

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.490
and just don't look behind
me, and see what happens

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.870
at the bottom of the hill?

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.960
So I went down the
hill quite fast,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.430
and got to the
bottom of the hill.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.440
I had nearly a minute and a
half up on the main group.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.480
And I caught the front group.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.120
So I didn't attack though.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.810
I went down the hill
faster than him.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.697
People keep saying, even 30
years on, ah, Stephen, oh, you

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:44.280
shouldn't have
attacked your teammate.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.460
But I just want
to make it clear.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.680
I didn't attack.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.000
I went faster than
him on the downhill.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.277
It's clear, yeah?

00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:52.776
Mhm?

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.610
Then, all of a
sudden, the team car

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.651
came along and said,
Stefano, what are you doing?

00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:02.700
I said, well, I went
down the hill quite fast.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.640
Very surprised
nobody followed me.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.750
Now I'm in the break.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.510
At least my team
now are at ease.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.400
They can sit behind and wait for
the Bianchis and the Panasonics

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.720
to arrive.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.470
And the guy says, Stefano,
you don't understand.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.684
There's mayhem behind you.

00:06:17.684 --> 00:06:18.600
They're on the ground.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.849
They're hanging out in threes.

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.270
They're everywhere,
ones and twos.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.690
You went down that hill so
fast, they're everywhere.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.479
It's totally
disorganized behind you.

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:26.520
You're going to get away.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.610
Well, that's what it's
all about, isn't it?

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.980
No, Stefano, you
don't understand.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.715
Roberto's riding behind you.

00:06:33.715 --> 00:06:35.220
I said, oh.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.540
That's not very
good of a teammate.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.725
Tell Roberto to
stop and I'll stop.

00:06:41.725 --> 00:06:43.440
No, no, no, Stefano.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.770
You don't understand.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.395
Roberto wants you to stop.

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:47.440
But I said no.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.930
Tell him, he stops, I stop.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.240
He rides, I ride harder.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.870
And that was kind
of war was declared.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.210
And I told him, just tell
Roberto not to give it at all.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.840
Because when he catches
me, I'm going again.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.820
So that's what
actually happened.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.750
And he caught me
on the final climb.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.470
And I struggled like
terrible in the final climb,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.280
Because I'd done like,
45K riding in the front.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.990
And my teammate, Eddy
Schepers was right beside me.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.010
And he came up
beside me, Stephen,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.590
this is the day
you win the Giro.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.700
You've got to catch
that breakaway now

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.033
because there's a group of
four or five guys ahead, Tony

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:21.270
Rominger, Steve Bauer.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.500
You got to catch that guy.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.060
This is the day
you win the Giro.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.844
And I buried myself
over the top.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:28.260
And I finished like, four or
five seconds behind the group

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.660
on the finish line.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.240
But just one second
ahead of Tony Rominger

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.980
to put on the pink jersey.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.500
Which doesn't sound a lot.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.140
But I could've imagined
another scenario.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.410
After everything
that had happened,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.495
taking the jersey off an Italian
rider, in an Italian race,

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:48.810
in an Italian team.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.460
They wouldn't have been
very sympathetic with me

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.510
at the finish.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.510
My boss had come along
to sign me a new contract

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.750
for the following year.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.750
So all of a sudden, the
boss got his helicopter,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.950
went home, and left me to deal
with a very annoyed public.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.310
And he couldn't send me
home because I had a jersey.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.100
And Roberto lost
four or five minutes.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.900
So the scenario there
was for one second,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.429
the whole history
could've been changed.

00:08:16.429 --> 00:08:18.595
And of course, we had no
earplugs those days either.

00:08:18.595 --> 00:08:20.136
So we didn't know
what was happening.

00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:23.970
So then after that, things
got quite complicated.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.950
GARETH MORGAN: And was
that the day you knew

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.261
you were going to win the Giro?

00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:30.510
STEPHEN ROCHE: That was the
day I realized how hostile

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.800
the Italian public can be.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.820
Because even today, for
example, even though we all

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.720
feel cocky and everything else,
somebody would say to you,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.310
Stephen, here's a scenario.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.830
What would you do
in this scenario?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.520
And if someone was to
describe that scenario to me

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.849
today, after not living
that scenario, I said,

00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:54.390
there's no way I'd
have stayed there.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.181
I'd have gone home.

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:57.090
And the first plane
home, I'd have been home.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.120
Because it was an
incredible scenario.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.990
And the very next day, the
people were spitting at me,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.300
shouting all kinds
of abuse at me,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.530
spitting rice mixed
with wine at me.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:12.760
All kinds of slogans
which I can't mention here

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.570
because there's too
many young people here.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.750
It's absolutely amazing.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.220
And for the first day, I wasn't
allowed to talk to the press.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.620
So I couldn't get my
side of the story across.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.190
But the next morning, I
spoke to a journalist.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.150
I told him to be
my spokesperson.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.880
And he took my story
and very politely said

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.960
to me, once it was all finished,
Stephen, story's great,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.280
you know?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.650
The only thing is, all the
articles are done for tomorrow.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.040
So I have tomorrow.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.260
I can promise you, your
article will be in the paper

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.010
the following day.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.540
I'll tell your side.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.990
So it made things very,
very complicated for me.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.210
And very next day, then I'm on
the podium, getting my flowers.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.760
And it wasn't as
luxurious as it is today.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.280
It was like a back
of a big truck.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.800
There was the podium.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.140
There was a plastic,
plexi kind of curtain.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.210
Behind that curtain, that
was the live television.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.952
So I was saying to myself,
like I can't leave this camera.

00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:14.160
I'm going to get killed here.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.284
Someone's going to kill me.

00:10:15.284 --> 00:10:17.000
It was really, really hostile.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.950
Had to tell my
side of the story.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.600
So I took my flowers
around the bit.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.370
And I walked over gently
towards the two guys

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.560
on the front door of
these plastic doors

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.640
for the live television.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.900
Threw my flowers
out to the public.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.850
And the same time, barged in
between these two big guys

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.210
that were standing there
to protect the live set.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.184
And I burst into live set.

00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:43.850
The journalist says
bah-- uh-- eh-- uh--

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:49.040
we-- uh-- uh-- we
have a surprise guest.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.610
Stephen, I suppose you've
come in to surprise us.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.400
I'm sure you've come in to
tell your side of the story.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.440
The story of Sappada,
they call it.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.550
So I said yes.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.110
So at that particular day, I
realized for the first time

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.760
I could actually speak Italian.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.790
And I put a few words
together to explain

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.950
my side of the story.

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.550
It helped a little bit.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.760
But you can imagine,
in Italy, they

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.000
didn't want to hear about it.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.833
GARETH MORGAN: Yeah.

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:15.480
STEPHEN ROCHE: So things were
extremely difficult and hostile

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.252
for the next 10 days.

00:11:17.252 --> 00:11:21.080
GARETH MORGAN: Is there
any Italians in the room?

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.060
Oh, they're all
watching live TV.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.960
Well, it all worked
out very well.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.312
You ended up being the first
Irish person to win the Giro.

00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:34.410
And we'll talk about the rest
of the season later on as well.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.360
But I wanted to go back
to the very beginning.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.890
Because you're a local
boy, born and bred

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:42.630
out the road, in Dundrum.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.270
What got you interested in
cycling in the first place?

00:11:48.132 --> 00:11:51.540
STEPHEN ROCHE: It was
quite by accident, really.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:56.820
I played football with my
local lads after school.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.560
I thought it was good.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.646
But I always watched them
playing on the Sunday,

00:12:00.646 --> 00:12:03.900
even though I trained
with them all week.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.360
Which wasn't very
nice, you know?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.299
And I swam fairly strong,
but I wasn't really

00:12:08.299 --> 00:12:09.090
a straight swimmer.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.060
I swam off to the side, which
is very embarrassing when

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.440
you're in the pool.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.310
And one day I was
playing football

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.550
in the middle of
our housing estate.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.700
And maybe not so much
these days, but in those

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.230
days there was always
one person, at least,

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.020
in a housing estate that
knew everybody's business.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:33.780
And this particular person,
her husband actually cycled.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.490
So she knew I used to ride on
my bike, had a paper round.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.350
I used to deliver the
papers on my bike.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.892
And I'd go up to
Glencree on a Sunday

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:43.141
where they had a little
[INAUDIBLE] store where they'd

00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:45.950
make my bangers and my sausages
and think it was great,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:46.910
you know?

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.900
Think I'd gone to
the end of the world.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.400
And I'm back.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.872
But this woman knew that I had
a little interest in cycling.

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.830
And she was coming down
from the shops one day.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.080
And she crossed by the green
where we played football.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.972
And she says, Stephen, you
like riding a bike, don't you?

00:13:00.972 --> 00:13:01.680
I didn't ask her.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.120
I was too polite to
ask her how she knew.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.390
But looking back
it, now we know why.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.090
But anyway, she said, there's
a new Cycling Club starting up

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.470
at H. Williams at
7:30, next Wednesday.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.390
If you want to go
along, go along.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.380
So I went along.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.430
And I was told I had
to be 13 to join.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.870
I was only 12 and 1/2.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.190
So I told them I was 13.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.120
And I joined the club.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.655
And went on from there.

00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:32.220
But I didn't actually
jump at it straight away.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.790
I enjoyed it because I
was training with my mates

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.330
all week, or
whenever I had time.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.750
And on the weekend I went out
and rode a race with my mates.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.210
And the first race we
rode was in Skerries.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.320
And after a couple
of laps, I stopped.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.480
I was riding my friend's
bike, because my bike wasn't

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.500
good enough.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.270
I was wearing jeans
and a pair of shoes.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.100
And the jeans were rolled up.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.545
And it was on a small closed
circle in the Skerries.

00:13:59.545 --> 00:14:01.795
About two laps to go, I
pulled on the side of the road

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:03.294
and the coach came
running after me.

00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:04.650
Stephen, Stephen, what's wrong?

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:05.508
What's wrong?

00:14:05.508 --> 00:14:07.380
Nothing.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.310
Why'd you stop?

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.100
I was tired.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:11.220
So I stopped.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.272
But the beauty of it
was, I was cycling

00:14:14.272 --> 00:14:15.730
and competing with
the mates that I

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.370
was training with all week.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.260
And then we raced
every other week.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.810
And we got on better and better,
from strength to strength.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.350
But I never really
a super rider.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.720
But I enjoyed what I was doing.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.595
And that's probably what
made me stick in it.

00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:28.690
GARETH MORGAN: Mhm.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.710
So clearly you've learned a
lot about cycling and training

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.160
for cycling over the years.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.243
Here's a question for you.

00:14:34.243 --> 00:14:36.245
Because there's lots
of avid cyclers here.

00:14:36.245 --> 00:14:39.660
Let's say you pick somebody
from the audience here,

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.460
and you've got eight weeks to
get them ready for the Tour de

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:42.960
France.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.690
What are you going to focus on?

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.554
[SIGHS]

00:14:49.554 --> 00:14:50.587
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.587 --> 00:14:52.420
STEPHEN ROCHE: That's
a very, very big task.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.880
I'd focus on well,
maybe, getting time

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.000
off work, first of all.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.770
And trying to find a
good training program.

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:07.911
But no, I'm training myself at
the moment, for our own event

00:15:07.911 --> 00:15:08.410
we're doing.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.590
And we're having kind
of a tour back to '87.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.270
We're going to do
the '87 21st stage

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.260
of the tour over three days.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.300
And I'm starting to
train for it now myself.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.850
But it's a big task
for me, because I

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.170
haven't been training a lot.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:24.950
But looking at the
people here today,

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.657
I don't see much talent
here for cycling.

00:15:27.657 --> 00:15:29.490
GARETH MORGAN: All the
Italians are missing.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:29.760
That's why.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.218
STEPHEN ROCHE: I could be making
a mistake maybe, you know?

00:15:32.218 --> 00:15:35.470
But at least, watch the
Giro, next few weeks.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.550
You might get a few tips.

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.466
GARETH MORGAN: Uh-huh.

00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:40.670
Well, I mean, training has
changed a lot since 1987

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.170
to today.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.410
And obviously you're
a keen observer

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.360
of how the cyclists
prepare themselves today.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.160
In fact, I hear you're
commentating on the Giro

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.980
starting tomorrow,
for French TV.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:57.820
What's your observations
on how training has

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.162
changed over the last 30 years?

00:16:01.162 --> 00:16:02.620
And particularly,
what things would

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.050
you do differently,
based on what

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.894
you know now, if you were
going back to do 1987 again?

00:16:10.894 --> 00:16:12.310
STEPHEN ROCHE:
I'll ask my parents

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.310
to be born 10 years later.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.010
Because when they see the
money that's going around now,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.237
they say well, you
know, I wonder,

00:16:20.237 --> 00:16:21.320
have you got a case there?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.278
A legal case, you know?

00:16:22.278 --> 00:16:22.830
[LAUGHS]

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.590
But no, everything has
changed, totally changed.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.500
And it's difficult.
We never look at it

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:33.580
and say, our time was better
than today or today is not

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.590
as good as yesterday.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.010
We all deal with it
at our own times.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.860
And we look at the
Nicolas, for example,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.360
today, who is racing with BMC.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.310
And you see his lifestyle,
you look at his bank account

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.817
and you say, yeah,
it's brilliant.

00:16:45.817 --> 00:16:47.650
But at the same time,
look at the lifestyle.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.820
You say, well, it's
not money for nothing.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.629
You know?

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:52.545
GARETH MORGAN: How is
the lifestyle different?

00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:53.330
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well--

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.190
GARETH MORGAN: So
Nicolas is your son?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.570
STEPHEN ROCHE:
He's my son, yeah.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.250
Well, for example, I
had ridden say, 37,000,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.250
38,000 kilometers a year.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.280
I'd have been racing
120 days of the year.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.770
Again today, 65
days a year, maybe.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.869
Christopher might
do 50 days a year.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:12.240
So it's a lot less competition.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.349
And that's why maybe today some
of the riders go till 38, 40.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.879
Whereas in our day it was
31, 32, 33, because we

00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:19.780
were riding twice as much.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.390
But we started
racing in February,

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:22.990
and finished off in October.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.819
And we're hitting peaks like
in March, for Paris-Nice,

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:30.940
in May for the Romandie or
Giro, for July, for the Tour.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.610
In August, for the end-of-season
Classics, in September,

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.720
for the World Championships, and
then for Lombardy in October.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.150
They we'd have a break.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.410
I used to always
say, being stubborn,

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.150
you don't get paid
for staying at home.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.267
So you got to race.

00:17:45.267 --> 00:17:46.600
You don't get paid for training.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.550
You got to race.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.436
Win a race, you get paid.

00:17:49.436 --> 00:17:50.560
Training, there's no money.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.330
Got to train, then race.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.970
Whereas today it's,
I focus on the race.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.230
I train for that race.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.780
And I try and win that race.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.874
And it might mean
taking five weeks out

00:17:59.874 --> 00:18:01.040
in the middle of the season.

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.451
Whereas for us, that
was totally unheard of.

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:05.450
We'd do a three-week
training block in February.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.487
And that was it for the year.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:09.070
And we were afraid
of taking time out.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.840
Because you're afraid
of losing the condition.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.120
Because you, all the time,
ask yourself the question,

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.230
will it come back?

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.910
I left off at here.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.022
When I get back on,
will it be the same?

00:18:18.022 --> 00:18:19.690
You're always worried about it.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.030
Whereas today, with all the
data available to the guys,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.860
the power meters, the watt
meters, the heart monitors,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.030
and all the science
there is behind it,

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.520
they can tell you
exactly where they are.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.570
They haven't got to go
out on the bike and say,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:33.695
I'm going to go well today.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.080
They know, merely from
the numbers, how they are

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.300
and where they are.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.484
It's all gone so scientific.

00:18:39.484 --> 00:18:40.900
But at the same
time, the downside

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.930
is I'm asking myself well,
do they enjoy it as much?

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.760
Because we really enjoyed it.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.500
Whereas when you're
riding a bike today,

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:48.940
you're looking at the watts.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.250
And you're wondering why
they aren't going up.

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:53.080
Or you're getting
up in the morning

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.830
and say they're going to do six
hours, that's 3,000 calories.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.660
Well, I've only eaten 1,500.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.770
So I'm going to
lose so many grams.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.330
It's all full-time, 24/7,
all the time, on the ball.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.930
Whereas we would get
up in the morning,

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.970
7:00, 7:30, have
a good breakfast,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.420
go off and ride the bike.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.420
Didn't really matter what
we had in our pockets.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.740
We'd ride a bike.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.400
Hail, rain, or snow,
we'd ride a bike.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.650
Today the guys are getting up.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.270
They're nearly
weighing their food,

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.290
what the protein is,
the calories, and this,

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.540
and the carbs.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.460
Everything is all monitored.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.180
They function to what
train they're doing.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.010
Where we trained in groups, now
they all train as individuals.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.800
Because they all have a
different training program.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.480
And everyone's are
all so different.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.510
So it's become
unsociable as well.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.180
Definitely, if I was thrown
into this peloton today,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.310
I wouldn't cope.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:47.790
But the guys today have grown
up with this, and the numbers.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.120
And it's all about numbers.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.330
And which is, I think for the
kids, has been unfortunate.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:55.310
Because they don't know
how to enjoy the bike.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.540
For example, I have another
son, Alexis, he was 18.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:03.130
And he went for a trial for
the 82R Cycling Club there,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.155
about a few weeks ago.

00:20:04.155 --> 00:20:07.420
And 19 or 20 guys went
for the same interview.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.180
And I spoke to the
coach afterwards.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.596
And the coach said,
Stephen, there

00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:13.072
were 2 guys of 20
that appealed to me.

00:20:13.072 --> 00:20:13.780
One was your son.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.950
I said, why?

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.520
Because he spoke to me about
himself, what he was doing,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:21.160
his plans, what he
was doing in school,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.050
what job he was looking for.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.580
Whereas the other
guys were talking

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.140
about how many
watts they're doing,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.455
what their recovery rate,
how many heartbeats they have

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:29.830
and everything
else, what they've

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.660
done in the O2 max test
and everything else,

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.660
whereas Alexis has
never done one.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.460
Because I always said, Alexis,
there's time for that later on.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.800
Learn the feeling of your legs.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.216
Learn the feeling of your body
when you're under pressure.

00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:42.780
And then start
working on the watts.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.571
But working on the
watts when you're young?

00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:46.520
16, 17, 18 years of age?

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.490
That's when you learn
to enjoy the bike.

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.557
Which means when
you're 21, 22, 23,

00:20:50.557 --> 00:20:52.390
and you start needing
to get into the watts,

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:55.630
the nitty-grittys of the
real scientific training,

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.610
he'd have been doing
it all at a young age

00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:58.990
and have never enjoyed that.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.730
When the times
get tough, I think

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.260
that's where it all comes out.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.210
You go to playing
football or playing

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.686
golf or marbles or something.

00:21:05.686 --> 00:21:07.810
But it's difficult to stay
in cycling when you have

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.460
to do it for a full lifetime.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.970
That's why I think
the riders today,

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.730
the lifestyle is very hard.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:13.720
Because it's full on.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.554
It's 24/7.

00:21:15.554 --> 00:21:17.470
And it's a very difficult
lifestyle they have.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.219
GARETH MORGAN: Now,
Stephen, you mentioned

00:21:19.219 --> 00:21:22.510
reaching a number of peaks in
the season when you were back

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.680
in '87.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.080
Obviously winning
the Giro was a peak.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.000
And then a couple
of weeks later,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.590
I think three weeks
later, you were

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:35.560
lining up for the Tour de
France and feeling confident

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.530
going into that race.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.230
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well,
I just won the Giro,

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.510
and under very
difficult circumstances.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.500
So of course, I was worried
about my general condition.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.020
But I decided that between
the Giro and the Tour,

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.965
there was only like, 18
days, I think it was.

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:55.660
And I suffered an awful
lot morally and physically.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.570
But not very, very
severely morally.

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.290
So I thought well, that
Giro tour was 26 days.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.390
It's the longest
one since the war,

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.350
and the most mountainous
since the war.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.140
So I wasn't a great climber.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.092
I was a good climber.

00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:10.050
So going into a tour
which was very mountainous

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.480
was going to be
difficult for me.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:16.600
So I decided OK, well, I'll
hide for the three weeks

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.012
between the Giro and Tour.

00:22:18.012 --> 00:22:19.470
Because going to
races, everybody's

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.554
going to be talking about
Visentini, how I got it,

00:22:21.554 --> 00:22:23.886
how I didn't get it, how I
lost it, why did I attack him

00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:25.070
and why didn't I attack him?

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.350
So I don't answer that again.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.696
So let's just get on with
it and prepare for the tour.

00:22:29.696 --> 00:22:32.090
So the first week I
just rode the bike.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:34.500
Just promenading and
just riding the bike

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.484
whenever I felt like it.

00:22:36.484 --> 00:22:38.650
And the second week, start
building up the distance.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:39.770
And the third week,
I started training

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:41.770
on the motorbike doing
like, once in the morning,

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.603
once in the evening
time, doing short spins.

00:22:43.603 --> 00:22:46.360
But not too tiring,
but fast spins.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.740
Because my idea was that
after winning the Giro,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.120
going to the Tour, If you
don't show the first day,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.832
people say well, it was a
fluke or it doesn't matter.

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:56.290
Whereas, I wanted
to show everybody

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.880
that the Giro wasn't a fluke.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.944
And the Tour, I always have it
marked as one of my priorities.

00:23:01.944 --> 00:23:04.360
So I finished third in the
Prologue, which is good for me.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.640
Because I was showing everybody
that I was still in form.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.790
And that particular
tour, I broke it up

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.650
into seven or eight days.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.500
Because you cannot be
on form for 26 days.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.390
So you pick out the
days that suit you,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.350
which is the Prologue.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:18.990
Show everybody you're here.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.681
Stay safe for the
first time trial.

00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:22.180
Do your best in the
next time trial.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.145
And I won that.

00:23:23.145 --> 00:23:25.020
Then you go on into the
first mountain stage,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.570
and you try and perform on it.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.870
So that was my strategy.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:28.700
Up to the Alps.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.380
And then the Alps, I say,
OK, I can identify now

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.410
who my rivals are and
how can I beat them?

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.100
It a lot of that was strategy.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.530
Which a lot of it today
is not as strategic.

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:39.960
It's more scientific.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.030
But in our day there
was a lot of strategy

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:46.150
and you always had to
work on the other guy

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.200
and know his strong
points, his weak points,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.856
and try and work on them.

00:23:50.856 --> 00:23:54.424
GARETH MORGAN: And your
favorite moment from that Tour?

00:23:54.424 --> 00:23:56.340
STEPHEN ROCHE: The
favorite moment of the Tour

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.090
was probably a dramatic moment
for everybody, especially

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.590
my family.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.920
Because when I collapsed at
the finish line on La Plagne,

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.980
it's an event that everybody
talks about today still.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.690
Because it was moving at
20 down with 5K to go.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.030
And I pulled out all the
stops and brought it back down

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.240
to four seconds on
the finish line.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.220
But I had brought back the
gap down in a short period.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.800
It was purposely done,
everything I had.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.050
Because I knew that if I
had wrecked it earlier,

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.770
Delgado might accelerate.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.000
Whereas by him having 120 up
but 5K to go, he's going to say,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.300
OK, I'm happy now.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.789
I've got Roche now.

00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:35.580
I'm OK in the lead.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.007
I have 120 ahead,
so I won the tour.

00:24:40.007 --> 00:24:42.090
And I was thinking, well,
I'll let him think that.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:45.380
And then with 4K to go, 5K to
go, give it everything I have.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.040
And then and I'll
try and get back

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.059
to behind 30 seconds of
him And then surprise them.

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:51.100
So that that's why I did.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.340
But I came right
back to four seconds.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:56.100
So the problem was that
the journalists were all

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.450
saying, well, Laurent
Fignon won the stage.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.040
So they're all over
Laurent Fignon.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.020
They were on Delgado
winning the Tour.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.207
And they were on peloton.

00:25:03.207 --> 00:25:04.665
But Roche is in
the middle where he

00:25:04.665 --> 00:25:07.290
lost the Tour and no sympathy.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.034
So when Roche came out of
nowhere, all of a sudden,

00:25:10.034 --> 00:25:11.450
the journalists
had their articles

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:13.870
already pre-written as
to Delgado won the tour.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.930
And Roche went into anonymous.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.890
And then Roche comes
round the corner.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.890
So the journalists were
running towards Delgado.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.970
And all of a sudden,
they come over to me.

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:25.680
So nobody wanted to
help me off my bike

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.721
because they were all
looking for the first word.

00:25:27.721 --> 00:25:28.620
But I couldn't talk.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:33.190
So I collapsed on
the finish line.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.960
And the one thing
I remember most,

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.030
the most frightening thing was
that I'm lying on the ground.

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:41.370
And I can't move
my arms, my legs.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:42.300
Can't move them.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.270
And the guys are saying,
Stephen, move your legs in.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.785
The ambulance, the car
is getting close to you.

00:25:47.785 --> 00:25:49.650
And I couldn't move my legs.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:51.720
And the doctor's
saying, Stephen,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.127
blink your eyes if
you can hear me.

00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:56.210
So I communicated with the
Doctor for five minutes

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.821
with my eyes, just
yes, no, yes, no,

00:25:57.821 --> 00:25:59.070
until I started coming around.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.810
Then they put me in the
back of the ambulance.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.280
And then things
got a bit better.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.613
But it was a frightening moment.

00:26:03.613 --> 00:26:05.810
But for me, it was a moment--

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.170
well, historic moment really.

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.450
Because that's the day I
could've lost the Tour.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.180
And it was an epic day.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.980
I had attacked over the
[INAUDIBLE],, like, 100K to go.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.900
It was suicidal, but I did it.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.220
And I was caught.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.770
My plan backfired.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.350
But I still came back to save
the day on that tiny stage.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.610
So for me, that's probably the
most memorable day of the Tour.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.890
Maybe because everyone
talks about it, even today.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.790
And it's still so
fresh in my mind.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.991
But it is a famous
day in cycling,

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:34.740
and a famous commentary
from Phil Liggett,

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.948
because Phil Liggett was
the only one really watching

00:26:36.948 --> 00:26:38.034
the monitor that day.

00:26:38.034 --> 00:26:39.450
And when he saw
me coming he said,

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.991
that looks like
Roche. that is Roche.

00:26:40.991 --> 00:26:43.671
And his words are very
famous, even to this day,

00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:44.670
for the live commentary.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:45.930
GARETH MORGAN: Yeah.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.780
I remember that Tour very well.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.560
I was there on the
Champs-Elysees that day.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.429
I was very young.

00:26:52.429 --> 00:26:54.845
STEPHEN ROCHE: You weren't
wearing glasses then, were you?

00:26:54.845 --> 00:26:57.612
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:57.612 --> 00:26:59.070
GARETH MORGAN: And
it was at a time

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.520
when we didn't have very
many Irish sporting heroes.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.740
In fact, I think of you
as a pioneer in that.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:09.810
It wasn't until 1988 that the
Irish football team qualified

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.750
for their first big event.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.540
Since since then
we've been spoiled.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.920
But you were a real pioneer.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.650
Was there a moment after
that where you went, wow,

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.905
I really made the big time?

00:27:22.905 --> 00:27:24.600
STEPHEN ROCHE: Big time, no.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.140
But I didn't really
realize the impact

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.850
it was having back
here in the country.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:36.830
Because the late Charles
Haughey, [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:40.225
met me on the podium in Paris.

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:41.850
GARETH MORGAN: Never
missed a photo op.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:44.190
STEPHEN ROCHE: Never
missed a photo opportunity.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.274
And I didn't really
know-- well, I

00:27:47.274 --> 00:27:49.440
knew who he was, OK, but I
wasn't intimate with him.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.527
I would kind of say well,
what's he doing here?

00:27:51.527 --> 00:27:52.610
Should I say hello to him?

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.070
Should I ask him
to go for a pint?

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.210
Or what do I say to him?

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.790
Anyway, he'd already
had a few pints.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:05.340
But when he was finished with
the protocol and everything

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.950
else, he leaned on my
shoulder and said well,

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.570
every day [INAUDIBLE],,
cup of coffee.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.660
And he was totally stoned.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.610
But I took him to his word.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.410
And before I go into that one,
I came home the following day

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.610
into Dublin.

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.092
And of course, Charles Haughey
was waiting for me there,

00:28:23.092 --> 00:28:24.800
for the plane, with
a fabulous welcoming.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.186
And I'm coming home
saying, on the plane, well,

00:28:27.186 --> 00:28:28.810
I'm going to look
like I need you here.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.050
Back in Dublin, getting
off a plane and nobody

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.360
in the airport.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.450
Because the 525 cycling
fans are all in Paris.

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.972
They can't get home to meet me.

00:28:37.972 --> 00:28:39.930
So I'm going to look
bloody stupid, getting off

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.090
a plane for a reception
and have nobody there.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.690
So anyway, to my surprise,
I got off the plane,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.900
and there was thousands of
people all over the tarmac.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.350
They had banners up
all over the airport.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.150
And when I got off
the plane, then

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.184
the crowds jumped the barriers,
went out to the tarmac.

00:28:58.184 --> 00:29:00.100
And the police had to
make a human [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.600
so I could walk through.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.610
Like really, Elvis
Presley, Beatles stuff.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:04.237
It was amazing.

00:29:04.237 --> 00:29:06.320
People were pulling at me,
and absolutely amazing.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.530
Absolutely amazing.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.220
And they had a civic reception.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.620
The bus ride then,
from the airport

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.715
to Dublin, civic reception
in a mansion house.

00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:14.840
From there out to my house.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.480
So that was an
amazing day for me.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.410
Because there was so many
people that day in Dublin,

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.770
and had come to greet
me at my homecoming.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.704
And I realized then the
impact, that they were

00:29:27.704 --> 00:29:28.870
watching television at home.

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.400
They were watching the papers.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.132
They were not so
much on social media,

00:29:33.132 --> 00:29:34.840
because there wasn't
so much at the time.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.370
But they were following what was
going on and really appreciated

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:39.280
what I did.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.980
But getting back to the
Charles Haughey thing.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.910
People say he stole the show.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.370
But in all fairness, I had
a little story to tell.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.760
They actually went down to his
house a couple of months later.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.710
Because we'd had an
event in Malahide.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.000
And I called in.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.210
And they stopped me at the box.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.870
Then I introduced myself.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.370
They told me to
go up to the door.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.900
And the door was open.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.460
And the late Charles
Haughey came out

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.530
of a meeting with
his Aran sweater

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.760
on him, a pair of Aran slippers.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.390
Hey, Stephen, I'm
in a meeting here.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.030
Go to the bar at
the bar at the back

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.252
and I'll meet you
in five minutes.

00:30:13.252 --> 00:30:14.710
So he came in the
back room anyway.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.040
And there was no journalist,
nobody around, just himself,

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:18.770
myself.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.690
And we left the
world and everything

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.550
else for about two hours.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.740
At the end of it all,
he went into a back room

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.495
with a velvet curtain.

00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:30.370
And he came back out
with a box of chocolates

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.520
and brushed the dust off and
says, give it to the wife.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:38.520
I held him to his word.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.311
Gave the chocolates to
the wife, of course.

00:30:40.311 --> 00:30:43.470
But I mean, on the podium in
Paris, he got a lot of stick

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.379
for coming over and greeting me.

00:30:45.379 --> 00:30:46.920
But he said to me,
Stephen, (SLURRED)

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.003
everyone's turning around.

00:30:48.003 --> 00:30:49.830
He was a bit-- so I call in.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.390
And he welcomes me.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.850
And we saw each other, spoke
about everything and anything

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.010
for two hours with no
journalists and nobody else

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.227
around.

00:30:58.227 --> 00:31:00.060
For me, it was a great,
great moment for me,

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.643
to be sitting with
a person like that,

00:31:01.643 --> 00:31:03.976
and to be just talking
to a normal person.

00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:06.267
GARETH MORGAN: So the first
Irish winner of the Tour de

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:08.890
France, the only Irish winner
of the Tour de France so far.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.416
Who's your bet for the next
Irish winner of the Tour de

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:14.907
France?

00:31:14.907 --> 00:31:17.240
STEPHEN ROCHE: I wouldn't
mind keeping it in the family.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.200
GARETH MORGAN: Uh-huh.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.650
Well, you've plenty of options.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.541
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well, Nicolas
now is getting a bit long

00:31:21.541 --> 00:31:22.082
in the tooth.

00:31:22.082 --> 00:31:23.220
But Alexis, he's coming up.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.230
He's very, very good.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.430
Well, he's got
incredible potential.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.530
I don't want to put any
pressure on the kid now,

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.240
but he's got great potential.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.880
But his passion is IT.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.090
He's doing very well at it.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.072
So he has an option.

00:31:37.072 --> 00:31:39.530
But he loves the cycling as
well and he's got great talent.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.500
So we'll see where it goes.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.690
But I don't know who the
next Irish person will be

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.290
or if he's even born yet.

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:51.320
But I did a charity event down
the Leinster Loop, down in down

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.970
in Athy, down in
Kildare last year.

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:54.560
We have a family
ride on the Saturday.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.490
And I was riding along
with a young kid, about 11,

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.220
12 years of age.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.420
And he was riding with
all this cycling gear.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.065
I said to him, what do you
want to be when you grow up?

00:32:01.065 --> 00:32:02.990
He says, I want to be the next
Irish winner of The Tour de

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.627
France.

00:32:03.627 --> 00:32:04.460
So maybe it was him.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:04.880
GARETH MORGAN: Good.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.213
STEPHEN ROCHE: Maybe it was him.

00:32:06.213 --> 00:32:10.040
GARETH MORGAN: Good OK.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.900
Let's go into the darker
side of the sport.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:17.060
Because obviously there's
been a lot of talk

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.940
over the last while
about drugs in sport,

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.160
and particularly in cycling.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.950
And in fact, actually, I
looked that the last Tour de

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:26.870
France that you rode
in, you were riding

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:32.540
with a certain Texan who
was doing his first Tour de

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:36.930
France, and very infamously
ran into lots of trouble

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:37.430
after that.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:42.530
What's your thoughts
on drugs in this sport?

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.180
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well,
the drugs, I always

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.570
ask the people, where does
cheating begin and end?

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.360
They have this thing now,
they call it a sticky bottle.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.860
Where any of you
involved in cycling

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.276
know what a sticky
bottle is, it's

00:32:56.276 --> 00:33:00.260
actually when you see
the rider wants a bottle.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.430
So he put his hand out.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:02.510
The car comes up.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:04.880
And all of a sudden, the
rider goes fast forward.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.960
And he's pushing
himself off the car.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.489
I say, for example, that's where
cheating begins also, there.

00:33:12.489 --> 00:33:14.280
Without getting into
the doping side of it.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.770
Cheating starts there.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.350
And getting back onto
a group after having

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.780
a wee or a puncture, being
stuck back in by the car,

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.160
right up to the back
of the bunch, I say

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:29.394
don't wait till somebody gets
in the car, gets back up,

00:33:29.394 --> 00:33:31.560
gets out of the car before
doing something about it.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.140
But unfortunately, the UCI
don't listen to me anymore.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.530
And last year we saw Nibali
doing this similar thing.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.110
he got dropped.

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:42.440
He had a problem.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.820
And the first group was
going away from him.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.180
And he got a sticky bottle.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.640
And we saw, from the helicopter,
his speed went from 40 to 70k

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.420
an hour.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.470
And about a kilometer or so
he caught the group in front.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.890
And at the end, he even tried
defending himself as to why?

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.540
Why is everybody
getting onto me?

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.460
You know, why?

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.500
They didn't have an
accident or an incident.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.980
Whereas for me, all those things
are all incidents of the race.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.674
That's what makes it the race.

00:34:08.674 --> 00:34:09.590
You can't be doing it.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:13.880
But on the darker side of
it, on the drug side of it,

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.560
I was always against it.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:18.860
And I must say that the last
two generations have had it

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:19.969
very hard.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:22.969
Because we've been telling
all the kids to stay clean

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.170
and don't cheat.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.629
But they've been riding
against riders who they know

00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:28.610
are more than likely cheating.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.260
And I used to say
back in the '80s

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:35.170
that you could say 10% of the
peloton might be cheating.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:37.520
And the others are
suspected of cheating.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.429
Whereas in the '90s and
2000s, we were saying well,

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:44.882
90% of them are cheating and
then 10% might be cheating.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:47.090
And that all came out in
all the different books that

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.839
were written over the
last couple of years

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:49.961
that it was true.

00:34:49.961 --> 00:34:50.460
d

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.293
GARETH MORGAN: Where
do you think it is now?

00:34:52.293 --> 00:34:55.010
STEPHEN ROCHE: I reckon it's
gone back to where it was.

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:59.330
I really hope that there'll
be even less than 10%

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.350
still doing it.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:01.950
It can never be proven.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.127
But with the biological passport
now and the whereabouts system,

00:35:05.127 --> 00:35:06.710
it's getting more
and more complicated

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.350
for guys to cheat
without being caught.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:12.740
But as you know, there's always
something new on the market

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.870
that we don't know about.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.880
And we always feel that there's
always somebody a little bit

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.020
further ahead.

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:21.020
But I'm confident
that the UCI are doing

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.395
the utmost to make it clean.

00:35:23.395 --> 00:35:24.700
But it's all about education.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.480
Like, why did it get so bad?

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.980
It got so bad because
the young kids

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.140
were going out with the
[INAUDIBLE] on the weekends

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.290
and riding the race.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.040
They were coming in
crying because they've

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.740
got sore legs, which is normal.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.840
And then you go to the local
GP and say, listen, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840
has sore legs and [INAUDIBLE]
still in the race.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.923
Can you give me something?

00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:42.720
And he's giving him whatever, an
aspirin or whatever, a vitamin

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.330
C. And then the following
it's something else.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.371
Then it's something else.

00:35:45.371 --> 00:35:47.090
Then it gets into
the high-end drugs.

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:49.550
That the young kid
gets a pro contract.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:52.320
He knows all his life
he's been using whatever.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.930
So he has to use it to perform.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:56.010
So he continues on with it.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:59.090
And that's where the cycling
got to over the years.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.010
Because the kids
were starting off

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.890
young because there
was no control in it.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.640
And the GPs were giving out
anything and everything.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:08.937
It took like, two generations
to pull it back a bit.

00:36:08.937 --> 00:36:10.520
And of course, all
the different books

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.910
that were written about it
highlighted all the problems

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.884
and made everyone aware of
what is and what was going on.

00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:18.425
And then, of course,
all the controls

00:36:18.425 --> 00:36:20.258
that were being put in
place, the Whereabout

00:36:20.258 --> 00:36:23.470
system, the biological
passport, which is amazing.

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.840
Normal cyclists now
will do a minimum 14

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:30.380
controls in the year, without
even being randomly tested.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.330
He has to also tell everybody.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:35.475
They have an app where they
have to put in their program.

00:36:35.475 --> 00:36:37.660
They call it the
Whereabouts Program.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.885
So if, for example, Nicolas
coming to me on a Saturday,

00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:43.990
he has a phone and this
app, and going to my dad

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.800
and [INAUDIBLE] and Antibes.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.490
If the last minute
he changes his mind,

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.470
go to his grandmother
or whatever,

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.120
he has to put it in there.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.140
Because this base
serves for the Olympic

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.360
Council, the National
Federations, the UCI.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.640
They can look at this
and say, OK this guy,

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.150
we're going to want to test him.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.650
Where is he?

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:04.010
Ah, we're going to test him.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.710
And the rider has to be
within two hours of where

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.290
he said he would be.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.189
If he's not, he gets
a first warning.

00:37:10.189 --> 00:37:11.480
Then they get a second warning.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.050
And a third warning,
he's positive.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.160
Declared positive and suspended.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.740
So nobody wants to have
that on their record.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.800
So it is getting very, very
hard for riders or athletes that

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.565
are trying to cheat to cheat.

00:37:22.565 --> 00:37:23.940
But unfortunately,
there's always

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.960
somebody ahead of the posse.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:31.180
But you know, I see in the
racing today, young riders that

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.589
are new to the sport, have
understood that you're not

00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:34.630
going to win by cheating.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:38.014
It's about hard work,
dedication, and training.

00:37:38.014 --> 00:37:40.180
GARETH MORGAN: And talking
about today and hard work

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.260
and dedication and training,
the leading favorite

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.210
going into the Tour de France
this year is Chris Froome.

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.739
How would you have
fared against him?

00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:52.030
STEPHEN ROCHE: What a question.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.245
[LAUGHS]

00:37:53.245 --> 00:37:55.120
GARETH MORGAN: How would
you have beaten him?

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.438
Or would you have
written for Team Sky?

00:37:58.438 --> 00:38:01.220
STEPHEN ROCHE: Yeah, I think
that my Carrera team back

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.090
in the '80s was the equivalent
or similar to the Team Sky,

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.390
except we were more tactically--

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.620
I'd say we could do
really, our own tactics.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.170
We spoke about tactics together.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.270
And we employed what
we felt was necessary.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.190
Whereas the Sky team
are told what to do.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.920
And sometimes you can call
the guys like, brain dead.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.530
An example like, not
insulting the guys,

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:31.420
but like two years ago in
Italy, with Sky, he at one

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.330
stage they told Nicolas,
you're now on the front

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.790
now from 80 to 120K.

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:39.490
Which means that whatever
happens between those two

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.366
limits, he has to make sure
nothing goes without him.

00:38:42.366 --> 00:38:45.940
That particular day,
the Movie Star team

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.860
were riding for some
reason or whatever.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:49.100
And Nicolas felt, it's great.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:51.100
I can have a handy ride.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.040
So after 120K,
Nicolas, how are you?

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.080
Great.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.278
OK, see you tomorrow.

00:38:56.278 --> 00:38:58.660
He said, I feel good.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.165
No, no, no, tomorrow.

00:39:00.165 --> 00:39:02.290
Whereas Nicolas felt really,
really bad about that.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:03.830
And I can understand that.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.550
But then the very next day,
the team had a bad day.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:09.290
And Froome was challenged
on Alpe d'Huez.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.130
And Nicolas was the only
one to basically help him.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.480
So you can understand
the strategy there,

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.470
that if Nicolas buried
himself yesterday for nothing,

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.370
he wouldn't have had the
energy to be the front.

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.700
So it's become so scientific
now, that's where it's gone to.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.260
You ride there and
there and there.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.920
And you save the energy
for when we really need it.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.310
You got a job to do.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.490
But Sky has gone a little
bit overboard on it.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.980
But they're going very tactical
and very scientific on us.

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.664
And it is killing a bit of
the suspense in the races.

00:39:39.664 --> 00:39:41.080
But the answer to
your question, I

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.540
think I would have had a
good go at Froome, yeah.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.050
And although I could never
have been as light as him.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.360
But nevertheless,
Froome was a great guy

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.980
and a great ambassador
for cycling.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.800
Because he has had
a lot of shit thrown

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.050
at him over the last couple
of years because of what's

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.740
been going on in cycling in
general, but not himself.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.540
And he has stood up
to it very, very well.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:04.390
He's answered politely and
correctly to the journalists,

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.724
rather than breaking their nose.

00:40:05.724 --> 00:40:08.223
Which other riders would have
broken the journalist's noses.

00:40:08.223 --> 00:40:08.780
You know?

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.400
So he has been a great
ambassador for cycling.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.550
And I think that this year he
strives on people knocking him.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.800
People say, well, Quintana
will win the Tour this year

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.133
because Froome isn't going well.

00:40:22.133 --> 00:40:25.930
That's fueling his
energy, fueling his motor.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.370
And boy, he'll be hard
to beat this year again.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.260
But I think that if we
can take some conclusions

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.680
from last year's tour, we saw a
batch of young guys coming up,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.930
Pinot, Bardet, Barguil,
Dumoulin, Yates.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:44.100
Load of young guys coming
up, 24, 25 years of age,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.760
who are not worried
about being second.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.625
They want to win.

00:40:46.625 --> 00:40:48.454
Whereas for years,
riders were riding

00:40:48.454 --> 00:40:50.120
to be second on the
podium behind Froome

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.110
or behind Indurain,
or behind whatever.

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:55.360
All of a sudden, they
have the ambition to win.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.910
And they believe they can win.

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.420
And for that reason, I think,
for the next 5, 10 years,

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.877
we're going to live some
really, really good tours.

00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:02.710
GARETH MORGAN: Good.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.543
That's good to hear.

00:41:03.543 --> 00:41:07.955
I think we're going to have
time for one or two questions.

00:41:07.955 --> 00:41:08.830
Here's the first one.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.270
AUDIENCE: Hey,
how are you doing?

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:20.250
Later that year,
in '87, when you

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.850
were in the final kilometer
of the World Championship

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.240
race, myself and all
my friends thought

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.320
that you were going to lead
Kelly for a sprint finish.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.810
And I think a lot of the riders
in the Bush thought that too.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.308
And when you broke and
nobody followed you,

00:41:38.308 --> 00:41:42.292
I'd like to know, what was the
plan between yourself and Kelly

00:41:42.292 --> 00:41:45.280
before the race?

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.268
And how did all that change?

00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:49.015
Or what happened?

00:41:49.015 --> 00:41:51.390
What was going through your
head when you went and nobody

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.030
followed you?

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.502
STEPHEN ROCHE: Well, the deal
was that I'd won the Giro,

00:41:57.502 --> 00:41:58.210
I'd won the tour.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:01.780
And Sean, unfortunately,
he crashed out of the tour.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.160
Hadn't had a great season.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.110
So the World that
year was supposed

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:07.740
to be designed, more or less,
for a rider like Sean, that

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.060
wasn't all-arounder,
but a good sprinter.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.999
So that was Sean's year
to be World Champion.

00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:13.915
That year or the following
year, but that year

00:42:13.915 --> 00:42:17.230
was definitely the year
that was suited for him.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.650
And I basically went down.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:23.140
And I was very tired
after winning my double.

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.540
And I had no real
ambition going down there,

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.744
other than to help Sean.

00:42:27.744 --> 00:42:30.160
Because everybody had said,
oh, it's a dead, flat circuit.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.630
Wait and see, the
sprinter's race.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:35.656
I'm only going to up the
numbers and to help Sean.

00:42:35.656 --> 00:42:38.500
And it was only after arriving
down like, two days, three days

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.540
before, we went
around the circuit.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:43.300
And I realized well,
gee, this is OK.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.160
A sprinter, it goes around once.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.506
But we're going around 22
times, with 2 climbs every lap.

00:42:48.506 --> 00:42:50.380
And I was saying that
most of these sprinters

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.450
are going to be tired
at the end of the road.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.276
So I could have a chance.

00:42:55.276 --> 00:42:56.650
Which, in a way,
was good for me.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:58.426
Because I spent
the last few months

00:42:58.426 --> 00:43:00.300
just thinking about
helping Sean, and getting

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:01.180
to the end of my season.

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.554
I wasn't even
thinking one second

00:43:02.554 --> 00:43:06.640
that I did which I was just and
nobody was kind of targeting me

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.840
as a favorite either

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.690
because they recognized that
I'd done too much in the Giro

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.235
in the tour, that I'd be
wasted for the Worlds.

00:43:15.235 --> 00:43:17.390
And another aspect that
helped me very much also

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.740
was the fact that it had been
35 degrees the day before.

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:22.890
I was totally wasted
because of the fatigue

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:24.040
of the Giro and the Tour.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.280
But the morning of the
race, we opened the curtains

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.986
and it's eight degrees
and lashing rain.

00:43:29.986 --> 00:43:33.160
It wasn't Malahide or
Swords, or Dundrum,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.380
but we like lashings
of rain in September.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.760
It was amazing, amazingly cold.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.460
And straight away, something
clicks and you say,

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:44.020
well, hmm, somebody's
telling me something here.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.130
And you see things as well.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.670
Like everyone opens the
curtains up the same way.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.677
And someone will say
well, shit, it's raining.

00:43:52.677 --> 00:43:54.010
all of a sudden, they're beaten.

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.060
Some don't like the rain.

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:56.470
Some will fall off.

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:57.610
Some won't be on form.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:00.610
Some won't-- you know, we all
have our problems in the rain

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.280
and the sun.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.310
Your 200 opponents, all of
a sudden it comes down say,

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:10.387
50 and 20 direct
rivals, you know?

00:44:10.387 --> 00:44:12.220
So I thought, OK, well,
the best thing to do

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.070
is keep dry for the first part
of the race as much as I can,

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:15.760
hide.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.260
And then the second
part of the race

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.780
just try and be available to
help Sean and wait and see.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.880
So with two laps to go, then
Sean had missed a break.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.650
And I had done a lot
of work before then.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.320
So I was a bit
starting to feel it.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.170
It was 272 kilometers.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.405
So I was starting to feel
a bit under the weather

00:44:31.405 --> 00:44:33.150
while it was raining.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:37.887
And I accelerated a little
bit, brought Sean out to front.

00:44:37.887 --> 00:44:38.970
We cut the group in front.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.260
And I went straight
to the front to make

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.864
sure the break got away.

00:44:43.864 --> 00:44:45.280
So once the break
was established,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:46.540
then I came back to the back.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.456
Thinking, OK, well, I
better just take a rest.

00:44:48.456 --> 00:44:51.280
Because if I'm going to lead
Sean out for the sprint,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.650
I can't just lead out for 10K.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.850
I got to lead out
the final 4 or 5.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:58.810
So as I got to the back then,
two or three guys attacked.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.070
Nobody chased.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:02.720
So I thought gee, I've been
working all day for Sean.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.520
Here these guys are,
riding away from us.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.436
So I jumped across it.

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:08.020
I'm thinking that the break,
the group would come after me.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.060
But they didn't
react straightaway.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.301
So I found myself in
this four-man break.

00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:14.800
And out of the four men-- there
was five of us with myself--

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:17.757
the four of them are faster
sprinters than myself.

00:45:17.757 --> 00:45:19.340
So I'm saying like,
what a bloody mess

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.881
I've gotten myself
into now because I

00:45:20.881 --> 00:45:22.230
can't sprint with these guys.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:23.460
I've worked all day.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.160
We've built the whole
thing up for Sean.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.410
We've ridden for Sean all day.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.930
And now Sean's back
like, back behind.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:33.631
I tried getting
away about 5K to go.

00:45:33.631 --> 00:45:35.380
But as I was going up
the right-hand side,

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:39.490
the group pulled across and
kind of stopped me a little bit.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.265
But then I came to
the final corner.

00:45:42.265 --> 00:45:45.190
I had one guy on my wheel.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:48.000
It's amazing how the
brain actually works.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.440
Not because of Google, but when
I'm explaining what happens,

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.350
I often say, I Googled help.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.100
And it's actually
faster than Google Help.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.600
Because it's amazing how
the brain actually works.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.350
Like, you're going into a
corner, a left-hand corner, 500

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:02.380
meters to go.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.940
The wind's coming
from the right.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:06.450
So you're analyzing
all this in your brain.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.090
And I reckon I go, I
have one guy on my wheel.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.750
If I go to the right,
because the guy's

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.550
going to go to the left,
totally in the wind.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:13.750
If I go off on the
right, the guy's

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:14.833
going to come on my wheel.

00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:16.250
He's going to beat me.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.470
I don't want to be second.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.380
If I wait, I'm
going to be fifth.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.202
What do I do?

00:46:20.202 --> 00:46:22.285
So all of a sudden, like,
the brain goes-- chicka,

00:46:22.285 --> 00:46:23.784
chicka, chicka,
chika-- keeps going.

00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:26.000
And the guys are pulling
into the left-hand side

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.490
to close the door.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:29.950
And I waited till that
door got just enough for me

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:31.120
to get through.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.750
So if the guy behind
me tries to follow me,

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.700
he might just
hesitate a little bit.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.710
So I went through
the gap, got through.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.000
That actually happened.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.610
The guys in the group were
Sorensen, van Vliet, and Ralph

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:44.790
[INAUDIBLE], all sprinters.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.980
But all are fighting
with each other.

00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.470
So once again, I was going--
chicka, chicka, chicka-- going

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.600
again.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.610
And these guys are
looking at each other.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.651
Because if leads there,
one's going to be beaten.

00:46:52.651 --> 00:46:54.935
So I might gain a
few seconds there.

00:46:54.935 --> 00:46:55.810
That's what happened.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:57.018
I went on the left-hand side.

00:46:57.018 --> 00:46:58.680
The guy behind me got blocked.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:00.388
The other side are
looking at each other.

00:47:00.388 --> 00:47:02.460
I got 10 yards, 15
yards, 20 yards.

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.997
And that was enough then, to
hold them off to the finish.

00:47:04.997 --> 00:47:07.330
And then Sean, of course,
then, was in the group behind.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:11.610
They caught this small group
about 20, 30 yards to go.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.230
And Sean, of course,
finished sixth.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:17.760
So it was an amazing final.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.170
But I only won, really, two,
wons the races in my career.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.700
One was the World Championships.

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:25.620
And the other a
Paris-Roubaix Amateur.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:26.960
So there wasn't that kind of a--

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.330
I was more of an endurance
and a tour rider.

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:32.060
But it's amazing how things go--
chicka, chicka, chicka-- click.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.240
And at the last
minute and that's

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.865
amazing how fast the
brain has to adapt

00:47:34.865 --> 00:47:36.270
to the different circumstances.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.000
GARETH MORGAN: And of course,
it wrapped up a fantastic

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.270
banner year, 1987.

00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:44.885
I think we're
almost out of time.

00:47:44.885 --> 00:47:46.260
I was going to
say, Stephen, it's

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:47.850
wonderful to have
you here at Google.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:50.310
And it's wonderful to have
you as a Google customer.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.883
You have a thriving
cycling business,

00:47:52.883 --> 00:47:55.796
which I believe we're
helping you with.

00:47:55.796 --> 00:47:57.010
And it's going well.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.970
STEPHEN ROCHE: Yeah,
the Cycling Holidays now

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.460
are going on 21 years now,
stephenrochecyclingholidays.com.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:11.360
We have almost 70%
repeat loyalty clients,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.720
we've got very loyal clients.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.747
And it's basically a program
we have in Spain in Mallorca,

00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:18.330
where we have five groups every
day for five different levels.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.600
So everybody here can
find a level of their own.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.410
And we have two ride
captains in each group

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.050
which actually make
sure the speed is

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.057
kept to a certain speed.

00:48:26.057 --> 00:48:27.390
They don't leave anybody behind.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:30.030
The following cart, make sure
we have drinks and everything

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:32.190
else, as in water
and electrolytes,

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:35.280
not in alcoholic drink.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.210
And we have three lovely
hotels which we always

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:40.440
keep our people in.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.070
And we have between 60 and
80 people a week for February

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.302
through to June, and
then September, October.

00:48:46.302 --> 00:48:48.510
And in between we do a
private guiding, bike rentals,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.343
and everything else.

00:48:49.343 --> 00:48:53.760
And this year, of course,
for the 30th anniversary,

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.205
we're going back to that
famous state in La Flange,

00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:58.350
where we're organizing in June.

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.865
We're calling it letape87.com
We have our own website.

00:49:01.865 --> 00:49:04.140
And we're having
a three-day event

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.069
where we arrive at the Grenoble
on the Friday night, June 9th.

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:10.110
Saturday morning we do a
Grenoble Bourg d'Oisans,

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:10.933
up Alpe d'Huez.

00:49:10.933 --> 00:49:14.280
70K only, but Alpe d'Huez.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.940
And the Dauphine, which is the
second-biggest tour in France

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.746
will arrive one hour behind us.

00:49:20.746 --> 00:49:22.620
And the tour contenders
will be there as well

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:24.950
for the second-to-last
stage of the Dauphine.

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:26.700
Next day we start at
Bourg d'Oisans, which

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.650
is where the Stage 21 started.

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:31.770
Bourg d'Oisans, over
[INAUDIBLE] telegraph.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:34.660
Down at the [INAUDIBLE]
where we have lunch.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:39.180
And then we have to the
limit will be to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.830
Then you get a bus to the hotel.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:43.500
And over limit will
leave [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.290
and go over the Madeleine,
down the far side, which

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:48.900
is the second climb
of the famous stage.

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.330
Next morning we do Brides-les
Bains, back on the stage

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:54.510
again, up into La Plagne,
finishing on top of La Plagne,

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.090
to have completed
the full stage.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:56.430
GARETH MORGAN: Great.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.763
STEPHEN ROCHE: So it's a
fairly kind of monumental stay.

00:49:58.763 --> 00:49:59.910
But there's no time on it.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.790
We have following
cars, motorbikes.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.415
There are only going
to about 30 people

00:50:03.415 --> 00:50:06.390
on it, 30, 35 people on
it, fully-guided motorbikes

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:09.589
and ride captains,
lovely hotels.

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:10.880
So we're looking forward to it.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.380
And hopefully we will
have some names on it

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.820
as well, where we haven't
got full agreements yet

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:20.850
from the likes of
Indurain, Delgado.

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:22.530
I'm trying to get
Delgado to come back.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:25.980
And we lit the stage.

00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.140
But this time, not collapsing.

00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:30.570
And for the fun of it,
so it'll be a few names

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.750
that'll be coming along with
us, either for three days

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:34.904
or for one of the days.

00:50:34.904 --> 00:50:36.570
Even Eddie Merckx
we're talking to also.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.100
Maybe he might
come along and ride

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:39.808
that, at the last few
kilometers with us.

00:50:39.808 --> 00:50:40.710
So we're doing that.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:41.870
And also, we have
a lighthouse tour

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:43.995
at the end of the year,
which is in Mallorca, which

00:50:43.995 --> 00:50:45.560
is four days around the island.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.720
Every day, changing
hotels for four days.

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.127
Which is something we've done
for the last two years now.

00:50:50.127 --> 00:50:51.460
And that's been a great success.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.466
So the cycling
holidays are booming.

00:50:54.466 --> 00:50:56.090
There are many guys
out there doing it.

00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:58.770
I was one of the first
guys doing it 21 years ago.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.160
Now there's hundreds
of them doing it now.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.250
But we're still there.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.497
And we like to boast ourselves
as being one of the best.

00:51:05.497 --> 00:51:06.330
GARETH MORGAN: Good.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:08.490
So there's a cycling holiday
for everybody in the audience?

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:09.760
STEPHEN ROCHE: Everybody
in the audience.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.468
stephenroche.com.

00:51:10.468 --> 00:51:12.230
GARETH MORGAN: If
the price is right.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.767
Stephen, wonderful
to have you here.

00:51:14.767 --> 00:51:15.600
Thank you very much.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.160
And good luck with
your business.

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.660
And good luck with
your commentating

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.482
over the next three
weeks for the Giro.

00:51:20.482 --> 00:51:21.480
STEPHEN ROCHE:
Thank you very much.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.590
Hope you all enjoyed it.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.570
We didn't give you much
time to talk, did we?

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.680
Unfortunately, didn't
get any questions in.

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.659
It's unfortunate.

00:51:28.659 --> 00:51:30.450
GARETH MORGAN: Well,
you're sticking around

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:31.150
for a few minutes.

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.920
STEPHEN ROCHE: Yeah,
sure, yeah, yeah.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.660
GARETH MORGAN: And
happy to ask question.

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:32.960
All right.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.001
STEPHEN ROCHE: Thank you.

00:51:34.001 --> 00:51:36.910
[APPLAUSE]
