00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.870
As we have learned over the years, even the
biggest and best movies in the world often

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.050
feature some pretty funny mistakes.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.259
Of course, having a few mistakes doesn’t
make them bad movies – it’s just an extra

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.969
fun thing for us to look for!

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.770

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.330
Captain America: Civil War
Captain America: Civil War brought Marvel

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.330
some incredible commercial and critical success
and many people have argued that it is the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
best MCU film to date.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.330
That being said, the movie isn’t without
it’s fair share of goofs and slip ups.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.330
In the first Avengers briefing with the Secretary,
it can be clearly seen that, in the background,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.330
Tony Stark is wearing a wedding ring.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.330
The problem is, when the shot changes, Tony
can be seen in the same position – but this

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.330
time with no ring.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.330
It’s not uncommon for playboys like Mr.
Stark to take off their wedding ring once

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.330
and a while but we have to think this was
an editing mistake and not a character choice.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.330
Suicide Squad
Suicide Squad is by no measure a perfect movie,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.330
actually it’s not even close – so it’s
not really surprising that along with the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.650
poor decisions the film made it also made
some visible continuity mistakes too.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.150
When Harley is changing and the whole crew
stops to look at her undeniably hot body,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.670
there is a continuity mistake that totally
slips through.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.250
In the moment right before we see that Will
Smith’s Deadshot is wearing a white shirt.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.760
The movie then cuts to Harleys super hot stripping
scene but when we cut back, Smith is wearing

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.489
a totally different dark coloured shirt.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.649
We are guessing that Robbie’s bod distracted
most fans and it looks like the folks editing

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.990
Suicide Squad may have been as well.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.439
Doctor Strange
2016’s Doctor Strange is just another example

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.439
of how Marvel can take a lesser-known property
and turn it into a serious hit.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.260
With Cumberbatch leading the way, the film
introduced us to some new magical elements

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.570
of the MCU, but unfortunately, all the magic
in the world couldn’t fix some mistakes

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.570
in this film.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.110
At one point, Stephen Strange is at home looking
for help on a video chat and when he becomes

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.150
frustrated he throws everything on his table
to the ground.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.350
Christine then enters with food for him and
when the camera cuts back, we can see that

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.830
all of the things he just knocked to the ground
have magically been placed back on the table.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.710
Doctor Strange may have some awesome powers
but we don’t think instant tidying up is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.780
one of them.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.700
The Wolf Of Wall Street
Not counting a 2005 documentary that is literally

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.441
called the F word, The Wolf Of Wall Street
holds the record for the most uses of the

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:52.790
expletive in a film with 506 F bombs.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600
The movie is a wild ride and along with all
the swearing there is also some pretty steamy

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.939
sex scenes between Leo and Margot Robbie.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.140
One of these scenes actually features a pretty
funny continuity error as Leo’s pants magically

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.260
jump on to his body between cuts after his
final love making session with Robbie.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.259
We’re guessing you probably didn’t catch
this editing mistake as there are a lot of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.920
other things on the screen to be looking at,
but once you’ve seen it, it’s hard not

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.260
to laugh at.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.550
Jurassic World
Although it was met with mixed critiques,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.680
there is no denying that Jurassic World was
a commercial success as it raked in well over

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.290
1.5 Billion dollars in 2015.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.010
The movie was undoubtedly exciting and Chris
Pratt did a great job with his character but

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.900
unfortunately, even with all that money behind
it, the movie still had some visible slip

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.900
ups.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.290
In the scene when Hoskins first approaches
the raptor cage, we can see that his watch

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.200
shows approximately 2pm.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.440
After the rescue of the staff member who falls
into the pit, the shot cuts back again to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.110
Hoskins and his watch now reads 1pm.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.740
This movie features a lot of crazy science,
but we don’t think it dealt with time travel

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.400
so we are going to have to chalk this one
up as a continuity error!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.310
La La Land
La La Land is a force to be reckoned with

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.080
as the 2016 Hollywood musical has now officially
tied the record for most Oscar nominations

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.080
of all time.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.050
This film takes every last details in to consideration,
but even the most carefully crafted cinema

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.200
can fall victim to some continuity issues.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.200
On the day Sebastian (played by Ryan Gosling)
visits Mia (played by Emma Stone) at her coffee

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.830
shop, Mia had been shown entering work wearing
black pants and carrying a yellow bag.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.780
But, when Mia leaves work, she is wearing
a blue skirt and holding a red bag.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.050
Over the next few cuts, Mia’s outfit continues
to change from skirt to pants.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.620
It’s a very small mistake and in a movie
that has the actors singing and dancing through

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.459
the stars, this little slip up likely goes
unnoticed.

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.060
Avengers: Age Of Ultron
The Avengers movies admittedly have a lot

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.010
on their plates with all of the characters
and storylines needing to intertwine in just

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.849
the right way to make sure everything in the
MCU makes sense.

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.909
It is understandable then, how some small
editing errors can slip past the filmmakers

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.860
and make it to the final cut.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.510
In Avengers Age Of Ultron’s big chase through
the streets of Seoul, Capt. America's shield

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.470
starts out with a few scratches and smudges
that are clearly visible.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.530
While his shield is strong, we don’t think
it has regenerative powers so it must be an

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.049
editing mistake that by the end of the chase,
Cap’s shield is magically spotless.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.110
Hell Or High Water
Hell Or High Water was one of the most criminally

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.509
underrated and under watched films from 2016
and hopefully it’s Best Picture nomination

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.599
will help convince more people to go see it.

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.650
If you do take the time to see this thrilling
piece of cinema, try to catch the editing

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.300
mistake from the start of the film.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.060
As Ben Foster and Chris Pine are driving off
after their first bank robbery, Foster is

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.629
shown taking off his right glove and putting
the hand back on the steering wheel.

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:35.400
But, in the next shot from outside the car,
his gloves have magically jumped back on his

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400
hands.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.249
This is a high intensity moment, so we are
guessing that viewers didn’t catch this

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:43.770
on the first watch, but that’s what we’re
here for!

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.650
Zootopia
Zootopia is a lot of a fun and did a great

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.210
job of introducing us to some hilarious characters
while also promoting a pretty meaningful message.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.830
One of the best characters in the film is
Yax, who is of course played by the notoriously

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.210
chill Tommy Chong.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.729
Unfortunately for Yax, he is the subject of
our latest movie mistake as he completely

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.430
messes up what he calls himself.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.789
Yax, who doesn't wear clothes, incorrectly
refers to himself and his fellow nudists as

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:13.430
"Naturalists", which actually means experts
or students of natural history.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.360
What he meant to say, was “Naturists”,
as in people who don’t wear any clothes.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.590
It’s unclear if this mistake was on purpose
or not, but either way, we spotted it!

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:57.860
Deadpool
In one scene 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.349
from Deadpool you can clearly see the Merc
with a mouth have his right hand chopped off.

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.330
The problem with this is that just a few moments
later, when Deadpool falls into the dumpsters,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.900
you can totally see his hand still attached.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.689
While some people could argue that this is
just Deadpool regenerative power working at

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.779
light speed, we think it’s far more likely
that this is just a case of discontinuity,

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.949
leaving us with a pretty funny movie mistake.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.219
Deadpool also has another editing mistake
hidden in it, but we can’t take credit for

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.259
finding this one.

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.080
Check out the video our friends at The Richest
Youtube channel just put out all about shocking

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.009
