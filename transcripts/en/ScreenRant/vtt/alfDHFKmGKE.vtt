00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.830
Cultural customs change from border to border,
and what’s okay in one place has the potential

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.450
to be devastating in another.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.770
Anime has spread across the globe, but because
of this, some people still aren’t sure what

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.900
to make of it.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.180
Since everyone seems to have an opinion about
what should (or shouldn’t) be on TV, audiences

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.770
have heard all sorts of different justifications
for limiting access to certain shows.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.960
Most of the reasons on this list are pretty
over-the-top, but just remember: they all

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.960
worked.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.360
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Famous ANIME Shows
Banned Around The World For Shocking Reasons.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.480
Attack on Titan
Known for their harsh stance on censorship

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.910
laws, apparently the Chinese legal system
takes childhood very seriously.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.760
At least, that was their official position
when they announced a ban on the popular Japanese

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.690
series Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin).

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.500
Citing that it was too violent, the censors
justified their decision by saying the young

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.280
audience would internalize the imagery, and
become delinquent.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.460
The same argument people used to make about
rock and roll.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.390
Censors cited the move as a public rejection
of vulgarity.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.240
But instead of safeguarding their morality,
the laws only encouraged fans to find other

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.480
ways of watching it.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.770
Excel Saga
Excel is the not the kind of employee you’d

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.360
want as a personal assistant, even though
she’s gung-ho about every assignment.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.219
When the creators of the Excel Saga were nearing
the end of their run on television, they decided

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:23.219
to go big.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.109
They wanted her last episode to be banned
from airing, and worked hard to include content

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:30.439
so offensive that it wouldn’t make it past
Japanese censors.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.700
And just in case, they also edited the episode
to be too long for their assigned timeslot.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.689
The self-sabotage paid off in a big way, and
they got what they wanted.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.159
The finale was never aired in Japan.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.869
After spending over twenty episodes with the
character, a lot of people were left high

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.579
and dry.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.539
Death Note
Who among us is without an enemy?

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.719
Who hasn’t fantasized about what it would
be like to wake up to the news that their

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.479
greatest foe has vanished?

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.420
If that sentiment is a little too dark for
you, stay away from Death Note.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.130
Revolving around a notebook with murderous
capabilities, the series was labeled as “objectionable”

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.740
by.. you guessed it.. the Chinese government!

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
The reason they gave for the ban was that
the content was too violent, but others argue

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.660
it’s the series’ anti-authority undertone
that makes the censors uncomfortable.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.680
People tried to get it banned in Albuquerque,
New Mexico too.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.730
But they were less successful.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.849
Kinnikuman
France is an artists paradise.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.909
With it’s rich culture and history of greats,
it seems like the ideal place for out of the

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.680
box ideas.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.540
Except when it comes to Nazis.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.930
In an attempt to write a character that was
a quote unquote “good nazi” the anime

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.349
series Kinnikuman got itself banned there.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.099
France has rock-hard hate speech laws that
inform what can and can’t be shown on television.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.709
So when the swastika-clad Brocken Jr. appeared
on screen, legislators tore the show apart.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.090
Less than half of the series’ episodes made
it to air, and the manga is banned outright.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.690
Transformers: Robots in Disguise
The devastating events of September 11th,

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.879
2001 have forever changed the way North American
audiences consume media.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.799
And since then, the World Trade Center’s
iconography has been treated with respectful

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.799
sensitivity.

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.500
Many writers have shied away from imagery
that conjures up memories from that day.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.780
And it’s for this reason that the debut
episode of 2001’s Transformers: Robots in

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.909
Disguise was pulled from circulation.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.019
The episode which had aired just three days
prior showed Optimus Prime crashing through

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.859
a towering skyscraper.

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.439
And given the social climate at the time,
the network no longer felt comfortable with

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.549
the episode, and ended up pulling it from
rotation.

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.010
Hetalia
Have you ever wondered what the countries

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.030
of the world would look like if they were
people?

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.439
Hetalia has the answer.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.630
Beginning as a web comic, the series gained
a massive following and was made into a T.V.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.630
show.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.670
Not all countries were excited to be personified.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.459
South Korea argued the character structure
reduced entire cultures to stereotypes.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.239
The show removed the character associated
with the country, but that wasn’t enough.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.470
Citizens were insulted that the program continued
to run on some networks, and a petition for

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.579
the local broadcasters to remove it entirely
circled the country.

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.930
One exec even alleges that station personnel
were receiving death threats because of it.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.790
The tactics worked, and the show was taken
off South Korean air.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.940
Blood-C
Like we mentioned earlier, the Chinese government

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.290
takes censorship very seriously.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.959
And in 2015, they named 38 anime and manga
titles as the latest batch of banned stories.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.860
While it took a little while for the full
list to be revealed, one series that was officially

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.700
named early on was Blood-C. The censors had
laundry list of complaints about the show,

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.700
so when it came time to justify their decision
they had more than a few reasons to fall back

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700
on.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.470
Too bloody, too graphic, or too violent- take
your pick.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.191
Again the censors screamed “think of the
children!” and, just like that, the entire

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:39.250
series disappeared.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.780
Osomatsu-san
In a lot of countries, parodies are passable

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.820
at best, and tasteless at worst.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.630
But for the most part, they’re allowed.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.970
A lot of artists accept that once their work
is out there in the world, there’s a chance

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.730
someone will want to make fun of it.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.950
But Japan is having none of that.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.570
Since Japanese law doesn’t contain any protections
for works of parody, anything created there

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.220
is subject to strict copyright restraints.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.850
And because of it’s satirical nature, Osomatsu-san,
aka Mr. Osomatsu, got into some big trouble

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.060
with the bureaucrats.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.320
The first episode, which contained nods to
Sailor Moon and Attack on Titan, has been

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.440
removed from streaming services.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.640
And reanimated for it’s home release.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.220
Kokomo no Jikan
How do you make most of the world’s population

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.220
uncomfortable?

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.340
Talk about sex!

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.470
And Kokomo no Jikan fits that description
in a big way.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.100
The story follows a 9 year-old student who
has sexual feelings toward her 23 year-old

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.100
teacher.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.320
We probably don’t need to explain why that’s
upsetting.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.470
But fans of the show are adamant that it’s
not that big of a deal, and that it’s actually

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.550
a deeply misunderstood dark comedy.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.380
They also point out that there are worse versions
of anime out there.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.720
Censors argue that, while that may be true,
Kokomo no Jikan still crosses the line.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.561
And debates have even started about if the
show should be labelled as child porn in the

00:05:51.561 --> 00:05:52.760
United States.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.810
Pokémon
Pokémon is a certified phenomenon with followers

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.810
worldwide.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.840
Boasting cards, toys, and video games to name
a few, there are tons of ways for fans to

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.930
engage with the pocket monsters.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.280
The recent smartphone release of Pokémon
Go shattered download records, proving that

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.550
decades after it’s creation, the franchise
is still going strong.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.970
But not everyone loves the adorable creatures.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.240
In 2001, Saudi Arabia banned all things related
to the series.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.120
After mistakenly interpreting what the word
“Pokemon” means, religious authorities

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.310
labeled it as Zionist propaganda.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.460
And argued that the central premise of the
game resembled a form of gambling, something

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.720
“good” kids are not supposed to do.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.280
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.660
Do you know of any other anime shows banned
around the world for interesting reasons?
