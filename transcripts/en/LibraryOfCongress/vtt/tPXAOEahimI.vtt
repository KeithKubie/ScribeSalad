Congress in Washington D.C.

to present Meredith Monk here

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.580
at the Library of Congress.

[ Applause ]

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.060
A joy to hear you particularly
here in our hall.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.450
Such a beautiful clarity.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.850
We talked a little bit
earlier today, very briefly,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.880
about the exhilarating and dizzying
course of the last year for you,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.930 position:56%
celebrating fifty years of composing

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.260
and performing the
residency that you --

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: I
started when I was two.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.980
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Two --

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.100
[ Laughter ]

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.800 position:56%
And your mother was a singer, right?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.100
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: Yes.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yea.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.370 position:56%
And most recently, of course,
receiving the National Medal of Arts

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.520
from President Obama, what has that
been like for you, the intensity

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.730
and the sheer number of events and
also, what's your trajectory now?

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.510
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: What
was before the trajectory?

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.810
I'm sorry.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.110
I missed it.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.410
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: What has
it been like for you?

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.340
You talked about just the feelings.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: Well, getting the
National Medal from President Obama,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.900
I'm still shaking from it.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.770
I'll never forget it in my lifetime
and a beautiful human being,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.280
and yea, I mean, really,
when they called me up,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.660
I was shaking for a few hours.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.620 position:56%
It's sort of beyond your-- you know,
you just do your work, basically.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.430
So you know, something
like that happens,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.230
it's kind of beyond your
dreams or, you know?

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.740
I mean, you are just step
by step doing your work.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.130
So it was a magical day.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.990
But the 50th year was really
interesting because, you know,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.800
it was a way for me to also
look back over many, many,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.890
many different aspects of my work.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.180
I was the Debs Composer
Residence at Carnegie Hall

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.910
and so we did six concerts,
different concerts,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.210 position:56%
at Carnegie Hall really
emphasizing the variety of the work.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.340
Like for about the last
15 years I've been trying

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.420
to work a little bit more
with instrumental ensembles

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.340 position:56%
like an orchestra or chamber groups,
mostly with voice, but you know,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.830
because that is my instrument.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.130
But I did try.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.280
I did a premiere piece for a very
wonderful ensemble called the ACJW,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.420
which is the Academy Carnegie
Juilliard Wild ensemble,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.250
and they get a stipend
for two years.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.320
It's young musicians who want
to play chamber music mostly,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.390
and they're very, very
fine, fine musicians.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.410
So I thought, you know,
bite the bullet.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.130
Don't put a voice in there.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.220
I mean that would be the way
I would feel more secure,

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.310
and why don't you just use the
seven instruments and so, you know,

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.330
the old days, is it my braid, is
it my-- you know the old days,

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.370
when we had these things and
that was a great experience,

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.550
and then I did my ensemble.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.130
The last concert was a real
beautiful potpourri of music from,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.430
for 50 years, and there was a one
four hour marathon where a bunch

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.160
of different musicians that I love
and that I know did their versions

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.180
of my music, which was very -- that
was very special including Leonardo

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.590
from Sonic Youth, and you
know, DJ Spooky, Missy Mazzoli.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.330
There were, you know, a
lot of different people.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.010
So that was very special.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.230
And then we also performed
On Behalf of Nature,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.560
which was my last large multimedia
music theater piece at BAM,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.180
and that does include movement and
light, and it has eight performers

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.210
in it and was basically about what
we're losing, in danger of losing.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.760
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I wish we
had the space for that here.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.820
Back to your chamber
music for a moment.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.120
Do you have any plans?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.650
We're in the business
of chamber music

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.790
so anything we should know about?

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.080
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: I have a piece in
mind but it probably would be more

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.740
for a chamber size orchestra,
maybe in voices and right now,

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.310
I'm working on a new
piece with Allison

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.820
and Katie called, Cellular Songs.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.370 position:56%
It's right now, three -- So far I've
done four little A Cappella pieces,

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.140
but it will grow from there.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.630
But I'm very interested.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.890
I've always used the
voice as an instrument,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.140
and now I've been really interested
in using the instruments as voices.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.660 position:56%
So I've learned a lot about that and
then it goes back into my ensemble

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.040
because the whole ensemble also
includes John Hollenbeck who's a

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.620
fantastic multi-percussionist,
and so some of the richness

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.040
of the instrumental writing that I
find with working with an orchestra

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.900
or something like that, I can put
it right back into the ensemble.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.630 position:56%
So I think it's grown in that way
and you know, when you're an artist,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.150
you just want to keep
growing and growing.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.480
That's basically my goal of
life is to hopefully be growing

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.940
until the day I die and be working.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.990
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I read a comment
from the critic, Tom Service,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.640
the British critic, saying
that he felt that you wanted

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.400
to give your listeners a vision
of concentration and attention

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.420
in an ever diminishing and be in
an increasing speed of the world

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.380
and diminishing attention circle.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.560
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: Yes because we
are definitely victims of weapons

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.160
of mass distraction, which
is what Gary Snyder said,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.530
and I think it's so true.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.590 position:56%
So I think that the live performance
is such a wonderful opportunity.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.300
First of all, we're all here in
the same space in the same time

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.010
and that's unusual and I feel
that we're losing sense of touch

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.890
and we're even losing the sense of
being able to look at each other

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.400
in the eyes and not
have the thumbs going.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.970
I always say, I think generations
from now, people are going

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.080
to have hands like
this and big thumbs.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.380
You know, no fingers.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.680
It's just going to be thumbs.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.030
So, you know, I feel like the live
performance we're very vulnerable

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.820
and that's unusual
also in the culture.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.470
It's not smoothed over in any way.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.770
We could fall.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.580
We could sing the wrong note.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.280
It's like a tight rope a little
bit and it's very important

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.010
to affirm our human sense of touch
and connection and I think that --

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.120
and then also the concentration
thing too.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.350
It's not -- it's just about
being able to let go of that part

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.420 position:56%
of your mind that's always
narrating your life, and now I think

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.310 position:56%
because of the devices of mass
distraction, we even have more irony

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.130
and quotation marks and brackets
and it just goes more and more.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.120
You know, so we're looking at this,
looking at this, looking at this,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.460
looking at this; how
about direct experience?

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.510
So I think that the live
performance has that possibility.

to open this up a little bit

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.260
and I believe we have
some microphones

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.710
that are already going around.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.400
It might be a little
hard to see you.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.970
Does anyone have a question?

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:00.750
I haven't done computer digital,
kind of that media at this point.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.940
But, I mean, now I'm
speaking through a microphone.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.860
You know, I go into
the recording studio

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.850
and they use a computer even though
-- you know, I've worked for ECM

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.910
and Manfred Eicher is cursing
the computer all the time.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:16.610
So I don't know.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.370
I mean, I guess my instinct has
been to go more towards the --

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:28.180
I feel like the voice can do
anything and that I guess I go more

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.540
and more, keep on doing this
acoustic kind of idea as much

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.390
as I can as a sort of anecdote
because there's plenty of that,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.410
you know, in the world but it's not
that I'm closed to the possibility.

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.520
If there was something where
it transcended itself somehow,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.950
you know, where it's
not what it's about

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.400

goes beyond in a way.

I mean I use film in my pieces and
you know, video, that kind of thing,

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:00.620 position:56%

know, computer web kind of idea yet.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.510

though at any point.

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.630
Yes, I mean, well, it's funny.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.140
I had a voice teacher and
I still study to this day,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.250 position:56%
but this voice teacher -- I remember
I was singing at Carnegie Hall,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.250
and I was doing some of
these songs from The Hill,

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.220
and I didn't have a microphone,
and you know it was so beautiful,

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.160
the voice in acoustic
space which I really love.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.240
And he, a voice teacher of all
things, you know, opera teacher

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.540
and everything, he said,
you should use a microphone

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.820
because then you get to hear
the little nuances and clicks

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:46.030
so you know -- or the little,
very subtle kinds of things.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.450
And so, I mean, we could easily, in
this beautiful room that has a lot

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.380
of grain to it, we could certainly
sing without a microphone,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.030 position:56%
but sometimes you don't want to push

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.650
because if you push past it
you don't get also the little,

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.030
tiny detail.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.660
So that's usually why
I use a microphone,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.000
but in a room that's very
live and a very small room,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.570
we would go without
a microphone easily.

so beautiful with the acoustics.

have a microphone with it.

of them, and he --

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.880
you know, one of the most wonderful
things about working with Bohdan is

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:13.120 position:56%
that he has this incredible range of
instruments and instrumental skills,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.210
and so when we're working
on something we try

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.690
to find what the best
sound would be for that.

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.290
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: You
are very welcome.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.910
I mean I was going to tell him to
come out but he may be downstairs.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.680
He could tell you.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.050
On Behalf of Nature we
use a tiny, little flute.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.620
At the very beginning, he
uses the contra base clarinet.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:39.040
He uses a base clarinet and a
regular B flat clarinet and I mean,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.860
all kinds of things in the piece.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.660
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Yes?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:50.730
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.530
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: Yes.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.640
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:58.100
It's very close to what you
have to do with a Jew's harp.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.150
With a Jew's harp, I change
the inside cavity of my mouth

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.110
to make the different
tones that you hear

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.760
over the fundamental Jew's harp.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.460
So basically, I'm keeping --
it's actually not so relaxed.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.110 position:56%
You have to keep that fundamental
and you close off some of the places

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:21.980
in here so that it isolates
that overtone so that midrange,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.280
you are not hearing so much.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.040
You are hearing the fundamental
and then by closing off,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.430
and actually it's coming
through here.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:32.430
You hear that overtone,
and actually, in some ways,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.310
you hear overtones
better with a men's voice

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.880
because you know sometimes we're
actually singing our fundamental

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.040
pretty high than our overtone, you
can't -- it's not human hearing.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.310
I was singing that
song pretty high today

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.010
and so I was getting a different
kind of overtone than I might

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:52.510
if I was singing a half a
tone lower or tone lower.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.550
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.350
Yes.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:13.050
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:17.010
Well, first of all, my mother
was a jingle singer on the radio.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.860
She was the original Muriel Cigar,

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.380
Blue Bonnet margarine,
Schaefer Beer.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.020
My grandfather was a base
baritone from Russia.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.790
And he came from the United
States and then sang in all kinds

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.840
of places, Carnegie
Hall, Brooklyn Academy.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.240
He would do concerts
with a contralto,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.540
base baritone and contralto.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:37.850
That's unusual.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.870
And then he opened
a music conservatory

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.890
up in Washington Heights.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:45.090
So that side of the family

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.460
and I heard my great
grandfather was a cantor in Russia

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.420
so that singing thing was something
that was very natural for me.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.740
Movement was quite hard
because I have strabismus,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.650
an eye thing where I can't fuse
two images and my mother heard

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:01.230
about Dalcroze Eurhythmics.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.290
So my earliest training was
in Dalcroze Eurhythmics,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.940
which is an integration of
the body, and you learn music

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:11.840
through the body, but I think I
learned my body through music,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.500
so but I was moving a lot
as a child dancing too.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.890 position:56%
So I have a combined background in
music and in dance and also theater.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:25.880
So I think that that's also
partially why when I had

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:30.080
that revelation at the piano
doing regular classical exercises

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.790
that I realized, the voice can
also be a nonverbal instrument.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.130
I think coming from a movement
background, I trusted that.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.820
I trusted that nonverbal
communication is very deep,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.600 position:56%
and at Sarel [assumed spelling]
Arts, I was in the voice department.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.880 position:56%
I studied classical singing leader,
opera workshop, and then when I came

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:54.840 position:56%
to New York, my pieces were more
gesture based; a little bit of voice

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.730
and very cinematic
kind of structures,

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.030
and I was missing singing.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.810
And so I just sat down at the
piano and started vocalizing,

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.560
and I had this revelation
and from that point on,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.340
my life really changed, and
the revelation also included

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.270
that within the voice could be male
and female, different landscapes,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.870
characters, ages, different
ways of producing sound.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.170
I felt that it was a very --

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.810
I instinctively felt that it was a
very deep and ancient instrument.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.420
It could delineate feelings
and shades of feelings

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.630
for which we don't have words.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:34.250
And it also, strangely enough, was
a way of coming back to my family

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.380
because being in a bunch
of singer family, you know,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:42.380 position:56%
a family with a bunch of singers,
it's kind of hard to find your spot.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.990
So and I had done a lot of
choreography at that point

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.790
and I had -- because of
my physical limitations,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:52.530
I had to find my own vocabulary
which was a blessing, you know,

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:58.050
that I found my own way of finding
movement so I knew how to work

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.130
so that when I had the
revelation with the voice,

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.490
I knew to go into the studio and
I knew how to work with my voice

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:07.890
and I had a more wide range,
you know, you could say,

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:11.170
virtuosic instrument as a singer.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.990
So it was like I came home
when I had that revelation

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.490
and it's been all these years
thinking of the voice and the body

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:24.760
as one, because I think that our
singing style is very kinetic.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.980
And then like Katie didn't
come from a movement background

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.010
but she's a wonderful
mover so you know, it's --

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.390
we come from different
backgrounds with the ensemble.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.890
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Maybe just
one or two more questions.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.020
Maybe here.

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of interest

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.130
in the way you produce different
sounds, but I was curious

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.860
about one aspect of it as
to learning how to do that

00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.110 position:56%
or spending time alone in New Mexico
or wherever, your way you do that,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:06.170
about the evolution of your ability
to make this a different sound.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:11.730
How does that work for you and are
you able to hear yourself working

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:17.390
or do you have to take that
out and teach yourself?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.690
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: It's
very interesting.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.800
Oh, well there's actually two or
three different questions in there.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.800
One is the listening, which is --

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.090 position:56%
I mean in a way, the older I get the
more I realize that I actually live

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:34.260 position:56%
through my ears and I've just been
more and more just enjoying sitting,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.910
especially when I'm in New Mexico

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.870
because I don't have traffic
and everything going by.

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.570
Sometimes I just sit like
I feel like I'm like a dog.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:42.870
I'm like --

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.170
[ Laughter ]

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.400
You know how dogs just sit there?

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:53.490 position:56%
And I just listen and you know, I've
always been more a doer than a be-er

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.270
so I'm learning how to be.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.820
I also have meditation practice,
which is helping me learn how to be

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.730
but I just sit there and
listen and I'm just so stunned

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:08.350
by the cosmic conductor, you know,
in nature, how sounds come and go,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.100
and I guess I've always
felt very close to that.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.330
And then as far as hearing
myself, I mean I do hear myself.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:18.590
I don't have to go outside to teach
it to someone else and hear it.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.270
I do tape myself, you know,
or notate what I'm doing.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.210
But it's a funny question that
you would ask because I think

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:30.960 position:56%
at certain times in all of our lives
as singers, there's a certain point

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.390
where you have to kind of
relearn that coordination

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.640
of hearing yourself in
relation to what's around you.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.710
You know, sometimes you
lose that coordination

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.910 position:56%
so you are either not hearing what's
around you enough or you are hearing

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.790
or you are not hearing yourself
enough so really the, you know,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:54.900 position:56%
staying in tune and everything is
doing both simultaneously; listening

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.380
and being able to hear yourself.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.430
So sometimes, I give in my
workshop like an exercise

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.730
like that where you are singing.

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.300
It's like the big group of
people and you choose a tone

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.600
and everybody chooses a tone.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.150
At the same time, you are
listening to the whole thing,

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:12.870
and you choose somebody else's
tone when you finish yours

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.980 position:56%
so that it keeps on shifting, you
know it's kind of like a big cluster

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.190 position:56%
that keeps on shifting and so that's
that thing of being able to --

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:25.460
and also when you sing with groups,
like say choral pieces or something

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.290
like that or groups, I always
say if you only hear yourself,

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:31.440
you are singing too loud because
one of the most wonderful things

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.360
about singing with other people
is hearing the other people.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.910
That's a pleasure of it.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.210
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.510
&gt;&gt; Meredith Monk: Wonderful
question, thank you.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:40.810 position:56%

might be it for the evening.
