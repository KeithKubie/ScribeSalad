00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.580
Ever since its debut in 1977, the Star Wars
franchise has been a staple of pop culture.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.480
So many of its characters and aspects have
become so well-known around the world, that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.390
even those who haven’t seen the films are
aware of Han Solo and the Force.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
But did you know there are some details even
the biggest fans might not know about their

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
favorite films?

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.320
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Hidden Star Wars
Facts You Didn’t Know

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.530
Spielberg Can’t Direct

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.120
When planning Return of the Jedi, Lucas’
first choice for director was his good friend

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680
Steven Spielberg, who was coming off the hits
Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.540
However, Spielberg could not accept the job,
since Lucas had dropped out of the Director’s

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.440
Guild following controversy over Star Wars’
famous opening text crawl.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.500
With few options available, Lucas had to go
with the non-union choice of Richard Marquand.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.320
Thankfully Marquand worked out, and Return
of the Jedi offered a rousing finale to the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.320
trilogy.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.379
Still, it’s hard not to think what might
have been if Spielberg in his prime directed

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.730
a Star Wars flick.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.579
Liam Neeson’s Poor Judgment

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.520
The Phantom Menace is seen as one of the most
disappointing films ever, but even its detractors

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.430
enjoyed Liam Neeson’s performance as Jedi
Master Qui-Gon Jinn.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.030
However, if it were not for a lapse in judgment,
we may have missed that memorable aspect.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.530
When offered the part, Neeson accepted it…
without reading a word of George Lucas’

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.700
maligned script.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.030
Being in a Star Wars movie is something many
would sign up for, but Neeson may have thought

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.250
differently if he had seen the story Lucas
had in mind, which infamously sent the series

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.299
down a dark path that it still hasn’t fully
recovered from.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.650
Yoda Speaks the Truth

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.799
Even James Earl Jones couldn’t believe that
Darth Vader was Luke’s father, as the twist

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.450
sent shockwaves around the world.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.500
It was such a surprise, that Lucas had to
include a scene in Return of the Jedi where

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.970
Yoda informed Luke he really was Vader’s
son.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.570
That’s because a child psychologist told
Lucas that kids watching the film would dismiss

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740
Vader’s revelation as a lie unless it was
unequivocally sated as fact.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.130
Since Yoda was one of the franchise’s heroes
and perceived as an honest being, it was determined

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.690
this was the best way to go.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.700
There clearly was no misdirection happening
here.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700
Ford Takes Two

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.430
After the original Star Wars became a hit,
stars Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher quickly

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.160
signed on for two sequels.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.060
But Harrison Ford did not.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.310
Thinking that Han Solo’s story had been
told in full, the actor was unwilling to commit

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.319
to multiple films.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.030
That was one of the influencing factors in
setting up the famous carbonite sequence in

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.590
The Empire Strikes Back, as everyone was unsure
Ford would come back for the third film.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.660
Luckily, Lucas convinced him to return, and
Han had a heroic conclusion to his arc and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.750
still has a part to play in the future.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.680
Lando’s a Clone?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.670
Fans would have to wait until 2002 to get
a taste of the Clone Wars teased in the original

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.090
film, and Lucas’ idea for that conflict
clearly evolved over time.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.599
The initial concept for Han’s buddy Lando
was that Lando was a clone that fought in

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.150
the War, leading a legion of them to a settlement
when the fighting was over.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.460
Admittedly, that would have been an interesting
angle to explore, but having Lando be a one-of-a-kind

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.250
smooth talking scoundrel was for the best
and set up a stronger character arc.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.160
It’s hard to go wrong with Billy Dee Williams.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.209
Luke Becomes Vader

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.720
Despite the Emperor’s best attempts, Luke
never turns to the Dark Side of the Force

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.740
and remains a hero until the very end.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.269
But Lucas toyed with the idea of having the
hero become bad.

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.000
In the early stages, Return of the Jedi was
going to end with Luke putting on Vader’s

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.989
helmet and saying, “Now I am Vader.”

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.550
It would have been a moment out of left field
and completely ruin the entire story of the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.550
trilogy.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.520
Thankfully, this was never a change Lucas
made to the originals.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.060
Seeing Luke have one touching moment with
his father was much more emotional and satisfying

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.360
for viewers.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.069
Star Wars: Flop of the Century

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.790
After completing a rough cut of the first
film, Lucas showed it to a few of his director

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.780
friends, and many were unimpressed with the
results.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.340
Playing into Lucas’ worst fears about the
project, the likes of Brian de Palma and others

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.129
called it the “worst movie ever made”
and did not express much hope for it.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.550
The only one who proved to be prophetic was
Steven Spielberg, who believed from the beginning

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.099
that Star Wars had what it took to be a major
success.

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.670
He may have just been trying to make his friend
feel better, but Spielberg seemed to know

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.610
what he was talking about.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.470
A Disturbance in the Force

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.850
George Lucas created Star Wars, but producer
Gary Kurtz was just as instrumental.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.470
When he left the franchise before Return of
the Jedi, it upset many of the cast and crew

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.630
– and sent the series down a different path.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.549
Lucas and Kurtz disagreed over why people
loved Star Wars.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.530
Lucas thought it was the spectacle and put
more of an onus on special effects and commercialization.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.160
Kurtz fought for poignant stories that resonated.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.000
As we could later see in the response to the
prequel trilogy, many of the Star Wars fans

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.050
would have sided with Kurtz.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.300
It’s too bad he didn’t stay on.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.669
The First Film is Fourth?

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.650
When Star Wars was first released, it was
just Star Wars.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.840
Its sequel started the trend of subtitled
“episodes,” and The Empire Strikes Back

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.120
was called “Episode 5.”

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.090
To make things more consistent, Lucas re-released
the original movie with the addition “Episode

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.850
4 – A New Hope.”

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.020
However, he did not have the prequel trilogy
planned at the time, and Fox executives tried

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.960
to discourage him from it to avoid confusing
moviegoers familiar with Roman numerals.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.740
He eventually went back and completed the
story, but for a while it had to be odd to

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.860
many that the first, second, and third films
were really fourth, fifth, and sixth.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.150
What’s My Name?

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.350
Boba Fett.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.350
Palpatine.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.350
Ewoks.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.720
These names are iconic as part of Star Wars
lore, but how did they get that way?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.790
Unlike Luke, Han, and Vader, the names are
hardly spoken in the original trilogy – if

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.790
at all.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.560
Boba is referred to as “the bounty hunter”
throughout Empire Strikes Back until Han utters

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.500
his name before he falls into the Sarlacc
Pit, and nobody says “Palpatine” or “Ewok”

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.500
in Return of the Jedi.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.710
It’s a testament to Star Wars merchandise
that these figures are known by their full

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.810
names and not just what’s said in the films.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.979
It’s hard to imagine them standing out if
they were known only by generic terms and

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.900
not something unique to them.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.210
Those were our picks for Star Wars Hidden
Facts, were there any we missed?
