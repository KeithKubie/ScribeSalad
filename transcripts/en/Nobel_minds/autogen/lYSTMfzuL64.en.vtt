00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.869
 
hi we are students from st. Louis high

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879
hi we are students from st. Louis high
 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.120
hi we are students from st. Louis high
school in Belmar New Jersey we would

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
school in Belmar New Jersey we would
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.709
school in Belmar New Jersey we would
like to ask you a question so the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
like to ask you a question so the
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.480
like to ask you a question so the
question from the students in st. Rose

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
question from the students in st. Rose
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340
question from the students in st. Rose
school in New Jersey is will the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
school in New Jersey is will the
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.109
school in New Jersey is will the
universe expand forever or will it

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119
universe expand forever or will it
 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.810
universe expand forever or will it
collapse well we think that if it

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
collapse well we think that if it
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.340
collapse well we think that if it
continues to do what it is doing now

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350
continues to do what it is doing now
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.890
continues to do what it is doing now
that it will expand forever because not

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
that it will expand forever because not
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.720
that it will expand forever because not
only is it expanding it's accelerating

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
only is it expanding it's accelerating
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450
only is it expanding it's accelerating
and going faster and faster all the time

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
and going faster and faster all the time
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.040
and going faster and faster all the time
on the other hand since we don't know

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
on the other hand since we don't know
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200
on the other hand since we don't know
why it's doing that we also can't say

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210
why it's doing that we also can't say
 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.340
why it's doing that we also can't say
that we're sure that it's going to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
that we're sure that it's going to
 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.740
that we're sure that it's going to
always do it so other people have a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
always do it so other people have a
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200
always do it so other people have a
theory that says well this is something

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
theory that says well this is something
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.470
theory that says well this is something
called membranes coming close together

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
called membranes coming close together
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.750
called membranes coming close together
in a higher dimensional space and that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
in a higher dimensional space and that
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.190
in a higher dimensional space and that
they can go apart and then come together

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
they can go apart and then come together
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.709
they can go apart and then come together
so if that were to happen then yes

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
so if that were to happen then yes
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.860
so if that were to happen then yes
indeed the universe could collapse again

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870
indeed the universe could collapse again
 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.180
indeed the universe could collapse again
maybe has been doing this over and over

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
maybe has been doing this over and over
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.479
maybe has been doing this over and over
so I think it's too long a time for us

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
so I think it's too long a time for us
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.220
so I think it's too long a time for us
to ever find out by direct measurement

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
to ever find out by direct measurement
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.349
to ever find out by direct measurement
because the universe has been expanding

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
because the universe has been expanding
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900
because the universe has been expanding
for many billions of years and we've

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
for many billions of years and we've
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359
for many billions of years and we've
only been here for a short time so we

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
only been here for a short time so we
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980
only been here for a short time so we
have to wait too long to find out the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
have to wait too long to find out the
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.400
have to wait too long to find out the
answer to your question I'm sorry
