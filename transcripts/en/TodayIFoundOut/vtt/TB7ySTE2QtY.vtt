00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.080
Anyone who’s ever witnessed a poker run
knows that Harley-Davidson motorcycles are

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.020
really, really loud.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.160
And since not everyone thinks that’s a good
thing, in recent years, there have been efforts

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.410
to stifle them.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.230
Straight off the line today, Harley exhaust
systems can emit noise as high as 80 decibels

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.119
(dBs), give or take depending on the model.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.860
For reference, a typical car when idling emits
noise at about 35-45 dB and in the high 50s

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.970
to low 60s decibel levels at freeway speeds.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.900
Even something like a 2008 Ford F-450 truck
only gets as loud as 51 dB when idling and

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.510
68 dB when traveling at 65 mph.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.420
And while you might think 68 dB isn’t that
far off 80 dB, it’s important to understand

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.870
that the decibel system is logarithmic- in
this case, an increase in 10 dB means that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.650
this sound level is ten times more powerful.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.260
So, for instance, 80 dB would be ten times
more sound pressure than 70 dB.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.000
For further reference, when you’re talking
with someone in a normal speaking voice, you’re

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.430
usually talking at about 60 dB and a lawnmower
is usually around 90 dB while a typical military

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.210
jet engine averages about 120 dB.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.610
Needless to say, apart from older models of
Harleys that could sometimes reach as high

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.200
as 90-100 dB stock, even today’s 80 dB is
still really loud.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.420
This is far in excess of many cities’ noise
ordinances, particularly for residential areas,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.479
although it complies with EPA regulations
for street level noise.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.090
So why do they make Harleys so loud?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.810
For starters, it’s difficult to attain the
level of quietness one sees in a passenger

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.159
car in a motorcycle due to little room for
bulky mufflers on the bike.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.700
That said, loud, powerful sounding engines
have become a signature of this particular

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.729
brand of motorcycle, leading to the real problem-
many who buy Harleys are not satisfied with

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.379
the legally regulated stock noise of the engine
and instead choose to swap out the existing

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.840
exhaust systems for straight pipes that don’t
really mute the engine noise at all.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.129
This results in sound that can exceed 100
decibels when revved up.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.409
This is extraordinarily loud, and could even
do damage to human hearing.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.829
At just 94 decibels (dB) only one hour of
exposure can damage your hearing, while at

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.939
100 dB, a mere 15 minutes of exposure will
do the trick.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.719
Needless to say, the Harley aficionados who
make these modifications and don’t wear

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:47.159
proper hearing protection while riding pay
a long-term, ear-ringing price for making

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.799
their engines sound more powerful.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.489
Given this sort of extreme noise pollution,
there has been a backlash against noisy bikes

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.500
in recent years, with many local communities
placing restrictions specifically on motorcycle

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.349
noise, and others banning them altogether.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.099
One such effort is EPA stamp enforcement.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.120
Motorcycles are supposed to display EPA stamps
on their chassis and exhaust systems that

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.920
match each other to ensure the system hasn’t
been modified.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.669
While previously enforcement has been lax,
more recently communities are mandating compliance,

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:29.959
including Denver, CO (2007), Boston, MA (2009),
Arvada, CO (2009), Portland, ME (2009), Green

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.549
Bay, WI (2009) and the State of California
(2010)

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.379
So strong is the outcry that the President
and COO of Harley-Davidson, Jim McCaslin,

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.799
posted a message on the company’s website
in 2009 imploring bikers to not modify their

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.769
bikes to make them louder.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.269
While loud, powerful sounding engines on Harleys
in the past have been something of a selling

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.260
point, McCaslin noted the backlash over the
noise today is beginning to cause problems.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.629
He further implied that unless bikers piped
down, regulations and laws would continue

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.059
to be put in place until Harley-Davidson could
no longer sell its loud motorcycles and the

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:12.579
bikes already on the road might ultimately
be banned completely.

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:18.370
McCaslin also directly addressed the custom
of modifying the exhaust to get more power:

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.340
Testing has proven that straight pipes do
not necessary outperform pipes with lower

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.560
noise levels.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.449
Pick the wrong pipes and you can severely
reduce your horsepower and/or your torque.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.389
And while you’re doing it, you’ll awaken
the sleeping giant of social concern that

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.680
lives next door to all of us.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.460
Harley-Davidson has also taken steps to eliminate
the modifications by no longer shipping racing

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.229
exhaust systems that can work on street models
to dealers.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.259
Beyond the argument over increasing power,
enthusiasts in favor of loud exhaust systems

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.210
often claim that their “loud pipes save
lives,” meaning that because they can be

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.650
heard, drivers of cars and trucks are alerted
to their presence and won’t hit them.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.020
While certainly anyone who’s driven a motorcycle
around much is well aware of the fact that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.450
many larger passenger vehicles simply don’t
notice the motorcycles in their blind spots

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:14.720
and the like, antagonists note, however, that
the majority of fatal crashes involving motorcycles

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.689
were caused by the motorcycle rider, at least
according to a 2007 report by the National

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:22.830
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.409
In the report, it was noted that 45% of fatal
motorcycle crashes are single vehicle (meaning

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:36.139
the motorcycle, alone), and that among the
remaining 55%, in nearly 75% of the two-vehicle

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.729
crashes, the motorcyclist was deemed responsible.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.169
That said, the classification of single vehicle
crashes that accounts for 45% of all fatal

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.449
motorcycle crashes does include “run-off-road
collisions.”

00:05:48.449 --> 00:06:02.319
The debate rages on.
