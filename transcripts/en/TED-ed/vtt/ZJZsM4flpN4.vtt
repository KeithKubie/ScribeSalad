00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.353
I know, insects, it's really weird,

00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:19.835
but bear with me.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.848
Now, I am an entomologist.

00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:23.145
I confess to that.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.098
And, when I look at the planet,

00:00:25.122 --> 00:00:26.551
the reason I'm an entomologist

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.539
is because out of the 1.9 million species

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.511
that are described on planet Earth,

00:00:33.535 --> 00:00:36.345
over 1 million of them are insects.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.538
And I truly believe as a scientist today

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:40.435
we live in the best of times

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:42.499
because here we are enjoying TED,

00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:43.296
and Facebook,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.379
and YouTube,

00:00:44.403 --> 00:00:45.718
and this wonderful theater,

00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:46.602
healthcare,

00:00:46.626 --> 00:00:48.400
longer life spans.

00:00:48.424 --> 00:00:50.791
But we also live in the worst of times

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.491
because we are on a planet
with 7 billion people

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:54.614
with a lot of problems.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:57.055
And for those of us
who look at biodiversity,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.537
it's a heart-wrenching
and wonderful time all together

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.563
because we see the links
between nature and people,

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:06.292
and we're losing them at the same time.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:11.005
Both honeybees and humans
originate in East Africa.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:14.376
And, here in Kenya, a wonderful
relationship exists

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.960
where a bird called
a honeyguide, up there,

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:20.461
has this interesting phenomenon

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:22.326
where it actually leads either humans,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.208
which it's done for thousands of years,

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:27.322
77,000 year old paintings from Tanzania,

00:01:27.346 --> 00:01:28.420
and the honey badger

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:30.459
to the wild honeybee colony.

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:32.968
Now, for a long time
we thought this relationship

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.446
first evolved between the honeyguide

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.756
and the honey badger.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.733
But it turns out that it actually evolved

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:41.307
between the human and the honeyguide,

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.327
and the badger's a parasite.

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.387
Now, when we look at bees,

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:48.630
there is this amazing diversity out there,

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:50.527
20,000 species.

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:54.024
And one in three bites of food that we eat

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.437
is thanks to an insect pollinator.

00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:58.128
So one of the things I'm working on

00:01:58.152 --> 00:01:59.741
is looking at those links

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.276
between nature and sustainable human life.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.443
And here are just
a few of the beautiful bees

00:02:05.467 --> 00:02:06.895
that we have in Kenya,

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:09.249
in fact, not far from Nairobi.

00:02:09.273 --> 00:02:12.901
Now, how many of you like coffee?

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.896
Yeah, I actually can't drink it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.577
because if I do, my hands shake,

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:21.257
and I can't pick up ants and bees.

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.683
Chocolate?

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.220
I love chocolate, the darker the better,

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:27.530
so I really like chocolate.

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:30.725
Now the thing is,
without insect pollinators,

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:32.321
there would be very little coffee

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.188
and no chocolate on the planet.

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:35.388
Could you imagine that?

00:02:35.412 --> 00:02:37.330
That's really scary!

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:40.985
Now, I want to show you

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:42.823
out of thousands of examples

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:44.562
that I could have brought here today

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:47.245
to show you how insects
are connected to your life,

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.370
to every single human being on the planet.

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:52.665
Here are two colleagues and friends.

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.139
Domina is a farmer in Mwanza

00:02:56.163 --> 00:02:58.421
in western Tanzania,

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.830
and Peter is from the Kerio Valley

00:03:01.854 --> 00:03:03.799
in northwestern Kenya.

00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:06.175
Now, Domina grows pigeon feed, cow feed,

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.355
a whole wide range of legumes.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:09.896
And she feeds her family,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.847
she survives in a very remote area

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:13.690
based off of these amazing crops,

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.342
legumes, a lot of traditional vegetables,

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:17.027
and all of them are pollinated

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:19.031
by these different wild bee species.

00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:23.788
Now, Peter grows five varieties
of mango on his farm,

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:26.368
and he actually paid for his education

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:28.422
by growing and selling mangoes.

00:03:28.446 --> 00:03:29.968
And I really like mangoes

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:32.612
and so it's really a great
pleasure working on the farm

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:34.724
with five different varieties of mango.

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:39.637
And if you look at all these
different fruits and crops here,

00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.005
one thing that connects us to biodiversity

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.636
and one thing we do as a scientist,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.844
we write papers.

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:48.254
We do research, and we write papers.

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:49.593
Nobody ever reads them,

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.159
but here's one of my papers.

00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:52.487
It's on the African violet.

00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:54.614
This is in the U.S.

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:57.261
This florist sells
about 10,000 dollars worth

00:03:57.285 --> 00:03:58.534
of violets a year.

00:03:58.558 --> 00:04:00.862
It's worth about 6
billion dollars in trade.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:02.568
It originates in East Africa,

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:04.354
and we never knew what pollinated it.

00:04:04.378 --> 00:04:06.042
Well, I went off and studied this.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.759
One thing to say about pollinators

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:11.253
is it comes done to being about sex.

00:04:11.277 --> 00:04:13.403
And how many of you like sex?

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:16.548
Where are we, the Vatican?

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.841
So what happens when insects
help plants have sex

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.386
is there's really good sex.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.220
This is an example of really good sex.

00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:32.039
So basically the bee comes along,

00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:33.467
it vibrates the flower

00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.850
at a specific frequency, 11 to 12 hertz,

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:36.658
pollen is released,

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:38.390
and the plant survives in the wild.

00:04:38.414 --> 00:04:40.912
This is one of the world's most endangered
plants.

00:04:40.936 --> 00:04:43.608
We go up into the deserts
of northern Kenya,

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:44.662
which are now very famous

00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:46.858
because of the discovery of oil.

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:49.776
But I will tell you
a little different story.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.613
These animals, the camel,

00:04:51.637 --> 00:04:55.431
which allow life in this
very remote community,

00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:58.474
are browsing off of a shrub
called indigofera,

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:01.636
and indigofera is 100%
dependent on bee pollination.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.322
So all these wild bees
produce the indigofera,

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.162
which the camels and goats eat.

00:05:06.186 --> 00:05:08.714
And we look at a community like this,

00:05:08.738 --> 00:05:10.324
Nalaray, northern Samburu,

00:05:10.348 --> 00:05:12.158
and people will look at these children

00:05:12.182 --> 00:05:13.634
and say they are poor.

00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:14.632
And I disagree

00:05:14.656 --> 00:05:17.989
because over lunch we collected
30 different bee species

00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:20.353
in the Acacia where they had their lunch

00:05:20.377 --> 00:05:24.295
and 400 pollinator species
in the Acacia tortilis

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.439
where their classroom is located.

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:30.108
So I want to leave you
with a radical piece of technology

00:05:30.132 --> 00:05:31.371
called the bee hotel

00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:33.538
that you can innovate
and build for yourself.

00:05:33.562 --> 00:05:36.304
Create a habitat where
bees can nest and live

00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:37.413
in your own backyard.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:40.080
But more importantly, please create space

00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:42.244
in your hearts for insects.

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:45.357
Spend five minutes a day
with them if you can.

00:05:56.217 --> 00:05:59.147
And I believe that if the one lesson

00:05:59.171 --> 00:06:00.488
we can learn from insects

00:06:00.512 --> 00:06:03.572
is that meek shall inherit the Earth.
