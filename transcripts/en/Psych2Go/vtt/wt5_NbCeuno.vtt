00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.260
In

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.940
This loud and fast-paced world many introverts find themselves drowned out overwhelmed or stomped on by society

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.210
Here are eight reasons to look for an introvert as a life partner

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.560
Number one introverts are self-sufficient

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.709
The first thing you need to know is that introverts do not need you they do not need relationships

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.500
And they don't need others. No they don't need them

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:43.209
They want them so if an introvert chooses you they want you to want someone is so much more powerful than to need them

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.190
needing someone means that once that need is met the person is no longer necessary to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.630
Want someone however means that there's a conscious effort to keep that person in your life?

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.529
Number two introverts are loyal

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.990
Once you're an introvert person you're their person period that's it end of story

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.689
They won't play games or flirt with others

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.239
They won't cheat on you and won't treat you like you're nothing to them because truthfully you're worth it all to them

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.080
number three introverts are great listeners

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.498
Introverts know what it's like to be ignored and overlooked so when you talk to them you will have their full attention

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.209
For you to want to talk to them whether to know their opinions or not means the world

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.469
If they reply they will have given the response a lot of thought they won't take your discussion lightly and you may soon find that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.259
They know much more about you than you do about them

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.579
Number four introverts have a talent for empathy because most of their attention resides in their heads

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.019
Introverts find themselves able to connect at a deeper level quite easier than most

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:53.979
They can read others easily especially if they know you well and will feel your emotions as if they're their own without having to try

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.949
They won't respond with judgment. They'll respond with understanding because they know what it's like to be misunderstood

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.309
Number five introverts are authentic in today's world introversion is usually seen as an act of rebellion by others

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.999
Introverts know who they are and aren't afraid to fight for it. They won't change to please others in their eyes

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It would only be a lie and an insult to you and themselves

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.220
Never try to give an introvert what you think they want to hear what they want to hear is the truth?

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.899
Number six introverts understand self-love

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.619
Introverts tend to spend a lot of time mingling with their own Souls which is why they'll encourage you to do the same

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.850
When they see your true self they'll treasure it more thoroughly than anyone before

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.020
For they know what it's like to have to learn to love yourselves much less another

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.369
Number seven introverts can be really creative

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:57.670
introverts spend so much time in their own heads that they develop their own unique worldviews not all introverts will have the same worldview and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.410
Usually they express them through art music literature or all of the above

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.518
They'd rather express themselves creatively and passionately than converse so prepare to be shocked at the things they can do

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.660
number eight introverts can be mysterious

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.979
This will be the hardest to deal with and falling in love with an introvert

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.299
More than likely you will always feel like they know you better than you know them

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.359
Introverts tend to keep parts of themselves hidden because emotional vulnerability is one of their greatest enemies

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.679
But for some reason you'll probably find this mystery to be alluring

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.970
Introverts are quite valuable quite unusual

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.970
And they rarely get the chance to shine

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.249
Maybe if you look around you'll see one lounging in the background watching quietly with a smile on their face

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.009
Don't go up and try to force yourself on them

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:55.809
Just catch their eye across the room smile if they return it and linger on you come on over if they just continued glancing around

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.010
Don't worry. It's not personal

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.110
They've just got about fifty tabs open in their heads who knows if you put in the time you could become one that's frequently visited

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.019
