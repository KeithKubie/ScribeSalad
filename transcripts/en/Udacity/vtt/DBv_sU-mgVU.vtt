00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.230
Throughout this course,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.480
you're going to need to test
your site on different devices.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.470
So, pull out your credit card and

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.735
get ready to order all of these
devices that you see behind you.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:14.305
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Pete, I, I don't think
we can ask everybody to do that.

00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:15.145
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:18.865
Instead, you could just use
a simulator or emulators.

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:21.425
Simulators and
emulators are great tools.

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:25.035
While they're not always 100% accurate,
because they're on different hardware

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:28.745
and sometimes have a different code
path, they'll often get the job done.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.445
And for this course, we'll be just fine.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.930
In this course, Cam and I are going to
use an emulator built into Chrome, but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.530
be sure to check out some of the other
ones including the iOS simulator, and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.640
some of the cloud based services
in the instructor notes.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.280
&gt;&gt; Nice, I like that a lot more,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.170
emulation is definitely
the much cheaper solution.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.340
&gt;&gt; It is,
here lemme show you how it works.
