00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.520
 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.560
What I want to do in this
video is talk about continuity.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.950
And continuity of a
function is something

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.490
that is pretty easy to
recognize when you see it.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.569
But we'll also talk about how we
can more rigorously define it.

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.860
So when I talk about it being
pretty easy to recognize,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.920
let me draw some functions here.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.300
So let's say this is the
y-axis, that is the x-axis.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.310
And if I were to
draw a function,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.540
let's say f of x looks
like something like this.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.465
 

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.840
And I would say
over the interval

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.631
that I've drawn it, so
it looks like from x

00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:40.320
is equal to 0, to maybe
that point right over there,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.624
is this function continuous?

00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:43.790
Well you'd say no, it isn't.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.748
Look, we're over here,
we see the function just

00:00:45.748 --> 00:00:48.420
jumps all of a sudden, from
this point to this point

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.860
right over here.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.140
This is not continuous.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.650
And you might even say
we have a discontinuity

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.460
at this value of
x, right over here.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.635
We would call this
a discontinuity.

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:04.260
And actually this
type of discontinuity

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.551
is called a jump discontinuity.

00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:08.554
 

00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.220
So you would say this
is not continuous.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.080
It's obvious that these
two things do not connect.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.010
They don't touch each other.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.420
Similarly, if you were to
look at a function that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.910
looked like-- let me draw
another one-- y and x.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.590
And let's say the function
looks something like this.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.815
Maybe right over here,
looks like this, and then

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:32.930
the function is defined to be
this point right over there.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.420
Is the function continuous
over the interval

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.219
that I've depicted
right over here?

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.010
And you would immediately
say no, it isn't.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.740
Because right over
at this point,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.272
the function goes up to
this point, just like this.

00:01:44.272 --> 00:01:52.060
And this kind of discontinuity--
this is the discontinuity--

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.900
is called a removable
discontinuity.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.656
Removable.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.780
One could make a reasonable
argument that this also

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.500
looks like a jump,
but this is typically

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.190
categorized as a
removable discontinuity.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.550
Because if you just
re-define the function

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.070
so it wasn't up here, but
it was right over here,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.750
then the function is continuous.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.190
So you can kind of
remove the discontinuity.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.210
And then finally, if I were
to draw another function-- so

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.040
let me draw another one
right over here-- x, y.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.790
And ask you, is this one
continuous over the interval

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.010
that I've depicted?

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.780
And you would say, well, look.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.488
Yeah, it looks all
connected all the way.

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:31.210
There aren't any
jumps over here.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.020
No removable
discontinuities over here.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.590
This one looks continuous.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.860
And you would be right.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.980
So that's the general
sense of continuity.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.110
And you can kind of
spot it when you see it.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.620
But let's think about a more
rigorous definition of one.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.220
And since we already have a
rigorous definition of limits,

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.930
the epsilon delta
definition, gives us

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.500
a rigorous definition
for limits.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.600
It's a definition for limits.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.710
So we can prove
when a limit exists,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.530
and what the value
of that limit is.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.390
Let's use that to create
a rigorous definition

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.580
of continuity.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.810
So let's think about a function
over some type of an interval.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.300
So let's say that we have-- so
let me draw another function.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.540
Let me draw some
type of a function.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.570
And then we'll see whether
our more rigorous definition

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.610
of continuity
passes muster, when

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.020
we look at all of
these things up here.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.470
So let me draw an
interval right over here.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.513
So it's between that x
value and that x value.

00:03:36.513 --> 00:03:38.830
This is the x-axis,
this is the y-axis.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.975
And let me draw my function
over that interval.

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.770
Over that interval it
looks something like this.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.520
So we say that a
function is continuous

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.047
at an interior point.

00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:50.630
So an interior point
is a point that's

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.420
not at the edge of my boundary.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.712
So this is an interior
point for my interval.

00:03:57.712 --> 00:03:59.670
This would be an end
point, and this would also

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.640
be an end point.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.660
We'd say it's continuous
at an interior point.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.830
So continuous at interior
point, interior to my interval,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.930
means that the limit as,
let's say at interior point c,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.769
so this is the point
x is equal to c.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.280
We can say that it's continuous
at the interior point

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.535
c if the limit of
our function-- this

00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:27.910
is our function
right over here--

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.550
if the limit of our
function as x approaches c

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.690
is equal to the value
of our function.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.480
Now does this make sense?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.400
Well, what we're saying
is, is at that point,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.600
well this is f of
c right over there.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.570
And the limit as
we approach that is

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.960
the same thing as the
value of the function.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.670
Which makes a lot of sense.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.780
Now let's think about it.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.110
If these would have somehow
been able to pass for continuous

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.800
in that context.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.640
Well, over here, let's say that
this is our point c. f of c

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.560
is right over there.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.030
That is f of c.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.570
Now is it the case
that the limit

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.040
of f of x, as x approaches
c, is equal to f of c?

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.040
Well, if we take
the limit of f of x

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.580
as x approaches c from
the positive direction,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.570
it does look like it is f of c.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.320
It does look like
it's equal to f of c.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.280
But if we take the
limit-- but this

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.740
does not equal the
limit of f of x

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.989
as x approaches c from
the negative direction.

00:05:32.989 --> 00:05:34.530
As we go from the
negative direction,

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.670
we're not approaching f of c.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.460
So therefore, this
does not hold up.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.210
In order for the limit
to be equal to f of c,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.900
the limit from
both the directions

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.050
needs to be equal to it.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.520
And this is not the case.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.030
So this would not pass muster
by our formal definition,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.660
which is good.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.830
Because we see visually
this one is not continuous.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.330
What about this one
right over here?

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:57.590
And let me re-set it up.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.600
So let me make sure
that that looks

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.860
like a hole right over there.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.210
So we see here,
what is the limit?

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.750
The limit-- and
this is our c, right

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.210
over here-- the limit of
f of x as x approaches

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.970
c, let's say that
that is equal to L.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.640
And so that, we've seen many
limits like this before,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.374
that's L right over there.

00:06:18.374 --> 00:06:19.790
And it's pretty
clear just looking

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.070
at this is that L
does not equal f of c.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.190
This right over here is f of c.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.480
So once again, this
would not pass our test.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.850
The limit of f of
x as x approaches

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.180
c, which is this right over
here, is not equal to f of c.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.640
So once again, this
would not pass our test.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.020
And here, any of the interior
points would pass our test.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.330
The limit as x
approaches this value

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:52.520
is equal to the function
evaluated at that point.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.970
So it seems to be
good for all of those.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.470
Now let's give a
definition for when

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.740
we're talking about
boundary points.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.570
So this is continuity
for an interior point.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:13.033
And let's think about
continuity at boundary--

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.783
or let me call it
endpoint, actually, that

00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:19.160
would be better-- at endpoint c.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.500
 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.450
So let's first consider
just the left endpoint.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:31.930
If left endpoint-- so what I'm
talking about, a left endpoint?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:39.870
Let me draw my axes,
x-axis, y-axis.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.590
And let me draw my interval.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.940
So let's say this is the
left endpoint of my interval,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.300
this is the right
endpoint of my interval.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.070
And let me draw the
function over that interval.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.770
Looks something like this.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.360
So when we talk about
a left endpoint,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.490
we're talking our c
being right over here.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.781
It is the left endpoint.

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:04.530
So if we're talking
about a left endpoint,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:11.410
we are continuous at
c means-- or to say

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.970
that we're continuous at
this left endpoint c--

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:20.510
that means that the limit f
of x as x approaches c, well,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.090
we can't even approach see
from the left hand side.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.300
We have to approach
from the right.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.930
Is equal to f of c.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.910
And so this is
really kind of a, we

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.869
can only approach something
from one direction.

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:34.618
So we can't just say
the limit in general,

00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:36.260
but we can say the
limit from one side.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.110
So it's really very
similar to what we just

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.720
said for an interior point.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.740
And we see over here
it is indeed the case,

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.880
as x approaches c, our
function is approaching

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.110
this point right over here.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.080
Which is the exact
same thing as f of c.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.587
So we are continuous
at that point.

00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:53.920
What's an example where an
endpoint-- where we would not

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.590
be continuous and an end point?

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:01.090
Well, I can imagine a graph
that looks something like this.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:06.090
So here's our interval,
and maybe our function.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.910
So at c it looks like that.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.530
There's a little
hole right there.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.321
And then it would look
something like that.

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:12.950
Or there's no hole,
the function just

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.150
has a removable discontinuity
right over there.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.000
At least visually
it looks like that.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.980
And you see that this
would not pass the test.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.430
Because the limit as we approach
c from the positive direction

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.800
is right over here.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.950
That's the limit.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.220
But f of c is up here.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.300
So f of c does not
equal the limit

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.080
as x approaches c from
the positive direction.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.915
So this would not be continuous.

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:39.290
And you could
imagine, what do we

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.980
do if we're dealing
with the right endpoint?

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:51.200
So we say we're continuous
at right endpoint c

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.560
if-- so let me draw that, do
my best attempt to draw it--

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:03.260
so this is my x-axis,
this is my y-axis.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.965
Let me draw my interval
that I care about,

00:10:06.965 --> 00:10:08.340
say it looks
something like this.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:12.820
A right endpoint means
c is right over there.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.640
And we can say that we
are continuous at x,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.800
the function is
continuous at x equals

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:25.780
c means that the limit of f of
x as x approaches c-- now we

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.130
can't approach it from both sides.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:29.130
We can only approach it
from the left hand side.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.510
As x approaches c from
the negative direction,

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.630
is equal to f of c.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.090
If we can say that,
if this is true,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.300
then this implies that we
are continuous at that right

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.820
endpoint, c, and vice versa.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.230
And a situation where we're not?

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.140
Well you could imagine instead
of this being defined right

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.660
at that point, you
could create, you

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.720
could say the function jumps up.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.800
Just like we did
right over there.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.200
So once again, continuity, not
a really hard to fathom idea.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.080
Whenever you see the function
just all of a sudden jumping,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.940
or there's kind of a gap in
it, it's a pretty good sense

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.100
that the function is
not connected there.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.446
It's not continuous.

00:11:06.446 --> 00:11:07.820
But what we did
in this video is,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.830
we used limits to define
a more rigorous definition

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.590
of continuity.
