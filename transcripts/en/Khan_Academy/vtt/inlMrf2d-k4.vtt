00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.960
In everyday language, we
know what a kite means.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.050
It's these flimsy things
that we take to the beach

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.950
to fly in the wind
with our families.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.450
But you could imagine
mathematicians

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450
have looked at the general
shape of these kites,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.690
or at least the way
they're drawn in cartoons,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.439
and say, well, that's
an interesting shape

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:16.160
in its own right.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.990
Let's also make this
a mathematical term.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.540
This is a shape
like a parallelogram

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.960
or like a rhombus.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.270
It's just another
type of quadrilateral.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.470
But in order for it to be used
in mathematics in a useful way,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.007
we have to define it a
little bit more precisely.

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:32.840
So let's see if we can
come up with a couple

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.120
of interesting definitions
of what a kite could

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.420
be or a couple of interesting
ways to construct a kite.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.620
Well, one way that you
could think about a kite

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.145
is it looks like it
has two pairs of sides

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:44.520
that are congruent
to each other.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.440
So, for example, it looks
like this side and this side

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.780
need to be congruent
to each other.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.900
So let's make that a constraint.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.210
And they touch each other.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910
They have a shared
common endpoint.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.820
So you have one pair
of congruent sides

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.070
that's adjacent to each other.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.060
They have a common endpoint.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.230
And then you have
another pair of sides

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.120
that are congruent
to each other.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.650
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.820
And they are adjacent.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.610
They share a common endpoint.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.690
So one definition that
you could make for a kite

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:27.880
is that you have two
pairs of congruent sides,

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.630
where the congruent
sides are adjacent.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.541
 

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.790
And you might say, well,
what's the other alternative?

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.610
If the congruent
sides aren't adjacent,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.610
what else could they be?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.960
Well, the congruent sides
could be opposite each other.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.660
And what happens if
you were to do that?

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.400
So if these two
sides are congruent,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.202
but they didn't have
a common endpoint,

00:01:51.202 --> 00:01:52.910
we're still dealing
with a quadrilateral.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.300
What would it look like?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.230
Well, you would have
one congruent site here,

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.475
and that would be congruent
to this side right over here.

00:02:00.475 --> 00:02:04.110
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.350
And then you would have a
congruent side right over here

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.759
that is congruent to this side.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.217
This would be a
situation where you

00:02:10.217 --> 00:02:11.759
have two pairs of
congruent sides,

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.800
but they're not adjacent.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.260
They don't have any common
endpoints with each other.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430
Each side in the
congruent side pair,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.130
they're opposite to each other.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.070
So here, once again,
we get a quadrilateral.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.140
We still get four sides.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.290
A kite is a quadrilateral.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.620
This is a quadrilateral.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.850
But this isn't a kite.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.310
This right over here
is a parallelogram,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760
and we've seen that
multiple times before.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.230
But kites can also
be constructed

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.830
in other interesting ways.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.300
You might see that what looks
right here, that these two

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.357
diagonals of this kite
are perpendicular.

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.190
And that indeed-- and
I'm not going to prove

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.565
it here-- is a
property of a kite.

00:02:48.565 --> 00:02:51.990
 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.910
These two lines,
these two diagonals,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.272
intersect at a 90-degree angle.

00:02:58.272 --> 00:02:59.730
The other thing we
know about kites

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.100
is that one of these lines is
bisecting the other of the two.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.570
So you could actually
construct a kite that way.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.150
You could start with
a line, and then you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.280
could construct a
perpendicular bisector

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.260
of that line,
another segment that

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.760
bisects it at a 90-degree angle.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.550
So here, there you go.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.200
So that bisects
it, so that means

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.630
that this segment is
equal to this segment.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.050
We split it in two.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.820
And then if you connect the
endpoints of the segments,

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.190
you should get a kite.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.080
And you will indeed get a kite.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.030
So it would look
something like this.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.380
And once again, this
segment is congruent

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.170
to this adjacent
segment, and this segment

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.710
is congruent to this
adjacent segment.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.450
But what would happen if
these two diagonals are

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.020
both perpendicular
bisectors of each other?

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.100
So what would happen
in this scenario,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.779
where-- let me draw one segment.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.570
And then I'm going to
make another segment,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.111
but they're going
to be perpendicular

00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.130
bisectors of each other.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.010
So let's do that.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.427
So now they're both
perpendicular bisectors

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:06.010
of each other.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.640
So this segment is
equal to this segment,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.740
and this segment is
equal to this segment.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.110
Well, now, once again,
you still have a kite,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.350
but now you're also
satisfying the constraint

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.750
for another type of
quadrilateral that we've seen.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.390
So now you're satisfying
the constraint.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.230
All your sides are equal.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.190
All of your sides are parallel.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.640
You're now dealing with
a rhombus, which is also

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.050
a special type of parallelogram.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.810
And then if you were
to go even further,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.350
where these two diagonals
have the exact same length

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.520
and they're both perpendicular
bisectors of each other,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.380
so you have both the
exact same length.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.470
I'll try to draw it
as cleanly as I can.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.810
So they're both the
exact same length,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.830
and they're both perpendicular
bisectors of each other.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.580
So each of these halves would
be the same length as well.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.570
Then you have a subset of--
I guess I could say-- rhombi,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.510
and you get to a square.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.060
 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.010
So one way of thinking
about it is any square

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.096
is also a rhombus.

00:05:14.096 --> 00:05:16.950
 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.850
And any rhombus is also going
to satisfy your constraints

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.890
for being a kite.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.950
But there's a
bunch of kites that

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.060
don't satisfy your constraints
of being a rhombus or a square.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.780
A kite is just two
pairs of congruent sides

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.620
that are adjacent to each
other, and they're usually

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.395
pretty easy to spot out
because they look like kites.

00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:37.895
