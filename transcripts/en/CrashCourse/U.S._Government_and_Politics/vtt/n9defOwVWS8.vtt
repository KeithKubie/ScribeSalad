00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.480
Hi. I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government.
Uh. It's been a dream of mine to be on Crash

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.780
Course since I was a little kid. Speaking
of acting like a little kid, today, we're

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.500
gonna talk about the U.S. Congress, which,
according to the Constitution, is the most

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.240
important branch of government. That was probably
written by Congress. It wasn't. They didn't

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.099
So when I say that Congress is supposed to
be the most important branch of government,

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.369
I'm talking about the national government,
not the state government. There's a difference,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.910
okay? I know this, because the Constitution,
which consists of seven articles and 28 amendments,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.580
mentions Congress first. In fact, right after
the preamble, the very first section of the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.550
very first article, which is helpfully labeled
Article I, Section I, says this: "All legislative

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.960
powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.480
consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives."

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.940
So, right away, the Constitution sets up a
two house legislature, with a Senate and a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.219
House of Representatives. The Latin word for
this is bicameral, and I promise I'll quit

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.119
with the Latin now. I didn't really say much Latin,
but, just once, but I'll pr -- I won't say anymore.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.660
[Theme Music]

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.240
That's pretty catchy. [whistles theme] So
let's start with the House of Representatives,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.470
because it's a little easier. In order to
serve in the House, you have to be 25 years

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.770
old, a citizen for seven years, and a resident
of the state that you hope to represent. I'd

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.090
like to think that I represent a state of
enjoyment. Vote for me 2015. Representation

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.820
is determined by population. No state has
fewer than one, Vermont, North and South Dakota,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.069
Wyoming, and Alaska each have one, and the
most populous state, California, has 52. Right

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.770
now, there are 435 members of the House of
Representatives.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.819
The Senate has two senators from each state
for a total of 100. To be a senator, you must

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.500
be at least 30 years old, a citizen for nine
years, and a resident of the state you hope

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.319
to represent. Originally, senators were chosen
by the state legislatures, which meant that

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.270
they tended to be politically important members
of a state's elite class. But this changed

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.399
with the 17th amendment, and now, senators
are elected by the people, just like representatives.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.700
I'm gonna explain how the two houses of the
legislature actually legislate in a later

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.349
episode--I'll have a bigger beard, probably--but
now, I'm going to point out a few of the ways

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.569
that they are different. Ultimately, the houses
do the same thing, make laws, but the Constitution

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.750
grants certain specific powers to each house.
Let's look at those powers in the Thought Bubble.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.390
The House of Representatives is given the
power to impeach the president and other federal

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.730
officials. This can be confusing because people
tend to think that impeaching means kicking

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.240
the official out of office, but it doesn't.
The House impeaches an official by deciding

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.200
that that person has done something bad enough
to bring him to trial. An impeachment is like

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.940
a criminal indictment. Once the official is
impeached, the trial happens in the Senate.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.600
If it's the President who's been impeached,
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court presides.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.940
Otherwise, it's the Vice President. You don't
let the VP preside over a presidential impeachment,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.720
because he has a vested interest in seeing the president
removed. Then the VP would become president. Duhhh.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.380
The second power that the House has is that
they decide presidential elections if no candidate

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.020
wins the majority of the electoral college.
I'll explain this later, but for now, remember

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.170
that this barely ever has happened ever.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.890
The third power that belongs specifically
to the House is found in Article I, Section

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.320
7: "All bills for raising revenue shall originate
in the House of Representatives." This is

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.120
pretty important, because it means that any
bill that raises taxes starts in the House,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.140
and if you know anything about America, you
know that we care about taxes, a lot. So this

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.920
power is huge and is sometimes called "The
Power of the Purse".

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.940
The Senate has some important powers, too.
The first one I've already mentioned is that

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.260
they hold impeachment trials. That doesn't
happen very often at all. Another power the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.630
Senate has is to ratify treaties. This requires
a 2/3rds vote of the Senate. Most treaties

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.640
you don't hear much about, except when the
Senate refuses to ratify them, as it did or

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.500
didn't do with the Treaty of Versailles. I
totally would have ratified that treaty, just

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.630
sayin'. The last significant power that belongs
only to the Senate is the confirmation power.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.110
The Senate votes to confirm the appointment
of executive officers that require Senate

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.620
confirmation. Some of these, like the cabinet
secretaries, are obvious, but there are over

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.680
1,000 offices requiring Senate confirmation,
including federal judges, and this is probably too many.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.620
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Uh, I love saying that,
YES! So those are the major differences between

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.870
the two houses of the legislature, but why
do we have two, and why did the framers of

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.959
the Constitution make them different anyway?
There are two categories of reason here: historical

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.660
and practical. The historical reason for the
two houses is that when the Constitution was

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.010
being written, the framers couldn't agree
on what type of legislature to have, because

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.550
they came from states with different interests.
Delegates from states with large populations

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.269
wanted legislatures to be chosen based on
the state's population, so that their states

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.429
would have, wait for it, more legislators
and more power. This is called proportional

00:04:21.429 --> 00:04:26.129
representation, states with small populations
understandably didn't want proportional representation.

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:30.260
They favored equal representation in the legislature,
which would give them equal power. Large states

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.630
supported what was called the Virginia Plan,
and small states wanted the New Jersey Plan,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.510
and they argued over it until a compromise
was reached. Since it was brokered by Connecticut's

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.310
Roger Sherman, it was called the Connecticut
Compromise, or, more usually, The Great Compromise,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.490
because historians are really bad at naming
things. Hey, this war is nine years long.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.310
Let's call it the Seven Years War. That's
actually genius.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.620
If you guessed that the compromise was an
upper house with equal representation and

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.520
a lower house with proportional representation,
congratulations, you understand the Great

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.460
Compromise! You don't win anything if you
guessed it right. Actually, if you guessed

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.520
it right, click here and watch me punch an
eagle.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.270
So that's the historical reason for the two
houses, but what about the practical reasons?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.169
One of the main reasons to divide the legislature
and to give the two houses power is to make

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.500
it so that the legislature doesn't have too
much power. How do we know that the Framers

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.430
wanted this? Because one of them, James Madison,
told us that in one of the Federalist Papers.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.650
In Federalist 51, Madison wrote "In republican
government, the legislative authority necessarily

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.490
predominates. The remedy for this inconveniency
is to divide the legislature into different

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.070
branches and to render them different modes
of election and different principles of action,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.620
as little connected with each other as the
nature of their common functions and their

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.860
common dependence on the society will admit."

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.430
James Madison may not have sounded like Foghorn
Leghorn. But that's one of the theories.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.889
My theory. I say, I say. Anyways, the idea that
one house of the legislature can limit the

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.949
power of another house is called an intrabranch
check. We'll look at this in more detail when

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.669
we talk about checks and balances. In general,
the Framers of the Constitution were kind

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.350
of obsessed with the idea that the government
might have too much power. So we'll be seeing

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.340
lots of examples of how they try to deal with
this.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.460
So let's finish up by looking at the reasons why the
specific powers were given to each house. To do this,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.740
let me introduce my assistants. By assistants,
I really mean clones. Let's go to The Clone Zone!

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.380
So I made these clones to help us understand
these multi-sided issues. This is Senate clone

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.810
and this is House clone, and they're quite
good looking I might add.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.080
Senate clone: So you may have noticed, according
to the Constitution, Senators are expected

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.419
to be older than Representatives, and although
30 isn't all that old today, it was in 1787

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.040
when the Constitution written. This was because
older people are wiser, or at least more experienced,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.110
and the Framers wanted the Senate, which is
sometimes called the Upper House, to be more

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.650
serious, or just more dignified. And above
all, deliberative than the House. It was supposed

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.520
to be more immune from the desires of the
public, which the Framers were kind of afraid

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.540
of because of their unfortunate propensity
to riot. One of the ways that the Framers

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.620
hoped to ensure this was by giving Senators
a 6 year term, which really would mean that

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.169
they could ignore the ranting and ravings
of their constituents for at least, like,

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.120
5 years at a time. Because the Senate is supposed
to be the more deliberative body and the one

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.150
that is more insulated from public opinion,
they are the ones given the power to confirm

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.850
public ministers and to ratify treaties. I
guess they thought that being older and wiser,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.340
Senators would be better judges of character
and better able to govern based on their sense

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.500
of what is in the public interest. Sometimes
the idea that a representative should govern

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.150
based on what he thinks is best for the people
rather than what they say they want is referred

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.200
to as a representative acting as a trustee.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.500
House clone: Haha, which is another way of
saying that the Senate is full of elitist

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:33.530
snobs who don't care what their constituents
want at all. In the House of Representatives,

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.680
we're supposed to take into consideration
the desires of the people in their district,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.360
who voted for them, acting in the role of
delegates. So the main way that the Framers

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.960
tried to ensure that Representatives could
be more responsive to their voters, other

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.360
than having them directly elected for by the
voters instead of state legislatures, was

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.850
to give them 2 year terms. This method meant
that they have to be responsive to the changing

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.840
opinions of voters in their districts, otherwise
they could easily be voted out of office.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:08:00.039
You don't want that, no way. Oh boy. Why they
would be given the power of impeachment is

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:03.690
beyond me, but it totally makes sense to give
the power of the purse to the branch of government

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.759
that is closest to the people. After all,
one thing that the government does that is

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:11.100
directly related to almost everybody is taxes.
So you want the most democratic body making

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.810
the decisions that have the most direct effect
on people.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:18.270
Craig: Huh, thanks clones. So there you have
it, that's the basics of our bicameral Congress,

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.009
including the differences between the two
Houses and why they are that way. Oooh, I

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:26.130
used Latin again. I'm sorry. Mea culpa. We'll
be going into much greater detail about how

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.289
the two houses work together, or don't, in
future episodes. But that's enough for now,

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.749
