00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:16.485
Let's talk about how the narrative
of Africa is being told,

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.658
and who is doing the telling.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:21.901
I want to share with you
the selection of work

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.800
by contemporary artists
from Africa and its diaspora.

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:27.472
I love this art.

00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:31.568
I find it beautiful
and inspiring and thrilling,

00:00:31.592 --> 00:00:34.455
and I really hope I am able
to pique your interest.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.465
I want to share something about myself
and why art matters to me.

00:00:38.894 --> 00:00:41.753
I'm the daughter of an artist,
so that means that growing up,

00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:44.814
I had the chance to see my father
do artwork in his studio.

00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:47.188
My home was surrounded by art,

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:49.308
and I had an early art education,

00:00:49.332 --> 00:00:53.357
being dragged to museums and exhibitions
over the summer holidays.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.658
What I did not understand,
really, at the time,

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.944
is that this also gave me
an early understanding

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:01.571
about why art is important,

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.072
how to look at it,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.648
how to understand it,
but also how to love it.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.365
So art matters to me on a personal level,

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:13.469
and not only because it's beautiful
and inspiring and thrilling,

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:16.008
but because art tells powerful stories.

00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:21.381
All these artists have stories to tell you
about what it means to be African,

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:25.516
stories that tell you and touches
about our African identity,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.556
but also stories that tell us
about who we are as Africans,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.547
but also stories that tell us
about our complex history.

00:01:35.308 --> 00:01:38.284
So how can art tell you powerful stories?

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:41.190
I want to share with you this series

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:43.840
by Senegalese artist Omar Victor Diop.

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:47.030
This is a series of self-portraits,

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:48.974
and the artist in this particular series

00:01:48.998 --> 00:01:53.111
is focusing on the representation
of Africans in art history

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.506
between the 15th to the 19th century.

00:01:56.798 --> 00:01:59.726
I want to show you how, with one image,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.672
Diop is able to touch
on our African identity,

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.092
on the politics of representation,

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:07.163
but also on our social value system.

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.114
In this particular self-portrait,

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:15.483
Diop is actually referencing
another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.188
This picture is doing a portrait
of Jean-Baptiste Belley.

00:02:19.212 --> 00:02:21.992
Jean-Baptiste Belley
was a native of Senegal,

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:25.074
a former slave of Haiti,

00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:30.091
but during his lifetime, he also
was elected to represent the colony

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:33.392
at the third government
of the French Revolution,

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:36.892
and he advocated strongly
for the abolition of slavery.

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:40.043
What is very smart
and clever about Diop here

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:41.939
is that he's going back to history.

00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:44.485
He's reclaiming this figure

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.154
by restaging this beautiful
royal blue uniform,

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:51.285
where he is restaging also the pose,

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.804
and he's doing that
to actually underline the issues

00:02:54.828 --> 00:02:57.821
that are still impacting
individuals of color today.

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.078
There was nothing special

00:02:59.102 --> 00:03:02.801
about this very typical
political portrait of the time,

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:04.925
except that for the first time,

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.760
an individual of color,
in that case, Jean-Baptiste Belley,

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:11.394
was actually named
and acknowledged in a painting.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.252
What Diop is adding to this picture
is this crucial element,

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:18.455
which is the football under his arm,

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.678
and by doing that,

00:03:19.702 --> 00:03:23.264
Diop is actually touching
at our hero worship culture

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:25.347
of African football stars,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.268
who unfortunately, despite their fame,

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.975
their immense talent,
and their royalty status,

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.601
they are still invisible.

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.098
Diop is asking us to dig deeper,

00:03:35.122 --> 00:03:38.146
to go beyond history
and what has been written,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.875
and, basically, see how it still
influences and impacts us in the present.

00:03:42.948 --> 00:03:45.044
I want to share
this other beautiful series

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:48.178
called "Kesh Angels,"
by artist Hassan Hajjaj.

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:50.150
So in this particular series,

00:03:50.174 --> 00:03:52.406
the artist is really pushing
on the boundaries

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.737
of stereotype and clichÃ©.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.065
Hassan Hajjaj is a friend,

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.963
and honestly, I admire him dearly,

00:03:58.987 --> 00:04:03.878
but this particular series is talking
to me directly as a Muslim woman.

00:04:03.902 --> 00:04:05.998
I experience this all the time,

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.419
where, you know, people
have a lot of expectations,

00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:10.705
religious ones and cultural ones,

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:14.640
but what I love about this artist
is that he's putting all this on its head.

00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:18.173
He's actually challenging
every representation

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:21.555
of Muslim, Arabic women that there is.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.277
Hassan Hajjaj is a child of the diaspora.

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:28.530
He grew up in Morocco
amongst bright logo goods,

00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:31.778
you know, counterfeit originals
being sold at the souks.

00:04:31.802 --> 00:04:35.111
So to see those symbols
representing in his work

00:04:35.135 --> 00:04:39.652
a celebration of the global culture,
a critic of the global urban culture,

00:04:39.676 --> 00:04:41.089
is no surprise,

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:46.343
but really at the heart of his work
is his desire of a nuanced representation.

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:48.003
He wants us to interrupt ourselves

00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:50.034
and all the perception that we might have

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:53.764
on people, on a culture,
and on environment.

00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:55.169
And for example,

00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:58.979
this particular picture,
your common association would be,

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:03.344
you know, certain street brand for
a certain Western distinctive consumer.

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:05.801
Well, he mashes it all up,

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:10.341
where he is daring to imagine
a female biker culture

00:05:10.365 --> 00:05:14.801
where actually Chanel or Louis Vuitton
is designing the djellaba,

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:16.140
and Nike, the babouche,

00:05:16.164 --> 00:05:18.357
and this is actually the standard uniform.

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:23.064
What I love about the women
in "Kesh Angels"

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.430
is that they are able to hold your gaze.

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:28.581
We are completely
participating in the image,

00:05:28.605 --> 00:05:32.049
but they are the one inviting us in,
and on their own terms.

00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:37.461
Hassan Hajjaj's "Kesh Angels"
or "Project Diaspora" by Omar Victor Diop

00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.530
offer me two strong examples
why art is so instrumental.

00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:45.309
It is instrumental as it really
inspires us to ask questions,

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.373
but it is also instrumental
because it ignites change.

00:05:48.397 --> 00:05:52.270
Seeing diversity in race and ethnicity
in contemporary art

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:56.599
is the only way that we'll see
changes in the art industry,

00:05:56.623 --> 00:06:01.163
but also for the relations between Africa
and the Western canon.

00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:04.710
How we will participate in all this
is really up to us.

00:06:05.635 --> 00:06:07.421
There's a lot of progress to be made,

00:06:07.445 --> 00:06:10.389
and honestly, we still need
to support stronger voices,

00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:13.794
as they are the ones shaking things up
and bringing new perspective.

00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:15.977
I want to share
this beautiful old painting

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:20.763
by younger emerging artist
Kudzanai-Violet Hwami.

00:06:20.787 --> 00:06:24.406
For me, when I see her work,
it really represents freedom.

00:06:25.302 --> 00:06:29.668
Hwami has fantastic takes
on what it means to be an African

00:06:29.692 --> 00:06:31.128
and an African life.

00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:33.383
She has lived in three
different countries:

00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:36.184
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Britain,

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:39.343
and therefore has been influenced
by a multitude of layers

00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:41.367
of communities and cultures,

00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:46.490
from LGBT to eco to Xhosa
to emo to British cultures.

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:51.129
And as she says herself, the beauty
of being a child of the diaspora

00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:53.764
is really being able to reinvent ourselves

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.675
and what it means to be African.

00:06:56.493 --> 00:06:59.573
I want to leave you
with this powerful piece

00:06:59.597 --> 00:07:02.675
by South African artist Lawrence Lemaoana.

00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:05.544
Lawrence Lemaoana also criticized

00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:09.218
the influence of the media
on our moral consciousness,

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:14.704
and he's doing that by using those fabrics
like banners in political demonstrations,

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:17.242
where he's asking us
to reclaim our voices.

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:20.988
I believe in the transformative
power of art,

00:07:21.012 --> 00:07:25.862
as it is our only way to paint
a nuanced image of Africa,

00:07:25.886 --> 00:07:27.957
but also its diaspora,

00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.615
one that will be painted by its artists
and its cultural producers

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:36.172
with their radical but also very unique
view of seeing the world

00:07:36.196 --> 00:07:37.577
and their place in it.

00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:41.736
It is really through art
that we can regain

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.672
our sense of agency and empowerment.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.707
It is through art that we can
really tell our own story.

00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:53.166
So like Lawrence Lemaoana says,
the power is ours.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.341
Thank you.

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.174
(Applause)
