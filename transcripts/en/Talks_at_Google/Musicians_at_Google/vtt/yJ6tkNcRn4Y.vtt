MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.040
We are extremely thrilled today
to host the Alexander

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.160
String Quartet.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.250
Formed just over 30 years ago,
they're one of the premier

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.840
quartets worldwide.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.420
Members Zak Grafilo, Frederick
Lifsitz, Paul Yarbrough, and

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.700
Sandy Wilson are based in San
Francisco, where they serve as

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.660
the ensemble in residence for
San Francisco performances.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.980
You can find more about their
ongoing tours and their

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.030
discography at ASQ4.com, while
San Francisco performances is,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.870
of course, at performances.org.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.920
The ASQ has completed a series
of string quartet cycles,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220
including the complete Beethoven
and the complete

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.790
Shostakovich, both
very well done.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.880
Their latest works on the
Allegro Media Group include

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.990
pieces by Gershwin and Kern.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.730
Today's program will be
announced from the stage, but

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.440
as always, we'll have time
for some Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.460
After all, what is the string
quartet but the most elevated

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.340
musical conversation
in live music?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.810
So without further ado, please
join me in welcoming the

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.310
Alexander String Quartet
to Google.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.560
Thanks a lot.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.770
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: It's
an incredible

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.910
pleasure to be here.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.350
This setting-- this very
setting, with people gathered

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.160
around comfortably, television
cameras, was exactly what

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.330
Mozart and Haydn had in mind
when they were composing their

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.240
greatest quartets in the
1780s, and in Haydn

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.130
case, into the 1790s.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.350
The genre really started in the
1750s. '50s A young Haydn

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.820
started writing some
string quartets.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.730
A great many composers in
southern Germany and northern

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.400
Italy wrote quartets, although
the instruments had been

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.640
around for some time
before that.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.200
But this idea of the
conversation in the music was

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.510
really paramount to the
string quartet.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.190
And as I said, Haydn and his
younger counterpart Mozart did

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.800
everything they could to bring
the quartet to the point when

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.470
Mozart died in 1791, the quartet
was just a vehicle

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.170
that was going to last,
and it did last.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.480
Almost every great composer
to this very day has

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.200
written at least one.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.430
We used to have garages full
of scores sent to us from

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.479
composers around the world.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.210
Now we have mailboxes full of
them in electronic format.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.220
It hasn't stopped.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.330
This first work we're going to
play for you is one of the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.340
last quartets that
Mozart wrote.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.610
In fact, I think this is the
last quartet that he wrote.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.410
Not the last work.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.180
This dates June of 1790, and
he and Haydn had written

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.910
quartets back and forth for each
other, and they actually

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.020
played in a quartet together
with two other composers.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.630
It would've been wonderful to
eavesdrop on those evenings.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.330
But this quartet was written
as a set of three--

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.840
one of a set of three that was
dedicated to the King of

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.320
Prussia, who was an
amateur cellist.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.840
He was either a really great
cellist, or Mozart really

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.780
wanted to impress him, because
the cello writing is extremely

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.620
difficult in this work.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380
No pressure, Sandy.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.900
And we're going to share
with you the first

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.530
movement of this quartet.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.090
It starts off using the forces
in absolute unison, and

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.340
branches out from there.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:12:01.740
[MUSIC - MOZART]

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.950
PAUL YARBROUGH: For our next
selection, we've chosen to

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:09.080
play two movements from a
quartet by Franz Schubert.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.250
Schubert was born just a few
years after Mozart's death.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:20.490
He was born in the same city,
Vienna, in 1797, and lived

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.310
only until 1828.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:28.240
He died at the age of
31, having written

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.900
more than 1,000 works.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.460
He was an incredibly prolific
composer for

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.160
such a short lifespan.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.810
I think he did nothing but
write music pretty

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.060
much all day long.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.570
The two movements that we'd like
to play from a quartet

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.060
that has a nickname, Death
and the Maiden.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.800
This quartet was written
after a poem by a man

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.460
named Matthias Claudius.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.900
And the poem is very short.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.780
And first, Schubert wrote a
song on the poem, and the

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:08.880
story is, death has come to take
away this young girl, and

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.122
he's very seductive.

00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:15.310
And he says, come with me.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.410
You're going to love it.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:17.880
It's great.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.400
She says, no, no, no.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.220
I'm too young.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.200
I can't go yet.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.380
And he says, no,
you're coming.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.610
So basically, that's the poem.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.550
And the singer who sings
it has to kind

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.260
of do both the voices--

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.510
the voice of the maiden and
the voice of death.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.750
Anyway, later on, after having
written the song, Schubert

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.280
wrote a variations movement on
the theme from the song, and

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.000
that's the movement that we're
going to play from the string

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.880
quartet, which then took the
title of the poem as its

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.110
nickname for the
entire quartet.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:59.000
The quartet, which is four
movements, is very much in the

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.540
same vein as the poem, and
there's an amazing thing that

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.410
Schubert does, which
is going between

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.450
a dark minor tonality--

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.090
very ominous--

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.150
to something that's brighter,
more optimistic.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:18.120
Not necessarily happy,
but kind of serene.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.380
And it's such a beautiful
juxtaposition between these

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.920
two poles of expression.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.460
The first movement that we'll
play is actually the second

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.460
movement from the quartet, and
it's titled Andante Con Moto.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.720
And this is the theme and
variation of movement.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.130
And then we'll also play the
following movements, Scherzo

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.710
and Trio, and in that movement,
you'll hear the

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.050
contrast between the minor
and the major and the

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.300
darkness and the light.

00:15:03.589 --> 00:15:04.839
[MUSIC - FRANZ SCHUBERT,
"DEATH AND THE MAIDEN"]

00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:01.150
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: It's
interesting that Schubert and

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.890
Beethoven were alive, working
quite hard at the same time,

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.960
at the end of both
of their lives.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.950
And Schubert and Beethoven, as
far as we know, never met.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.050
They lived within blocks
of one another.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.020
And despite this impression of
Beethoven being this very

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.810
tall, imposing figure that you
see in statues, especially in

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.200
Vienna, he apparently
was quite short.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.390
And Schubert was even shorter.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.980
And Schubert was very shy, and
he just apparently could never

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.400
get up the nerve to go and speak
to Beethoven, of course,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.600
which was difficult also toward
the end of Beethoven's

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.740
life with hearing issues.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.560
But Beethoven, at the end
of his life, did ask his

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.230
assistant to bring in some of
the scores of this young

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.410
gentleman's music, and
was really, really

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.260
blown away by it.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.380
He could read it like a book.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:51.300
The other kind of ultimate spam
box was the coat room in

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.480
the home of [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.410
the great poet, playwright,
and philosopher.

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.230
He had an assistant that sort
of screened his mail.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.590
And Schubert had a handful
of songs--

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.850
of poems of [INAUDIBLE]
he had put to music.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.865
Those poems, those songs, the
lieder that he wrote, have

00:30:08.865 --> 00:30:12.480
been what has made a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] poetry famous in

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.640
every region of the world, where
it probably wouldn't

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.970
have been read otherwise.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:17.480
But at the time, [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.700
didn't really know who this guy
was, and never opened it

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.440
to see the manuscript of these
songs that had been written

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.020
based on his poetry.

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:30.600
These composers, looking back,
with hindsight, you can always

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.670
tell a good one.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.020
But at the time, it's really
hard to see what a winner is.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.280
But somehow, time seems to have
been very kind to these

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.080
handful of composers, and you'd
think that the string

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.790
quartet was only written and
played in Vienna, if you heard

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:47.420
the first part of
this program.

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.240
But we're going to move to the
20th century, and to England.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.270
Not necessarily to London, but
to England, and the composer

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.990
Benjamin Britten.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.700
Britten wrote three beautiful
string quartets, and he wrote

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.310
earlier than he wrote
the string quartets.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.670
In 1933, when he was
20 years old--

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.180
19, I guess, officially when
he wrote these works.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:13.320
He was born, as I said in
1913, and died in 1976.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.470
He wrote three divertimenti.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.140
Three sort of fun pieces,
although I wouldn't

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.490
necessarily call these
necessarily fun pieces.

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:24.835
But they are fun to play, and
they're fun to listen to.

00:31:24.835 --> 00:31:27.320
But as was anything with
Benjamin Britten's music,

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.550
there's a note of seriousness.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.130
He was a lifelong pacifist.

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:34.430
As a boy in boarding school,
he witnessed beatings that

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:37.750
were condoned, and perhaps that
was that type of thing

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.610
that led him to become a
conscientious objector during

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.430
World War II.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.770
He was in this country.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.530
He wrote the famous War Requiem,
which is a real

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.160
statement against man's
inhumanity to man.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.280
And he took his own art--
used his own art

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.940
to express his feelings.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.460
His innermost feelings about the
way he viewed the world.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.580
Composers have often used the
string quartet, because it's

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.700
this incredibly transparent,
intimate art form, to express

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.680
some of these feelings that
they perhaps otherwise

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.240
wouldn't express in an opera or
in a symphony, or in some

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.560
larger scale work.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.370
Shostakovich did that and
in the Soviet Union.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.360
When he had something to say
that he didn't want to be too

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.060
scrutinized by the upper echelon
of the government, so

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.960
he put it in a string quartet--
sort of worked it

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.870
into his music.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.490
And the string quartet
typically has a small

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:31.450
audience, so it didn't get the
kind of feature that his

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.390
operas, which often got
him into trouble, did.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.290
But this work by Britten is
just a charming work.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.295
Britten, a lot like Schubert, a
lot like Mozart, was writing

00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:43.330
music from a very,
very young age.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.030
Felix Mendelssohn
was another one.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.640
Music just seemed to come
out of their pores.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.840
And his mother, Benjamin
Britten's mother, fully

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.220
anticipated that her son would
become the fourth B--

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.700
after Bach, Beethoven,
and Brahms.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.310
Brahms lived in great fear that
Bruckner would become the

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.525
fourth B. But Britten--

00:33:04.525 --> 00:33:06.660
I don't know if he's considered
the fourth B, but

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.000
we love his music.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.530
This is three movements.

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.030
The first is a march, and the
second movement is a beautiful

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:16.030
waltz, and the third movement is
a very almost rambunctious

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:16.960
country dance.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.690
He wrote this pieces, I believe,
as descriptions of

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.210
three of his good friends
from his youth.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.430
And I don't know much more
about them, but you can

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:29.035
extrapolate what you can from
hearing these three vignettes.

00:33:47.712 --> 00:33:51.780
The repertoire is so fast that
if we spent, as we have, our

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.360
entire adult lives--

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.720
supposedly we are adults--

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.420
playing this music, we'll never
get through it all.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.480
Not on the level that
we want to play it.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.460
So we're very fortunate
in terms of that.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.780
And the vehicle, the string
quartet as an art form, and as

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:10.969
a vehicle for music, and to go
places as an ensemble is

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:11.274
remarkable.

00:34:11.274 --> 00:34:14.260
The four of us, all we really
need are four chairs, although

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.810
we could play three
of us standing up.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.699
And Sandy actually doesn't sound
too bad when he stands

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:20.210
up with the cello.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.679
I think he and Yo Yo Ma have
the record on that.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.190
But four chairs.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.060
We bring our own stands with us,
we buy a seat for Sandy's

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.510
cello wherever we
go in the world.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.290
It often flies first
or business class.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:32.780
It doesn't play word
or anything.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.420
SANDY WILSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.489
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: Sometimes he
does, sometimes he doesn't.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:38.170
But if you see four people with
instruments sitting in

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:41.260
four separate sections
of the plane, it's

00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:42.830
probably a string quartet.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.860
And not speaking
to each other.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:46.560
But we do spend a lot
of time together.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.030
And the four of us can go into
a wonderful setting like this

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.790
here at Google.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.050
We can go in, as we do,
through San Francisco

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.760
Performances, through
so many other means.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.130
Into classrooms, into inner
city schools to play in an

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:03.950
even closer setting than this--
children, high school

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.870
students, who perhaps never had
the opportunity to hear

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.010
something like this in their
lives, and they stand or sit

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.840
three feet away from Sandy's
cello or something.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.030
They can feel the vibrations in
a way that their electronic

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.400
reproductions just don't give
when they listen to music, and

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.560
it becomes an extraordinary
visceral experience.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.870
So the quartet as an art form is
a lot easier to get around

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.210
than a symphony.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:28.670
The repertoire is vast.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.050
Not to be mistaken that I
don't value symphonic

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.160
repertoire, or other things.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.700
You don't have to tune it like
a piano-- you just tune 16

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.850
strings instead of 600.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.170
But now it's your turn.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.950
If you have any questions at
all, anything you've been

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.640
dying to know, anything
you'd like to--

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.150
please.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:49.070
Can you tell us a bit more about
the circumstances under

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.480
which some of the early quartets
of Mozart, Haydn,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.540
Beethoven, were performed?

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:55.960
Were they done for members of
the public, or for friends?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.480
Did they do an entire couple of
quartets in an evening, or

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.000
did they just play in
[INAUDIBLE] movements?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.410
Things like that.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.330
PAUL YARBROUGH: Well,
great question.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.720
Something we have to bear in
mind when we play this music,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.440
that it was almost entirely
inaccessible to the general

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.070
public, really.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.660
It was the domain of
the aristocracy.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:20.940
These were people who lived in
palaces, and had the funds to

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.630
have a retinue of musicians,
perhaps in their employ.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:31.480
Or they were just from finer
families in Vienna who would

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.940
have musicales and would
invite the interesting

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.910
musicians of the day to come
and perform in their home.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.390
And if you were fortunate enough
to have an invitation,

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.700
you could hear the music.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.430
Or if you were among the very
few people, but a growing

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.770
class of people, who actually
were beginning to rise up into

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.400
a sort of a beginning middle
class, and those people could

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.890
actually afford to learn to play
instruments and enjoy the

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.820
music in their own--

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.650
this music has two purposes.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.270
One is a performance aspect,
and the other is a

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:08.760
participation aspect.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:14.700
And so during the early years,
it was considered a mark of

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.870
very good training and breeding
that you could take a

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:22.260
hand and play a part in the
string quartet with other

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:27.260
people who are like minded, and
that was a sort of, you

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:32.370
might say, kind of an
enlightenment idea, that

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.860
everyone could play and
participate in this music,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.160
which is such a rarefied
thing.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.390
And those people, when they came
to hear a concert or a

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:44.730
performance of some kind,
had high expectations.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:48.820
They knew the music, how it
would be structured, what was

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.110
likely to be the formal
structure of each of the

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.120
movements in the quartet.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:58.640
And there wasn't the same
prohibition against clapping

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.230
between movements, or even, at
that point, during movements.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:06.220
If you were turned on by
something that was done in the

00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:10.540
moment, just like you would in
a jazz performance, somebody

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.850
takes a solo and everybody
claps, and then it moves on.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.420
But that was not so unusual
in those times.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:25.190
Now it's become very stiff,
which we try, to some extent,

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:31.040
to counteract the stuffiness
or formality of classical

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.920
music concerts.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.760
On the other hand, we
appreciate, too, when people

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.920
are really attentive and silent,
and not clinking

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.980
glasses and talking loudly
and so forth.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.810
So I know some of the jazz
musicians, we say, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.700
club environment is so cool.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:49.720
It seems so personal
and so unstuffy.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.310
And they say, yeah, but people
are drinking and talking while

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:53.730
you're playing.

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.560
They kind of crave
what we have--

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.960
the silent audience
in a concert hall.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:00.910
I hope I answered your
question adequately.

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:03.100
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: There's also
some wonderful stories of the

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.170
composers themselves
playing together--

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.200
Mozart and Haydn getting
together, reading through

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.910
their latest string quartets,
and that's kind of how they

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:12.270
communicated.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.800
It was like, I can do that
better than you kind of thing.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:19.330
But, I mean, for us, musicians,
thinking about

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.490
being a fly on the wall,
watching some of these reading

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:23.070
sessions, is just amazing.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.870
I wish I could go back and see
what that must have been like

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:28.340
during first performances
of those works.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:32.000
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious if
you could comment on--

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.040
there's a lot of discussion
about the impact of technology

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.150
on the music industry lately,
and the transition to digital.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.505
And a lot of that is more about
popular music, and I

00:39:40.505 --> 00:39:42.760
know classical is sort of a much
smaller niche in terms of

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.560
the recording industry.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.560
But if you could comment on what
impact that's had on your

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.650
career, which has obviously
spanned that transition, and

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:50.910
also how you feel like
it's impacted

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:53.110
classical music overall.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.340
SANDY WILSON: I think
very well.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.870
I think we're still here,
we're thriving.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.250
We actually--

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:01.450
over 30 years, we've certainly
seen a lot of changes.

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.050
It's a hell of a lot less
expensive to record now, and

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.640
the ability to record really
well, and to control the

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:17.290
circumstances under which your
work is encoded for posterity.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:20.550
We have a lot more influence
over that.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.140
Of course, it's prolific.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.460
And the ability to saturate the
market with substandard

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.600
work is unfortunate.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:33.890
PAUL YARBROUGH: Along those
lines, we actually, after many

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:38.100
unfortunate experiences of
recording and trying to have

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:45.210
our work distributed well, and
nurtured, if you will, after

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:49.320
the fact of our making
recordings, we decided the

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.810
only alternative was to
make our own company.

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:58.470
So we started our own record
label about 20 years ago.

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:02.990
We have done work for other
labels, but we pride ourselves

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:11.230
in this set of recordings that
we've made, and the amount of

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:15.420
time and love we lavish
on these projects--

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:20.280
not only the musical side of it,
but also the information

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.790
inside the booklets, and the
photography, and the graphic

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:25.040
design, and everything.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.090
We read now that most people
under a certain age have never

00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.580
even bought a CD.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.040
They get everything
electronically, and probably

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.110
without paying for it.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.450
So that's a matter
of some concern.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:47.730
But I still think there are a
lot of people who like the

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:52.350
physical, the tangible product,
and don't mind buying

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.520
it and keeping it.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:00.490
Maybe then they put it on their
different devices and

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:05.260
use it in different ways, but I,
for one, still like to sit

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.270
down and look at liner notes
while I listen to a piece of

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:13.370
music, and enjoy whatever
commentary the artists

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:16.750
themselves might have included
in the booklet.

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:19.900
So hopefully there's still going
to be a market for just

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.630
hard products of recordings.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:28.260
But the other thing is, we do
have to be a little bit

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.250
involved in this change, in the

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.510
revolution that's involved.

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:42.430
We play 250-year-old
instruments, and 200 and

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.730
something year old music a
lot of the time, and all.

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:50.410
But we're still 21st century
artists, and we need to be up

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.930
to date, at least somewhat.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.290
Anyway, I don't know
if that's a good--

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:56.980
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: I want to
add that my friends who've

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.710
done very well, often in
[INAUDIBLE], have all been

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:05.380
buying vinyl, and paying a lot
of money, in some cases, for

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.600
record covers that have smudges
on them and other

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.580
things, sometimes with great
history-- which you can't do

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.150
with certain other things.

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.060
So it's kind of--

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.020
I know it's a small niche, but
it's an interesting thing.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.940
And a lot of the great recording
engineers we work

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:23.100
say that the analog still is
their preferred mode of

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.580
listening to things.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.300
And so it depends on
who you talk to.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.320
But the control issue that
Sandy [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.130
I mean, we did a Beethoven cycle
for BMG years ago, and I

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.350
think at a certain point,
it just got buried.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:42.150
And they owned it anywhere in
the universe, in any format.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:45.820
And then when we did our own,
they rereleased our old one to

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.230
try to compete with it.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.340
And that's just the way
the world works.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.920
But we had the choice
to do our own.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.140
And as Paul also mentioned,
old music.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.720
But we do a lot of new music,
too, and are able to

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:59.030
commission works through
friends, and

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.830
through other means--

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:01.490
foundations.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.460
And that's a very vital thing--
part of what we feel

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:08.170
is that the quartet shouldn't
be a museum piece.

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.340
It really should be living
today as well.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.850
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: I want to say
also, of course, wonderful

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:20.350
technologies that are costly,
and therefore, I think they

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:25.010
still remain in the domain
of the major mega labels.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.520
But we have had a chance to do
some surround sound recordings

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:34.240
recently, 24-bit, the extra
dimensions, and we actually

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.750
haven't heard the results
of that yet.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.210
So the vote's still out on
whether it's something we

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.060
should aspire to.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.930
But I know that there are
wonderful technologies.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:45.600
One thing that we would love to
try to figure out how to do

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:50.800
is to manage to record in an
acoustical setting in a way

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:52.650
that we could isolate
our voices.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.030
Sort of in a pie
sort of sense.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:03.330
So you can do music minus
one, or two, or three.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:08.170
And I know an awful lot of
very accomplished amateur

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:12.240
musicians would love
to sit in.

00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.790
So we've yet to figure out
how to manage that.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:15.510
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: Or
if he just got tired

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.070
of hearing me play.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:16.220
SANDY WILSON: Quadrophonic.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.640
Yeah.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.690
But the act of actually doing it
is still a challenge, with

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:24.950
accomplishing that isolation
and still keeping the

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.170
sightlines and--

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:30.210
anyway, that's just things
to play around with.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:31.520
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:34.730
One is that I'm very curious
about your individual

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:35.680
instruments.

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.680
If you can show us, and then
maybe tell me about those

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.420
things-- like, how many years
old, and how you like it, and

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.350
kind of stuff.

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.560
And the other thing is that I
was sitting over there, and

00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.200
there was a speaker there.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.140
It really magnifies the music in
one way or another, and I'm

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.350
really, really curious to see
without anything at all.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:58.850
And then what it used to be,
when they had in a castle, in

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:00.830
a [? new ?] room, and
listening to.

00:46:00.830 --> 00:46:03.180
So I was wondering if we can get
the opportunity to have to

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.490
have that experience.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.890
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: I'll give it
a shot, like the emperor's

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.090
new clothes.

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:08.120
First, about the instruments.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.080
You want to start?

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.530
Start with the first violin.

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.335
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: This is a
modern fiddle made in 1992, by

00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:15.340
a German maker named
Michael Fisher.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.880
It's a copy of a [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.550
SANDY WILSON: You
played that--

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.360
we actually played
at the Library of

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.060
Congress quite recently.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.700
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: There's a real
model at the Library of

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.370
Congress that was owned by Fritz
Kreisler that I played

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.920
on a couple years ago, which
is-- when I played on it, I

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.170
was like, wow.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:36.440
It's like my old violin.

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:40.890
So I was quite pleased to
play on that violin.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.120
SANDY WILSON: The security
folks were kind of--

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.800
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: They were
watching me pretty closely.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:45.480
SANDY WILSON: Very careful.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.680
Try to get out of the Library
of Congress with a fiddle.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:48.930
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: That'd
be a great movie.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.420
Strip search on aisle three.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.990
But this violin was made by a
maker named Francis Kuttner.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:02.560
He lives in San Francisco,
and in Cremona, Italy.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.180
Most of the time in Cremona.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:09.270
And he made this violin
in 2006 for me.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.380
He made a set of instruments for
a good friend of ours that

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.980
we've actually recorded a number
of CDs on that were

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.060
modeled on the Stradivari
instruments.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.080
This one is more
his own design.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.300
And Sandy plays, also, I'll just
tie that in, on a cello

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.320
by Francis Kuttner
but much older.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:30.280
SANDY WILSON: Well,
this one is 1980.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.240
I didn't buy it in 1980.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.170
I acquired this just about five
years ago, and I still

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:40.205
have a lovely 1702
cello at home.

00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:42.873
And if ever you want to buy
a nice 19th century French

00:47:42.873 --> 00:47:45.630
cello, see me afterwards.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:50.490
But this was the gold medal
winner in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:56.520
violin building competition in
that year, and I love it.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.110
We can tell you a little bit
about why we play modern

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.050
instruments--

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:02.610
some of us.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.060
PAUL YARBROUGH: Or
why I don't.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:04.960
SANDY WILSON: He can't
afford it.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.300
He wouldn't have paid them
enough, actually.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.950
PAUL YARBROUGH: This is the only
instrument in the quartet

00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:15.480
that actually could have
participated in the premier

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:19.380
performance of any of these
works that we play today,

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:24.100
because it was made in
1750 in Genoa, Italy.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.785
The maker's name is Costello.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.640
I play modern instruments, too,
from time to time, and I

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.580
often love them very much.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.180
It's sort of a myth
that the only good

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.990
instruments are old ones.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:49.260
Instruments do tend to improve
with age, but if they weren't

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:52.020
really great to start with,
they're not going to become

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.960
great with time.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:58.280
So finding an instrument that's
really right for you as

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.270
an individual that you're
able to express

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.720
yourself on is the trick.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:10.520
And if you're lucky enough to
be able to find a new one,

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.680
that's nice, because it's
a lot less expensive.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.790
The old ones are very valuable
for antique and collectible

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:22.920
reasons, but not necessarily for
the quality of the sound

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.810
that they make.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.680
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: With the
exception of the really great

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.380
ones, and we're talking about
instruments, in many cases,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.260
that are Stradivari and
[INAUDIBLE] instruments that

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.750
are valued at about $5
millsion, $6 million.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:39.530
And none of us want to sell
our children or pets or

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:40.450
anything to buy them.

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.650
PAUL YARBROUGH: I don't
think my kids would

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:43.340
bring that much, actually.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.480
But I'd think about it.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.330
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: But
they are magnificent.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.380
I have to say that when we get
together and play with friends

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.530
who do play on these
instruments, and hear them

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:55.910
side by side, these
do very well.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.100
You asked an important
question.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.830
Do we love them, or how
do we like them?

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:02.470
And the answer is I really
do love the instrument.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.760
And all of us have played on
some older instruments-- and

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.110
I'm also selling an instrument,
not here, today.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.750
But it's because I think it
should be played by a young

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.390
player that really loves it.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:17.590
And I don't need to have more
than one instrument.

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:20.050
I also have another instrument
that's in that set that we use

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:23.790
quite often, and its model, as
I said, is on the Stradivari,

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:24.810
and it's a little brighter.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:27.680
And as a second violinist, I
tend more to use it in the

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.710
quartet, and right now, it's
getting a new bridge on it.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:32.840
Francis has flown in from
Cremona for a few weeks.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.130
So I play on this,
which is my own.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:36.210
But I love them both.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.950
And we have to make sure that
our colleagues are happy with

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:40.960
our instruments, whether
we like it or not.

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.710
The four of us are practically
married in that regard.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.590
And if things aren't happy at
home, it's just not happy.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:49.650
So when I was buying this
violin, Sandy said--

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.860
I wasn't quite sure if I was
going to buy an instrument,

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.450
and Sandy said, it'll make
your life a lot easier.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.380
And sometimes it does.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.870
But you wanted to hear them
without any amplification.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:01.120
I think we can do that.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:10.000
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.870
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: This won't
be a listening quiz.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:19.140
This will be first part
of the second movement

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.940
of the Mozart quartet.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.190

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:34.970
And this is a lovely space,
and we do appreciate our

00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:36.220
fantastic engineer.

00:51:38.545 --> 00:51:39.539
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:39.539 --> 00:51:41.030
SANDY WILSON: Just want
to do [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.280
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: Yeah.

00:51:44.509 --> 00:53:51.190
[MUSIC - MOZART]

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:52.120
PAUL YARBROUGH: Better
with, or without?

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:53.560
AUDIENCE: Without.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.078
PAUL YARBROUGH: Number
two, OK.

00:53:55.078 --> 00:53:56.910
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: You
have a question.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.650
AUDIENCE: So I remember when I
was studying chamber music, my

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.550
group would listen to tons of
recordings of other groups

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:05.250
playing the same pieces, and
evaluate them, and decide

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.780
which one we liked best, and
watch tons of YouTube videos

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:09.510
of different performances.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.380
But I was wondering,
what's your, like--

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:12.550
an established quartet?

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.830
Do you ever go check out the
Saint Lawrence Quartet in

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.310
residency at Stanford to hear
some of their performances?

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:21.190
Or I know members of the San
Francisco Company sometimes do

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:23.460
Sunday chamber music
performances for fun.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.006
Do you ever listen to
any of those, or--

00:54:26.006 --> 00:54:27.180
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: That's
a great question.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.310
I don't know the Saint
Lawrence--

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:29.560
I'm just kidding.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.600
It's funny.

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.540
Yes and no.

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:39.550
Part of it's-- some of us
do, more than others.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:40.690
Some of us--

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:47.350
sometimes Zak, who knows how
to use YouTube and other

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.640
things will send us things
to listen to.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.780
I used to listen quite a bit.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.490
When we first started, and the
quartet lived in New York, I

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:56.640
would go here a number of
quartets, because you'd just

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.460
walk out your door in Lincoln
Center, and hear all your

00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.950
colleagues, and see them.

00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:03.610
Now I tend to just bump into
people in airports and chat

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.630
about families and kids
and old teachers.

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:11.540
But it is important, I
think, to listen to

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.300
other artists play.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:16.870
In my particular situation, my
feeling is, I listen to other

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.790
works in other genres outside
of the string quartet.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:25.170
I'll do a lot more listening
to songs, opera, by these

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:28.470
various composers, and we
all like a lot of music.

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:31.240
And there's only so much
time in the day.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.250
And also, if I want to listen
to something in my car, it's

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.940
usually going to be what my
kids want to listen to.

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.280
I have a 7-year-old and a
14-year-old, so you can use

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.830
your imagination.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.910
It's not Mozart's
string quartets.

00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:45.100
Even though they like
to come once in a

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.510
while to the concert.

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.400
But I do occasionally hear
things, and the answer is, I

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.770
do learn from my colleagues,
and from young groups that

00:55:52.770 --> 00:55:53.500
come and play for us.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:55.470
We've had a couple of groups
like the [INAUDIBLE] and

00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:57.030
others that have
worked with us.

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:58.850
They've become world
class ensembles.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:00.520
And they will send us things.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.680
Zak is working on producing
their first recording.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.100
And I learn a lot from
hearing other people.

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:11.850
But I don't particularly
spend a lot of time.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:13.580
I think you listen more.

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.020
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: I listen
a fair amount still.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:18.720
When I was a student, I used to
listen to recordings quite

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.780
a bit, and I still have
a lot of recordings

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.630
that I go back to.

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:26.230
I don't listen as much
as I did in the past.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.700
I probably would like
to listen to more.

00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:31.250
Going to live concerts, probably
hardly ever nowadays,

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.060
mostly because we're so busy.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.760
We're so busy teaching, we're
so busy rehearsing, playing

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.790
our own concerts.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.790
And I don't know if I had the
free time, if I would

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:43.570
necessarily want to go to
see string quartets.

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.190
I think since we spend so much
time doing it ourselves, like

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:49.680
what Fred said, kind of getting
away from what we do

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.380
every day is kind of nice.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.640
But I spend a fair amount of
time on YouTube, and watch

00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:58.020
videos, and listen
to recordings.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:57:00.790
It's fun, when I do have
the time late at night.

00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:03.110
SANDY WILSON: I have
to chime in.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:07.580
Recently, there was a movie,
some of you may have seen it,

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.285
called A Late Quartet.

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:16.560
It was mostly in art cinema
houses and such, but Philip

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.680
Seymour Hoffman and Christopher
Walken were in

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.600
this movie.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.780
They were both in the
string quartet.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:27.700
And I went, at the sort of
urging of a friend of mine,

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.990
who really wanted to see it and
really wanted me to come

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:32.150
and see it, too, with her.

00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:33.450
And so I went.

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:37.950
And I thought I was going to
hate it, because I thought it

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.950
was just going to be baloney.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.200
It's not really like
this, you know?

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.500
And of course, then you have
to watch these people who

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.700
don't really play instruments
pretend to be playing

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.160
instruments, which is kind
of painful for us.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.300
But in the end, I really thought
it was terrific.

00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:55.870
I haven't been able
to persuade anyone

00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:57.040
else to go see it.

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.010
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: I went
to see it, and it

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.060
wasn't showing anymore.

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:00.640
SANDY WILSON: Yeah.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.470
But it really was quite
well done, I thought.

00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:07.550
And they did a lot of fact
checking, and they must have

00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:12.440
had some great consultation to
get the internal things in

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.370
quartets kind of right.

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:15.460
It was funny--

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:19.080
one of the first scenes, there's
some problem after

00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.980
which we discover that the
cellist has incipient

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.000
Parkinson's disease.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.010
But the first violinist stops,
and he says, our vibratos

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.560
aren't matching.

00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:33.340
And I went, like, did
I hear him say that?

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:35.150
Because it's exactly
the thing that we

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:37.830
would say to one another.

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:39.890
So they really did do
a good job in that.

00:58:39.890 --> 00:58:42.590
I had to tell you about that,
because I thought that movie

00:58:42.590 --> 00:58:47.340
was very insightful for
what you asked.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:51.920
Do we still immerse ourselves
in all this stuff?

00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:53.740
And to some extent, we do.

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.741
But also, we need a break.

00:58:56.741 --> 00:58:57.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:59.010
Thank you very much.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.730
How have your careers evolved
differently than, perhaps, the

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:05.830
vision that you set yourselves
when you first started?

00:59:05.830 --> 00:59:10.250
And as you're trying to
establish yourselves as young

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:15.760
artists, what hurdles did you
face that perhaps surprised

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.330
you, and you had to find
creative solutions for?

00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:23.440
SANDY WILSON: Well, if you had
told me when I was 19 years

00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:29.800
old that at the age I am now,
which I won't say, that I

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:34.350
would be playing in a string
quartet, performing widely,

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:39.470
teaching at a university,
teaching music, and making a

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:42.660
living, I would've said
where do I sign?

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:47.440
I mean, this life that I live
is almost exactly what I

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.660
dreamt of as a young musician
starting out.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.760
So I'm really very,
very fortunate.

00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:59.450
As far as the challenges that
we face, I think the hardest

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:02.790
part has always been that
as a quartet you're

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:04.930
like a small startup--

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.770
a business where you can't
afford to just do your own

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:11.320
narrow area of expertise.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.760
You have to wear
a lot of hats.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.210
And everybody has to be willing
to do things that

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:19.780
weren't necessarily part
of their curriculum and

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.420
conservatory.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:28.900
Like, think about finances and
grant applications, and how to

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:34.000
organize students into chamber
music ensembles, and keep the

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.150
ruffled feathers from
flaring up.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:43.210
And I mean, we do a lot of
things for ourselves.

01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:48.340
We book our own travel, we drive
our own rental cars.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:54.260
And everything is kind
of small scale.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:01:00.150
And if you like that, if that
kind of endeavor is

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:02.730
fulfilling, then
this is great.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:06.100
If you really hate doing
anything for yourself--

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.640
I mean, the symphony musicians,
they sit their

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.960
suitcases outside their hotel
room, and someone picks it up

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.120
and puts it in the truck, and
they show up when they're

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:21.070
supposed to be there and play
their instruments, and that's

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:21.770
pretty much it.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.710
They don't really need to do
all these other things.

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:27.930
For us, it's impossible for
us to hire people to do

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:29.230
everything that we need to do.

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:33.480
So as a small business, we're
kind of on our own.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.010
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: I never
thought I would agree 100%

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:38.000
with Paul, because in a string
quartet, you hardly do.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.330
But actually, I think he said
it quite beautifully.

01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:44.080
I grew up watching two things
growing up in Boston-- the

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.360
Boston Celtics, and the great
string quartets that came

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:51.360
through to Harvard University
and to Jordan

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.220
Hall, and other things.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.330
And it was my dream to play
second violin in one of the

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.650
great quartets, because I was
enamored with some of the

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:57.190
second violinists.

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:01.200
So my other side of that was the
Boston Celtics, but I was

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.760
a little challenged in
some areas there.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.430
So I play in other
types of parquet

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.300
floors, but with a violin.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:12.050
So actually, I think when I
joined the quartet-- that's

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:12.730
another thing about--

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:14.810
I talked to my brothers, who
are in business and in

01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:15.560
software and in other things.

01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.700
And another thing about
the quartet--

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:20.200
when I joined this quartet, I
fully anticipated that I would

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:24.840
lose a little hair, become
gray, and see myself--

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.340
I saw myself as a lifetime
commitment.

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.260
It was 26 years ago when
I joined these guys.

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.490
And I haven't changed that sense
of commitment to it.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:37.460
We do from time to time get
upset with each other.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.690
We function as a group,
like a democracy.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:43.580
But we don't have
majority rule.

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.780
All four of us have to agree
100% on every decision we

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:50.130
make, whether it's where we
play, what fee we accept, what

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.840
airline we fly, or we fly
separate flights.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.950
All this stuff, we have to agree
100%, or we don't do it.

01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.930
So three to one doesn't win.

01:02:58.930 --> 01:03:02.380
So that also has kept us very
vested in what we do.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.060
But as far as a career, as far
as the dreams of a young kid--

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.450
I mean, until I look in the
mirror, I still think I'm like

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.800
16 or 17 years old.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.040
And according to my wife,
I act a little younger.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.990
So I fully anticipate, as Paul
said, I would be doing this.

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:18.930
I would be here with you all
today, playing Schubert and

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:20.210
Mozart, and loving it.

01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:21.640
So I'm pretty lucky.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:26.790
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming today.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.640
I was wondering if you could
comment on the sort of

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.020
interplay between technique and
musicality, and whether

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:35.830
you're making decisions based on
expediency, or based on the

01:03:35.830 --> 01:03:37.710
quality of the music.

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.100
ZAKARIAS GRAFILO: That's a
really great question, and I

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.980
think that's something that we,
as professional musicians,

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.570
struggle with throughout
our careers--

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:49.920
trying to find ways to be
efficient, but still

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:51.170
speak to the music.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.380
I don't know if I have a
real answer for you.

01:03:56.380 --> 01:03:58.310
I think it's something
that, like I said, we

01:03:58.310 --> 01:03:59.890
struggle with every day.

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:03.100
We rehearse every day for four
or five hours in the morning,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:05.630
and these are the kinds of
things that we talk about.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:10.670
We're constantly checking
each other.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:13.220
Is this a good musical idea?

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:16.180
Does this make sense
interpretively?

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:19.000
But we are also talking about
mechanics, too-- the mechanics

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.230
of playing together, the
mechanics of playing in tune,

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:22.790
the mechanics of matching
our vibratos,

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:24.670
matching the bow speeds.

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:26.890
So there's always
a balance there

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:28.580
between those two things.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:32.140
The mechanics of playing and
playing together, and being

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:36.510
musical, and interpreting the
music the best possible way.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:39.490
SANDY WILSON: It's something
that's particularly rewarding,

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:45.170
when you do it in an intimate
team like this with three

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:45.730
other people.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:50.520
Because you draw on the
amplitudes and the strengths

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.335
of one another.

01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:54.870
There are some things that
somebody's going to hate to

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:58.180
do, but that somebody else just
loves to roll up their

01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.070
sleeves and get in with that.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:06.860
So we might have the intonation
Nazi, or the

01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.860
vibrato Nazi, or the guy who's
going to say, no, we just have

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:10.540
to routine this.

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:11.420
We're going to slow this down.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.070
We're doing this spot, we're
doing that spot.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:18.640
But the process, we've
refined it.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.756
There are certainly some times
when we're really under the

01:05:20.756 --> 01:05:22.685
gun, and we go into the practice
room and say, we

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:23.900
really have to microwave this.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:27.020
We're not going to
make it on time.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.820
We pull extra rehearsals.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.520
We do what we have to do,
and our families pay.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.020
I mean, they really--

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.310
it's a family business.

01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:40.020
We all have spouses and
kids, and it's tough.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:45.160
I don't think that many
orchestral musicians--

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:45.860
professionals--

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:50.410
really understand what the life
of the string quartet is.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:54.730
They will tell us, and we'll nod
in appreciation when they

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.840
tell us, oh, you guys
are so lucky.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.090
It's just fantastic--

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.680
you're doing everything
we wanted to do.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.240
But it's like, as Paul says, I
mean, these guys just show up

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.120
at the concert.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:07.080
The bus takes them there, and
their tailcoats are already

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.930
pressed, their shoes
are polished.

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.170
They just have to go out,
play the concert,

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:13.340
and then that's it.

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:14.740
It's not like that.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.790
This is really--

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:18.650
it's a grind.

01:06:18.650 --> 01:06:25.580
But the reward is that we are
all doing exactly what I think

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:30.210
we aspired to do, even if
we didn't know we did.

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:33.490
It's so satisfying,
to go to work and

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:37.110
to have people applaud.

01:06:37.110 --> 01:06:40.280
It's a wonderful privilege.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.190
And I think we recognize
it as a privilege.

01:06:42.190 --> 01:06:44.640
We really do recognize
we're also--

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.940
we've been very lucky to be
still doing this into our

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.600
fourth decade now.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.530
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: I think the
great thing about the quartet,

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:53.910
and I think why a lot of young
people get excited about it,

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.560
is that you are a member
of a team.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560
You're part of an ensemble.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.860
But you're also a soloist,
because of the transparency.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.580
You're the only one
who's playing

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.270
that part in the group.

01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:06.700
And so you have really the
best of both worlds.

01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:08.480
And it's a fine balancing act.

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.620
I also have to say, much
like Sandy just said--

01:07:12.620 --> 01:07:14.530
I used to play for [INAUDIBLE]
in the Boston Symphony.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:16.550
When my colleagues come and hear
us play, or hear us on

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:18.580
the radio, or hear one of our
recordings, and they say,

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.720
you've gotten so much better.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.230
I can't imagine how bad
I was at the time.

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:27.660
But it it's really a testament
to the kind of criticism--

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:31.700
daily criticism, and support
that we get from one another.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.040
Because we know that you
have to balance--

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.450
and I think it's true in any
business-- you have to balance

01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:40.450
how hard you push each other and
the effectiveness with the

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:42.640
overall health of the
organization.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:45.340
And we're not an organization
where people quit very often,

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.240
or resign, or leave.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.710
There've been very few changes
in the quartet.

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:54.410
I'm the second second violinist
in 31 years, and Zak

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:59.260
is maybe the fourth
first violinist.

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.663
The first one didn't stay very
long, the second one did for a

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:06.960
few years, and the third
one 10 years out.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.370
But we go through first
violinists.

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:11.480
But we've also known
Zak a long time.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.410
We've known him since he was
a kid in San Francisco.

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:18.819
So it's a real balancing
act in the work

01:08:18.819 --> 01:08:19.779
that we have to do.

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:21.410
Thank you for having us today.

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:23.630
The San Francisco
Performance--

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.210
Virginia-- for bringing
us down here.

01:08:26.210 --> 01:08:28.609
We don't live that far away, so
if you ever want to have us

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:31.550
back, I think you know
how to find us.

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:34.540
And you can Google us
and find out more.

01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.500
I always wanted to
say that there.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.549
Because it's just part
of our life.

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:42.630
And, I mean, my kids think
they're so smart, because they

01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:43.779
can Google everything.

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:46.979
And that's not a substitute
for intelligence, but it's

01:08:46.979 --> 01:08:48.340
very useful.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:50.600
But it's really been
a pleasure.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.359
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:53.810
doesn't know what he's
talking about.

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.260
FREDERICK LIFSITZ: Yeah.

01:08:56.260 --> 01:09:00.700
And thank you, Cliff, so
much for all this.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.029
So we'll be packing
our things up.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:05.140
If you want to take a look at
the instruments, or chat a

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.069
little bit, some of us won't be
running right out the door.

01:09:08.069 --> 01:09:09.970
So thank you.
