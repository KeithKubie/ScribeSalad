00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.260
If you want to disguise
your blowgun, you can also use

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.100
camouflage that matches 
the environment you're in.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.460
[Captions by Mike R. at Y Translator]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.440
Hey guys. I'm Nate.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.590
Welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.420
Today, we're gonna take 
a look at another DIY weapon.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.780
We're going to be building a 
blowgun out of a cereal box.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.420
Here's what we're gonna need 
for this build: a cereal box, of course,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.200
preferably one of the taller ones.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.249
This is an 18-ounce box of cereal.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.779
We've got some tape, 
some paper clips, Post-It notes,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.220
bamboo skewers, 
a few straws and a glue gun.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.160
We'll also be using some scissors, 
a ruler and a razor blade.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.200
The first step is to take 
the  cereal out of the box.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.970
We actually just need the 
cardboard that the box is made of,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.500
so put the cereal aside 
and  use it another time.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.880
With our box nice and empty, we now want
to break it down so it's all one flat sheet.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.320
Our cereal box is now open, 
it's flat, and we can cut out

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.840
the pieces that we need from
these flat sheets of cardboard.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.780
We want to cut out a 
rectangle that's three inches wide

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.760
and as long as we can get in 
one unbent piece of cardboard.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.860
To start, let's remove the 
flaps around this larger triangle.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.060
With the flaps removed, we can 
measure off a three-inch width,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600
and we'll cut that rectangle 
out of this piece of cardboard.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.480
We now need to score lines 
into it and fold it into a triangle.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.640
We want to measure off four equal 
sized portions within this three inch strip.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.100
So, let's mark off 
every three-quarter inches,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.740
and score the cardboard at that width.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.000
When I say score, what I mean
is that we'll take the razor blade,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.040
we'll line the ruler up on those lines,

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.909
and we'll drag the razor 
blade across the cardboard,

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.329
but not hard enough to cut all the way through.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.789
We only want the cut to go about 
halfway through the cardboard,

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.670
and that will let us bend the 
cardboard perfectly along the lines.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.640
We can see that there's clearly 
a mark in the cardboard,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.660
but it hasn't separated into two pieces.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.700
It's all still very much one piece.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.080
Let's do that for the other
two lines, as well.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.940
It's now easy to see that we have
four equal portions of our cardboard,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.380
and we now want to fold 
along each of those lines

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.140
folding into the shiny printed side.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.200
Use the ruler to sort of push along the 
edge so it's all folding at the same time.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220
You can see how nicely it 
folds along the spot

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.840
where I've scored the cardboard.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.660
We now have our cardboard that's been
scored and folded all the way around.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.340
So, now we need to glue it together
but we're not gonna go for the square,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.220
we're actually going to 
overlap two of the pieces

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.790
and fold it into a triangular-prism shape.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.640
With the cardboard folded, we'll use 
the hot-glue gun to keep it closed.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.480
If you don't have access to a hot-glue gun,
you can use

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.860
strong tape for this step, as well.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.060
We now have our triangular-prism shape
that will work as our blowgun.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.500
Let's add a few features that will make
our blowgun function a little bit nicer.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.740
Let's grab one of our paper clips
and bend the very end of it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.460
at about a 90ยบ angle.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.760
Using some tape, we now want
to secure this paper clip to the

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.100
bottom of one side of the prism.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.260
This is going to act as 
sort of a safety guard

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.310
that makes it so when 
we use our blow darts,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.340
they can only go into the gun 
but they can't come back out.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.610
I could probably use 
scotch tape for this step.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.660
But you know here at the King of Random,
we do love electrical tape.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
Now that's attached.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.600
And let's actually add another 
layer of tape beyond that,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.390
not to hold the paper clip down,

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.700
but as sort of a mouth guard.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.040
This is cardboard, and if we 
put our mouth on it too much,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.610
it's gonna end up getting soggy.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.770
The waterproof nature of the 
tape will help prevent it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.120
from deforming with extended use.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.390
The basic blowgun is built, and now
we need some darts that go with it.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.130
Let's grab our Post-It notes 
and some bamboo skewers.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.760
Peel off a single Post-It 
note and try to roll

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.290
it into a fairly tight cone shape.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.220
Now, Post-It notes are sticky, 
but they're not so sticky that

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.540
they'll hold themselves 
when they're tightly coiled.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.020
So let's add a bit of 
clear tape onto this cone.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.140
Now, we need to get this cone 
shape to fit into this blowgun.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.680
They're obviously not the same size.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.800
But what we can do is, using the end
that doesn't have a paper clip on it,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.980
press the cone down into the 
blowgun until it's filling all the way

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.740
to the edges of our triangle.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.260
Using a pen, mark off where 
the paper meets the cardboard tube.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.560
Now, we'll use our pair of scissors 
to cut off the excess paper.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.400
That should give us a cone 
with a triangle profile

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.980
that fits perfectly into our blowgun.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.979
A little cone of paper isn't  gonna
travel very far or very fast though,

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.020
and that's where the
bamboo skewers come in.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.350
Let's cut off a piece about two inches long
from the pointy end of our bamboo skewer.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.300
There should be a small hole 
in the tip of the cone.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.259
But if it's not quite big enough
for the bamboo skewer to fit through.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.610
Just widen it a little bit 
with a pair of scissors,

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.039
fit the bamboo skewer until most of it

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.690
is protruding out of the 
front of the paper cone,

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.160
and then secure it in place 
with some more tape.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.260
There's one dart.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300
Let's make three more.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.640
We've got some darts made

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.740
and we've got a blowgun made,

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.169
let's test one of these darts 
out and see if it's working.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.440
So, we've got our little guard 
that will stop our dart

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.860
from coming out of the gun backwards,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.380
but we should be able to just push 
the dart right into the gun past that guard.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.680
Let's see if our blowgun can
drive one of these little darts

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.900
into this piece of foam core board.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000
Boom! 
Look at that.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.240
That stabbed right through it.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.780
Beautiful. So, we know that works.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.140
Our darts are just sort of laying around,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.760
so, let's build a mechanism 
that lets us attach them

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.520
to the side of our gun 
for easy reloading.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.610
We've got a lot of cereal box left,
let's cut out another rectangle

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.180
from one of these smaller pieces.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.640
This one 2 1/4 inches wide 
by 3 inches long.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.180
We now want to cut this
rectangle into three equal strips,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.600
each one 3/4 inches wide 
and 3 inches long.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.340
With our three strips cut out, 
we now want to score and

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.660
fold them the same way that 
we did with the blowgun body.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.900
Before we glue these 
three pieces closed, though,

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:07.270
we want to add a small 
section of drinking straw

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.780
into the corner of each one.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.940
Let's cut off three pieces of 
drinking straw that match

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.080
the width of these โ
3/4 of an inch.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.640
Of course, you don't have 
to do different colors,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.700
but I have them available and I do 
like having different colors of things.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.460
Let's use a small dab of 
hot glue in the center crease

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.939
to attach our straw pieces.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:25.909
Remember that they will be attached.

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.279
And then fold it into 
a complete triangle, so,

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:30.800
we don't want to glue them
with the cardboard wide open.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.639
We want to glue it with the 
cardboard already pinched at an angle.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.879
Once the straw is attached to the center 
piece, we can use a little bit more glue

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.480
to glue these two outside tabs together.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.229
We can now attach these three triangles
to the outside of the body of the gun.

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.540
Position them so that the 
straw is on the outside portion

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.560
and not one of the inside corners.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.050
We can now have one dart loaded 
into the barrel of our gun

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.259
and three additional darts 
pressed into the straws

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.509
on the side of those prisms 
that we just added.

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:07.520
Now, when we're ready to reload, 
we can just grab another dart

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.420
and fit it into the back of the gun.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.160
At this point, our blowgun is 
functional, but it looks pretty bland.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.260
It's just cardboard colored.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.620
So, let's get some tape and see
if we can't decorate this thing a bit.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.300
I think that's looking quite a bit more 
stylish, but I don't want to quite finish yet.

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.080
There's a few more design 
elements that I want to add on.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.210
When Grant showed you how to build
the laser-assisted PVC blowgun,

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.710
he had a laser pointer added on,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:47.740
and I think we can do the same thing
to take this up to another level.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.509
Here's the laser pointer that we will be
mounting to the side of this blowgun.

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:52.460
It's got a nice, bright green dot.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.380
Should show up nicely even 
in pretty light conditions.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.640
A couple of side-mounted supports 
should help keep the laser pointer

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.580
nicely centered on the blowgun.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.280
Our cereal box blowgun 
is looking quite good.

00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:23.270
It's decorated. It can
hold three extra darts.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.629
It has a laser sight on it.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:28.080
At this point, what we need is 
a target to shoot it at,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.480
something more interesting than
a blank piece of foam core board.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.640
I've printed out this picture of a zombie,
and we're gonna try mounting that

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.880
to a piece of this board

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.180
so we have something 
more specific to aim at.

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.280
Beautiful.
I'll call him Bob,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.680
Bob the Zombie.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.200
Bob the Zombie has volunteered 
to be our blowdart target โ

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.000
and by volunteered, 
I mean he can't complain

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.130
because he's a printed-out 
piece of paper.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.280
Let's try hanging Bob up and see
if we can shoot his lack of brains out.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.840
Whew! A lot of power.
Maybe too much power.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.540
Couldn't control it.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.940
Ha!
Right in the face.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.440
Take that Bob.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.100
Hit the board. 
Missed the zombie.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.360
Yeah!

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.840
Hand!

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.680
Stabbed him in the hand.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.540
Eyeball!

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.960
That'll take out even a zombie, I think.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.680
Ha!

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.200
His heart was still beating โ
well, now it wouldn't be.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.400
Good work.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.860
Brainless shot.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.780
It's not 100% accurate because 
our darts are made out of

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.360
paper and bamboo,
but it has a laser on it.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.200
I think the intimidation factor
is the most important part.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.840
Hey, guys, 
thanks for watching.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.340
If you're not a subscriber yet,
just hit the bomb to get in the club.

If you missed our last video 
or want to watch it again,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.020
just click up here at the top.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.440
Click down there if you 
want to see what the Internet

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.580
thinks that you should watch next.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.620
That's it for now.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.540
Have fun, be safe, 
and see you tomorrow.
