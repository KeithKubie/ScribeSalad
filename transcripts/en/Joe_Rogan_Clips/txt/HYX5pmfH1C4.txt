Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Is there something you wrote? Yeah, that's in high school. Oh my God. That you wanted to be a comedian. It says, I want it to be, I want to be a quantity. I want to stand up comic and to work with comedy on television. Yeah. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. Make It. Yeah. So that says I want to do anything. I like what I'm hearing. Whatever it takes, whatever it takes. Look at, I wrote below. I want you to wear a track suit with no underwear and meet me at the doc. Got It. We're going to get on my yacht and you got good time. Let's go. And I got a part for you to read my script. Oh, you imagine some guy takes you out on his, on his yacht. You're like, wow. So you really think my tape was good.

Speaker 1:          00:46          My Ah, yeah, you tape was amazing. We're going to show them, what do we say? Our listening, any ae brings you this script. It tells you what's required of you. Yeah. And then you're out there in the middle of the water bobbing around staring at this guy and he got a couple of glasses of wine. He was like, I'm gonna make you a star. I need to get my dick sucked. Okay. I get that shit. I get it. I did write in high school anything it takes. Now imagine being a woman and you're in that situation. You think you're gonna be able to sweet talk dot guy, right? That's why you were flirting with them and that's why you got close to him. You're going to get a part, you have to play him and gonna get apart. Next thing you know you're on that ocean.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Well that feels creepy. That feels rapey. It is rapey. Right? When you're a dude, you'd be like, fuck that guy. Fucked up. Just sacrifice, man. That's, I'm understanding for the role that I'm saying. It's a different feeling. Totally right, but still dangerous because if the guy finds out that you're not willing and then you might be hostile and then he might be hostile back like your two dudes. One Dude want to get his dick sucked by a dude, but they're both two dudes and it's a real hair raising situation for both of you. What are you paying for him? It's hair raising, right? You try to get this guy to suck your Dick and the guy said, I'll fucking kill you and you're like, Jesus, now I've got to drive this guy back in my boat. It just me and him, a guy who said he would kill me in a 20 foot long little boat.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Yeah, you got to sit while you got to make him set up by the bow and you just drive quiet. What do you do? Jump in the water. That's where people kill people. Like you know he's going to tell people. Yeah, totally. That's how he gets it. That's why. That's where that kid from Iowa goes missing. Went to Hollywood for big dreams. Never came back. Is that on the water? Cement shoes my friend put on these shoes. Yeah. I guarantee that's happened. But I guarantee you had guys tried to get a guy to suck his dick and the guy who tried to fight him and they fought to the death. He kidding me. I'm sure it's happening now. There's got to, right as we're speaking, there's got to be a nice listening to this hallway. Murder Jay guy is choking him to death. He doesn't want anyone to know.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Don't go on the boat unless you really know the guy. That's my message. That's my message. How well do you know the guy man or women, if the guys that producer and he takes you on the boats don't go on the boat. I feel like that about, and how well do you know the guy with the boat? Not that, well, I'm not going on that guy's boat. I was on a show once in, there was a guy who was kind of a, he was a, I don't want to be mean, but he was sleazy. You just Hollywood calling out someone for being fucking sleazy. Sleazebag but it's the, the most stereotypical version of, ah, yeah. And, uh, there was a gal who is also working on the television shown, choose young and flirtatious and the next thing you know, they were on his boat for the weekend working on the script and they came back.

Speaker 1:          03:28          We were like, wow, like you really just said that. Yeah, we are, we're guys creatively, oh guys, we're going to creatively just out in the middle of the water and the water gives me and Unis the water makes me feel a type of way, but it's like normal stuff. Like that's what people did for US business. Yeah. He used to be, but Jamie wanted to bring this up because you can sort of talking about that and we never, oh, well this was a different subject, but related. I'll save it. This is a Ed buck. Do you know who that guy is? Who? I know he's like this democratic. Uh, he's a a donor. Oh, right. Oh yes. Right. And they were 10 to two dudes had been found dead there, um, from drug overdoses. So though they'd come over and one guy said that, what did he say?

Speaker 1:          04:13          That. I don't know what they've said, but like they, I think what makes him do drugs or, or he's taken them in while they're already super high and he's helping them out or something. They die and they ended up dying. Why bother? There comes, he's claiming that he's helping to people that think coincidence. Maybe he's telling the truth. Maybe he goes out there and finds really high people. Nice people trying to save people in the middle of the night. What are you cynical bro? Yeah, Dude. What do you think is happening? You want me to take a wild guess? Yeah, I bet he goes out looking for people that are real fucked up to get back to his apartment to get some fucking Dick. What? No Way. And then that side that's, and then they say, do you have any more drugs? And he goes, you bet I got more fucking drugs.

Speaker 1:          04:53          They do more drugs together and they die and he dies and he stays alive. Whoa. You sure? Case closed, your honor. Are you direct? I rest my second gentleman. Mr. Buck. Okay, well it looks like a fine man. Don't show that. Looks like he doesn't do anything, anything like he's got a nice gold tooth shining in the back of his mouth. Like a, what's his name, the wet bandits from home alone investigators found multiple sex toys, multiple syringes and clear plastic bags with suspected suspected methamphetamine in a toolbox roll cabinet in the living room. He's got a tool box fill with syringes and sex toys. Let's go to work. Clear plastic bags with meth more has been homeless and how that worked out. How it says Ma bags. Clear plastic bags like more than many. He's got bags of speed. He'd been homeless and and worked as an escort.

Speaker 1:          05:49          Yeah, that's, he was on that Gigolo show. Season Four. He was one of the main guy. He's the guy. I become addicted to. Drugs in the Bush is the one to thank you. Gave me my first injection of crystal meth. I become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Well, I don't know if that's true. Yeah, but it's crazy story that the, what we do know is true as two people died over there. Yeah. That's fucking insane. He's like, hey man, just gee, is there, there's different standards, right? Like here's the, here's the thing, like if that guy, if he was a heterosexual guy and two women had died at his house, prison for life, what are the odds that they wouldn't arrest him? It zero. Zero, zero. Zero. If, if, if one woman is found dead in your fucking apartment. Yeah. If you go going to go to Paris, hookers and shoot them up with Meth, yeah, you go to jail, you go to prison. But if you pick up mail, okay. It's like what we were talking about earlier. Yeah. If it's a guy like, ah, you're a Russian model, you came over here to that work, Bro. Fuck the old ladies come on. Like, that's, it's true with these guys. Two guys are dead and everybody's like, Hey, you know, that's the fucking game they're playing. They a play in that shoot the math game. Munch. You shoot John, you, he's only killed two guys. What the fuck?
