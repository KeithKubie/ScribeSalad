00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:06.730
PROFESSOR: How
you feeling, Paul?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.622
PAUL FOLINO: I'm
feeling well, thank you.

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.720
PROFESSOR: How does it feel to
be finished with this class?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.350
PAUL FOLINO: It's bittersweet.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.220
It's a little bit of a relief,
but I definitely learned a lot.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.066
PROFESSOR: What was the
most unexpected thing

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.743
that you learned in this class?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.910
PAUL FOLINO: I
guess how much audio

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.240
is important to making a video
instead of the actual video.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.825
I mean, the video
is important too.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:36.765
PROFESSOR: Do you think
that there is anything

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:40.160
that you learned in
this class that you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.555
would apply to stuff outside
the video or anything moving

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.540
forward?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.820
PAUL FOLINO: Yeah, definitely.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.940
I learned how to
communicate better.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.730
So I think I'd be
able to explain

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.350
things that are
a little bit more

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.910
technical in a simplistic way.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.598
PROFESSOR: What was
the most helpful thing

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:07.830
that happened in class?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.920
PAUL FOLINO: I'd have to
say working with the groups

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.778
and having the feedback
from multiple people.

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.090
I think that was a
good method to hone

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.770
in on the script and the video.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.486
So all the feedbacks
was spot on too.

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:28.430
PROFESSOR: What about
the hardest thing?

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.400
So maybe the hardest assignment?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.440
PAUL FOLINO: I think the hardest
part of it was taking a script

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.190
and trying to translate it
into different camera shots

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.540
and angles and how
many times to change

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.300
an angle and all that stuff.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.860
It's kind of hard to do
that, so that took a while.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.220
PROFESSOR: What was it
like being on camera?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.560
PAUL FOLINO: It was
nerve-wracking at first.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.840
I think I was more nervous
being on camera by myself,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.570
shooting at home.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.370
PROFESSOR: Really?

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.155
PAUL FOLINO: Yeah.

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:00.940
PROFESSOR: Because I
was going to say you

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.430
sound very natural right now.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.680
PAUL FOLINO: It might have
just been beaten out of me.

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:10.476
PROFESSOR: How would you
explain this class to someone

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:11.925
who's never taken it before?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.670
PAUL FOLINO: It's a--
that's a tough one.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.300
PROFESSOR: Or who
should take this class?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.315
PAUL FOLINO: I think
anyone who wants to-- I

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:33.890
wouldn't even say anything to
do with videography or anything

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.390
like that.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.400
It's just if you
want to learn how

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:45.480
to describe things in a clear
way and be-- I don't know.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.610
That's all I'd say.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.350
There's definitely a big
technical aspect to it,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.630
but I'd say that's kind
of just a byproduct

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.442
of the actual learning.

00:02:58.442 --> 00:02:59.900
PROFESSOR: Thank
you for your time.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.120
PROFESSOR: You're welcome.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.271
PROFESSOR: Next question.

00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:03.395
PROFESSOR: Are you nervous?

00:03:03.395 --> 00:03:04.725
Are you excited?

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:06.290
How do you feel about the--

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.532
PAUL FOLINO: I'm excited
to see everyone's videos.
