Vincent J Musi:
So our relationship with animals

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.368
<i> is constantly evolving.</i>

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.003
<i> For the longest time science
 could just never accept</i>

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.074
<i> what most pet owners know
is that animals think and feel.</i>

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.242
<i> But proving that they have
 thoughts and emotions</i>

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.712
<i> is a lot of what this work
 is about.</i>

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.247
<i> The question for me next
 is really about</i>

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.816
<i> over these 10,000 years
 how does an animal</i>

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.252
<i> that's intended
 for the dining room,</i>

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.055
<i> how does it go
 to the living room?</i>

00:00:56.055 --> 00:01:02.594
( applause )

00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.598
Vincent J Musi:
Thank you, you're very kind.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.934 line:0%
It all started for me
when I bought a haunted house.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.569 line:0%
(laughter)

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.604 line:0%
It's true. That's what
the neighbors told me,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:12.972
but it was after
I bought the house.

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.207
Here's a photograph of it.
(laughter)

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.243
<i> The previous tenants
 had heard all this scratching</i>

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.012
<i> and kicking and rumbling and
 creaking all around the house,</i>

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.048
<i> they thought it was
 the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe,</i>

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:25.351
<i> who lived in the neighborhood,
 where I live now.</i>

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:29.656
So I did what any sane person
would do, I called an exorcist.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:33.259
<i> His name was Mike Hughes.
 And he's a trapper</i>

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.494
<i> and a specialist
 in nuisance wildlife.</i>

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.897
So, he managed to get
all the ghosts out of my house,

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.433
the squirrels, the opossums,
the nine raccoons,

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.101
the birds, the rats.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.803
It was either that or
to designate

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.406
it a national wildlife refuge.
(laughter)

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:48.507
Now Mike had quite a menagerie
at his own home

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.442
and I was curious,
so I photographed him.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:52.512
And some of his animals
were opossums,

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.448
an albino raccoon,
and this iguana.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.850
So I asked around
some of my colleagues.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.985
A lot of the guys do this.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:01.721
<i> We're trying to do this
eye contact thing, it's simple.</i>

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.023
<i> We bring an animal,
 we put it on a seamless.</i>

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.691
I said, "What do we do?"
And they said,

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.060
"You know, all animals
are food motivated.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.296
All you have to do
is really kinda provide

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.098
the set and this is
going to work out for you.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:15.535
<i> I thought, okay, that's cool.
 Well, mistakes were made.</i>

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:20.606
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:22.107
<i> Yeah.</i>

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:24.277
<i> The idea here was
 to photograph these--</i>

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:26.345
(audience laughter)

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:30.216
<i>Yeah, exactly, these superstars</i>

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.284
<i> of the animal cognition.
 These are famous animals.</i>

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.186
<i> Years of research
 had been done with them.</i>

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.056
<i> Books had been
 written about them,
 scientific careers...</i>

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.624
And I was going to become

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:40.760
the Annie Leibovitz
of animal photographs.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.061
(laughter)

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.898
And it was going to be all about
eye contact and lighting. Right?

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.634
Well, it's hard to do that when
an animal won't look at you.

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.302
(laughter)

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:52.404
<i> And with some animals,
 like this lemur,</i>

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:54.941
<i> every time I picked up
 the camera, boom! He was gone.</i>

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.077
<i> He'd shoot away.
 And my career, like the lemur,</i>

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.579
<i> was vanishing
 before my eyes.</i>

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.679
(laughter)

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.848
You don't get
a lot of second chances.

00:03:02.848 --> 00:03:04.617
And I thought,
why is this happening?

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:07.119
Why am I being punished here?
What have I done wrong?

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.423
I went all the way to Austria
to photograph this Marmoset.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.657
<i> His name is Momo.</i>

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:14.393
<i> He's really smart.
 Okay, big deal.</i>

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:17.263
And he smells really bad.
(laughter)

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.965
<i> And his head
 is the size of a walnut.</i>

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.534
And he hates me.
(laughter)

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:23.903
<i> See, it looks calm to you,
 doesn't it?</i>

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:25.672
<i> No, it's not.</i>

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.707
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:03:27.707 --> 00:03:30.075
He's peeing on me.
(laughter)

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:31.677
<i> He's peeing on my equipment,</i>

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:34.447
<i> and he's telling his
 Marmoset friends to pee on me</i>

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:36.682
and pee on my equipment.
(laughter)

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:39.752
<i> And he screamed at me
 and he wouldn't stop.</i>

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.621
<i> And he told his friends
 to scream at me.</i>

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.090
And... I began to think that

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.993
<i> even fish were screaming at me
 from under water.</i>

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:50.863
<i> This is a Gunnison's
 prairie dog, and he
 screamed at me too.</i>

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.131
<i> Scientists believe these guys
 have language ability,</i>

00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:54.366
<i> sophisticated stuff, right.</i>

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:56.336
It's not like,
"Aah! Bad things
are happening...

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.471
It's like, "There's a guy
from National Geographic

00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.905
and he's gonna come here
and take our picture."

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.541
This guy screamed at me
on the phone.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.642
(laughter)

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.380
And, he... he's a rescued
prairie dog from Phoenix.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.949
He was hit by a car and
his name is Speed-bump.

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.750
(laughter)

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.320
And he lives in Wabash, Indiana.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.355
It's like I didn't know what to
do, I couldn't take it anymore.

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:18.958
I started to scream at him,
back at him.

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:21.560
And I started to interview him
like... like a press conference,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.329
rapid fire. "Mr. Bump,
how are the winters in Wabash?

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:25.898
What do you think?"
All this kind of stuff,

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.767
and I sang to him.
I did everything I could,

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.936
and all of a sudden
he just stopped.

00:04:29.936 --> 00:04:32.871
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:04:32.871 --> 00:04:36.675
So, you see, with Speed-bump,

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:38.744
I discovered
my inner Doctor Dolittle

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.679
and I embarked
on this new career,

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.848
if I could just talk
to the animals.

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:45.985
Show this respect and patience,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.220
things I didn't have much of
to be honest with you,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.723
I might find
what I was looking for.

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:54.527
<i> Now, this is Kanzi.
 He was a real test for sure.</i>

00:04:54.527 --> 00:04:56.429
<i> Does anybody know Kanzi,
 he's a Bonobo.</i>

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:57.729
<i> He's a pygmy chimpanzee.</i>

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.666
<i> He understands
 about 3,000 spoken words.</i>

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:01.934
<i> It's incredible.</i>

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:03.669
<i> So, now he communicates
 with humans</i>

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.804
<i> using this vocabulary
 that's drawn</i>

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:08.540
<i> from like 350 symbols.
 It's lexigrams.</i>

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.044
And, they're printed
on a sort of like, uh,

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:13.546
place mat,
laminated thing.

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:16.115
He walks around with it and
he makes complex sentences.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.951
"Kanzi wants this now
with this person there."

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:21.386
It's not like... pointing
to the thing.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:24.189
And the lexigram for an orange
may not look like an orange.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.458
It's real sophisticated stuff.

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:27.960
So, I got there and they said,

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.230
"What... what... what have you
brought for Kanzi?" I said,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.901
"I didn't bring anything.
I brought my lights."

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.569
So, we have to ask
his permission.

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.070
And we have to ask
him what he'd like.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.239
And so they, you know...
(does hand movements)

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:43.643
And Kanzi...
(does hand movements)

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.412
And, they interpreted
that as "Kanzi would like

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:49.382
Starbucks coffee for he
and his Bonobo friends."

00:05:49.382 --> 00:05:51.217
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:05:51.217 --> 00:05:52.918
And so I had to send
my assistant back

00:05:52.918 --> 00:05:57.923
into town to get six grande
coffees with the simple syrup,

00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:59.391
for him and his Bonobo friends.

00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:00.993
And, Kanzi every once
in a while,

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:02.561
will do this sort of thing
where he'll go...

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:03.829
(does hand movements)

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.633
And two grown-ups will chase
each other through the halls.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:08.734
And it's his entertainment.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:10.302
We're around
for entertainment.

00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:13.606
<i>Now you'll notice that he never
 really quite looked at me.</i>

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:14.707
<i> And it was intentional.</i>

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:15.808
<i> No matter what I did,</i>

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.242
<i> I could never get him
 to make eye contact.</i>

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:20.345
<i> He is a very, very cool guy
 and very, very sharp.</i>

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:22.482
<i> And I'm glad to have gone
 and done it.</i>

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:24.950
<i> On the other extreme
 of this, this is Whack.</i>

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.153
<i> She's a New Caledonian Crow,
 lives in Oxford, England.</i>

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:30.622
<i> When she's not trying to poke
 the eyes out of visiting</i>

00:06:30.622 --> 00:06:33.091
<i> National Geographic
 photographers,</i>

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:34.726
<i> which she did for two days,</i>

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:36.728
<i> she excels at problem solving.</i>

00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:40.299
Creating tools from materials
she's never seen before,

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.601
to solve problems she's
never been presented before.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.671
An example is,
they would take a test-tube and

00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:48.407
put something that she wanted
at the bottom of it, food.

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:51.143
And present her with things
that you could make tools from.

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:52.811
Now, what they didn't
know to this point,

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.880
was that these animals
can make tools,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.982
which is different than
using tools.

00:06:56.982 --> 00:07:00.152
Chimps do this, humans do this,
very few animals

00:07:00.152 --> 00:07:02.054
possess this capability.

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.557
And Whack could
take something and

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:07.159
fashion a tool from it to
reach into the test-tube

00:07:07.192 --> 00:07:09.762
and get the thing out of it,
that you were looking for

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.198
from something she'd never
been presented before.

00:07:12.198 --> 00:07:14.700
It's amazing stuff.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.735
<i> Now, this is Betsy.</i>

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.505
<i> Betsy is so famous that
 that's not even her real name.</i>

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.739
(laughter)

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:23.742
<i> I'm not kidding. She's a
Border Collie living in Vienna.</i>

00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:26.712
<i> And she has the vocabulary
 of a toddler.</i>

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.447
She can hear a word
once or twice,

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.048
and know that
it means something.

00:07:30.048 --> 00:07:33.586
She can link photographs with
an object in the photograph.

00:07:33.586 --> 00:07:36.455
An example would be to show her
a photograph of a teddy bear.

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:39.325
Let's say it's Randy, right.
And say, "Go find Randy."

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:43.061
And send her into another room
full of these stuffed animals.

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:45.231
She'll look around and
she's got-- she's pretty good,

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:47.666
and she'll find the thing
in the photograph,

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:48.834
bring it back to you.

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.068
Two or three times, come back

00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:51.803
in six months,
she's got it locked in.

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:53.839
It... It's an incredible thing.

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:58.243
<i> We put Shanti here, she's a
 9,000-pound Asian elephant,</i>

00:07:58.243 --> 00:08:01.279
<i> we put her on an enormous
 white seamless background.</i>

00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:03.248
<i> You know, they are amongst
 the most intelligent animals,</i>

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:04.850
<i> they grieve, mimic behavior,</i>

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.119
<i> they have language abilities,
 memory.</i>

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:09.922
But then they look in
the mirror, they see themselves.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.090
And it's a rare cognitive
accomplishment, that

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.992
we know is only shared
by great apes

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.728
and dolphins and some humans.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:18.030
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.466
At the Bronx Zoo, elephants
were put in front of mirrors.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.468
And at first they treated
the mirror as an object

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.702
as you might imagine.

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:25.771
But then, they started
to check themselves out.

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.740
They'd lift their trunks and
they would look at things

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.074
and different places.

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:31.944
See, for the longest time
science could just never accept

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:34.947
what most pet owners know,
is that animals think and feel.

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:38.517
But proving, proving that they
have thoughts and emotions

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.385
is a lot of what
this work is about.

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.988
And the scientists can
consider this a collaboration

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.289
between them and the animals.

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:47.460
Their work teaches us about
the boundaries of humanity.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:50.696
It's really exciting stuff but
it's about these characteristics

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.032
that are distinctly human
and things that aren't.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.234
<i> This is a lemur at Duke.
 His name is Aristides, and</i>

00:08:56.234 --> 00:08:58.070
<i> they used to think these
 guys were not so smart.</i>

00:08:58.103 --> 00:09:00.138
<i> They are primates but
 they are on the lower end.</i>

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:02.307
<i> But he learns
 like a toddler does.</i>

00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:03.342
<i> He is learning how to count.</i>

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:04.976
<i> He uses a touch screen
 with his nose.</i>

00:09:04.976 --> 00:09:06.878
And all this stuff is
food rewards, right?

00:09:06.878 --> 00:09:09.915
So you do this right,
the sequence...
you get something,

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:12.150
but they, they have
great enthusiasm for it,

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:15.087
so they don't need to be fed.
They just like to do it.

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.990
<i> And rats, they may or may
 not have a sense of humor,
 but they laugh.</i>

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.661
<i>There's a guy at Bowling Green,
 his name is Jaak Panksepp.</i>

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:24.530
<i> And they call him
 the rat tickler.</i>

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.633
He takes rats, and
he tickles them, and they laugh.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:29.334
(laughter)

00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:30.669
So, they are trying to figure...

00:09:30.669 --> 00:09:33.505
They play jokes
on each other and stuff.

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:34.906
<i> And there's not a day
 that goes by</i>

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.642
<i> we don't learn something
 about honey bees, right.</i>

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.643
<i> They are really,
 highly evolved socially,</i>

00:09:38.643 --> 00:09:40.278
<i> and they have
 this complex behavior</i>

00:09:40.278 --> 00:09:41.880
<i>of communication and navigation.</i>

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.849
<i> They learn colors and scents.</i>

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.017
<i> And they can map
 their environment out.</i>

00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:48.154
All with a brain
the size of a milligram.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:49.355
It's a little, tiny thing.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.657
And, and now according
to some work we think--

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.492
we find out
they might have emotions.

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.728
They might possess
pessi-- pessimism.

00:09:56.728 --> 00:09:58.898
<i> This is a Scrub Jay
 called Psychobird.</i>

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.765
(laughter)

00:10:00.765 --> 00:10:02.834
<i> And they plan for the future.</i>

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:04.770
<i> They take these birds, and
when they go to sleep at night.</i>

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.939
<i> And wake up
 in two different rooms.</i>

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.508
And in one room, in the morning
they feed them breakfast.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.076
And in the other room,
they don't.

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:14.246
And after a while they give them
the option to feed at night.

00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:16.882
And what they do, is they do
this thing called caching.

00:10:16.882 --> 00:10:19.217
They take food, put it
in their mouth, they hide it.

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:20.886
And then they can hide it
in a certain place,

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:23.055
and come back
and get it later.

00:10:23.055 --> 00:10:25.590
These birds all hid it
in the room

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.293
that didn't have food
in the morning.

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.162
Because they didn't know
if they were going to wake
up in that room.

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.530
Now the caching thing is
extraordinary because they--

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.633
he is caching right now, right.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.535
And every time
I am not looking at him,

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:39.304
he'll go (imitates vomiting)
and spit it out.

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.474
Because he's afraid I'm gonna
know where he is hiding it.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.607
So, they'll hide it

00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:44.810
and then if they think
they have been seen hiding it,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.513
they'll be like sneaky and
they'll hide it somewhere else.

00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:51.083
<i> And, you know, chimps are
 out closest relatives, right.</i>

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:54.219
<i> We got 99 percent of the same
 DNA with these guys.</i>

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.522
<i> We've studied them
 for a very long time,</i>

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.956
<i> since the 50's right.</i>

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:00.492
<i> Jane Goodall, and
 they make tools...</i>

00:11:00.492 --> 00:11:03.462
<i> These guys, they love
 and trust, they have morals,</i>

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:08.167
<i> they fight, they forgive, they
 cooperate, they have culture.</i>

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.035
And they have these
unique ways of doing things.

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.137
Problem solving,
social responsibility...

00:11:12.137 --> 00:11:15.907
And it's all spread
by learning, mostly by women.

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:18.310
Females, like
Georgia here, will pass

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.379
these culture traditions,
cultural traditions

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:25.084
on to the other chimps,
and keep this thing going.

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:28.187
<i> These are cichlids
 and they are really crazy.</i>

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:30.989
<i> They have this thing called
 transitive inference, right,</i>

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:34.126
<i> and it's the same kind of
 logical reasoning that we use</i>

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.827
<i> when we go into a bar.</i>

00:11:35.827 --> 00:11:38.396
<i> And we don't pick a fight
with the tallest guy in the bar.</i>

00:11:38.396 --> 00:11:41.867
And these fish, in order to get
ahead in their social rank,

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.002
need to keep fighting.

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:44.570
So they fight a fish,
they get their colors,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.472
they get ahead
in social standing,

00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:47.907
then start fighting again.

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:50.709
But they know not to pick
a fight with the wrong guy.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:55.447
And it's this, like step on
the way to logical reasoning
for a fish.

00:11:55.447 --> 00:11:56.982
<i> Sheep have facial recognition.</i>

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:59.551
<i> They recognize faces
 of other sheep,</i>

00:11:59.551 --> 00:12:01.553
<i> up to 50 of them
 for like two years.</i>

00:12:01.553 --> 00:12:05.023
<i> And up to ten humans
 for two years. It's amazing.</i>

00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:07.192
<i> This is Azy,
 he's a magnificent animal.</i>

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:09.194
<i> He comes into the room
 and he's--</i>

00:12:09.194 --> 00:12:11.230
Well, that's actually life-size.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.099
(laughter)

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.868
Orangutans above
all the great apes,

00:12:16.868 --> 00:12:18.237
find-- they are contemplative.

00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:21.206
They make choices that are
logical and they're thoughtful,

00:12:21.239 --> 00:12:23.942
maybe more than chimpanzees.

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:26.011
<i>This is a Pacific Giant Octopus.</i>

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.313
<i> They have personalities,
 they use tools,</i>

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:30.783
<i> they recognize individuals,
 and they play.</i>

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.818
<i> David Liittschwager
 whose photographs grace</i>

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.953
<i> the side of the building here
 told me this story.</i>

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:37.089
<i> He said
 at the Monterey Aquarium once</i>

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.424
he was doing a tour
with an entourage

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:42.694
that included the Dalai Lama,
who was dressed in his robe.

00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:44.997
And they pass
the Giant Octopus who is,

00:12:44.997 --> 00:12:47.733
as they often are,
way in the back of their tank

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:50.001
and he was a mottled tan.

00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:53.204
And the octopus saw the
Dalai Lama come through the room

00:12:53.204 --> 00:12:55.474
and leaped
to the front of the tank,

00:12:55.474 --> 00:12:56.809
put itself on the edge
of the tank

00:12:56.809 --> 00:13:00.178
and changed to the color
of the Dalai Lama's robe.

00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:01.346
They are pretty sneaky.

00:13:01.346 --> 00:13:03.948
In Seattle, they had
these guys and at night

00:13:03.948 --> 00:13:05.684
they'd block the air pressure

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.285
and they'd blow
the tops of their tanks.

00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:09.154
They'd sneak off into
the other exhibits

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:11.390
eat the other fish,
go back to their tanks

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.959
leaving a trail of water and go,
"Hey man, I didn't see nothing."

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:17.429
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.965
<i> This is Alex.
 Alex could use a 100 words</i>

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:22.301
<i> and he had the intelligence
 of a 5-year old.</i>

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:23.802
<i> He could count to seven.</i>

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.737
<i>He knew 'same' from 'different'.</i>

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:27.606
<i>He knew 'larger' from 'smaller'.</i>

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.274
<i> He would talk to you.</i>

00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:31.510
"Would you tickle me?"
(imitating parrot)

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:32.911
(laughter)

00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:35.981
And I said,
"Sure. Show me where."

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:37.716
And he put down his head,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:40.452
and he lifted the feathers
up on the crook of his neck.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.688
And so I tickled him.

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:44.656
And then he said, "Could
you tickle me on the chair?"

00:13:44.656 --> 00:13:46.157
And we went
and sat on the chair.

00:13:46.157 --> 00:13:48.127
And we had
this delightful afternoon.

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:50.529
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:52.831
It's true.

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:56.301
He passed away at 31,
which is young for a parrot.

00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:59.004
And when he died, his obituary
was in the New York Times.

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:02.674
That's how famous he was.
It's true.

00:14:02.674 --> 00:14:04.342
It's true.

00:14:04.342 --> 00:14:08.147
So our relationship with animals
is constantly evolving.

00:14:08.147 --> 00:14:10.583
It... It's a really fascinating
thing to me, and

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.018
probably the single
most important part of this

00:14:13.018 --> 00:14:14.353
is domestication, right.

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.021
<i> Millions of animals
 on the planet, right.</i>

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:19.291
<i> There's like 14 large mammals
 that have been domesticated.</i>

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:22.895
<i> Nobody knows why,
 nobody knows how.</i>

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:25.097
All dogs come from wolves.

00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:28.400
<i> And as a result
 of all of this evolving</i>

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.302
<i> over the years,
 dogs are changing.</i>

00:14:30.302 --> 00:14:32.237
<i> It's because domestication
 didn't just happen,</i>

00:14:32.237 --> 00:14:33.471
<i> it's still going on.</i>

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:37.243
<i> So, these researchers at Duke
 are telling this dog</i>

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:40.946
<i> that there is food under
 both of those cups,
 and there isn't.</i>

00:14:40.946 --> 00:14:42.681
So one of them tells the truth
all the time,

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.349
one of them doesn't.

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:46.885
And the dog is figuring out
which one is telling the truth.

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.353
And then they mix it up.

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:49.889
It's an amazing thing.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.858
So you have these things
that happen to an animal,

00:14:52.858 --> 00:14:54.927
once we've domesticated it,
right.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.695
But across the board

00:14:56.728 --> 00:14:58.897
what we've done is lost
all the wild animals.

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.999
<i> There are no
 wild cows anymore, right.</i>

00:15:00.999 --> 00:15:03.034
<i> Wild aurochs were the
 originals, right?</i>

00:15:03.034 --> 00:15:05.437
<i> So we've lost all of that.</i>

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:08.440
And, we have only a few
animals that can go back.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.911
<i> So, pigs can go back
 and be feral. Cats can do it.</i>

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:16.181
We think now that the cats
may not be really domesticated.

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:17.983
They just might be
tolerating us.

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:18.883
(laughter)

00:15:18.883 --> 00:15:24.589
It's true. They chose humans.

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:28.894
So, the question
for me next is really about

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:32.297
over this 10,000 years,
how does an animal that's

00:15:32.297 --> 00:15:34.466
<i> intended for the dining room,</i>

00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.368
<i> how does it go
 to the living room?</i>

00:15:36.402 --> 00:15:38.337
<i> (laughter)</i>

00:15:38.337 --> 00:15:41.773
<i> This is a pot-bellied pig that
lives in Saint Paul, Minnesota.</i>

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:43.775
<i> Her name is Daisy Mae
 and she is blind.</i>

00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:46.745
<i> And when the owners
 got it, they almost had
 to get rid of her</i>

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.280
<i> because there was a law
 in the books that said,</i>

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.748
you know, cougars, lions,

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:52.317
pot-bellied pigs were
vicious animals.

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:54.219
And so they changed laws
because of this pig.

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:55.687
It's pretty cool.

00:15:55.687 --> 00:15:59.224
This whole idea of exotic pets
is kinda hot button,

00:15:59.224 --> 00:16:01.493
everybody is a
little bit conversant in it,

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:03.094
We always see something
on the news about it.

00:16:03.094 --> 00:16:04.997
I wanted to do a piece

00:16:04.997 --> 00:16:08.399
on the relationship humans
had with these animals.

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:11.102
What possessed somebody
to want to have one.

00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:12.337
I didn't want to judge 'em,

00:16:12.337 --> 00:16:15.274
I wanted to give their
piece, so--

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:19.878
It's a capybara going for
his afternoon swim in Texas.

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:24.616
<i> He's a jumbo rat,
 130-pound rodent.</i>

00:16:24.616 --> 00:16:26.685
<i> A pretty cool guy.</i>

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:30.055
<i> And this is one of my favorite
 of all times.</i>

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:32.691
<i> That's Dillie.
 She is beautiful, isn't she?</i>

00:16:32.691 --> 00:16:33.858
(laughter)

00:16:33.858 --> 00:16:37.929
<i> Born in 2004.
 So, an Amish breeder</i>

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:41.165
<i> who had an animal
 that was gonna probably die.</i>

00:16:41.165 --> 00:16:42.534
And in the middle of the night,

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:45.404
he called up his local
veterinarian, Melanie Butera,

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:48.774
and he sort of got somebody
to drive him to her

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:52.644
and Melanie took care of this
animal, brought it back to life.

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:54.179
Over a long period of time.

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:56.414
And now Dillie lives
in her house.

00:16:56.414 --> 00:17:00.085
This is on the second
floor of a house.

00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:04.690
She goes to the bathroom
in the kitchen on towels,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.859
eats spaghetti from a plate,
goes up and down the
set of stairs.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.428
And she is
the most wonderful animal,

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:12.297
I've ever been around.
She really is extraordinary.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:15.133
And, you know,
she has her own webcam.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:16.535
You guys probably have that.

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:17.669
(laughter)

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:22.007
There was a point there where
she got a little freaked out

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:24.409
because somebody came by
with that Burt's Bees stuff,

00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:27.345
and she thought it was a bee
and so she was afraid.

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:29.815
And so, she slept on
the floor in a different place.

00:17:29.815 --> 00:17:31.349
She wasn't visible
on the webcam.

00:17:31.349 --> 00:17:34.686
This webcam has a million
unique visitors per month.

00:17:34.686 --> 00:17:37.489
And Melanie got emails

00:17:37.489 --> 00:17:40.192
from the International
Space Station saying,
'Where is the deer?"

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:45.663
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:17:45.663 --> 00:17:50.168
<i> This is Albert.
 Yeah, this is his bedroom.</i>

00:17:50.168 --> 00:17:53.137
<i> Yup, and this is
 a 12-foot Burmese python.</i>

00:17:53.137 --> 00:17:55.106
<i> Now, he's holding
 that python for me.</i>

00:17:55.106 --> 00:17:56.942
<i> I'm going to come clean
 with you on that,</i>

00:17:56.942 --> 00:18:00.712
<i> because his room is full of
every one of the most poisonous,</i>

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:04.816
venomous, aggressive snakes
on Earth, are all there.

00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:07.919
<i> So he's got these
Egyptian Cobras and King Cobras</i>

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:10.722
<i> and Australian Browns,
 and on every one of--</i>

00:18:10.722 --> 00:18:13.124
<i>Looks like the Museum of Natural
 History in there, doesn't it?</i>

00:18:13.124 --> 00:18:14.693
<i> And every one of those cages,</i>

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.895
<i> these things has
 a little thing on it listing</i>

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:19.197
<i> what the animal is, and
 what the anti-venom is.</i>

00:18:19.197 --> 00:18:21.599
And on the door,
is a list of directions

00:18:21.599 --> 00:18:24.870
to the hospital
that has the anti-venom.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.506
Because he's
been bitten 100 times.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:30.074
And so he's like, "You want me
to bring the King Cobra out?"

00:18:30.074 --> 00:18:31.410
No, I don't!

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.779
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:18:34.779 --> 00:18:37.582
He feeds, he single-handedly
figured out

00:18:37.582 --> 00:18:40.151
how to deal with this invasive
species thing in Florida.

00:18:40.151 --> 00:18:45.356
He feeds smaller pythons
to the cobras.

00:18:45.356 --> 00:18:47.358
Chops them up gives them
to the cobras, "Here you go."

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:50.462
Not this one, but he did that.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:52.063
One thing I should
tell you is that

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:54.165
none of these animals
are truly wild.

00:18:54.165 --> 00:18:55.834
<i> These are captive born animals</i>

00:18:55.834 --> 00:19:00.438
<i> and they've been very,
 very far away from
 any wild bloodlines.</i>

00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:01.606
<i>They can't go back to the wild,</i>

00:19:01.639 --> 00:19:03.608
<i> because they never came
 from the wild.</i>

00:19:03.608 --> 00:19:06.411
Melanie Typaldos has
this big capybara.

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:09.447
<i> And she is home every day.
 He goes for his swim at four,</i>

00:19:09.447 --> 00:19:11.249
<i>and she'll feed him in the pool.</i>

00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:12.984
<i> And his name is Gary,</i>

00:19:12.984 --> 00:19:15.686
<i> which is short
 for Garibaldi Rous.</i>

00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:17.990
R-O-U-S Rodent Of Unusual Size.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:20.292
(audience roaring
with laughter)

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:22.193
He's a 120-pounds,
and he's three years old.

00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:23.862
And this is her second one.

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:25.730
And this is not an animal
that takes,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.532
well, kindly, to humans, right.

00:19:27.532 --> 00:19:29.535
You have to earn trust
with this thing

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:33.505
<i> and they have an incredible
 relationship and</i>

00:19:33.538 --> 00:19:36.475
<i> Mario Enfante and
 his cougar, Sasha.</i>

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.876
<i> This is his child.</i>

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:40.178
<i> I went down, I gotta tell you,
I saw it and it was a real bond.</i>

00:19:40.178 --> 00:19:43.382
<i> It was not like
 a trophy for this guy.</i>

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:45.283
<i> Because nobody is going
 to find him, you know.</i>

00:19:45.283 --> 00:19:48.452
<i> Really, really an
 interesting situation.</i>

00:19:48.452 --> 00:19:50.455
<i> Now that's cute, a little cat.</i>

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.023
<i> That's a bobcat.</i>

00:19:52.023 --> 00:19:55.293
<i> Six weeks old, it's going to
 grow up to be a big bobcat.</i>

00:19:55.293 --> 00:19:57.262
<i> Now, a lot of people
 raise these things.</i>

00:19:57.262 --> 00:19:59.931
<i> They have a huge human imprint
 on them when they're little.</i>

00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:01.766
So that, hopefully,

00:20:01.766 --> 00:20:04.302
when they get to be bigger,
and they go off with somebody,

00:20:04.302 --> 00:20:05.570
that they'll retain that

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.940
and they may not chew
their face off, kinda thing.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.908
It could be very dangerous
with these animals.

00:20:10.908 --> 00:20:13.078
I don't want to understate that.

00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:15.914
But, you know, she raises
them, they follow her
around the kitchen,

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:17.615
she has him around her dog.

00:20:17.615 --> 00:20:20.685
And it's-- at this point
where this whole process starts.

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:23.055
Some breeders are great,
some breeders are bad,

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.690
and there's a whole cycle
that can go after this,

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.325
because what are you gonna do?

00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:28.994
If it gets too big to handle,

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:30.862
people don't know
what to do with these animals.

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:34.899
It's across the board
with big cats and bears

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:37.035
and things like that,
as you'll see.

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:38.970
<i> This is Mike Stapleton,
 he's in Ohio.</i>

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.805
<i> He has six, five, six tigers.</i>

00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:42.707
<i> And he is suing the state</i>

00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:44.308
<i> because they've decided that</i>

00:20:44.308 --> 00:20:46.311
<i> they're going to take all
 these laws back a little bit.</i>

00:20:46.311 --> 00:20:48.613
<i> And you're not going
 to be allowed to have
 one of these animals</i>

00:20:48.613 --> 00:20:51.849
<i> without huge bonds. So,
 these are all rescued animals.</i>

00:20:51.849 --> 00:20:55.420
<i> These were probably photo
 tigers, when they were cubs.</i>

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.654
<i> People had their
 picture made with them.</i>

00:20:56.654 --> 00:20:57.922
<i> Then they get too big.</i>

00:20:58.022 --> 00:21:02.027
And at a year, they go
somewhere else and
they are down this path.

00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:04.195
Where are they gonna
go, they are not going
to go to a zoo.

00:21:04.195 --> 00:21:06.265
Zoo's won't take them,
They don't have room for them.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:09.901
There are only so many refuges.
It's pretty tight.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:12.070
<i> The one wild animal
 I did photograph...</i>

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.639
<i> This is actually
 a real nuisance gator.</i>

00:21:14.639 --> 00:21:16.441
<i> And the guy
 with it is Bob Freer.</i>

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.643
<i> He got his first alligator
 when he was six.</i>

00:21:18.643 --> 00:21:21.179
<i> His dad stopped
 at some roadside place,</i>

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:22.814
<i> bought him a gator,
threw it in the back, and said,</i>

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.782
"Here you go."
(laughter)

00:21:24.782 --> 00:21:27.619
And so he-- he's spent
his entire life now.

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.720
He's got this place called
Everglades outpost

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.723
and he rehabilitates wildlife.

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:34.726
'Cause lots of crazy stuff comes
into Miami International Airport

00:21:34.726 --> 00:21:39.830
and he's got, like, snow monkeys
there, and he's got bears.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.167
But he loves gators
ever since he was a kid,

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.435
and so he wrestles gators.

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:46.003
He's been an alligator
wrestler for 30 years.

00:21:46.003 --> 00:21:48.840
I asked the man, "What's the
relationship with a gator like?

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.875
What do they want?" He said,
"They want to be left alone."

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:53.411
(laughter)

00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:54.679
So, you know, I don't know

00:21:54.679 --> 00:21:56.848
what an exotic animal owner
looks like.

00:21:56.881 --> 00:21:58.716
I thought, what if we took
the same animal

00:21:58.716 --> 00:22:02.153
and we did different owners.

00:22:02.153 --> 00:22:06.524
<i> So this is at a thing called
Skunk Fest that was in Ohio too.</i>

00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:07.959
<i> And we photographed,</i>

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:10.962
<i>you know a little cross section
of some of the owners of skunks.</i>

00:22:10.962 --> 00:22:16.001
<i> This is Travis and
 he's a DJ at a strip club.</i>

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.971
And Nicki is a mother of two.
She's got a skunk.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:23.708
<i> And this is Malena. She's 16,
and she dresses up like skunks.</i>

00:22:23.708 --> 00:22:26.310
(laughter)

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.181
<i> And then you've got Maggie,
 she's 12, on the left.</i>

00:22:29.214 --> 00:22:32.617
<i> And Sean's, a technical
 engineer, with his skunk.</i>

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:36.154
<i> And Cherie's, a housewife
in Pennsylvania, with her skunk.</i>

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:38.957
<i> But I can tell you honestly
 the bond is true.</i>

00:22:38.957 --> 00:22:41.960
I want to leave you
with something--

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.596
A lot of what these animals
have taught me is patience.

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.798
You need it, 'cause you
can't make an animal do

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.065
what you want it to do.

00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:53.838
<i> So we photographed a hedgehog
 for the cover in December.</i>

00:22:53.838 --> 00:22:56.875
<i> And, you know,
 like the little Gunnison,</i>

00:22:56.875 --> 00:22:58.009
<i> you know,
 I could yell at him.</i>

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:59.344
<i>When you do that to a hedgehog.</i>

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:01.746
<i> it turns into a pinecone.</i>

00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:04.582
And so, any slightest movement

00:23:04.582 --> 00:23:06.217
and the thing goes back
into a pinecone.

00:23:06.217 --> 00:23:09.321
So this fellow
Brandon Harley is a kid

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:11.523
who raises these guys.
We took nine hedgehogs

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:13.324
and spent a day
photographing them

00:23:13.324 --> 00:23:15.426
on a seamless
to try to make a picture.

00:23:15.426 --> 00:23:17.929
And this is a little piece
on what we did.

00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:21.099
(rock 'n roll guitar music)

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:50.261
Thank you.

00:23:50.261 --> 00:23:53.064
(applause)

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:55.600
