00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
this is a weird time to be a comedian I

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.930
don't know if you've been following

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.050
entertainment but it is a bad time to be

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.040
a predator has anyone been paying

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.730
attention to that

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.570
we're losing like three actors a day

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.400
like I'm gonna see the New Avengers

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.960
movie last year like why is everyone

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.160
being played by Paul Giamatti they're

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.920
like he's the only one left it feels

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.300
like a dark time I saw a baby in the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.800
coffee shop the other day he was wearing

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.969
a t-shirt that said I love life I was

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.969
like you'll grow out of it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.329
it gets shittier I like babies do you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.300
know what's better than a baby buy a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.270
little is not having a fucking baby

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.770
I get drunk a lot I sleep in I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.770
confidently walk back to overheated cars

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.610
it's a good life my sister calls her

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:09.950
baby a miracle and I play along but uh

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.270
it'sit's a bit much miracle we never

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.210
call adults miracles we're doing way

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.440
cooler shit there are no babies that can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.850
dunk just have a baby we're like it's a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.060
miracle then it grows up and were like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.950
nevermind winning the lottery that's a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.570
miracle you'd never win the Mega

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:40.340
Millions jackpot and be like should we

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:41.690
keep it my niece is always crying I'm

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.310
trying to make her laugh and my sisters

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.840
like you gotta let her cry cuz she's at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.390
that age now that if you interrupt she

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.710
becomes dependent so that's strange that

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
we do that the babies you can't even do

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.100
that to adults if you came to my

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.810
apartment of my girlfriend was

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.970
hysterically crying I can't be like it's

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:02.060
cool I'm trying you know we're gonna nip

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.000
Xbox so it is over

I'm playing NBA 2k she's playing with

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.220
herself but either way we're both

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.830
thinking about LeBron you women are

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.230
amazing I know you know why cuz you can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.440
fake an orgasm but you can't fake a good

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.440
mood

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.790
you could tell me I'm the best you've

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.650

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.390

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.270
flattering I'm not doing that much we'd

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.400
I feel like I played that with an

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.700
erection that's why I asked if I made

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.110

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.340

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.340
the buzzer completely still

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:48.360
I'll say just made me come here's a

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.400
barber tip whatever barber you go to

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.959
that is whatever music they're playing

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.290
that's the haircut you're gonna get

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.290
Armenian hip-hop

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.500
this is a weird area to do my special

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.410
because this is like I'm seeing like the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.700
hipster dads in this area you know it

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.510
like the skinny jean wearing

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.060
disciplinarian I saw a dad and he was

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.980
yelling at his son he was like Simon and

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.650
I turned around because it's a stupid

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:27.030
fucking name Simon if you keep this up

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.950
you're not gonna get any more smoothie

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.390
that's the punishment now apparently I

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.180
thought we used to beat the shit out of

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.780
the kids but apparently mango bad this

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.160
is where we're at I mean my friend just

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.570
laughed in his face he turn to us he

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.200
goes one eat you mind your own fucking

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.240
business

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:49.030
I was like oh well we're not gonna get

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.580
any more smoothie I'll fight you do but

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.990
if I win I'm taking that smoothie and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.990
I'm gonna drink it in front of Simon

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.390
I feel bad for these kids we tell kids

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.370
they could be whatever they want and

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.930
then we don't give them the odds but you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.730
know if I have a kid I'm gonna be honest

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.620
if he's like daddy can I play in the NBA

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.200
I'm gonna be like statistically it's

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.190
possible but let's take a look at this

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:20.410
chart I've taken the liberty of

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.690
factoring in your size and race it

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.680
doesn't look good you're a tiny Jew

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.680
that's why we named it TJ

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.960
you
