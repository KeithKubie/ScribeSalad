that will jump into the build system all

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769
that will jump into the build system all
 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.610
that will jump into the build system all
right Thank You Jay all right so let's

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620
right Thank You Jay all right so let's
 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.309
right Thank You Jay all right so let's
talk about the build system so it

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319
talk about the build system so it
 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.649
talk about the build system so it
working before we talk about in stature

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659
working before we talk about in stature
 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.300
working before we talk about in stature
and we want to talk about just general

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
and we want to talk about just general
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.759
and we want to talk about just general
build system improvement right instant

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769
build system improvement right instant
 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.710
build system improvement right instant
run does not always activate and so we

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
run does not always activate and so we
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.849
run does not always activate and so we
still wanted to make sure that the build

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859
still wanted to make sure that the build
 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.250
still wanted to make sure that the build
step would be faster than it used to be

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260
step would be faster than it used to be
 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.280
step would be faster than it used to be
so you know we know of a few butter legs

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290
so you know we know of a few butter legs
 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.929
so you know we know of a few butter legs
that are you know I'm sure very obvious

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939
that are you know I'm sure very obvious
 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.759
that are you know I'm sure very obvious
to you whether it's DX or prog out or

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769
to you whether it's DX or prog out or
 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.289
to you whether it's DX or prog out or
just the installation process so let's

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299
just the installation process so let's
 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.170
just the installation process so let's
go through a few of those so the first

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180
go through a few of those so the first
 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.569
go through a few of those so the first
fix that we did was we improve the DX

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
fix that we did was we improve the DX
 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.159
fix that we did was we improve the DX
merger so when you build with Android

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169
merger so when you build with Android
 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.099
merger so when you build with Android
with a cradle and you have a lot of

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109
with a cradle and you have a lot of
 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.599
with a cradle and you have a lot of
dependencies we're going to protect all

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
dependencies we're going to protect all
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.920
dependencies we're going to protect all
of those dependent dependencies

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
of those dependent dependencies
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.899
of those dependent dependencies
separately running DX on each of them

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909
separately running DX on each of them
 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.309
separately running DX on each of them
and then at the end we have a merge

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319
and then at the end we have a merge
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.129
and then at the end we have a merge
state now the algorithm was pretty bad

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139
state now the algorithm was pretty bad
 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.140
state now the algorithm was pretty bad
unfortunately it was a quadratic

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150
unfortunately it was a quadratic
 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.659
unfortunately it was a quadratic
algorithm and so more and more

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669
algorithm and so more and more
 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:42.860
algorithm and so more and more
dependencies that you're having a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
dependencies that you're having a
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.319
dependencies that you're having a
project really slower it would get the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329
project really slower it would get the
 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.629

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820
big application and you have more than
 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.760
big application and you have more than
65 k method and you need to shrink it

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770
65 k method and you need to shrink it
 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.130
65 k method and you need to shrink it
below the actual limit so when you do

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140
below the actual limit so when you do
 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.420
below the actual limit so when you do
that then you need to run program on

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430
that then you need to run program on
 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.090
that then you need to run program on
every debug build and it's slow the main

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100
every debug build and it's slow the main
 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.980
every debug build and it's slow the main
problem it's non incremental and the

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990
problem it's non incremental and the
 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.140
problem it's non incremental and the
second problem is it disabled predicting

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150
second problem is it disabled predicting
 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.030
second problem is it disabled predicting
and by that I mean that you know when

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040
and by that I mean that you know when
 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.130
and by that I mean that you know when
you run proguard the output of proguard

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140
you run proguard the output of proguard
 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.690
you run proguard the output of proguard
is a single jar which means that you

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700
is a single jar which means that you
 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.940
is a single jar which means that you
have to read X the whole application and

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950
have to read X the whole application and
 

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.650
have to read X the whole application and
its dependencies every time and so

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660
its dependencies every time and so
 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.780
its dependencies every time and so
really wanted to fix that so we've been

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.790
really wanted to fix that so we've been
 

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.730
really wanted to fix that so we've been
working on a new shrinker it's

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740
working on a new shrinker it's
 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.430
working on a new shrinker it's
experimental right now the big thing is

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.440
experimental right now the big thing is
 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.070
experimental right now the big thing is
that it has some increment allottee but

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080
that it has some increment allottee but
 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.180
that it has some increment allottee but
the big thing really is that it

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190
the big thing really is that it
 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.760
the big thing really is that it
disability it enables predicting so if

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770
disability it enables predicting so if
 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.320
disability it enables predicting so if
you have let's say your main application

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:31.330
you have let's say your main application
 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.420
you have let's say your main application
plus ten dependencies the output of the

plus ten dependencies the output of the
 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.490

if the shrinker has to do a full non
 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.510
if the shrinker has to do a full non
incremental run it doesn't really matter

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520
incremental run it doesn't really matter
 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.850
incremental run it doesn't really matter
if it only touches one of those jar file

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:44.860
if it only touches one of those jar file
 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.550
if it only touches one of those jar file
the other nine jars will be the same and

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560
the other nine jars will be the same and
 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.260
the other nine jars will be the same and
greater allows us to just say you know

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.270
greater allows us to just say you know
 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.820
greater allows us to just say you know
hey those jars are the same I don't need

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:50.830
hey those jars are the same I don't need
 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.410
hey those jars are the same I don't need

is not to replace program you know so

00:07:59.460 --> 00:07:59.470

well right now if you first train quiz

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:14.950
well right now if you first train quiz
 

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.500
well right now if you first train quiz
program to get bit others if you like a

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:16.510
program to get bit others if you like a
 

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.210
program to get bit others if you like a
limit but you're still above it you have

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:18.220

mean sdk is not less than 21 so in that

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960
mean sdk is not less than 21 so in that
 

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.540
mean sdk is not less than 21 so in that
case what happened is the process is hey

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:24.550
case what happened is the process is hey
 

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.550

we run together sometime because it was

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560
we run together sometime because it was
 

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.230
we run together sometime because it was
slow the first time so let's running

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240
slow the first time so let's running
 

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.630
slow the first time so let's running
again yeah and so here you know because

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:30.640
again yeah and so here you know because
 

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.550
again yeah and so here you know because
we control the code of the shrinker it's

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560
we control the code of the shrinker it's
 

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.890
we control the code of the shrinker it's
easier to keep the graph of dependencies

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:34.900
easier to keep the graph of dependencies
 

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.060
easier to keep the graph of dependencies
and without codes and things like that

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.070
and without codes and things like that
 

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.030
and without codes and things like that
and actually run shrinker and multi

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.040
and actually run shrinker and multi
 

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.589
and actually run shrinker and multi
decks at the same time so that will come

00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599
decks at the same time so that will come
 

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.570
decks at the same time so that will come
later probably after to do we want to

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:42.580
later probably after to do we want to
 

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.530
later probably after to do we want to
stabilize first the shrinker for 40 dodo

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540
stabilize first the shrinker for 40 dodo

alpha one of the plug-in it will come in
the next

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:50.700
the next
 

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.000
the next
in a few weeks this is how you enable it

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.010
in a few weeks this is how you enable it
 

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.180
in a few weeks this is how you enable it
so you do have to enable minify still

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:56.190
so you do have to enable minify still
 

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.040
so you do have to enable minify still
but in debug you would say use program

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.050
but in debug you would say use program
 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.390
but in debug you would say use program
thoughts and in release you would say

00:08:59.390 --> 00:08:59.400
thoughts and in release you would say
 

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.340
thoughts and in release you would say
use forgot you actually it's true by

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:01.350
use forgot you actually it's true by
 

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.560
use forgot you actually it's true by
default so you don't need to say it but

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.570
default so you don't need to say it but
 

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.320
default so you don't need to say it but
this is what would happen here the

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.330
this is what would happen here the
 

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.810
this is what would happen here the
result so if we look at here the first

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820
result so if we look at here the first
 

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.040
result so if we look at here the first
thing I want to mention you know just to

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:10.050
thing I want to mention you know just to

thing I want to mention you know just to
go back to the DX mojo if you compare

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580
go back to the DX mojo if you compare
 

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.580
go back to the DX mojo if you compare
the clean build on the first column and

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:13.590
the clean build on the first column and
 

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.930
the clean build on the first column and

the clean build with shrinking on the
 

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.130
the clean build with shrinking on the

merging it's actually better not to do
 

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.880
merging it's actually better not to do
it but anyway we fix that so on the

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:28.890
it but anyway we fix that so on the
 

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.290
it but anyway we fix that so on the
right column you can see that you know

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300
right column you can see that you know
 

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.080
right column you can see that you know
we're quite faster than before almost

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.090
we're quite faster than before almost
 

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.450
we're quite faster than before almost
two decks and that is running the

shrinker in a known incremental way so

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.440
shrinker in a known incremental way so
as soon as there's a change we rerun the

to show the numbers we get you know a
 

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.190
to show the numbers we get you know a
little bit faster again so it's not you

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200
little bit faster again so it's not you
 

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.300

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.300
hopefully you know at least twice as
faster than the clean build fine

00:09:59.300 --> 00:09:59.310
faster than the clean build fine
 

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.090
faster than the clean build fine
crematory so that's quite good so that's

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100
crematory so that's quite good so that's
 

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.830
crematory so that's quite good so that's
the changes for actually building now we

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:03.840
the changes for actually building now we
 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.260
the changes for actually building now we
want to talk about deployment deployment

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.270
want to talk about deployment deployment
 

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.450
want to talk about deployment deployment
is slow we know a DB is slow so we

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:08.460
is slow we know a DB is slow so we
 

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.610
is slow we know a DB is slow so we
talked about it a little bit yesterday

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620
talked about it a little bit yesterday
 

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.620
talked about it a little bit yesterday
during the keynote you know we'd have a

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:12.630
during the keynote you know we'd have a
 

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.020
during the keynote you know we'd have a
new adb push pull protocol much faster

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:15.030
new adb push pull protocol much faster
 

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.300
new adb push pull protocol much faster
throughput it's coming to the emulator

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.310
throughput it's coming to the emulator
 

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.640
throughput it's coming to the emulator
soon and with some system image at least

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:19.650
soon and with some system image at least
 

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.650
soon and with some system image at least
22 APR 22 and 23 and we'll back power

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660
22 APR 22 and 23 and we'll back power
 

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.320
22 APR 22 and 23 and we'll back power
back later to two more system images so

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:27.330
back later to two more system images so
 

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.480
back later to two more system images so
the plane faster is great what we want

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:29.490
the plane faster is great what we want
 

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.610
the plane faster is great what we want
to do also is maybe Bush less right so

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620
to do also is maybe Bush less right so
 

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.450
to do also is maybe Bush less right so
we have a new mechanism in a studio 1.5

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:35.460
we have a new mechanism in a studio 1.5
 

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.830
we have a new mechanism in a studio 1.5
that you may have noticed where when you

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:36.840
that you may have noticed where when you
 

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.930
that you may have noticed where when you
click the Run button we first asked you

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940
click the Run button we first asked you
 

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.030
click the Run button we first asked you
you know where you want to deploy it to

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040
you know where you want to deploy it to
 

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.670
you know where you want to deploy it to
and then we build and then we deploy and

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680
and then we build and then we deploy and
 

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.140
and then we build and then we deploy and
before we would do first build and then

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.150
before we would do first build and then
 

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.380
before we would do first build and then
ask you so this is something that you

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:48.390
ask you so this is something that you
 

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.850
ask you so this is something that you
know it's not really did to what we

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860
know it's not really did to what we
 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.140
know it's not really did to what we
wanted to do but since we are doing that

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.150
wanted to do but since we are doing that
 

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.550
wanted to do but since we are doing that
now we figure out hey maybe we can do

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560
now we figure out hey maybe we can do
 

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.140
now we figure out hey maybe we can do
something so as I first proof of concept

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:54.150
something so as I first proof of concept
 

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.290
something so as I first proof of concept
we decided to do it to target

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300
we decided to do it to target
 

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.210
we decided to do it to target
specifically for your device in term of

00:10:59.210 --> 00:10:59.220
specifically for your device in term of
 

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.710
specifically for your device in term of
density so if you plug a device with

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720
density so if you plug a device with
 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.770
density so if you plug a device with
mdpi you know why package xhdpi why

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:03.780
mdpi you know why package xhdpi why
 

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.340
mdpi you know why package xhdpi why
package

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:04.350
package
 

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.490
package
xxhdpi and all of that so apt does that

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500
xxhdpi and all of that so apt does that
 

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.080
xxhdpi and all of that so apt does that
falls in a very smart way so if there's

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.090
falls in a very smart way so if there's
 

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.860
falls in a very smart way so if there's
some data I said that you do not have an

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:12.870
some data I said that you do not have an
 

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.170
some data I said that you do not have an
mdpi it will package another density

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180
mdpi it will package another density
 

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.000
mdpi it will package another density
basically like the device will choose

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.010
basically like the device will choose
 

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.190
basically like the device will choose
right if you have a device that you know

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200
right if you have a device that you know
 

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.510
right if you have a device that you know
has a density when you don't have those

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:20.520
has a density when you don't have those
 

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.080
has a density when you don't have those
assets it's fine some some other assets

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.090
assets it's fine some some other assets
 

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.450
assets it's fine some some other assets
to use so here we don't get a whole lot

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:26.460
to use so here we don't get a whole lot
 

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.310
to use so here we don't get a whole lot
only ten percent but you know this is

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320
only ten percent but you know this is
 

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.590
only ten percent but you know this is
still useful but we do want to extend

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600
still useful but we do want to extend
 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.030
still useful but we do want to extend
that to more thing so the things that

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040
that to more thing so the things that
 

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.590
that to more thing so the things that
you want to extend to for example our ad

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600
you want to extend to for example our ad
 

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.720
you want to extend to for example our ad
is right if you deploy to an x86 device

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:35.730
is right if you deploy to an x86 device
 

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.330
is right if you deploy to an x86 device
why build and package I'm code let's not

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:38.340
why build and package I'm code let's not
 

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.800
why build and package I'm code let's not
do it all right so we'll do that next

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:39.810
do it all right so we'll do that next
 

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.960
do it all right so we'll do that next
and that would be for people who have

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:41.970
and that would be for people who have
 

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.420
and that would be for people who have
native code beginning and then we want

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:44.430
native code beginning and then we want
 

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.280
native code beginning and then we want
to do that for multi text as well it's

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:46.290
to do that for multi text as well it's
 

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.750
to do that for multi text as well it's
not really packaging it's more building

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760
not really packaging it's more building
 

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.360
not really packaging it's more building
this time right now we tell you hey if

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.370
this time right now we tell you hey if
 

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.800
this time right now we tell you hey if
you have to use legacy multi legs and

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:51.810
you have to use legacy multi legs and
 

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.210
you have to use legacy multi legs and
you want it to be faster creative

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.220
you want it to be faster creative
 

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.120
you want it to be faster creative
violent for min SDK 21 and above so that

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.130
violent for min SDK 21 and above so that
 

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:57.530
violent for min SDK 21 and above so that
when you deploy it to let's say the

00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540
when you deploy it to let's say the
 

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.480
when you deploy it to let's say the
marshmallow device it uses the native

00:11:59.480 --> 00:11:59.490
marshmallow device it uses the native
 

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.370
marshmallow device it uses the native
multi text rather than the legacy so

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:01.380
multi text rather than the legacy so
 

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.440
multi text rather than the legacy so
here we're basically going to be able to

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:03.450
here we're basically going to be able to
 

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.330
here we're basically going to be able to
that automatically if you plug it 21 it

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:05.340
that automatically if you plug it 21 it
 

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.670
that automatically if you plug it 21 it
will just relate with the native one you

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680
will just relate with the native one you
 

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.200
will just relate with the native one you
unplug it you plug a different one and

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.210
unplug it you plug a different one and
 

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.780
unplug it you plug a different one and
it will use the legacy one that way you

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:11.790
it will use the legacy one that way you
 

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.010
it will use the legacy one that way you
don't have to think about changing the

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:13.020
don't have to think about changing the
 

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.750
don't have to think about changing the
variance and deploying the wrong guy on

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760
variance and deploying the wrong guy on
 

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.220
variance and deploying the wrong guy on
to the wrong device and all of that will

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:16.230
to the wrong device and all of that will
 

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.530
to the wrong device and all of that will
just take care of that for you ok so we

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540
just take care of that for you ok so we
 

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.120
just take care of that for you ok so we
saw building we saw deploying now you

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.130
saw building we saw deploying now you
 

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.710
saw building we saw deploying now you
have to install so i took this small

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720
have to install so i took this small
 

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.060
have to install so i took this small
little app right i was scheduled five

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:26.070
little app right i was scheduled five
 

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.950
little app right i was scheduled five
meg that's not really big and i try to

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:27.960
meg that's not really big and i try to
 

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.960
meg that's not really big and i try to
install it on my nexus 6 and the install

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:29.970
install it on my nexus 6 and the install
 

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.410
install it on my nexus 6 and the install
was 12 seconds which is just 12 seconds

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420
was 12 seconds which is just 12 seconds
 

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.630
was 12 seconds which is just 12 seconds
right it's awful i mean we have before

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:35.640
right it's awful i mean we have before
 

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.100
right it's awful i mean we have before
and after right it's like you know we

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.110
and after right it's like you know we
 

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.120
and after right it's like you know we
made some really good progress on

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:38.130
made some really good progress on
 

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.040
made some really good progress on
building you know 2.4 x that's awesome

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:40.050
building you know 2.4 x that's awesome
 

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.660
building you know 2.4 x that's awesome
and then we add installation and it's

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:41.670
and then we add installation and it's
 

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:46.250
and then we add installation and it's
just bad so you know 18 x is better than

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260
just bad so you know 18 x is better than
 

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.890
just bad so you know 18 x is better than
28 sorry 18 seconds is better than 28

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:48.900
28 sorry 18 seconds is better than 28
 

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.630
28 sorry 18 seconds is better than 28
but it's still just way too slow so we

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:50.640
but it's still just way too slow so we
 

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.880
but it's still just way too slow so we
wanted to fix that and so that's why we

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:52.890
wanted to fix that and so that's why we
 

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.140
wanted to fix that and so that's why we
didn't start trying right we really

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.150
didn't start trying right we really
 

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.330
didn't start trying right we really
wanted to change the whole deployment

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:56.340
wanted to change the whole deployment
 

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.430
wanted to change the whole deployment
cycle from end to end not just focus on

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440
cycle from end to end not just focus on
 

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.020
cycle from end to end not just focus on
building look at everything and we

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.030
building look at everything and we
 

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.460
building look at everything and we
wanted to do that in a way that worked

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:01.470
wanted to do that in a way that worked
 

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:03.860
wanted to do that in a way that worked
on all the devices as well so instant

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:03.870
on all the devices as well so instant
 

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.810
on all the devices as well so instant
run so what we want to do is we want to

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820
run so what we want to do is we want to
 

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.150
run so what we want to do is we want to
deploy as little as possible so only

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160
deploy as little as possible so only
 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.640
deploy as little as possible so only
what changed we want to avoid it

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:10.650
what changed we want to avoid it
 

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.500
what changed we want to avoid it
studying because as we just saw it 12

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:12.510
studying because as we just saw it 12
 

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.210
studying because as we just saw it 12
seconds or more if you have a much

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.220
seconds or more if you have a much
 

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.590
seconds or more if you have a much
bigger application right it could be a

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600
bigger application right it could be a
 

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.290
bigger application right it could be a
lot more and you know

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300
lot more and you know
 

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.190
lot more and you know
just not kill the app whatsoever right

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200
just not kill the app whatsoever right
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.170
just not kill the app whatsoever right
so to avoid killing the app it's not

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180
so to avoid killing the app it's not
 

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.790
so to avoid killing the app it's not
always possible if you made a completely

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800
always possible if you made a completely
 

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.280
always possible if you made a completely
structural change but when we can leave

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:28.290
structural change but when we can leave
 

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:29.330
structural change but when we can leave
it running that's what we called hot

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:29.340
it running that's what we called hot
 

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.120
it running that's what we called hot
swap so the app is just running if we

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.130
swap so the app is just running if we
 

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.250
swap so the app is just running if we
have to mess with your app in in more

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260
have to mess with your app in in more
 

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.080
have to mess with your app in in more
significant ways but still leave it

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.090
significant ways but still leave it
 

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.160
significant ways but still leave it
running that's what we called warm swap

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.170
running that's what we called warm swap
 

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.930
running that's what we called warm swap
so a resource change will trigger a warm

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940
so a resource change will trigger a warm
 

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.690
so a resource change will trigger a warm
swap cold swap is not in the preview

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700
swap cold swap is not in the preview
 

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.550
swap cold swap is not in the preview
build but that's where we restart your

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560
build but that's where we restart your
 

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.110
build but that's where we restart your
app in order to make bigger structural

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120
app in order to make bigger structural
 

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.340
app in order to make bigger structural
changes so that your objects have

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:46.350
changes so that your objects have
 

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.980
changes so that your objects have
changed and of course the last one is

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:48.990
changed and of course the last one is
 

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.110
changed and of course the last one is
full rebuild and restore if you change

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120
full rebuild and restore if you change
 

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.880
full rebuild and restore if you change
something for example the app icon we're

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:52.890
something for example the app icon we're
 

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:53.810
something for example the app icon we're
gonna have to do this because obviously

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820
gonna have to do this because obviously
 

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.550
gonna have to do this because obviously
your launcher wants to see the icon we

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560
your launcher wants to see the icon we
 

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.370
your launcher wants to see the icon we
can deal with that but every building we

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380
can deal with that but every building we
 

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.080
can deal with that but every building we
reinstall is where you are today before

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.090
reinstall is where you are today before
 

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.690
reinstall is where you are today before
instant run so let's see what happens

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:02.700
instant run so let's see what happens
 

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.220
instant run so let's see what happens
actually when you do a full regular

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.230
actually when you do a full regular
 

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.200
actually when you do a full regular
build with instance right right because

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.210
build with instance right right because
 

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.790
build with instance right right because
we have to prepare your application if

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800
we have to prepare your application if
 

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.140
we have to prepare your application if
you take a regular application build

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:09.150
you take a regular application build
 

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.850
you take a regular application build
with another version of studio we can

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860
with another version of studio we can
 

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.200
with another version of studio we can
just go and replace the phone the fly

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:12.210
just go and replace the phone the fly
 

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.450
just go and replace the phone the fly
there it's just not going to work so the

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:14.460
there it's just not going to work so the
 

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.620
there it's just not going to work so the
first thing that you have started doing

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:15.630
first thing that you have started doing
 

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.600
first thing that you have started doing
is when you build with Gradle from

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.610
is when you build with Gradle from
 

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.400
is when you build with Gradle from
studio we kind of do something a little

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:19.410
studio we kind of do something a little
 

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.900
studio we kind of do something a little
bit different right so we kind of called

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:20.910
bit different right so we kind of called
 

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.540
bit different right so we kind of called
studio we we call grade oil with you

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.550
studio we we call grade oil with you
 

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.770
studio we we call grade oil with you
know an additional properties saying hey

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:24.780
know an additional properties saying hey
 

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.900
know an additional properties saying hey
you're in that special mode and then

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:26.910
you're in that special mode and then
 

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.640
you're in that special mode and then
Gradle we create additional task in

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:28.650
Gradle we create additional task in
 

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:30.500
Gradle we create additional task in
order to do more work than if you build

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:30.510
order to do more work than if you build
 

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.510
order to do more work than if you build
from the command line so will you no

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:32.520
from the command line so will you no
 

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.800
from the command line so will you no
will you do by code instrumentation

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:33.810
will you do by code instrumentation
 

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.870
will you do by code instrumentation
we'll add a server to your app so that

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880
we'll add a server to your app so that
 

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.190
we'll add a server to your app so that
you can talk to it and things like that

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:37.200
you can talk to it and things like that
 

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.400
you can talk to it and things like that
so let's look at what it looks like so

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:40.410
so let's look at what it looks like so
 

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.010
so let's look at what it looks like so
this is a very simplified version of the

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:43.020
this is a very simplified version of the
 

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.360
this is a very simplified version of the
build steps right we have the manifest

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:44.370
build steps right we have the manifest
 

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.220
build steps right we have the manifest
merger that generate the final manifest

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.230
merger that generate the final manifest
 

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.810
merger that generate the final manifest
that we packaged with a PT and then we

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:47.820
that we packaged with a PT and then we
 

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.720
that we packaged with a PT and then we
have the Java CDX flow where we just you

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:50.730
have the Java CDX flow where we just you
 

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.820
have the Java CDX flow where we just you
know compile and convert code so the

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:52.830
know compile and convert code so the
 

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.260
know compile and convert code so the
first thing that we do is we stopped

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.270
first thing that we do is we stopped
 

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.270
first thing that we do is we stopped
fitting DX with your regular classes

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:56.280
fitting DX with your regular classes
 

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.220
fitting DX with your regular classes
right so we have a new API call you

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
right so we have a new API call you
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:59.870
right so we have a new API call you
transform API and I'll talk about that

00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880
transform API and I'll talk about that
 

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.400
transform API and I'll talk about that
in my other chalk on the Gradle plug-in

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:01.410
in my other chalk on the Gradle plug-in
 

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.560
in my other chalk on the Gradle plug-in
and so we are going to do that bike on

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:03.570
and so we are going to do that bike on
 

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.910
and so we are going to do that bike on
instrumentation and we're basically

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920
instrumentation and we're basically
 

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.440
instrumentation and we're basically
going to add a level of indirection to

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:06.450
going to add a level of indirection to
 

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.700
going to add a level of indirection to
every method and constructor in your

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:07.710
every method and constructor in your
 

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.740
every method and constructor in your
code so that we can go and replace stuff

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:09.750
code so that we can go and replace stuff
 

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.290
code so that we can go and replace stuff
on the fly later then you know I

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300
on the fly later then you know I
 

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.640
on the fly later then you know I
mentioned we need an app server because

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:13.650
mentioned we need an app server because
 

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.380
mentioned we need an app server because
to do we'll talk directly to the app so

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:15.390
to do we'll talk directly to the app so
 

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:18.080
to do we'll talk directly to the app so
we add that code to your app and then

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.090
we add that code to your app and then
 

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.900
we add that code to your app and then
you know we just send that to the X in

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:20.910
you know we just send that to the X in
 

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.490
you know we just send that to the X in
order to actually start the server and

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500
order to actually start the server and
 

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.320
order to actually start the server and
add some just some class loader and

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.330
add some just some class loader and
 

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.490
add some just some class loader and
things like that we actually have to

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500
things like that we actually have to
 

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.840
things like that we actually have to
change our manifest so we actually

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:26.850
change our manifest so we actually
 

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.550
change our manifest so we actually
instrument you know your manifest we add

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560
instrument you know your manifest we add
 

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.200
instrument you know your manifest we add
stuff to it and we add a new custom

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.210
stuff to it and we add a new custom
 

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.840
stuff to it and we add a new custom
application class

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:31.850
application class
 

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.920
application class
you know and then we actually need to

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:33.930
you know and then we actually need to
 

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:35.630
you know and then we actually need to
add your that particular application

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:35.640
add your that particular application
 

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.450
add your that particular application
class to your code and that you know if

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:38.460
class to your code and that you know if
 

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.950
class to your code and that you know if
you have already your own custom

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:39.960
you have already your own custom
 

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.050
you have already your own custom
application class that the one that we

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060
application class that the one that we
 

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.660
application class that the one that we
use will proxy and delegate to yours so

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:44.670
use will proxy and delegate to yours so
 

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.280
use will proxy and delegate to yours so
that it's transparent you know you don't

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.290
that it's transparent you know you don't
 

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.540
that it's transparent you know you don't
have anything to change right that was

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:47.550
have anything to change right that was
 

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.980
have anything to change right that was
one thing that we really wanted to do is

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:48.990
one thing that we really wanted to do is
 

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.320
one thing that we really wanted to do is
as a developer you should not have to go

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:51.330
as a developer you should not have to go
 

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.120
as a developer you should not have to go
and hack the code around to make the

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.130
and hack the code around to make the
 

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.290
and hack the code around to make the
appt work with instant and it should

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300
appt work with instant and it should
 

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.480
appt work with instant and it should
just work and then the final thing that

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:56.490
just work and then the final thing that
 

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:58.220
just work and then the final thing that
you are doing is in order to make sure

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.230
you are doing is in order to make sure
 

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.920
you are doing is in order to make sure
that the connection between the app and

00:15:59.920 --> 00:15:59.930
that the connection between the app and
 

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:02.390
that the connection between the app and
studio is valid we generate to build ID

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:02.400
studio is valid we generate to build ID
 

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.220
studio is valid we generate to build ID
on every bill to make sure that we know

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:04.230
on every bill to make sure that we know
 

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.510
on every bill to make sure that we know
what the current state is so when you're

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:08.520
what the current state is so when you're
 

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.460
what the current state is so when you're
hitting the Run button ni de this is

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.470
hitting the Run button ni de this is
 

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.260
hitting the Run button ni de this is
what happens so we first make sure that

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:12.270
what happens so we first make sure that
 

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.660
what happens so we first make sure that
you're actually using Gradle Tip O'Neill

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:13.670
you're actually using Gradle Tip O'Neill
 

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.100
you're actually using Gradle Tip O'Neill
and then we check the build IDs I've

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.110
and then we check the build IDs I've
 

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.300
and then we check the build IDs I've
just mentioned to make sure that the

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:17.310
just mentioned to make sure that the
 

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.460
just mentioned to make sure that the
device and Gradle are in sync because if

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:19.470
device and Gradle are in sync because if
 

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.710
device and Gradle are in sync because if
they're not if you've you know rent rent

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720
they're not if you've you know rent rent
 

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.870
they're not if you've you know rent rent
your device from a different developer

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880
your device from a different developer
 

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.100
your device from a different developer
machine or whatever it could be really

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.110
machine or whatever it could be really
 

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.480
machine or whatever it could be really
really bad if we put the wrong bites on

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:26.490
really bad if we put the wrong bites on
 

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.610
really bad if we put the wrong bites on
there that are incompatible then we make

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620
there that are incompatible then we make
 

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.050
there that are incompatible then we make
sure that we actually talked to it so we

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060
sure that we actually talked to it so we
 

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.060
sure that we actually talked to it so we
use the socket connection to the app and

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:32.070
use the socket connection to the app and
 

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.590
use the socket connection to the app and
then we check is the activity in the

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600
then we check is the activity in the
 

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.780
then we check is the activity in the
foreground and if all that's true then

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:35.790
foreground and if all that's true then
 

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.660
foreground and if all that's true then
we run Gradle and Gradle is run with a

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:38.670
we run Gradle and Gradle is run with a
 

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.550
we run Gradle and Gradle is run with a
different task which basically would

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560
different task which basically would
 

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.700
different task which basically would
build up the decks files it then runs a

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:43.710
build up the decks files it then runs a
 

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.110
build up the decks files it then runs a
verifier which makes sure that

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120
verifier which makes sure that
 

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.150
verifier which makes sure that
everything that you've done in your code

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160
everything that you've done in your code
 

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.210
everything that you've done in your code
is compatible with the hot swap and if

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220
is compatible with the hot swap and if
 

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.700
is compatible with the hot swap and if
it is of course we can do a hot swap

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:52.710
it is of course we can do a hot swap
 

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.100
it is of course we can do a hot swap
otherwise we will do a cold swap and the

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.110
otherwise we will do a cold swap and the
 

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.110
otherwise we will do a cold swap and the
other thing we do for optimization is to

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120
other thing we do for optimization is to
 

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.820
other thing we do for optimization is to
monitor that files you're editing in the

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:58.830
monitor that files you're editing in the
 

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.530
monitor that files you're editing in the
IDE and the reason we're doing that is

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540
IDE and the reason we're doing that is
 

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.690
IDE and the reason we're doing that is
that that allows the Gradle plug-in to

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:02.700
that that allows the Gradle plug-in to
 

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.150
that that allows the Gradle plug-in to
do certain optimizations they're not

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160
do certain optimizations they're not
 

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.800
do certain optimizations they're not
technically necessary but we're really

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:06.810
technically necessary but we're really
 

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.230
technically necessary but we're really
looking for latency avoidance and so if

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240
looking for latency avoidance and so if
 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.550
looking for latency avoidance and so if
I've noticed that you only touch java

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:10.560
I've noticed that you only touch java
 

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.720
I've noticed that you only touch java
files we don't have to touch the

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:11.730
files we don't have to touch the
 

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.819
files we don't have to touch the
resource task or similarly form only

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:13.829
resource task or similarly form only
 

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.189
resource task or similarly form only
touch the Java class anything so the

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199
touch the Java class anything so the
 

00:17:16.199 --> 00:17:18.949
touch the Java class anything so the
right now we only support hot-swap in

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959
right now we only support hot-swap in
 

00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:20.210
right now we only support hot-swap in
the main module we'll add that to the

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220
the main module we'll add that to the
 

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.679
the main module we'll add that to the
sub-module but one of the optimization

00:17:21.679 --> 00:17:21.689
sub-module but one of the optimization
 

00:17:21.689 --> 00:17:23.600
sub-module but one of the optimization
that we do is if you change the code in

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:23.610
that we do is if you change the code in
 

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:24.949
that we do is if you change the code in
the main module and you just ask greater

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959
the main module and you just ask greater
 

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:26.750
the main module and you just ask greater
to build it doesn't know anything about

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760
to build it doesn't know anything about
 

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.220
to build it doesn't know anything about
the state it doesn't monitor the file

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:28.230
the state it doesn't monitor the file
 

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.020
the state it doesn't monitor the file
change at the moment and so it's going

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.030
change at the moment and so it's going
 

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.520
change at the moment and so it's going
to try to build all your sub modules

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:31.530
to try to build all your sub modules
 

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.100
to try to build all your sub modules
which will be up to date but because it

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:34.110
which will be up to date but because it
 

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.240
which will be up to date but because it
doesn't know anything it has to go and

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.250
doesn't know anything it has to go and
 

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.380
doesn't know anything it has to go and
make sure that all the fines haven't

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:36.390
make sure that all the fines haven't
 

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.180
make sure that all the fines haven't
changed and if you have dozens of

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:38.190
changed and if you have dozens of
 

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.980
changed and if you have dozens of
modules that can take a lot of time now

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:39.990
modules that can take a lot of time now
 

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.300
modules that can take a lot of time now
if you actually run it you will see you

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:41.310
if you actually run it you will see you
 

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.590
if you actually run it you will see you
know up to date up to date up to date up

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600
know up to date up to date up to date up
 

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.700
know up to date up to date up to date up
to date and nothing change and that's

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:43.710
to date and nothing change and that's
 

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.520
to date and nothing change and that's
good but it

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:44.530
good but it
 

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.380
good but it
can't take still take some time if you

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:46.390
can't take still take some time if you
 

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.240
can't take still take some time if you
don't have you know an SSD if you have

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.250
don't have you know an SSD if you have
 

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.070
don't have you know an SSD if you have
slow I or whatever you know that's going

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080
slow I or whatever you know that's going
 

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.510
slow I or whatever you know that's going
to take a lot of time and so studio

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520
to take a lot of time and so studio
 

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.610
to take a lot of time and so studio
knows so studio tells you hey you know

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:53.620
knows so studio tells you hey you know
 

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.020
knows so studio tells you hey you know
only the main module change and then we

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.030
only the main module change and then we
 

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.970
only the main module change and then we
just you know something at the greater

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:56.980
just you know something at the greater
 

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.250
just you know something at the greater
plug-in we will just stop asking to

00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.260
plug-in we will just stop asking to
 

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.930
plug-in we will just stop asking to
build those and then we won't even do

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:00.940
build those and then we won't even do
 

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.190
build those and then we won't even do
the up-to-date check and then it's much

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200
the up-to-date check and then it's much
 

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.690
the up-to-date check and then it's much
much faster so this is what happens once

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:06.700
much faster so this is what happens once
 

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.130
much faster so this is what happens once
you get the actual file so here you have

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:08.140
you get the actual file so here you have
 

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.780
you get the actual file so here you have
studio on the left and then greater and

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:09.790
studio on the left and then greater and
 

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.160
studio on the left and then greater and
then on the right you have your app it's

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.170
then on the right you have your app it's
 

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.600
then on the right you have your app it's
running and it has a server and it has

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:12.610
running and it has a server and it has
 

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:14.880
running and it has a server and it has
that class that we just touched so you

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:14.890
that class that we just touched so you
 

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.530
that class that we just touched so you
know we call greater you know and then

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:16.540
know we call greater you know and then
 

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.480
know we call greater you know and then
here that's you know it's a custom task

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:18.490
here that's you know it's a custom task
 

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.310
here that's you know it's a custom task
it's not a regular as somebody buglet

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320
it's not a regular as somebody buglet
 

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.380
it's not a regular as somebody buglet
you would normally use and we create you

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:22.390
you would normally use and we create you
 

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.060
you would normally use and we create you
know a text file that contains only the

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.070
know a text file that contains only the
 

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.130
know a text file that contains only the
classes that change it could be one it

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:26.140
classes that change it could be one it
 

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.300
classes that change it could be one it
could be two depending on how many you

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:27.310
could be two depending on how many you
 

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.340
could be two depending on how many you
change then you know studio grabs that

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:29.350
change then you know studio grabs that
 

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.740
change then you know studio grabs that
send that to the app server which you

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:31.750
send that to the app server which you
 

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.480
send that to the app server which you
know gets ready to use a custom class

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:33.490
know gets ready to use a custom class
 

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.130
know gets ready to use a custom class
loader to just load it now the thing

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.140
loader to just load it now the thing
 

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.840
loader to just load it now the thing
that's important is that when we load it

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:36.850
that's important is that when we load it
 

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:38.880
that's important is that when we load it
we don't actually load the same class

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:38.890
we don't actually load the same class
 

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:41.070
we don't actually load the same class
that you actually you know what we

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080
that you actually you know what we
 

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.170
that you actually you know what we
actually yeah the class is there we

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:43.180
actually yeah the class is there we
 

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.060
actually yeah the class is there we
can't replace it so what we load instead

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.070
can't replace it so what we load instead
 

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.680
can't replace it so what we load instead
is the special version and that special

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:46.690
is the special version and that special
 

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.000
is the special version and that special
version is created by cradle itself

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.010
version is created by cradle itself
 

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.830
version is created by cradle itself
during the bytecode transformation and

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840
during the bytecode transformation and
 

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:52.170
during the bytecode transformation and
it's just another ride of it and then

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:52.180
it's just another ride of it and then
 

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.630
it's just another ride of it and then
the observer will just basically call

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640
the observer will just basically call
 

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:58.230
the observer will just basically call
you know modify the class here on the

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240
you know modify the class here on the
 

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.800
you know modify the class here on the
left to delegate every method called to

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:00.810
left to delegate every method called to
 

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.000
left to delegate every method called to
to the override and that's you know

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.010
to the override and that's you know
 

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.440
to the override and that's you know
that's because that version of the class

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:04.450
that's because that version of the class
 

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.090
that's because that version of the class
is a special version as i showed in the

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:06.100
is a special version as i showed in the
 

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.860
is a special version as i showed in the
first graph where we had that by college

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:07.870
first graph where we had that by college
 

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.960
first graph where we had that by college
mutation we go and we add like lavelle

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:09.970
mutation we go and we add like lavelle
 

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.910
mutation we go and we add like lavelle
of indirection so here the observer just

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:11.920
of indirection so here the observer just
 

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.340
of indirection so here the observer just
big make the connection between the

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.350
big make the connection between the
 

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.660
big make the connection between the
original class saying you know hey now

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:15.670
original class saying you know hey now
 

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.610
original class saying you know hey now
when we call that method just go and

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:17.620
when we call that method just go and
 

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.920
when we call that method just go and
call that version instead so for

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:21.930
call that version instead so for
 

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.260
call that version instead so for
resource changes we're currently relying

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.270
resource changes we're currently relying
 

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.720
resource changes we're currently relying
on sending all the resources so we have

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:27.730
on sending all the resources so we have
 

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:30.270
on sending all the resources so we have
to run apt and it so if you have an app

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280
to run apt and it so if you have an app
 

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.410
to run apt and it so if you have an app
that's really large with lots of

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:31.420
that's really large with lots of
 

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.910
that's really large with lots of
resources it's not going to be instant

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:32.920
resources it's not going to be instant
 

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.770
resources it's not going to be instant
so the instant run feature i think is

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:34.780
so the instant run feature i think is
 

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.080
so the instant run feature i think is
really after the hot swap case but there

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.090
really after the hot swap case but there
 

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.260
really after the hot swap case but there
is a incremental apt underway that's

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.270
is a incremental apt underway that's
 

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.610
is a incremental apt underway that's
going to really help with this a lot and

00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:41.620
going to really help with this a lot and
 

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.960
going to really help with this a lot and
we have some short-term tricks we're

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:42.970
we have some short-term tricks we're
 

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.520
we have some short-term tricks we're
going to do to to send a smaller portion

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.530
going to do to to send a smaller portion
 

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.520
going to do to to send a smaller portion
of the resource file and once we send it

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:47.530
of the resource file and once we send it
 

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.490
of the resource file and once we send it
across the wire we then use reflection

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:50.500
across the wire we then use reflection
 

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.290
across the wire we then use reflection
hacks and i think there's no prettier

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.300
hacks and i think there's no prettier
 

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.630
hacks and i think there's no prettier
way of referring to it to actually make

way of referring to it to actually make
that running app restart activity and

00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600
changes you made there are some
 

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.060
changes you made there are some
limitations to resource changes if you

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:01.070
limitations to resource changes if you
 

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.740
limitations to resource changes if you
change for example the app name or any

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:02.750
change for example the app name or any

manifest we know we have to trigger a

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720
manifest we know we have to trigger a
 

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.290
manifest we know we have to trigger a
full rebuild and the other thing is that

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:08.300
full rebuild and the other thing is that
 

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.540
full rebuild and the other thing is that
we you know until the preview build we

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:10.550
we you know until the preview build we
 

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.130
we you know until the preview build we
had some special optimizations where the

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.140
had some special optimizations where the
 

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.950
had some special optimizations where the
our class was treated specially so we

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960
our class was treated specially so we
 

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.930
our class was treated specially so we
would exclude you know field checks for

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:16.940
would exclude you know field checks for
 

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.060
would exclude you know field checks for
them but we saw some crashes so to be on

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.070
them but we saw some crashes so to be on
 

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.160
them but we saw some crashes so to be on
the safe side if you have any ID changes

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.170
the safe side if you have any ID changes
 

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.450
the safe side if you have any ID changes
as well so if you drop in a new button

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:22.460
as well so if you drop in a new button
 

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.490
as well so if you drop in a new button
in the layout editor that's going to put

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:24.500
in the layout editor that's going to put
 

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.290
in the layout editor that's going to put
an ID for you by default or even if you

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:26.300
an ID for you by default or even if you
 

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.850
an ID for you by default or even if you
have plus IDs and you reorder them

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:27.860
have plus IDs and you reorder them
 

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.410
have plus IDs and you reorder them
that'll change the values in our class

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:29.420
that'll change the values in our class
 

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.790
that'll change the values in our class
so those things right now will trigger a

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:30.800
so those things right now will trigger a
 

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.650
so those things right now will trigger a
a restart and so for cold swap this is

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.660
a restart and so for cold swap this is
 

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.730
a restart and so for cold swap this is
something that is not in the preview

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:36.740
something that is not in the preview
 

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.430
something that is not in the preview
build I will demo it shortly but that's

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440
build I will demo it shortly but that's
 

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.840
build I will demo it shortly but that's
when you have any compatible change so

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:40.850
when you have any compatible change so
 

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.610
when you have any compatible change so
you've added a field which currently is

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:42.620
you've added a field which currently is
 

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.060
you've added a field which currently is
an incompatible change and so we're

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:46.070
an incompatible change and so we're
 

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.980
an incompatible change and so we're
working on basically making that be not

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:47.990
working on basically making that be not
 

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:50.460
working on basically making that be not
a full rebuild which it is right now

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:50.470
a full rebuild which it is right now
 

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.170
a full rebuild which it is right now
okay so you know there's a lot of things

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:53.180
okay so you know there's a lot of things
 

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.670
okay so you know there's a lot of things
happening under the hood by consume

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:54.680
happening under the hood by consume
 

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.110
happening under the hood by consume
attrition replacing class on the fly but

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120
attrition replacing class on the fly but
 

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.910
attrition replacing class on the fly but
we wanted it to be as easy for you as

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:57.920
we wanted it to be as easy for you as

possible right the user interface for
instant run is just like the Run button

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960
instant run is just like the Run button
 

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.200
instant run is just like the Run button
that you've used before all right so the

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.210
that you've used before all right so the
 

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.180
that you've used before all right so the
goal is that studio knows whether we can

goal is that studio knows whether we can
 

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:08.710
goal is that studio knows whether we can
do instruction whether we can do cold

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720
do instruction whether we can do cold
 

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.960

next to the Run button then you know

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:17.210
next to the Run button then you know
 

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.690
next to the Run button then you know
that you know you have instant run but

that you know you have instant run but
 

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.640

you know just keep pressing that button

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:21.650
you know just keep pressing that button
 

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:23.860
you know just keep pressing that button

you do that it will kill the app and
 

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.070
you do that it will kill the app and
then on the next one it will do a

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.450
activity right there are some case we
replace stuff that we can actually apply

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:55.460
replace stuff that we can actually apply
 

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:59.050
replace stuff that we can actually apply
it so we have a shortcut for that all

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.060
it so we have a shortcut for that all
 

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.830
it so we have a shortcut for that all
right demo can we get stage two all

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840
right demo can we get stage two all
 

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.630
right demo can we get stage two all
right so here is a old project you can

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640
right so here is a old project you can
 

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.550
right so here is a old project you can
see it's using the ancient Gradle

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:06.560
see it's using the ancient Gradle
 

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.610
see it's using the ancient Gradle
plug-in 1.5 and if you bring up the

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:09.620
plug-in 1.5 and if you bring up the
 

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.899
plug-in 1.5 and if you bring up the
Preferences panel

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:10.909
Preferences panel
 

00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:13.210
Preferences panel
and you go to the instant run settings

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:13.220
and you go to the instant run settings
 

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.320
and you go to the instant run settings
you can say it's telling me right now

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:14.330
you can say it's telling me right now
 

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.969
you can say it's telling me right now
that I don't have instant run because I

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:15.979
that I don't have instant run because I
 

00:22:15.979 --> 00:22:18.009
that I don't have instant run because I
need to update my project what that will

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:18.019
need to update my project what that will
 

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:19.810
need to update my project what that will
do is it'll update the Gradle people

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:19.820
do is it'll update the Gradle people
 

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.129
do is it'll update the Gradle people
know but it'll also give you build tools

00:22:21.129 --> 00:22:21.139
know but it'll also give you build tools
 

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:24.369
know but it'll also give you build tools
2302 which isn't necessary but really

00:22:24.369 --> 00:22:24.379
2302 which isn't necessary but really
 

00:22:24.379 --> 00:22:26.049
2302 which isn't necessary but really
it's gonna be much you should use them

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.059
it's gonna be much you should use them
 

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:28.539
it's gonna be much you should use them
anyways yeah and Gradle plug-in 2.8 all

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:28.549
anyways yeah and Gradle plug-in 2.8 all
 

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:30.070
anyways yeah and Gradle plug-in 2.8 all
right so here I'm going to switch to a

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080
right so here I'm going to switch to a
 

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.229
right so here I'm going to switch to a
different project in topeka sample app

00:22:32.229 --> 00:22:32.239
different project in topeka sample app
 

00:22:32.239 --> 00:22:35.619
different project in topeka sample app
which I've already run on the device so

00:22:35.619 --> 00:22:35.629
which I've already run on the device so
 

00:22:35.629 --> 00:22:36.700
which I've already run on the device so
let me show you some of the instant run

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:36.710
let me show you some of the instant run
 

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.279
let me show you some of the instant run
stuff the first thing we can do here is

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:39.289
stuff the first thing we can do here is
 

00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:41.469
stuff the first thing we can do here is
we can change some resources so CSS sign

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:41.479
we can change some resources so CSS sign
 

00:22:41.479 --> 00:22:43.359
we can change some resources so CSS sign
in at the top let me open up the

00:22:43.359 --> 00:22:43.369
in at the top let me open up the
 

00:22:43.369 --> 00:22:45.580
in at the top let me open up the
translations editor and find the sign in

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:45.590
translations editor and find the sign in
 

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.089
translations editor and find the sign in
string and we'll just change it to

00:22:48.089 --> 00:22:48.099
string and we'll just change it to
 

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:52.839
string and we'll just change it to
welcome sign in and if i hit the instant

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:52.849
welcome sign in and if i hit the instant
 

00:22:52.849 --> 00:22:56.200
welcome sign in and if i hit the instant
run button it now performs a incremental

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:56.210
run button it now performs a incremental
 

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.389
run button it now performs a incremental
build a grabs total resource file and it

00:22:58.389 --> 00:22:58.399
build a grabs total resource file and it
 

00:22:58.399 --> 00:23:00.249
build a grabs total resource file and it
sends it over and it restarts activity

00:23:00.249 --> 00:23:00.259
sends it over and it restarts activity
 

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:01.899
sends it over and it restarts activity
you can see it says welcome sign in over

00:23:01.899 --> 00:23:01.909
you can see it says welcome sign in over
 

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:04.950
you can see it says welcome sign in over
here if i switch to the theme editor i

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960
here if i switch to the theme editor i
 

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.269
here if i switch to the theme editor i
can make non string changes too so let's

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279
can make non string changes too so let's
 

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:09.519
can make non string changes too so let's
for example go and change the primary

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:09.529
for example go and change the primary
 

00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:13.299
for example go and change the primary
color to material red material pink yeah

00:23:13.299 --> 00:23:13.309
color to material red material pink yeah
 

00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:15.669
color to material red material pink yeah
we'll do red amba can also change the

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679
we'll do red amba can also change the
 

00:23:15.679 --> 00:23:18.879
we'll do red amba can also change the
status color for the device which I

00:23:18.879 --> 00:23:18.889
status color for the device which I
 

00:23:18.889 --> 00:23:21.549
status color for the device which I
thought was now I can't see it there it

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559
thought was now I can't see it there it
 

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:24.789
thought was now I can't see it there it
is so we'll switch that to let's say

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799
is so we'll switch that to let's say
 

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:27.369
is so we'll switch that to let's say
this one and again if i press instant

00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:27.379
this one and again if i press instant
 

00:23:27.379 --> 00:23:30.700
this one and again if i press instant
run the package the resources the app is

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:30.710
run the package the resources the app is
 

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.099
run the package the resources the app is
still running and it applies to those

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:33.109
still running and it applies to those
 

00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:36.810
still running and it applies to those
changes so let's make some code changes

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:36.820
changes so let's make some code changes
 

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.609
changes so let's make some code changes
so if you look at this grid of icons

00:23:39.609 --> 00:23:39.619
so if you look at this grid of icons
 

00:23:39.619 --> 00:23:41.649
so if you look at this grid of icons
over here the number of icons this

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:41.659
over here the number of icons this
 

00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:43.690
over here the number of icons this
dynamic is based on the size of the

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:43.700
dynamic is based on the size of the
 

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:45.489
dynamic is based on the size of the
avatar icons and the size of the screen

00:23:45.489 --> 00:23:45.499
avatar icons and the size of the screen
 

00:23:45.499 --> 00:23:47.049
avatar icons and the size of the screen
and it's done by this method right here

00:23:47.049 --> 00:23:47.059
and it's done by this method right here
 

00:23:47.059 --> 00:23:50.320
and it's done by this method right here
calculate spam count I can just go and

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:50.330
calculate spam count I can just go and
 

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.180
calculate spam count I can just go and
change this code let's say this is

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:52.190
change this code let's say this is
 

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.219
change this code let's say this is
hard-coded two three four now and if i

00:23:54.219 --> 00:23:54.229
hard-coded two three four now and if i
 

00:23:54.229 --> 00:23:58.960
hard-coded two three four now and if i
press isn't run you can see that nothing

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:58.970
press isn't run you can see that nothing
 

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.479
press isn't run you can see that nothing
happens and you can see that it was

00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:01.489
happens and you can see that it was
 

00:24:01.489 --> 00:24:03.460
happens and you can see that it was
saying in the toast we've made this

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:03.470
saying in the toast we've made this
 

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.710
saying in the toast we've made this
change for you but you know you may want

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720
change for you but you know you may want
 

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.759
change for you but you know you may want
to restart activity and that's because

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:06.769
to restart activity and that's because
 

00:24:06.769 --> 00:24:09.759
to restart activity and that's because
this code is only run on create right so

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:09.769
this code is only run on create right so
 

00:24:09.769 --> 00:24:10.960
this code is only run on create right so
just because I'm hot swapped it doesn't

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:10.970
just because I'm hot swapped it doesn't
 

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.489
just because I'm hot swapped it doesn't
really make you know make the change

00:24:12.489 --> 00:24:12.499
really make you know make the change
 

00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:14.529
really make you know make the change
visually appear but there's also a

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:14.539
visually appear but there's also a
 

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:15.639
visually appear but there's also a
bubble we're showing in the bottom left

00:24:15.639 --> 00:24:15.649
bubble we're showing in the bottom left
 

00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:17.440
bubble we're showing in the bottom left
corner here saying hey you know you

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:17.450
corner here saying hey you know you
 

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.489
corner here saying hey you know you
haven't restarted pivot II would you

00:24:18.489 --> 00:24:18.499
haven't restarted pivot II would you
 

00:24:18.499 --> 00:24:19.779
haven't restarted pivot II would you
like to do that it's telling you what

00:24:19.779 --> 00:24:19.789
like to do that it's telling you what
 

00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:21.430
like to do that it's telling you what
the shortcut is for doing it or you can

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440
the shortcut is for doing it or you can
 

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.750
the shortcut is for doing it or you can
also configure it by options so if I

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:24.760
also configure it by options so if I
 

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.780
also configure it by options so if I
first of all I'll set turn the option on

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:27.790
first of all I'll set turn the option on
 

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:30.220
first of all I'll set turn the option on
but also just applied manually right now

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:30.230
but also just applied manually right now
 

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:31.510
but also just applied manually right now
control shift are you can see if we got

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520
control shift are you can see if we got
 

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.660
control shift are you can see if we got
our three columns and now if I switch it

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:34.670
our three columns and now if I switch it
 

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:36.760
our three columns and now if I switch it
to four for example and press ctrl run

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:36.770
to four for example and press ctrl run
 

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.970
to four for example and press ctrl run
you can see it's nearly instant right

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:39.980
you can see it's nearly instant right
 

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.730
you can see it's nearly instant right
four columns so that's basically the hot

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:42.740
four columns so that's basically the hot
 

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.560
four columns so that's basically the hot
swap case and the warm swap case with

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:44.570
swap case and the warm swap case with
 

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.000
swap case and the warm swap case with
the resources now I'm going to show your

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.010
the resources now I'm going to show your
 

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.650
the resources now I'm going to show your
cold swap so cold swap is not actually

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:47.660
cold swap so cold swap is not actually
 

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.200
cold swap so cold swap is not actually
enabled and the reason for that is

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.210
enabled and the reason for that is
 

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.480
enabled and the reason for that is
primarily that it's really really buggy

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:52.490
primarily that it's really really buggy
 

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.070
primarily that it's really really buggy
so you can see I have an option here

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080
so you can see I have an option here
 

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.620
so you can see I have an option here
called demo only and that's because you

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:56.630
called demo only and that's because you
 

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.620
called demo only and that's because you
know this is not available in your build

00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:58.630
know this is not available in your build
 

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.520
know this is not available in your build
but i'm going to show you what it does

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:00.530
but i'm going to show you what it does
 

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.040
but i'm going to show you what it does
when we hopefully get it working so

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:03.050
when we hopefully get it working so
 

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.160
when we hopefully get it working so
let's put their real code back in and

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:06.170
let's put their real code back in and
 

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:08.080
let's put their real code back in and
let me do some method extraction here so

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:08.090
let me do some method extraction here so
 

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.360
let me do some method extraction here so
i'm going to actually extract this whole

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:10.370
i'm going to actually extract this whole
 

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.630
i'm going to actually extract this whole
line will call it get avatar sighs oh

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640
line will call it get avatar sighs oh
 

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.760
line will call it get avatar sighs oh
and the ID noticed hey this is a pretty

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:15.770
and the ID noticed hey this is a pretty
 

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:17.170
and the ID noticed hey this is a pretty
generic method let me try to generalize

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:17.180
generic method let me try to generalize
 

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.210
generic method let me try to generalize
that for you so now it's basically

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:19.220
that for you so now it's basically
 

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.860
that for you so now it's basically
turned it into something different which

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:20.870
turned it into something different which
 

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.860
turned it into something different which
I'll call get dimension and then we will

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:23.870
I'll call get dimension and then we will
 

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.260
I'll call get dimension and then we will
extract this expression over here to you

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:26.270
extract this expression over here to you
 

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.640
extract this expression over here to you
know calculate columns alright so now we

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:30.650
know calculate columns alright so now we
 

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.400
know calculate columns alright so now we
have some structural changes and because

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.410
have some structural changes and because
 

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.690
have some structural changes and because
i did a turned on cold swap if i hit run

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:37.700
i did a turned on cold swap if i hit run
 

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.080
i did a turned on cold swap if i hit run
now it's gonna kill the app and restart

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.090
now it's gonna kill the app and restart
 

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.210
now it's gonna kill the app and restart
it but it's not doing a full build you

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:43.220
it but it's not doing a full build you
 

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.530
it but it's not doing a full build you
can see it's little bubble saying hey

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:44.540
can see it's little bubble saying hey
 

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.810
can see it's little bubble saying hey
method added we couldn't really restart

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:46.820
method added we couldn't really restart
 

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.780
method added we couldn't really restart
it but now the app is back and running

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:49.790
it but now the app is back and running
 

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.760
it but now the app is back and running
and it's running a new code although

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:51.770
and it's running a new code although
 

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.560
and it's running a new code although
it's the correct code so let me change

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:53.570
it's the correct code so let me change
 

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.970
it's the correct code so let me change
it to prove that this new method can do

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:54.980
it to prove that this new method can do
 

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.210
it to prove that this new method can do
the right thing so instead run two

00:25:58.210 --> 00:25:58.220
the right thing so instead run two
 

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.560
the right thing so instead run two
columns from the new method so that's

00:25:59.560 --> 00:25:59.570
columns from the new method so that's
 

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.840
columns from the new method so that's
that's cold swap which hopefully will

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:01.850
that's cold swap which hopefully will
 

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.150
that's cold swap which hopefully will
get working soon the last thing I want

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:04.160
get working soon the last thing I want
 

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.120
get working soon the last thing I want
to show you is data binding so data

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.130
to show you is data binding so data
 

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.650
to show you is data binding so data
binding also broke for the preview build

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:08.660
binding also broke for the preview build
 

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.760
binding also broke for the preview build
we have it working in the night place

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:09.770
we have it working in the night place
 

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.150
we have it working in the night place
again one other actually let me just run

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:13.160
again one other actually let me just run
 

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.120
again one other actually let me just run
it first of all so this is a sample app

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:16.130
it first of all so this is a sample app
 

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.040
it first of all so this is a sample app
I found in the data binding code

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.050
I found in the data binding code
 

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.950
I found in the data binding code
repository I don't know what the app

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960
repository I don't know what the app
 

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.280
repository I don't know what the app
means but it has some buying expression

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.290
means but it has some buying expression
 

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.480
means but it has some buying expression
so I can show you so while that's

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:28.490
so I can show you so while that's
 

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.930
so I can show you so while that's
starting let me show you the stuff we

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:31.940
starting let me show you the stuff we
 

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.010
starting let me show you the stuff we
have predated money now this is not

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.020
have predated money now this is not
 

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.090
have predated money now this is not
integrated in the previous a added code

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:37.100
integrated in the previous a added code
 

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.499
integrated in the previous a added code
completion for expression language

00:26:38.499 --> 00:26:38.509
completion for expression language
 

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:41.549
completion for expression language
so here not only can i navigate between

00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559
so here not only can i navigate between
 

00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:44.979
so here not only can i navigate between
symbols and into you know methods and

00:26:44.979 --> 00:26:44.989
symbols and into you know methods and
 

00:26:44.989 --> 00:26:47.259
symbols and into you know methods and
data objects we also have full code

00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:47.269
data objects we also have full code
 

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:48.489
data objects we also have full code
completion here on all the attributes

00:26:48.489 --> 00:26:48.499
completion here on all the attributes
 

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:52.479
completion here on all the attributes
and all that stuff so that's nice so let

00:26:52.479 --> 00:26:52.489
and all that stuff so that's nice so let
 

00:26:52.489 --> 00:26:53.949
and all that stuff so that's nice so let
me just as you can see in this app here

00:26:53.949 --> 00:26:53.959
me just as you can see in this app here
 

00:26:53.959 --> 00:26:55.749
me just as you can see in this app here
we have uppercase characters in some of

00:26:55.749 --> 00:26:55.759
we have uppercase characters in some of
 

00:26:55.759 --> 00:26:57.310
we have uppercase characters in some of
these name cards if I were to change

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320
these name cards if I were to change
 

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.649
these name cards if I were to change
this to lowercase and do instant run you

00:27:02.649 --> 00:27:02.659
this to lowercase and do instant run you
 

00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:06.339
this to lowercase and do instant run you
can see that hopefully soon yeah it

00:27:06.339 --> 00:27:06.349
can see that hopefully soon yeah it
 

00:27:06.349 --> 00:27:07.359
can see that hopefully soon yeah it
applied the change and you can see it's

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:07.369
applied the change and you can see it's
 

00:27:07.369 --> 00:27:08.859
applied the change and you can see it's
not lower case so data by name is

00:27:08.859 --> 00:27:08.869
not lower case so data by name is
 

00:27:08.869 --> 00:27:09.939
not lower case so data by name is
working to and that'll hopefully make

00:27:09.939 --> 00:27:09.949
working to and that'll hopefully make
 

00:27:09.949 --> 00:27:10.989
working to and that'll hopefully make
their binding and its and run work

00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:10.999
their binding and its and run work
 

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:13.029
their binding and its and run work
really well together that's it for the

00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039
really well together that's it for the
 

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:23.060
really well together that's it for the
demo

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:23.070
 
 

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.889
 
alright so android emulator we talked

00:27:25.889 --> 00:27:25.899
alright so android emulator we talked
 

00:27:25.899 --> 00:27:27.629
alright so android emulator we talked
about the android emulator at the

00:27:27.629 --> 00:27:27.639
about the android emulator at the
 

00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:29.669
about the android emulator at the
keynote yesterday and we really wanted

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679
keynote yesterday and we really wanted
 

00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:31.169
keynote yesterday and we really wanted
to invest time and effort into the

00:27:31.169 --> 00:27:31.179
to invest time and effort into the
 

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:33.090
to invest time and effort into the
product because we knew we use it all

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:33.100
product because we knew we use it all
 

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.680
product because we knew we use it all
the time as a developer but it hasn't

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:34.690
the time as a developer but it hasn't
 

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.149
the time as a developer but it hasn't
been as great as we wanted it to be a as

00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159
been as great as we wanted it to be a as
 

00:27:36.159 --> 00:27:38.909
been as great as we wanted it to be a as
a team so the two things we worked on

00:27:38.909 --> 00:27:38.919
a team so the two things we worked on
 

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:40.889
a team so the two things we worked on
first is performance the second thing

00:27:40.889 --> 00:27:40.899
first is performance the second thing
 

00:27:40.899 --> 00:27:42.840
first is performance the second thing
its usability and we think of

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:42.850
its usability and we think of
 

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:44.099
its usability and we think of
performance in three different ways for

00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:44.109
performance in three different ways for
 

00:27:44.109 --> 00:27:47.969
performance in three different ways for
the emulator it's around cpu GPU and i

00:27:47.969 --> 00:27:47.979
the emulator it's around cpu GPU and i
 

00:27:47.979 --> 00:27:50.940
the emulator it's around cpu GPU and i
oh so for cpu will be added to the

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:50.950
oh so for cpu will be added to the
 

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.820
oh so for cpu will be added to the
emulator as multi core support what

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:53.830
emulator as multi core support what
 

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.320
emulator as multi core support what
allows you to do is that you can

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.330
allows you to do is that you can
 

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.029
allows you to do is that you can
actually process your apps faster and

00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039
actually process your apps faster and
 

00:27:57.039 --> 00:27:58.710
actually process your apps faster and
install them faster and get a more

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720
install them faster and get a more
 

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.779
install them faster and get a more
performant experience in the emulator

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:00.789
performant experience in the emulator
 

00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:04.139
performant experience in the emulator
for GPU if I just kind of strong

00:28:04.139 --> 00:28:04.149
for GPU if I just kind of strong
 

00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:05.940
for GPU if I just kind of strong
offering so far with the added

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:05.950
offering so far with the added
 

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:07.830
offering so far with the added
additional GL calls so you actually can

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840
additional GL calls so you actually can
 

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.499
additional GL calls so you actually can
support more GL applications and get a

00:28:10.499 --> 00:28:10.509
support more GL applications and get a
 

00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:12.629
support more GL applications and get a
more performant experience while using

00:28:12.629 --> 00:28:12.639
more performant experience while using
 

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:15.690
more performant experience while using
OpenGL ES and the third column we added

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:15.700
OpenGL ES and the third column we added
 

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.019
OpenGL ES and the third column we added
is I oh so zap touched on about adb push

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:19.029
is I oh so zap touched on about adb push
 

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:21.719
is I oh so zap touched on about adb push
speeds we also look at the i/o speed on

00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:21.729
speeds we also look at the i/o speed on
 

00:28:21.729 --> 00:28:24.389
speeds we also look at the i/o speed on
the actual virtual device in itself it's

00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399
the actual virtual device in itself it's
 

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:25.979
the actual virtual device in itself it's
like a little mini hard drive we

00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:25.989
like a little mini hard drive we
 

00:28:25.989 --> 00:28:27.599
like a little mini hard drive we
actually improve that very dramatically

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:27.609
actually improve that very dramatically
 

00:28:27.609 --> 00:28:29.639
actually improve that very dramatically
in order to improve things like install

00:28:29.639 --> 00:28:29.649
in order to improve things like install
 

00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:32.549
in order to improve things like install
time and processing time so let's look

00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559
time and processing time so let's look
 

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:34.049
time and processing time so let's look
isn't data to sort of highlight that

00:28:34.049 --> 00:28:34.059
isn't data to sort of highlight that
 

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:36.180
isn't data to sort of highlight that
particular data point and so we looked

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:36.190
particular data point and so we looked
 

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.499
particular data point and so we looked
at the google play store and try to find

00:28:37.499 --> 00:28:37.509
at the google play store and try to find
 

00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:38.700
at the google play store and try to find
the biggest not possible to kind of

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:38.710
the biggest not possible to kind of
 

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.680
the biggest not possible to kind of
highlight this particular scenario we

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:40.690
highlight this particular scenario we
 

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:41.729
highlight this particular scenario we
found one it's about forty five

00:28:41.729 --> 00:28:41.739
found one it's about forty five
 

00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:43.680
found one it's about forty five
megabytes it's quite extreme most

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:43.690
megabytes it's quite extreme most
 

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.810
megabytes it's quite extreme most
developers don't have apps this big but

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:45.820
developers don't have apps this big but
 

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.060
developers don't have apps this big but
let's just use this as an example so in

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.070
let's just use this as an example so in
 

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:50.249
let's just use this as an example so in
the past the emulator 1 dot 0 will take

00:28:50.249 --> 00:28:50.259
the past the emulator 1 dot 0 will take
 

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:53.310
the past the emulator 1 dot 0 will take
just under 300 seconds to install and

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320
just under 300 seconds to install and
 

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.409
just under 300 seconds to install and
push that application most of the time

Bluetooth connection so you can send

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640
Bluetooth connection so you can send
 

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.250
Bluetooth connection so you can send
messages between your Android wear and

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260
messages between your Android wear and
 

00:36:55.260 --> 00:37:01.020
messages between your Android wear and
the device thank you

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.030
 
 

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.890
 
do you know if you can modify the

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:02.900
do you know if you can modify the
 

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.540
do you know if you can modify the
network settings in the emulator so you

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:04.550
network settings in the emulator so you
 

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.700
network settings in the emulator so you
can point to a proxy a local proxy for

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:06.710
can point to a proxy a local proxy for
 

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.140
can point to a proxy a local proxy for
me to use like Charles or something like

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:08.150
me to use like Charles or something like
 

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:11.230
me to use like Charles or something like
that to sniff network traffic you want

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240
that to sniff network traffic you want
 

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.220
that to sniff network traffic you want
to set one time point the wife Wi-Fi

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:15.230
to set one time point the wife Wi-Fi
 

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.079
to set one time point the wife Wi-Fi
connection on the emulator to a local

00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:17.089
connection on the emulator to a local
 

00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:18.790
connection on the emulator to a local
proxy so you could sniff network traffic

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800
proxy so you could sniff network traffic
 

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.770
proxy so you could sniff network traffic
like using Charles proxy or something

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:20.780
like using Charles proxy or something
 

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:24.400
like using Charles proxy or something
like that I don't think so what's the

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:24.410
like that I don't think so what's the
 

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.950
like that I don't think so what's the
stock afterwards I think do we don't

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960
stock afterwards I think do we don't
 

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.480
stock afterwards I think do we don't
have Wi-Fi in addition because there's

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:28.490
have Wi-Fi in addition because there's
 

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:29.800
have Wi-Fi in addition because there's
only one network connection on the

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:29.810
only one network connection on the
 

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.030
only one network connection on the
emulator right now it's something we're

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040
emulator right now it's something we're
 

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.349
emulator right now it's something we're
working on so right now you only have

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359
working on so right now you only have
 

00:37:32.359 --> 00:37:35.050
working on so right now you only have
basically the network connection but

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.060
basically the network connection but
 

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.730
basically the network connection but
it's something we want to fix it cool

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:36.740
it's something we want to fix it cool
 

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:39.220
it's something we want to fix it cool
let's go to the side hi you mentioned

studio so it's actually a good winner so

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440
studio so it's actually a good winner so
 

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.200
studio so it's actually a good winner so
we just added and talked about it a

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.210
we just added and talked about it a
 

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:52.060
we just added and talked about it a
little bit in the next talk but cradle

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.070
little bit in the next talk but cradle
 

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:54.820
little bit in the next talk but cradle
but we just added well its support for

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:54.830
but we just added well its support for
 

00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:58.030
but we just added well its support for
modules that only build native code ok

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040
modules that only build native code ok
 

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.930
modules that only build native code ok
and we also just added in char module

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:01.940
and we also just added in char module
 

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.180
and we also just added in char module

different modules so you should be able
 

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:25.030
different modules so you should be able
to do that now okay thanks so the

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040
to do that now okay thanks so the
 

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.980

gonna be the initial release for that
but we are planning to do add more fit

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:43.040
but we are planning to do add more fit
 

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.040

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:10.970
emulator is it possible to simulate
 

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:16.450
emulator is it possible to simulate
partial or total packet loss so there so

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:16.460
partial or total packet loss so there so
 

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.220

want to like degra gate to 2g network
 

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.860
want to like degra gate to 2g network
and they can simulate that such

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:26.870
and they can simulate that such
 

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:31.450
and they can simulate that such
situation today so you showed a demo

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:31.460
situation today so you showed a demo
 

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:34.270
situation today so you showed a demo
that simulated the location changes I'm

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280
that simulated the location changes I'm
 

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.740
that simulated the location changes I'm
assuming that's intended for the

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:35.750
assuming that's intended for the
 

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.740
assuming that's intended for the
geofencing api testing that out and you

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:38.750
geofencing api testing that out and you
 

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.560
geofencing api testing that out and you
also mentioned the support for KML files

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:41.570
also mentioned the support for KML files
 

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.200
also mentioned the support for KML files
what about GPX files yeah so we parse

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:44.210
what about GPX files yeah so we parse
 

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:49.450
what about GPX files yeah so we parse
GPX and KML okay yeah so does what when

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:49.460
GPX and KML okay yeah so does what when
 

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.070
GPX and KML okay yeah so does what when
you're when you install with instant run

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:51.080
you're when you install with instant run
 

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.590

that still going to work in the same way
 

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.230
that still going to work in the same way

it runs just fine yeah the only thing is

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:03.830
it runs just fine yeah the only thing is
 

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:05.380
it runs just fine yeah the only thing is
that it does some extra stuff like

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:05.390
that it does some extra stuff like
 

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.210
that it does some extra stuff like

for some of these emulator features so

00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:17.570
for some of these emulator features so
 

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:19.560
for some of these emulator features so
if we're running integration tests on

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:19.570
if we're running integration tests on
 

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:21.490
if we're running integration tests on
emulators and that kind of stuff we can

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:21.500
emulators and that kind of stuff we can
 

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.100
emulators and that kind of stuff we can
control some of the settings

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.110
control some of the settings
 

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.840
control some of the settings
yeah that's not in the first release

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:25.850
yeah that's not in the first release
 

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.080
yeah that's not in the first release
something been thinking about but we're

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.090
something been thinking about but we're
 

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:32.160
something been thinking about but we're
definitely plenty on working that yeah

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.170
definitely plenty on working that yeah
 

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.720
definitely plenty on working that yeah
well the new emulators support a

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:34.730
well the new emulators support a
 

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.210
well the new emulators support a
headless mode for continuous integration

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:37.220
headless mode for continuous integration
 

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.660
headless mode for continuous integration
servers so that same point so we we are

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:40.670
servers so that same point so we we are
 

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:42.580
servers so that same point so we we are
looking at that like the remote testing

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:42.590
looking at that like the remote testing
 

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.830
looking at that like the remote testing
application for that so we're different

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:44.840
application for that so we're different
 

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:48.520
application for that so we're different
plane to do that so the logcat view in

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:48.530
plane to do that so the logcat view in
 

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.890
plane to do that so the logcat view in
Android studio kind of is not great like

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:53.900
Android studio kind of is not great like
 

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.800
Android studio kind of is not great like
it's still doesn't have the column view

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:56.810
it's still doesn't have the column view
 

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.560
it's still doesn't have the column view
that Eclipse had I'm sorting your tags

00:41:59.560 --> 00:41:59.570
that Eclipse had I'm sorting your tags
 

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.460
that Eclipse had I'm sorting your tags
and your time stamps and the filtering

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:03.470
and your time stamps and the filtering
 

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.950
and your time stamps and the filtering
doesn't seem to be as robust and half

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960
doesn't seem to be as robust and half
 

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.650
doesn't seem to be as robust and half
the time it seems like it loses the

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:08.660
the time it seems like it loses the
 

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.480
the time it seems like it loses the
connection to the device well the

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:10.490
connection to the device well the
 

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.280
connection to the device well the
connection wouldn't be logcat we know

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.290
connection wouldn't be logcat we know
 

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.950
connection wouldn't be logcat we know
that a DB has been pretty flaky

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960
that a DB has been pretty flaky
 

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.420
that a DB has been pretty flaky
particularly on some platforms and I

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:16.430
particularly on some platforms and I
 

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:17.800
particularly on some platforms and I
think the newer version of a DB is

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:17.810
think the newer version of a DB is
 

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:18.760
think the newer version of a DB is
actually better so you should definitely

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:18.770
actually better so you should definitely
 

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:20.770
actually better so you should definitely
install the preview version that's what

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:20.780
install the preview version that's what
 

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.390
install the preview version that's what
we use for the demo because instant run

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400
we use for the demo because instant run
 

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.860
we use for the demo because instant run
really wants an ADB connection to be

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:23.870
really wants an ADB connection to be
 

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.340
really wants an ADB connection to be
reliable on the obvious other point

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:27.350
reliable on the obvious other point
 

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.960
reliable on the obvious other point
there's also so we also look at this

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:28.970
there's also so we also look at this
 

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.540
there's also so we also look at this
right you place lock at what we've done

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:31.550
right you place lock at what we've done
 

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:35.440
right you place lock at what we've done
is we in 14 we made log had quite a bit

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:35.450
is we in 14 we made log had quite a bit
 

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.030
is we in 14 we made log had quite a bit
better so before that it was terrible

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040
better so before that it was terrible
 

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.230
better so before that it was terrible
now it's better although it still

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240
now it's better although it still
 

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.300
now it's better although it still
doesn't have a table sorting part of the

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:40.310
doesn't have a table sorting part of the
 

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:41.080
doesn't have a table sorting part of the
reason for that is that we're actually

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:41.090
reason for that is that we're actually
 

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.510
reason for that is that we're actually
using a console widget which gives us

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520
using a console widget which gives us
 

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.190
using a console widget which gives us
some other stuff for example we can

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200
some other stuff for example we can
 

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.570
some other stuff for example we can
collapse stack traces and things like

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:46.580
collapse stack traces and things like
 

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.070
collapse stack traces and things like
that and a much smarter way with the

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:48.080
that and a much smarter way with the
 

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.690
that and a much smarter way with the
auto expand in one in the 20 preview

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:52.700
auto expand in one in the 20 preview
 

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:55.210
auto expand in one in the 20 preview
we've done some more work so actually it

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:55.220
we've done some more work so actually it
 

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.160
we've done some more work so actually it
might've been 15 we show dead processes

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.170
might've been 15 we show dead processes
 

00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:59.020
might've been 15 we show dead processes
for example right so once your process

00:42:59.020 --> 00:42:59.030
for example right so once your process
 

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.500
for example right so once your process
dies you can still find it in the in the

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:01.510
dies you can still find it in the in the
 

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.840
dies you can still find it in the in the
process list and for 10 X what we do

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:04.850
process list and for 10 X what we do
 

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.340
process list and for 10 X what we do
cold swap the process changes was very

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:06.350
cold swap the process changes was very
 

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:07.540
cold swap the process changes was very
important for us to actually associate

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:07.550
important for us to actually associate
 

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.650
important for us to actually associate
the two together so we've done that as

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:08.660
the two together so we've done that as
 

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.230
the two together so we've done that as
well but we know that we need to improve

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240
well but we know that we need to improve
 

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.660
well but we know that we need to improve
it we have some work plan for it young

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:13.670
it we have some work plan for it young
 

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.510
it we have some work plan for it young
to rewrite the UI it just I usually use

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520
to rewrite the UI it just I usually use
 

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:19.750
to rewrite the UI it just I usually use
it from the terminology so you can have

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760
it from the terminology so you can have
 

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.030
it from the terminology so you can have
multiple tabs or you know you have

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040
multiple tabs or you know you have
 

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.190
multiple tabs or you know you have
different sorting or Android studio is

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200
different sorting or Android studio is
 

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.080
different sorting or Android studio is
kind of pretty inflexible about that

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:26.090
kind of pretty inflexible about that
 

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.590
kind of pretty inflexible about that
yeah we want to fix that

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:29.600
 
 

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:34.570
 
that's it I was wondering if you

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:34.580
that's it I was wondering if you
 

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:40.310
that's it I was wondering if you
consider the any impact of the bytecode

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:40.320
consider the any impact of the bytecode
 

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.050
consider the any impact of the bytecode
for instant run for developers who might

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060
for instant run for developers who might
 

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.470
for instant run for developers who might
be using Matt and trying to profile

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480
be using Matt and trying to profile
 

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.400

their apps considering you know so um

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:52.410
their apps considering you know so um
 

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.790
their apps considering you know so um
okay it performance tools and such right

00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800
okay it performance tools and such right
 

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.950
okay it performance tools and such right
are you asking about the overhead of the

00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960
are you asking about the overhead of the
 

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.540
are you asking about the overhead of the
in direction that more or less yeah

00:43:59.540 --> 00:43:59.550
in direction that more or less yeah
 

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.850
in direction that more or less yeah
instrumenting the bytecode has to have

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:01.860
instrumenting the bytecode has to have
 

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.100
instrumenting the bytecode has to have
some impact and yeah I definitely

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.110
some impact and yeah I definitely
 

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:06.470
some impact and yeah I definitely
wouldn't do profiling on in the instant

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480
wouldn't do profiling on in the instant
 

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.790
wouldn't do profiling on in the instant
run mode I probably turn off instant run

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800
run mode I probably turn off instant run
 

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.060
run mode I probably turn off instant run
when I'm gonna measure in our experience

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:11.070
when I'm gonna measure in our experience
 

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.160
when I'm gonna measure in our experience
it hasn't been a noticeable like I would

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:13.170
it hasn't been a noticeable like I would
 

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:17.480
it hasn't been a noticeable like I would
say but you know results may vary I

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:17.490
say but you know results may vary I
 

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.760
say but you know results may vary I
guess I mean for memory shouldn't impact

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:19.770
guess I mean for memory shouldn't impact
 

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.130
guess I mean for memory shouldn't impact
it too much anyway you know there is an

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140
it too much anyway you know there is an
 

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:25.610
it too much anyway you know there is an
instance of each of the right class only

00:44:25.610 --> 00:44:25.620
instance of each of the right class only
 

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:26.810

for the classes that you replace of

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:26.820
for the classes that you replace of
 

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.760

course but you know because you

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:28.770
course but you know because you
 

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.990

won't be any there should be no memory

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:32.130
won't be any there should be no memory
 

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.610
won't be any there should be no memory
changes right we're not educating lotto

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:34.620
changes right we're not educating lotto
 

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.800
changes right we're not educating lotto
objects we're not doing any of that so

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:36.810
objects we're not doing any of that so
 

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:38.150
objects we're not doing any of that so
for memory there shouldn't be an issue

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160
for memory there shouldn't be an issue
 

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.740
for memory there shouldn't be an issue
for performance yes you know there's

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:39.750
for performance yes you know there's
 

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:41.150
for performance yes you know there's
definitely something if you do actually

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160
definitely something if you do actually
 

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.620

method tracing you're going to see all

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:42.630
method tracing you're going to see all

those other rights you know delegation

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160
those other rights you know delegation
 

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.180
those other rights you know delegation
and all of that I guess the main cost is

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.190
and all of that I guess the main cost is
 

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:49.070
and all of that I guess the main cost is
the stuff we add that counts door to see

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:49.080
the stuff we add that counts door to see
 

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.610
the stuff we add that counts door to see
if I came at the limit right right

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:52.620
if I came at the limit right right
 

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.940
if I came at the limit right right
that's another problem I guess I was

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:55.950
that's another problem I guess I was
 

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.690
that's another problem I guess I was
wondering if the bytecode had been

00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700

instant run it's negligible I mean it's

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:16.410
instant run it's negligible I mean it's
 

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.350
instant run it's negligible I mean it's
very tired it's basically the same as

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:18.360
very tired it's basically the same as
 

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.690

those numbers was a big kiss for five

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:20.700
those numbers was a big kiss for five
 

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.790
those numbers was a big kiss for five
megabytes maybe it's really tiny but if

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800
megabytes maybe it's really tiny but if
 

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.650
megabytes maybe it's really tiny but if
you're dishing it shouldn't be

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660
you're dishing it shouldn't be
 

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.570
you're dishing it shouldn't be
proportional uh-huh it should I mean

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:26.580
proportional uh-huh it should I mean
 

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.670
proportional uh-huh it should I mean
it's basically and in fact we only touch

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680
it's basically and in fact we only touch
 

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.130
it's basically and in fact we only touch
your code not the library code which

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140
your code not the library code which
 

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.180
your code not the library code which
makes a big difference so when you're

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:32.190
makes a big difference so when you're
 

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.070
makes a big difference so when you're
using large libraries like Play services

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:34.080
using large libraries like Play services
 

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.870

going instrumenting those we only

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:37.710
going instrumenting those we only
 

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.440
going instrumenting those we only
instrument your actual app code that we

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:39.450
instrument your actual app code that we
 

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:39.740
instrument your actual app code that we
think

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:39.750
think
 

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.800

will change and so that's a pretty small

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:41.810
will change and so that's a pretty small
 

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.470
will change and so that's a pretty small
amount of code actually usually yeah you

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480
amount of code actually usually yeah you
 

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.300
amount of code actually usually yeah you
know not necessarily know we are aware

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:47.310
know not necessarily know we are aware
 

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:48.910

of some code bases that are pretty large

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920
of some code bases that are pretty large

yeah so did you want to talk about multi

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:51.450
yeah so did you want to talk about multi
 

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.360
yeah so did you want to talk about multi
dicks at all well one of the nice things

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:53.370
dicks at all well one of the nice things
 

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.460
dicks at all well one of the nice things
that as I mentioned is that we now

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:55.470
that as I mentioned is that we now
 

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.830
that as I mentioned is that we now
target it to the device you picked and a

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:57.840
target it to the device you picked and a
 

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.550
target it to the device you picked and a
lot of developers target newer devices

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:01.560
lot of developers target newer devices
 

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.530
lot of developers target newer devices
so if you're 21 and up we can use the

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540
so if you're 21 and up we can use the
 

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.720

what is goin on legacy multics what's it

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:05.730
what is goin on legacy multics what's it
 

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.280

called its nato native melted x so we

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.290
called its nato native melted x so we
 

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.840
called its nato native melted x so we
don't do that yet but we'll do that soon

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:08.850
don't do that yet but we'll do that soon
 

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.030
don't do that yet but we'll do that soon
the one issue to think about for multi

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040
the one issue to think about for multi
 

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.830
the one issue to think about for multi
texts if you're only get legacy multi

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:12.840

decks and your app is very close to the

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:15.620
decks and your app is very close to the
 

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.890
decks and your app is very close to the
65 k limit and you know adding that

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900
65 k limit and you know adding that
 

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.750
65 k limit and you know adding that
extra app server and stuff like that may

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760
extra app server and stuff like that may
 

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.760
extra app server and stuff like that may
bring you over the limit and in that

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:22.770
bring you over the limit and in that
 

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.260
bring you over the limit and in that
case you would have to figure out what

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:24.270
case you would have to figure out what
 

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.970
case you would have to figure out what
you do in your app to reduce the amount

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:25.980
you do in your app to reduce the amount
 

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.310
you do in your app to reduce the amount
of classes that you need upstart so

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:28.320
