00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.019
Sweaty palms, short breaths, feeling uncomfortable?

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:07.080
Do you have your smart phone on you?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.050
Do I?

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.160
Hey, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.450
Can’t function without your phone?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.990
Panic when you can’t find it?

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.400
New research says you’re not alone.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.430
Researchers from the University of Missouri
sought to study this stressful situation.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.529
They found that just being away from your
phone can cause anxiety and make you perform

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.990
worse on important tasks.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.899
To figure out what happens when people are
separated from their phones, the researchers

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.730
put people to task filling out a simple word
search puzzle, while hooked up to a blood

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.730
pressure cuff.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.260
The researchers told the participants the
experiment was to test new pressure cuffs,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.100
so they wouldn’t suspect it was really about
their phones.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.629
While they puzzled away, the researchers asked
them to rate how they were feeling, what their

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.989
level of anxiety was and if they had any feelings
of pleasantness or unpleasantness.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.069
After the first word search puzzle was complete,
researchers told the participants that their

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:00.850
phones were causing bluetooth interference
with the blood pressure cuff and had to be

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.890
moved to the other side of the room.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.190
Once separated from their phones, the participants
started on a second puzzle and in the middle

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.260
of figuring out the puzzle, researchers called
them.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.150
Imagine, sitting in a strange room, with a
weird thing on your arm, you can’t figure

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.820
out where the word “Alaska” is in the
puzzle, and YOUR PHONE STARTS TO RING.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
What if it’s your mom, what if Timmy fell
down a well again?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.480
You just don’t know.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.240
Not surprisingly, participants reported feeling
unpleasant and anxious, and their heart rates

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.520
and blood pressure increased.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.190
But not only did they feel worse, but they
did worse on the crossword puzzle.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.360
So what did the researchers conclude?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.200
Phone anxiety is a very real thing and can
lead to physiological anxiety and poor cognitive

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
performance.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.910
They suggest that phones have become such
a huge part of our lives that phones are now

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.300
an extension of our sense of self we feel
a loss of a part of ourselves when we are

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.300
separated.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.290
It seems this affects a lot of us.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.530
Some researchers called it NoMoPhobia, or
fear of being without your phone.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
60% of responders to a recent survey said
they can’t go more than an hour without

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.890
checking their phones and 73% said they panicked
last time they thought they lost it.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.259
So what would you rather go without than put
down your phone?

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.749
One study found that most people would give
up other comforts before their phones.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:20.400
70% would rather give up alcohol, 63% would
go without chocolate and 33% would rather

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.480
not have sex for a week than go without their
phones for a week.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.230
Another study found that 11% of americans
would rather leave home without PANTS than

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610
without their phones.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.930
What to do about it?

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.689
Please keep your pants on and put your phone
in your pocket or purse.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.540
If you need to stay focused on a task like
a meeting at work or a big test, keep your

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.719
phone on you, but turn it to vibrate or silent
mode so you won’t have any distractions.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.249
Are you as addicted to your phone as I am?
