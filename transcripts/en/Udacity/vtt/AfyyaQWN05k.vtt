The purpose of ARP is to allow a

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.170
host to discover the Mac address corresponding to a

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.520
particular IP address. And the host doesn't know

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.760
which host on the LAN owns that particular Mac

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.550
address. So, ARP allows the host to send

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.990
a broadcast query asking about who owns a particular

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250
IP address. And the response comes from the owner

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.390
of that particular IP address and the response is

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.160
the Mac address.
