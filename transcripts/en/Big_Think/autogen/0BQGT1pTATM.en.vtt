I began to realize that there was sort

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920
I began to realize that there was sort
 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.130
I began to realize that there was sort
of this insatiable demand for for

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
of this insatiable demand for for
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.530
of this insatiable demand for for
computing performance and that that

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.540
computing performance and that that
 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.900
computing performance and that that
demand would wouldn't be satisfied any

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910
demand would wouldn't be satisfied any
 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.080
demand would wouldn't be satisfied any
time in the in the near term unless we

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090
time in the in the near term unless we
 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.260
time in the in the near term unless we
could figure out a way to put tens or

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270
could figure out a way to put tens or
 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.119
could figure out a way to put tens or
hundreds or even thousands of

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129
hundreds or even thousands of
 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.840
hundreds or even thousands of
microprocessors together to work on one

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850
microprocessors together to work on one
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.650
microprocessors together to work on one
of these these very big single problems

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660
of these these very big single problems
 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.570
of these these very big single problems
so I eventually went to my management

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580
so I eventually went to my management
 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.920
so I eventually went to my management
and said you know I know you have me

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930
and said you know I know you have me
 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.319
and said you know I know you have me
looking at at other companies but I have

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
looking at at other companies but I have
 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.060
looking at at other companies but I have
this idea of starting a business that's

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070
this idea of starting a business that's
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.670
this idea of starting a business that's
sort of based on this notion of using

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680
sort of based on this notion of using
 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.299
sort of based on this notion of using
lots of micro processors somehow I

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309
lots of micro processors somehow I
 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.040
lots of micro processors somehow I
managed to convince them this was a good

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050
managed to convince them this was a good
 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.729
managed to convince them this was a good
idea something worth investing in and

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
idea something worth investing in and
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.510
idea something worth investing in and
for literally the next ten years we we

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520
for literally the next ten years we we
 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.190
for literally the next ten years we we
were on on this chase to to build the

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200
were on on this chase to to build the
 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.330
were on on this chase to to build the
world's fastest computer which we

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340
world's fastest computer which we
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.920
world's fastest computer which we
succeeded in doing bye-bye 1996

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930
 
 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.790
 
an interesting way to look at it is just

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800
an interesting way to look at it is just
 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.950
an interesting way to look at it is just
to think about the various cylinders in

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960
to think about the various cylinders in
 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.870
to think about the various cylinders in
your in the engine in your automobile I

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
your in the engine in your automobile I
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.330
your in the engine in your automobile I
mean we you know we have four cylinder

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340
mean we you know we have four cylinder
 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.130
mean we you know we have four cylinder
engines and six-cylinder engines and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140
engines and six-cylinder engines and
 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.900
engines and six-cylinder engines and
eight-cylinder engines I have an Abba

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910
eight-cylinder engines I have an Abba
 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.450
eight-cylinder engines I have an Abba
car that has a ten cylinder engine and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460
car that has a ten cylinder engine and
 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.580
car that has a ten cylinder engine and
they're even some with 12 or more

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
they're even some with 12 or more
 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.660
they're even some with 12 or more
cylinders so instead of having one giant

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670
cylinders so instead of having one giant
 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.510
cylinders so instead of having one giant
one giant cylinder that's trying to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
one giant cylinder that's trying to
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.270
one giant cylinder that's trying to
generate all the power to move the car

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280
generate all the power to move the car
 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.560
generate all the power to move the car
use use a number of smaller ones and and

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570
use use a number of smaller ones and and
 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.770
use use a number of smaller ones and and
the aggregate power is what is what

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780
the aggregate power is what is what
 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.410
the aggregate power is what is what
moves the car at you know at freeway

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420
moves the car at you know at freeway
 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.770
moves the car at you know at freeway
speeds and we're in a sense doing the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
speeds and we're in a sense doing the
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.410
speeds and we're in a sense doing the
same thing by using lots of micro

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
same thing by using lots of micro
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.380
same thing by using lots of micro
processors to generate generate high

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
processors to generate generate high
 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.110
processors to generate generate high
performance we're we're taking their

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
performance we're we're taking their
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.810
performance we're we're taking their
individual power and and harnessing it

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820
individual power and and harnessing it
 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.820
individual power and and harnessing it
in such a way that we can bring all of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830
in such a way that we can bring all of
 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.490
in such a way that we can bring all of
their energy to bear on on one single

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
their energy to bear on on one single
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.440
their energy to bear on on one single
very challenging computational problem

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
 
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 
I built my first computer or calculator

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
I built my first computer or calculator
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.229
I built my first computer or calculator
i guess more accurately when i was 12

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239
i guess more accurately when i was 12
 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.330
i guess more accurately when i was 12
and I had to I had to learn about binary

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
and I had to I had to learn about binary
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.250
and I had to I had to learn about binary
arithmetic and you know how computers

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260
arithmetic and you know how computers
 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.509
arithmetic and you know how computers
did did arithmetic and and that really

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519
did did arithmetic and and that really
 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.850
did did arithmetic and and that really
you know took me into you know to

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860
you know took me into you know to
 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.910
you know took me into you know to
learning new things about math and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920
learning new things about math and
 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.630
learning new things about math and
certainly you know electrical

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
certainly you know electrical
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.460
certainly you know electrical
engineering because it was all part of

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470
engineering because it was all part of
 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.880
engineering because it was all part of
creating that that calculator the fact

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890
creating that that calculator the fact
 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.900
creating that that calculator the fact
that I could actually build an

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910
that I could actually build an
 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.240
that I could actually build an
electronic device that could add

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
electronic device that could add
 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.789
electronic device that could add
subtract and multiply couldn't do divide

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799
subtract and multiply couldn't do divide
 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.729
subtract and multiply couldn't do divide
I wasn't quite up for divide but but do

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739
I wasn't quite up for divide but but do
 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.140
I wasn't quite up for divide but but do
three of the of the four basic

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
three of the of the four basic
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.839
three of the of the four basic
calculator functions and that that it

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849
calculator functions and that that it
 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.750
calculator functions and that that it
would do it repeatedly endlessly and

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760
would do it repeatedly endlessly and
 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.080
would do it repeatedly endlessly and
always get the right answer that I think

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090
always get the right answer that I think
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.289
always get the right answer that I think
that kind of determinism is what really

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299
that kind of determinism is what really
 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.330
that kind of determinism is what really
what really captured me

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340
 
 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.880
 
I can't remember exactly how old I was

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890
I can't remember exactly how old I was
 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.009
I can't remember exactly how old I was
probably 10 or 11 but a neighbor boy and

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019
probably 10 or 11 but a neighbor boy and
 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.100
probably 10 or 11 but a neighbor boy and
I had this idea that we should have a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110
I had this idea that we should have a
 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.869
I had this idea that we should have a
private telephone link between our

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879
private telephone link between our
 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.770
private telephone link between our
houses and so we we set out to to build

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780
houses and so we we set out to to build
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.680
houses and so we we set out to to build
the link and we got the we got the sort

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690
the link and we got the we got the sort
 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.949
the link and we got the we got the sort
of the endpoints figured out but then

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959
of the endpoints figured out but then
 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.350
of the endpoints figured out but then
came time to run the cable from my house

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360
came time to run the cable from my house
 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.110
came time to run the cable from my house
to his house which was we were you know

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
to his house which was we were you know
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.160
to his house which was we were you know
several houses apart and and we never

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170
several houses apart and and we never
 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.309
several houses apart and and we never
managed to get that that cable to work

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319
managed to get that that cable to work
 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.259
managed to get that that cable to work
the funny part is years later one of the

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269
the funny part is years later one of the
 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.539
the funny part is years later one of the
neighbors asked me to remove the cable

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549
neighbors asked me to remove the cable
 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.630
neighbors asked me to remove the cable
and because they were doing some you

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640
and because they were doing some you
 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.539
and because they were doing some you
know some landscaping and so I walked

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549
know some landscaping and so I walked
 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.069
know some landscaping and so I walked
along the fence pulling pulling the

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079
along the fence pulling pulling the
 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.160
along the fence pulling pulling the
cable out and I came to this point where

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170
cable out and I came to this point where
 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.839
cable out and I came to this point where
that cable and the other cable that was

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849
that cable and the other cable that was
 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.390
that cable and the other cable that was
coming from from my friends house were

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
coming from from my friends house were
 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.129
coming from from my friends house were
simply nodded together there was no

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
simply nodded together there was no
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.270
simply nodded together there was no
electrical connection between the two so

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280
electrical connection between the two so
 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.870
electrical connection between the two so
that was that was an ill-fated adventure

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880
that was that was an ill-fated adventure
 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.430
that was that was an ill-fated adventure
but my first attempt at inventing

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440
but my first attempt at inventing
 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.889
but my first attempt at inventing
something
