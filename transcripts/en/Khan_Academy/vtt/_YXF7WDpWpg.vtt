00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.830
Charles bought 5 apples
that cost $0.47 each.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.340
He paid with a five-dollar bill.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.930
How much change did
Charles receive?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.660
So let's think about
everything in cents

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.230
since they gave us the
cost in terms of cents.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.940
So first of all, how much
would the 5 apples cost?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.820
Well, we got 5 apples.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.810
5 apples-- let me do
that same green color.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.060
We have 5 apples, and
each of those apples

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.770
are going to cost $0.47.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.450
So 5 apples times
$0.47 per apple, this

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.130
will give us the total cost
of the 5 apples in cents.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.034
So what's 5 times 47?

00:00:44.034 --> 00:00:44.700
Well, let's see.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.866
5 times 40 is 200.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.120
5 times 7 is 35.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.180
So it's going to be 235 cents.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.290
So it's 235.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.210
And just to remind
ourselves, this is 235 cents.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.319
Now, how much did he pay?

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.520
He paid with a five-dollar bill.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.940
Well, a five-dollar bill is
going to be how many cents?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.240
Well, let's think about it.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.300
A five-dollar bill times
100 cents per dollar,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.810
he's essentially
paying with 500 cents.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.220
So this right over
here is the cost,

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.650
and then this is what he paid.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.310
So we could figure
out how much change

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.830
he needs to get back
in terms of cents.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.120
So he paid 500.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.150
The cost was 235.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.610
235, so we just
need to subtract.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.670
And you might be able
to do this in your head.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.560
But in case you can't,
we can solve this.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.400
We can do this by regrouping.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.020
We have a 0 in the ones place.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.210
We have a 0 in the tens place.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.940
But let's try to regroup
from the hundreds place.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.520
We could take one
of the hundreds,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.900
so now we have only 400 left.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.010
And a hundred is
equal to 10 tens.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.730
So we could put a 10
in the tens place.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.660
But then we could take
one of those tens away,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.260
so we only have 9 tens.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.160
And if you took a 10 away, then
you put that in the ones place,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.310
it's going to become a 10.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.630
And now we're ready to subtract.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.570
So we are left with
10 minus 5 is 5.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.630
9 minus 3 is 6.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.600
4 minus 2 is 2.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.160
So how much change
does Charles receive?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.570
Well, it would be 265 cents.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.340
If we wanted to write
this in terms of dollars,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.810
we already know that there
are 100 cents per dollar.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.630
So you could view this as
200 cents plus 65 cents.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.840
And 200 cents-- well, this is
two groups of 100 cents, or $2.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.540
So this right over here
is $2 and 65 cents.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.360
Or you could view this--
because 65 cents is really

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.420
65 hundredths of a dollar.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:10.150
You could view this as $2 and
65/100 of a dollar, or $2.65.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.750
So that's how much change
Charles should receive.
