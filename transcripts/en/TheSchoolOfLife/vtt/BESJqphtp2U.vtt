00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
For most of human history, the idea of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.220
being polite has been central to our

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.740
sense of what is required to count as a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.590
good and civilized person. But more

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.400
recently, politeness has come under suspicion.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.150
It can sound a bit fake and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.400
insincere and in its own way really rather rude.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.340
We often tend to prefer the idea of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.890
being frank and speaking our own minds.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.350
The rise in our collective suspicion of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.500
politeness has a history. Politeness used to be central

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.570
to our education. Etiquette,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.549
books and guides to manners were all

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.100
deemed essential. Yet in the late 18th

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.960
century,  the approach was thrown into

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.200
distribute. An alternative romantic idea

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
emerged, in large part driven forward by the Swiss philosopher

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.590
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who powerfully re-described

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.900
politeness as an indication of servility and deceit,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.600
and argued in favor of always remaining true to yourself.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.510
The romantic suspicion of politeness, was

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.000
given a further boost by the increasing role of the United States.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.319
being direct and open came to be seen by Americans

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.240
themselves as one of their national

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.300
virtues and attitude encapsulated in a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.950
climactic line from "Gone with the Wind".

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.200
When Rhett Butler turns the scholar to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.200
her and tells her exactly how he sees it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.290
"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn".  And

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.900
because America has been the world's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.400
most influential culture for around a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
century and a half, its attitude towards

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.990
politeness has been widely and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.880
pervasively disseminated around the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.340
planet ever since. Would ultimately

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.320
separates the polite from the Frank

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
person isn't really a knowledge of etiquette.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.150
It's not really about what knife to use

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.400
at a formal dinner, when to say please or

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.229
thank you, or how to word a wedding

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.240
invitation. It comes down to a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.340
contrasting set of beliefs about human

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.430
nature. The polite and the frank person

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.890
behave differently, chiefly because they

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.380
see the world in highly divergent ways.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.500
These are some of the key ideological

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.110
issues that separate them.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.910
Frank people believe in the importance

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.650
of expressing themselves honestly.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.170
Principally because they trust that what

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.600
they happen to think and feel will

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.949
always proved to be fundamentally

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.470
acceptable to the world. They're true

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.810
sentiments and opinions may when voiced

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.200
be bracing of course – but no worse. These

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.270
Frank types assume that what is honestly

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.000
avowed cannot really ever be vindictive,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.790
disgusting, tedious or cruel. in this

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.740
sense, the polite person sees themselves

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.450
a little in the way we typically see

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.100
small children: as blessed by an original innate goodness.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.200
Even the most etiquette-conscious among

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.940
us don't usually think that the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.310
strictures of politeness will apply to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.950
the very young. We remain interested to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.930
hear about whatever may be passing

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.970
through these diminutive creatures’ minds

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.610
and we stay unalarmed by their awkward

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.130
moments or negative statements. if they

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.800
say that the pasta is yuck

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.820
or that the taxi driver is a head like a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.400
weird goldfish, it sounds funny rather

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.280
than wounding. The Frank persons trust in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.130
their basic purity erodes the rationale

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.220
for editing or self-censorship. They can

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.140
believe that everything about them will

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.239
more or less prove fine, whatever they

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.500
happen to say or do. The Polite Person, by contrast,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.900
proceed under a fervent suspicion of themselves and their impulses.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.100
They sense that a great deal of what they feel and want really isn't

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.630
very nice. They're closely in touch with

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.300
their darkest desires and consents

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.400
they're fleeting wishes to hurt or

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.170
humiliate people. They know they're

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.120
sometimes a bit revolting and cannot

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.799
forget the extent to which they may be

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.320
offensive or frightening to others. they

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.300
therefore set out on a deliberate

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.430
strategy to protect others from what

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.260
they know is within them.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.660
It isn't lying as such. they merely

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.100
understand that being themselves is a treat

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.299
they should take enormous pains to spare

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.280
everyone else from experiencing-

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.709
especially anyone they claim to care

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.280
about. the Frank person operates with a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.290
charming unconscious assumption that

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.700
other people are at heart pretty much like them.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.510
this can make them very clubbable and

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.990
allows them to create some astonishing

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.600
intimacy's across social barriers at high speed.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.260
When they like listening to a particular

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.510
piece of music and high-volume, they'll

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.339
take it is obvious that you probably do

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.930
as well. Because they're very

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.300
enthusiastic about spicy food, or never

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.310
want to add salt to a dish, it doesn't

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.780
cross their mind to ask if you actually

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.910
like this restaurant or would favor a

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.700
salt cellar on the table. For their part,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.410
the polite person starts from the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.720
assumption that others are highly likely

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.639
to be in quite different places

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.160
internally, whatever the outward signs.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.710
their behavior is therefore tentative,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.470
weary and filled with inquiries. they

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.540
will explicitly checkup with others to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.700
take a measure of their experiences and outlook;

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.600
if they feel cold, they're very alive to the possibility

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.100
that you may be feeling perfectly warm

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.169
and so will take trouble to ask if you'd

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.500
mind if they went over and close the window.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.220
they're aware that you might be annoyed

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.410
by a joke that they find funny or that

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.970
you might very sincerely hold political

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.979
opinions quite at odds with their own.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.650
Their manners are grounded in an acute

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.229
sense of the gulf that can separate one

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.510
human being from another.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.520
The Frank person works with an

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.710
underlying sense that other people are

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.110
internally for the most part extremely

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.750
robust. Those around them are not felt to be

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.000
forever on the verge of self-doubt and

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.670
self-hatred. their egos are not assumed

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.100
to be gossamer thin and at perpetual risk

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.720
of deflating. There is therefore

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.880
understood to be no need to let out

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.250
constant small signals of reassurance

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.800
and affirmation. when you go to someone's

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.360
house the fact that the meal was tasty,

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.370
will be obvious to everyone, not least

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.570
the person who spent four and a half

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.700
hours cooking it. so there's no need to

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.470
keep stressing the point in a variety of

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.290
discrete ways. the office junior must

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.670
have a pretty clear sense that they're

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.130
making the grade without a need to stop

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.830
and spell it out. The Frank person assumes

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.710
that everyone's ego is already at least

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.620
as big and strong as it should be. the

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.690
polite person however starts from a

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.300
contrary assumption that all of us are

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.580
permanently only millimeters away from

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.160
inner collapse, despair and self-hatred.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.650
However confident we may look, we are

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.140
painfully vulnerable to a sense of being

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.200
disliked and taken for granted. all of us

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.880
are walking around without a skin.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.830
accordingly, the polite person will be

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.630
drawn to spend a lot of time noticing

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.460
and commenting positively on the most

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.740
apparently minor details.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.300
they'll say that the watercress soup was

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.250
the best they've had for years. they'll

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.470
mention that work on the Mexico deal was

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.540
really helpful too, and was noticed by the

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.760
whole compan. they'll know that everyone

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.860
we come across, has a huge capacity to

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.960
hurt us with what we foolishly and

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.720
unfairly referred to as 'small things'.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.180
There will be an associated difference in

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.700
how the Frank and polite person behaves

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.100
and service context. Frank people don't

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.960
feel any great need to express gratitude.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.990
the waiter or the person at the car

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.480
car-hire has (they feel) no special need of

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.400
kindness on top of the money they'll

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.260
already be getting from the transaction.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.780
Yet the Polite person knows that we need

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.150
to find respect and a form of love from

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.180
our work as much as we need cash. so

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.650
they'll be conscious of an additional

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.200
need to contribute smiles and a pleasant word or two.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.870
these people are doing their jobs for

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.940
the money of course, but payment never

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.100
invalidates an equally strong emotional hunger

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.980
for a sense of having been useful

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.600
noticed and appreciated by another person.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.300
the Frank person is often very kind, but

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.280
in a big way. they're interested in

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.950
enormous acts of generosity and kindness

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.100
towards major sections of humanity:

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.660
perhaps the rescue of the whole

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.940
continent of Africa or a plan to give

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.160
every child in the country an equally

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:52.800
good start in life. But a consequence of

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.800
their enthusiasm can be a certain in

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.810
patients with smaller moves and gestures.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:00.330
There's really no point, they may feel, in

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.160
spending time and money sending people

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.650
flowers, writing notes after a dinner or

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.140
remembering birthdays – when a fundamental

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.240
transformation of the human condition is

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.520
at hand. The Polite  also

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.230
passionately cares about spreading

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.150
kindness, love and goodness on a mass

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.460
scale, but they're cautious about the

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.770
chances of doing so on any realistic

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.950
time horizon. yet their belief that you

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.390
perhaps can't make things a lot better

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.250
for a huge number of people in the

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.800
coming decades&lt; makes them feel that it

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.380
is still very much a worthy goal to try

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.230
and make a modest, minor improvement in

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.510
the lives of the few humans you do have

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.820
direct contact with in the here and now.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.100
they may never be able to transform

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.100
another person's prospects entirely or

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.630
rescue the whole species from its

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.360
agonies, but they can smile and stop for 5

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.340
minutes to chat to a neighbor about the

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.320
weather. their modesty around what's

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.510
possible makes them acutely sensitive to

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.550
the worth of the little things that can

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.490
be done before today is over. the Frank

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.800
person has a high degree of confidence

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.110
as to their ability to judge relatively

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.760
quickly and for the very long-term

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.100
what's right and wrong about a given

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.650
situation. they feel they can tell who's

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.780
behaved well or badly and what the

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.340
appropriate course of action should be

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.900
around any dilemma.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.400
this is what gives them the confidence

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.680
to get angry with whatever strikes them

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.780
as stupid and to blow up bridges with

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.480
people they become vexed with. the polite

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.270
person is much more unsure. They're

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.860
conscious that what they feel strongly

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.230
about today might not be what they end

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.330
up thinking next week. they know how

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.820
easily they can get it all wrong.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.160
so they're drawn to deploy softening,

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.800
tentative language and holding

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.700
back on criticism whenever possible.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.640
they'll suggest that an idea might not

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.140
be quite right.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.480
they'll say that a project is attractive

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.400
but that it could be interesting to look

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.470
at alternatives as well, they'll consider

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.960
that an intellectual opponent may well

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.540
have a point. They aren’t just lying or

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.190
dodging tough decisions.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.290
their behavior is symptomatic of a new

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.700
asked belief that few ideas are totally without merit.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.620
no proposals are 100-percent wrong and

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.140
almost no one is entirely foolish. they

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.300
know good and bad are deviously

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.180
entangled. their politeness is a logical

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.880
careful response to the complexity that

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.850
they identify in the world. both the

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.490
Frank and the polite person of course have

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.130
important lessons to teach us, but it may

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.230
be that at this point in history,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.760
it's the distinctive wisdom of the

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.700
polite person that is actually the one

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.220
most right for rediscovery and that may

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.500
have the most effective power to take

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.660
the edge off some of the more brutal,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.310
aggressive and in the end

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.890
counterproductive consequences of the

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:51.350
reigning Frank ideology.
