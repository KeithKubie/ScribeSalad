00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.450
We've already talked about
linear demand functions that

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.980
actually have changing price
elasticity as we go down

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.970
the curve.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.940
And we've shown the extremes.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.060
We've shown things that
are perfectly inelastic

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.406
and things that are
perfectly elastic.

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:18.780
What I want to do
in this video--

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.070
and it'll be a quick little
video-- is think about can we

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.690
construct a demand curve, or at
least understand what it looks

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.650
like, that has a constant
elasticity across the curve?

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.640
And just for fun, let's make
it a constant elasticity of 1.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.847
So it has constant unit
elasticity of demand.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.680
So let's think about
how we can create that.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.805
And hopefully, it will give
us a bit more intuition

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.910
on how this elasticity
business even works.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.480
So let's draw our axes.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.730
So there you go, that is price.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.700
And that right
there is quantity.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.894
And let me put quantity.

00:00:59.894 --> 00:01:01.560
Now let's put some
numbers there that'll

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.459
just help us draw
this demand curve that

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.100
has unit elasticity at
every point, at every price,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.119
in every quantity.

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.910
So I'm just going to
put some numbers here.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.300
So let's say that that
right over there is 10.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.750
So that's $10 or
whatever we're doing.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.150
And then this is 10 units per
time period, 10 units per week,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.440
or 10 units per month,
or whatever else.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.910
Now, we want the absolute value
of the elasticity of demand

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.010
to be equal to 1 at all points.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.990
And we're going to assume
that this curve meets

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.540
the law of demand, which
means as price goes down,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.265
quantity demanded goes up.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:39.890
So let's think.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.410
This is going to be
a downward sloping,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.920
so really we're going to say
that the elasticity of demand

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700
is going to be
equal to negative 1.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.970
If we have a 1%
decrease in price,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.260
we're going to have a
1% increase in quantity,

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.730
and vice versa.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.280
So let's think about it.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.230
If we're up here, where
the price is near $10,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.600
and maybe where the
quantity is closer to $1,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.750
let's think about what
a 10% movement in price

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.150
would look like, a
10% movement down.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.930
It would be roughly
about this size.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.272
A 10% movement would
be roughly there.

00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:16.730
And I'm just trying to get the
general shape of this curve.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.605
I'm not going to go into
the deep mathematics

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:20.060
or the calculus of it.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.090
So that is a 10%
price movement down.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.670
And we also want to 10%
quantity movement up.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.010
But remember, our
quantity is only at 1.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.660
So a 10% quantity movement
up would only be 10% of 1.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.810
So if we're moving 10%
in price downwards,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.390
this is a 10%
upwards in quantity.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.480
So our curve up here would
look something like this.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.674
It would actually have
to be quite steep.

00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:49.090
Now let's think about what the
curve would look over here.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.900
Once again, we want
10% for both of them,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.380
because we want the price
elasticity of demand

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.690
to be 1 throughout the curve.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.380
So if we go over here, a
10% movement in price--

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.130
so let's say we're down here,
where price is close to 1--

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.790
a 10% movement in price
is going to be very small.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.520
So a 10% movement in price
is going to be like that.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.480
It's going to be roughly
a tenth of a movement.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.490
So that's a 10%
movement in price.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.760
But a 10% movement in
quantity demanded over here,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.116
it's going to be much larger.

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:25.740
It's going to look
something like that,

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.930
because the quantity is
approaching 10, so 10% of that

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.630
is about 1 unit just like that.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.320
So at this point
in the graph, it

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.740
would look something like this.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.510
It would flatten out a
good bit, just like that.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.640
And then when the price and
the quantity is about the same,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.550
so let's say this
point right over here,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.810
where the price and the
quantity is about the same--

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.020
so let's say that that is
2, this is 3, this is 2,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.859
this is 3 right over here--
your percent movements

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:55.900
are going to be the same.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.816
But since the price and
quantity are the same,

00:03:57.816 --> 00:04:00.380
the absolute movements are
also going to be the same.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.640
So at that point, our
curve should look something

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.140
like that.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.802
It should have a slope of 1.

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:06.260
And so if you
connect the dots, you

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.740
get the general
shape of a demand

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.360
curve that has a price
elasticity of demand

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.030
at negative 1
throughout the curve,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.959
or whose absolute value of
the price elasticity of demand

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.670
is 1.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.985
So let's just do that.

00:04:18.985 --> 00:04:20.360
So the curve would
look something

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.290
like-- I'll just
draw a dotted line;

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.990
it's easier to do-- so it'll
look something like that.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.780
It'll keep getting steeper as
we get the quantity closer to 0,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.160
and it'll keep flattening out
as the quantity grows and grows

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.270
and grows.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.180
Anyway, hopefully you
found that interesting.
