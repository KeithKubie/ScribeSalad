00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.180
Let’s be real here – you’ve got a 2,000-word
essay due in less than 24 hours and you’re
watching a YouTube video.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.840
Look at your life, look at your choices.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.620
But wait to do that until this video’s over,
because today I’m going to help you become
a literary genius.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.120
Or, at least, write a paper that doesn’t give
your teacher more ammunition for wastebasket
free throws.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:25.400
[Theme Music]

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.300
Simon Peyton Jones, a researcher for Microsoft,
once gave a talk at Cambridge University about
how to write a great research paper.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.880
In this talk, he advised the audience to start out
the paper writing process with a pre-writing phase.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.440
Only once that’s done should they go to
research.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.480
Most people do this in the opposite way.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.000
They get their idea, they go do a bunch of
research on it, and then write their paper.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.240
But I like Jones’ advice to go through a pre-writing
phase before doing any research, because
it does a couple of very important things.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.960
First, pre-writing will dredge up things you
didn’t even think you knew about the topic.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.320
This is something that professional
writers know really well;

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.100
when you spend some quality time writing in a
focused state, your brain will make connections and
serve up memories you didn’t even know you had.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.420
As a result, you’ll come up with lots of
great questions and preliminary arguments
that might just make it into your final draft.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.300
And this leads directly to the second benefit,
which is more focused research.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.360
When you go into the research process
armed with questions and arguments from
your pre-writing phase,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.890
you’ll have a much better idea of what you’re
looking for, and you’ll spend a lot less time going
down pointless rabbit holes.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.560
Now, the first thing to understand about the
pre-writing phase is that it’s not about cranking
out a polished paper on your first try.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.960
For one, you haven’t even done the research yet
– but more importantly, a paper is a big project.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.220
And with big projects, you need to just jump
in and make a mess at first.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.120
It’s like an artist creating a sculpture
out of a solid block of marble.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.200
Any good artist knows that it’s much easier to
hammer out the basic features right away instead
of trying to jump right into the detailed work.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.620
And at first, the result will be a mess, but
it’s much easier to hone a mess into something
great than to turn a solid block of marble
into a masterpiece on the first pass.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.240
So let’s get into the details.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.820
Personally, my pre-writing phase usually takes
the form of a brain dump.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.460
Now, this is not an attempt to write a coherent
paper.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.780
Instead, it’s just a chance for me to get
all of my thoughts onto a piece of paper or
into a document in my note-taking app.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.300
When I do a brain dump, I’ll open a new
document, set a pomodoro timer for 25 minutes,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.900
like we talked about in that procrastination
video, and then I just start writing.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.930
Specifically, I’m looking to pull basically everything
I know about the topic out of my brain, as well as
identify any questions I might have.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:26.380
I’ll also list out any main points that I think will be important to cover, and finally try to think of any specific external resources that might be useful to look at during the research process.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.580
Once you’ve done a brain dump, it’s time
to move onto the research process.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.020
Now, the biggest pitfall that most students
deal with here is the tendency to get stuck
in this phase forever.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.160
The author Cal Newport calls this “research
recursion syndrome” – you get stuck in a loop of
constantly looking for yet another source.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.660
In his book How to Become a Straight-A Student,
Newport lays out an algorithm of sorts for
ensuring you don’t get stuck in this loop.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.140
First, you find your sources.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.040
Now, you’ll probably find most of these at
the library or on the internet,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.160
but it’s also possible that you’ll find them in the
burial room of an ancient temple full of booby traps.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.240
Pro-tip: Most teachers agree that being impaled
by hidden floor spikes is not an acceptable
excuse for turning your paper in late.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.220
Just so you know.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.400
A safer place that you might actually want
to start with is Wikipedia.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.860
Now, some of your teachers are gonna say that
Wikipedia isn’t a good source – and they’re right.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.920
However, the citations section at the bottom
of each and every Wikipedia article is actually
a really great place to find good sources,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.800
since Wikipedia holds their articles to high standards
and requires high-quality source material – like scientific
studies published in reputable journals.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.120
Aside from Wikipedia, though, you’ll also find
lots of good sources through Google Scholar, journal
databases like EBSCO, your school library,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.540
and – one place you might not have thought
of before – the notes or bibliography section
in most popular science books.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.270
For example, Bill Bryson’s book A Short
History of Nearly Everything contains 48 pages
of citations and references to other works.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.760
Once you’ve found your sources, make
personal copies of them –

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.580
create photocopies if they’re in books
or other paper formats, or add them to a
note-taking app if they’re digital.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.720
This ensures that you’ll always have them
available to you when you’re writing without
having to go look them up again.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.680
Next, you wanna annotate the material.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.980
Skim each source, highlight the sections
that you feel are specifically relevant to the
arguments you want to make,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.720
and add any notes that might help you hammer
out the details of those arguments when you’re
actually writing the final draft.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.340
Finally, consciously ask yourself if you’re
done.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.360
Cal’s ballpark suggestion here is to have at least
two sources for each main point in your thesis, and
at least one for any tangential or non-crucial points.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.880
Of course, this is a general suggestion, so
you’ll have to make the final call.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.520
If the answer is no, repeat the process.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.030
If the answer is yes, then it’s time to
write your first real draft.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.920
And this should be an awful first draft.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.640
There’s a popular adage that’s often attributed
to Ernest Hemingway which goes, “Write drunk,
edit sober.”

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.240
Now, there are a more than a few things wrong
with this quote.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.860
First, Hemingway never said it – it’s actually
a pithy re-phrasing of a passage from a novel
called Reuben, Reuben by Peter De Vries.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.040
Secondly, Hemingway definitely didn’t write
this way – even though he was a guy who
definitely drank a lot in his spare time.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.860
However, it’s still a useful piece of advice
as long as it isn’t taken literally.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.460
What’s it’s actually getting at is the
usefulness of letting the initial act of creation
be free of scrutiny and restraint.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.010
And this is important, because one of the
most difficult problems that writers deal
with is perfectionism.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.380
To the Thought Bubble!

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.160
Let me get real with you for a second.
This video you’re watching right now?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.530
Creating this has been a dream of mine for
years.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.490
Crash Course was one of my biggest inspirations
for becoming a YouTuber in the first place,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.240
and ever since I started, one of my biggest
aspirations was to be a host on this very channel.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.700
I wanted to be a part of the project that
inspired me to start creating videos on my own.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.460
So I’ll be honest, sitting here, talking to you,
being an animated character – this is awesome.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.340
But it was also intimidating, because I felt like the
series had to be perfect, and that made it really hard
to write the scripts that you’re listening to right now.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.980
However, once I reminded myself that they
didn’t have to be perfect the first time, the
writing became much, much easier.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.600
I knew that my fantastic editor Meredith would
help me hone each script into something truly great
before I actually had to deliver it on camera.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.480
And once I acknowledged that fact, the first
drafts became so much easier to do.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.620
This same mindset will speed up the completion
of your own first draft as well.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:51.360
It’s ok if your first draft is awful, because
future you will be there to edit it and shape
it into something great.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.500
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.040
Now, one technique that I’ve found to be helpful
during this process is to write my first draft in a
different place than where I intend the final draft to go.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.340
This might be a separate document, or it might
be an entirely different app.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.180
For instance, I write the first draft of almost every
one of my blog posts and video scripts in Evernote.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.360
Later, I’ll polish them up in Google Drive.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.669
Using a separate app helps me to truly believe
that it’s ok to make a mess.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.980
Of course, that mess has to get cleaned up
eventually!

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:20.800
Now, I did say a minute ago that cleaning
it up is future you’s problem, but eventually
future you becomes now you.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.140
So let’s talk about editing.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.880
I recommend editing your paper in two separate
stages.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.740
Stage one is the content edit.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.760
Here, you’re looking at your paper as a whole
and asking yourself the most important questions:

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.600
Does each argument support the thesis?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.480
Does the paper have a good narrative flow?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.230
Is each argument properly fleshed out and
backed up with research or external sources?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.080
What can be removed or written in a clearer,
simpler way?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.220
Essentially, this stage is all about making
sure the paper communicates your message to
the reader as effectively as possible.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.160
It’s not about spelling errors.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.060
Those you should save for stage two – the
technical edit.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.100
At this point, you’re ready to go over your
paper with a fine-toothed comb to identify
any problems with the structure or syntax.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.520
Things like:
- Spelling and grammar mistakes
- Poorly structured sentences

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.060
- Formatting errors
- Sentences that just don’t sound right

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.860
I find that the most effective way to do a
technical edit is to print out the paper and
go over it by hand.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.700
It’s just easier to catch mistakes when
you’re editing the paper in its final intended
medium.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.620
Plus, by using pen and paper, you’re prevented
from making corrections on the fly.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:20.860
Doing so would require switching contexts from
editing to writing, which can be fatiguing and makes
it easier to get sloppy near the end of the paper.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.380
In addition to printing out your paper, you
should also take the time to read it out loud.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.200
This forces you to slow down and prevents
you from unconsciously skipping over any words,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.120
and it also helps you identify any sentences
that don’t sound good.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.540
Finally, remember that one set of eyes isn’t
good enough – especially when they’re your own.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.660
To make your paper truly great, you need to
let other people look over it and get their feedback.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.920
Simon Peyton Jones has some more good advice
here:

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.340
First, realize that each person can only read
your paper for the first time exactly once.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:54.580
Just like I can never experience the magic of Zelda:
Breath of the Wild for the first time ever again (single
tear), nobody can read your paper with fresh eyes twice.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.419
So be strategic with your reviewers.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.920
Let a couple people read the first draft, and
keep other people on deck for the final one.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.000
Secondly, make sure to explicitly ask for
the kind of feedback you actually want.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.120
When people aren’t given direction, they’ll
naturally gravitate to looking for spelling
and grammar errors –

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.820
which aren’t nearly as important as the big elements,
like whether your arguments even make sense.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.560
Finally, after you’ve gotten your feedback and finished
both stages of editing, print out your final draft and give
it one final read-through from start to finish.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.160
If everything makes sense and nothing sticks out
as glaringly wrong, give yourself permission to be done.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.480
In all likelihood, you’ve just crafted an
excellent paper. Congrats!

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:34.120
