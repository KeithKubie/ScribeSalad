00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.910
So now, using that idea,
let's talk about coded photography.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.760
Coded photography is really going to
get us into depths of kind to now

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.160
create different ways of
looking at the coded patterns.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.300
The aperture in this instance,
how we can control it, and

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.070
how can we embed that information to
allow the camera to be able to see

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.130
additional bits of information that will
actually allow us to capture images.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.800
Some of this should remind you of
what we did when we talked about

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.370
the light field camera.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.480
Right?
In the light field camera,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.350
we wanted to capture more information
than just the pixel information on

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.350
the sensor.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.250
We wanted to capture more
information about the light field

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880
that would allow us to
now generate new images.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.400
The question now is,
can we actually do a lot of this, and

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.190
again we touched on it a little bit when
we talked about the light field cameras,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.920
by controlling this, how we can actually
capture a novel image representation

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.150
that would allow us to do more
than a standard image would.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.760
We've looked at how to do this
with projector camera systems for

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.110
lighting control.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.480
So the coded exposure
basically kind of says,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.459
is we want to be able to control light
that enters a camera in time by using

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.720
different types of exposure controls.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.570
Coded aperture then, actually,
also impacts how much light goes in.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.580
Remember aperture is the opening,
the size, we can control this.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.889
This one we controlled the amount of
light goes in over time, this one we

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.990
controlled the amount of light goes
in by the size of the aperture.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.240
Of course, we can control
the illumination, as we know about how

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.725
to do with among other things,
with controllable projectors.

00:01:29.725 --> 00:01:34.355
We can also do a lot of control right
on the sensor itself of the camera.

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:35.245
An example of that,

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:39.505
that we've actually kind of seen also is
when we talked about the camera itself.

00:01:39.505 --> 00:01:43.265
We looked at the bare sensor, which
was actually doing coded information.

00:01:43.265 --> 00:01:47.890
Remember, the bare sensor,
basically, was coding how RGB was

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.180
captured at the sensor and then allowed
you to read it off with that code itself

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.020
helping us figuring out how to get
the right color at the pixel level.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.280
So coded photography is basically the
concept, now how can we actually learn

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.810
more about how we can code these things
it-selves and put them on the image

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.100
representation that would allow us
to showcase newer forms of images.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.590
What are these examples or
what we mean about that in a bit
