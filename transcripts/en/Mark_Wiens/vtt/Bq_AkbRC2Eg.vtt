00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.963
- Good morning.

00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:01.870
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.703
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:03.700
I'm in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.200
And one of the tastiest parts

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.480
or sections of the fish is the fish head

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.260
because you've got all
those little oozy bits.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.160
You get to dig out the
little crevices of meat.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.627
Locally, it's known as kepala ikan,

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:16.440
and it's very popular to eat in Malaysia.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.970
And so today, I'm gonna take you

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.920
on a fish head tour of Kuala Lumpur.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.753
We're gonna eat,

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:22.586
I have three places

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.600
that I wanna check out and share with you.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.350
We're gonna eat them one fish head

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.170
after the next after the next.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.770
And this is gonna be an amazing
day of food in Kuala Lumpur,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
and I'm gonna share

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:34.495
all the fish heads with you in this video.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.078
(upbeat music)

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.780
It's just 9:30 a.m. right now.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.870
They're still sort of setting up.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.550
The fish heads are ready.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.516
They're preparing the fried chicken.

00:00:52.516 --> 00:00:55.560
This place, it's, I think
it's officially known

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.090
as Annuar's Fish Head Curry,
but lots of people know them

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.580
as just the Bangsar or fish corner

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.540
because it's here at
the corner of the road,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.260
kind of in a little shopping plaza area.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.400
But the aroma, you can smell the,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
oh, by the way, this
place is also very famous

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.913
for their fried chicken.

00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:12.173
You can smell the aroma
of the fried chicken.

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:14.100
You can smell the curry leaves.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.780
Oh, man. (laughs)

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.170
Fish head for breakfast,
you cannot go wrong.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.041
Fried fish.

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:21.124
- Fried fish.

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:25.661
(mumbles) in the front side, sir.

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.370
- [Mark] Okay, in the front.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.430
- Boss, from the front.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.263
- Okay.

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.470
They want to get a photo of all of them,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.850
all the staff here at the front.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.273
Say welcome to, welcome to--

00:01:35.273 --> 00:01:36.125
- Welcome to.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:36.958
- [Mark] Annuar's.

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:37.791
- Welcome to Annuar's--

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:38.624
- [Mark] Kepala ikan.

00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:39.457
- Yeah, yeah, kepala ikan.

00:01:39.457 --> 00:01:40.290
- Backside, backside, backside.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.209
- [Mark] Okay, one,

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.839
two, three.
- One, two, three.

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:45.859
- [Group] Welcome to Annuar's kepala ikan.

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.367
- Hey, yeah, kepala ikan
(speaks in foreign language).

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:50.641
- Yes. (laughs)

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:51.788
Okay, awesome.

00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:53.161
They're all so friendly.

00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.710
- Boss, you're from what country?

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.940
- Ah, I live in Thailand.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.893
- Oh, Thai.
- Oh, Thailand.

00:01:56.893 --> 00:01:57.727
- Yes, Thailand, in Bangkok.

00:01:57.727 --> 00:01:59.640
- [Man] It's famous for 26 years.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.545
- [Mark] So it's been at
this corner for 26 years.

00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:02.679
(man mumbles)

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:03.512
Wow.
- Boss, boss.

00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:05.110
(mumbles) the curry, very nice.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.943
- [Mark] Oh, yeah.

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:08.000
- Yeah, the curry, fish
curry, very special.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.908
- [Mark] Hello.

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:09.741
(Mr. Annuar speaks in foreign language)

00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:11.100
Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.933
- Thank you very much.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:13.171
- [Mark] Are you Mr. Annuar?

00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:14.004
- Yes, Mr. Annuar.

00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:15.176
- Ah, very nice to meet you.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:17.759
(upbeat music)

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:23.585
Yeah. (chuckles)

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.620
Mr. Annuar just served
us a giant fish head.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.670
And you can see it's just,

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.150
they like literally opened minutes ago.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.900
There's already a line forming.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.610
It's self serving with the fried chicken.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.508
Oh, thank you.

00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:47.440
- Which part of the chicken you like?

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.273
You want the drumstick?

00:02:48.273 --> 00:02:49.136
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:50.253
- You want the wings?

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.113
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:52.183
- [Mr. Annuar] They're frying the wings.

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:53.016
- [Mark] Okay.

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.040
- You want a thigh?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.093
- [Mark] Sounds good.

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:56.261
- You want the breast meat?

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:57.094
- [Mark] Okay.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.061
- [Mr. Annuar] Okay (mumbles).

00:02:58.061 --> 00:02:59.228
- [Mark] Okay.

00:03:02.322 --> 00:03:03.322
- Enjoy, eh.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:09.233
- Oh, wow.

00:03:10.377 --> 00:03:11.210
(Mr. Annuar mumbles)

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.043
Oh, thank you.

00:03:12.043 --> 00:03:13.770
(Mr. Annuar mumbles)

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:14.720
Uh-huh.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.553
- [Mr. Annuar] They're
gonna make the cabbage.

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:16.990
- The cabbage, okay, great.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.823
- [Mr. Annuar] The other guy.

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:18.656
- Ah.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:22.234
(Mr. Annuar mumbles)

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:24.784
And we have the pleasure
to hang out with Mr. Dino,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.940
who is also,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.090
we just met him as we arrived.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.923
So we've got plates of rice.

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:31.570
We've got the fried chicken,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.080
and then, yeah, the main event, the dish

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.380
that we came here for,
which is the kepala ikan,

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.480
the fish head, which is
prepared Indian style.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.160
That sauce is just rich and spicious.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.760
Oh, man, I cannot wait.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.030
Okay, we gotta, we gotta set
the fried chicken aside for now

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.490
and move right in to
the massive fish head.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.610
So the reason that the fish
head is so tasty and so good

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.500
is because there's so many
different parts of the fish head

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.000
to explore and so many
different little crevices.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.980
You've got the cheek.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.660
You've got the upper head.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.450
You've got the belly-ish
section in the bottom.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.490
You've got all sorts

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.000
of little crevices and
crannies to dig out.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.833
I'm gonna start.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:12.263
Let's just begin with
that top head of the fish.

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:15.310
And despite like it being a
head, there's so much meat.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.360
You can just see that it's'
just sprouting with meat.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.210
Just set some of this top of
the head onto my rice first,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.340
onto my plate of rice.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.040
Maybe I'll go in for some
of this belly section

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.530
at the same time.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.380
Oh, yeah, there's so much meat on it.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.373
I'll add some cabbage to my plate as well.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.800
Okay, I'm going in for
that fish head first.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.010
This is the top of the
head, that chunk of fish,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.303
mix it with the rice.

00:04:52.256 --> 00:04:53.089
Mm-hmm.

00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:56.870
Oh.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.070
The flavor of that curry
sauce is smooth with spices.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.260
You taste the,

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.280
actually, you really taste
the curry leaves in there.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.043
The blend of spices is incredible.

00:05:09.174 --> 00:05:10.007
Okay.

00:05:10.007 --> 00:05:11.490
And another bite that
I can't wait to taste

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.590
is the fried chicken with
some of that curry sauce.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.270
Actually, maybe the most common thing

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.600
that everybody's eating here
because it's quick and simple

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.792
to just place the fried chicken
with the curry sauce on top.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:22.460
(chuckles) One more, one more spoon.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.291
Okay, I'm tearing into that,

00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.773
tearing into that fried chicken.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:35.800
Oh, the entire, the entire
covering of skin in one bite.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.633
Nice.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.357
- Okay.

00:05:48.357 --> 00:05:49.260
(Mark chuckles)

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.913
That is the bite.
- Oh, wow.

00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:53.560
The fried chicken is amazing.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.220
- [Man] So well spiced, wow.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.520
- You can see the big tub of chicken

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.040
which is marinated in a bunch of spices.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.230
Then it's deep fried, so it has

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.780
this like deep fried crust
all over the entire chicken.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.320
Plus it's crispy, plus
the curry sauce on top.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.770
It's seriously tasty.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.170
- [Man] Gorgeous.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.003
Oh, man.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.463
- Mmm.

00:06:15.463 --> 00:06:16.296
Oh, the head.

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:17.600
The head is one of the best things.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.060
And again, I think it is like marinated

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.643
in similar spice blend
as the fried chicken.

00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:30.080
It has that same marinade
flavor as the fried chicken,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.180
the spices in there, the
crispy like outer exterior,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.310
and then it's just like soft and tender.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.680
- [Man] Look at the size of that cheek.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.120
The cheek is huge.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.070
The entire spoon just
disappears under there.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.103
Whoa, oh my gosh.

00:06:43.103 --> 00:06:44.460
- [Mark] Look at that.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.533
Dude, that's all one cheek.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.750
Oh, and I didn't even get it all.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.583
There's still more.

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.000
It like goes all the way to the eye.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.650
That is all cheek.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.340
- [Man] Dude, that's a massive head.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.173
Look at that.

00:06:56.507 --> 00:06:57.340
Oh my gosh, yeah,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.140
the spoon just like
disappears under there.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.700
- I'm gonna definitely
take this opportunity

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.643
to rehydrate my fish cheek.

00:07:06.194 --> 00:07:07.226
A one biter.

00:07:07.226 --> 00:07:10.343
Cheers.
(man chuckles)

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.223
Oh, yeah.

00:07:15.223 --> 00:07:16.056
I got a scale.

00:07:17.916 --> 00:07:21.000
- Mmm, mmm, mm-hmm.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.370
- [Man] The tenderness is
out of control right there.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.340
- We're getting down to the
bottom of the fish head.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.900
Now starts the exploration.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.880
There's bits of skin.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.713
Here's eyeballs.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:32.040
Oh, here's the, here's the mouth.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.920
Can you see those teeth on there?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.223
Red snapper lips, upper lip.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.950
Just be careful you don't
cut yourself on the teeth.

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.193
Whoa, it's like, it's like jelly.

00:07:49.654 --> 00:07:51.970
The curry sauce itself was amazing.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.410
And then all the staff,
everyone that works here,

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.480
Mr. Annuar, they're so nice.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.870
They're so friendly.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.700
Not only is the food delicious,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.460
but I think why this restaurant,
this street food style

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.740
in Kuala Lumpur has such a loyal following

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.300
is because it's so welcoming.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.230
I mean it's like a neighborhood stall,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.765
and you just feel at home
when you're eating here.

00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:16.598
Thank you very much, Mr. Annuar.

00:08:16.598 --> 00:08:17.431
That was amazing.
- Thank you very much.

00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:18.824
I'm very happy to have you.
- Amazing.

00:08:18.824 --> 00:08:20.050
And thank you for your hospitality.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.400
So that's Mr. Annuar, and then your logo.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.233
And they were so nice.

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:26.500
They refused to accept our payment.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.440
So yeah, thank you very much

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.890
to Annuar's Fish Head
Curry, Bangsar, fish corner.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.600
Man, that was incredibly good.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.663
We are moving on now to
the next fish head curry.

00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:39.246
(upbeat music)

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.550
We're on our way to eat
the next fish head curry.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.200
You gotta get there before the lunch rush,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.280
so we're on our way.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.780
I know it gets packed,

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.030
and they can sell out
of the fish heads fast.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.320
One of the great things
about KL, Kuala Lumpur,

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.170
is that it really is a garden city.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.510
It's such a green city.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:09.380
And so we're right in the
center of Kuala Lumpur,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.710
but we're kind of on the hill.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.680
I think it's called
Tugu Park or something.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.743
But there's a cafe here that's
famous for their fish heads.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.043
Hello.

00:09:19.043 --> 00:09:19.876
- [Man] Hello.

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:20.709
- So you get to the top of the staircase

00:09:20.709 --> 00:09:21.940
and all of a sudden, it opens up.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:22.940
There's a parking lot up here,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.840
but you're just surrounded by jungle.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.270
It's so green.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.750
It's so lush.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:28.670
And then you have,

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.700
you smell the spices.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.380
There's a whole buffet counter.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.060
Again, the famous thing to eat here

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.210
is the kepala ikan, the fish head curry.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.230
And I believe that this version

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.500
is gonna be more of a Malay style.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.180
Let's get straight to another fish head.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.013
So you choose your fish head.

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:43.270
There are different prices
for different sizes.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.800
And we met,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.955
what is your name again?

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:46.788
- I'm Hozi, Hozi.

00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:47.621
- Hozi, okay.
- Yes.

00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:49.327
- And he watches our videos.

00:09:49.327 --> 00:09:50.912
- [Hozi] What size?

00:09:50.912 --> 00:09:51.790
- The biggest size, biggest size.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.152
- Biggest size.

00:09:53.152 --> 00:09:54.410
- [Mark} Yes, please.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.270
- [Hozi] Okay.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.290
- [Mark] Oh, nice.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.123
Sounds good.

00:09:57.123 --> 00:09:57.956
- [Hozi] Okay.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.968
That's fresh, very fresh.

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:02.135
- [Mark] Okay.

00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:17.020
Yeah.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.853
Wow.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.140
- [Hozi] Lady's finger and then (mumbles)

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.940
- [Mark] What is that sauce?

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.830
- This is like curry
also, and then mixed--

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:36.212
- [Woman] Soya.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:37.440
- [Hozi] Ah, yes, mixed, soya.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.350
- [Mark] Oh, okay.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.900
- [Hozi] Soya sauce, black soya sauce.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.490
- [Mark] Black soya sauce.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:42.323
- [Hozi] Sweet and sour.

00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:43.340
- [Mark} Ah.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.173
- Mango.

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:45.100
- [Mark] Green mango?

00:10:47.032 --> 00:10:48.040
- [Hozi] Green mango.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.910
- [Mark] Okay.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.960
- [Hozi] It's celery.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.083
- Wow.

00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:55.583
(chuckles) To keep it warm.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.970
This is fish head number two.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.570
This is an absolute beauty.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:03.570
And I like how they serve it.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.702
Actually, the flame went out
because we took so many photos,

00:11:05.702 --> 00:11:09.780
but they did serve it above
a flame to keep it hot

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.170
because it's so big.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.420
There's so much curry sauce.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.190
I love how they added that
extra curry sauce on top

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.880
as well as the green
mango shreds all over it.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.030
That's gonna add another twist, dimension

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.150
to this fish head curry.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.400
And he said that it's a mix
between Indian and Malay style.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.060
It's like the fusion of Malaysia

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.480
with the fish head in your pot.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.420
I'm gonna just kinda
park the, park the okra.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.530
And this is the eye.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.130
Look at the size of this.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.963
I'm gonna,

00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:42.580
I think, actually, the
easiest thing to do is, again,

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.860
go for the top of the head there

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.590
with those chunks of fish
that are just gonna flake off.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:48.560
Oh, look at that.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.500
Look at the amount of meat,
the head meat on there.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.020
And what I especially wanna
do is go in for some of that,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.740
that green mango and just kinda mix that.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.750
I'll go in for some of the
tofu, some of that green onions

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:03.230
and all those herbs, and
stick this on to my rice.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.160
Wow, you gotta really maneuver.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.723
You gotta really work your
way around this fish head.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.080
(laughs) Yeah, I got some of
those shreds of green mango.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.580
That's an awesome touch to it.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:24.603
Oh, wow.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.740
Oh, that is stunning.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.690
Oh, the green mango, that like
burst of natural sourness.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.040
Again, you can taste the curry leaves.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.780
You can taste, I believe
it's a jolt of also sourness

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.520
from tamarind, almost like a fruity taste.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.310
The fish is like firm and fresh.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.408
Wow, that sauce is unbelievable.

00:12:44.408 --> 00:12:47.893
Look at this, that meat just
blooming out of the fish.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.043
Wow.

00:12:58.962 --> 00:13:00.600
That curry sauce is good enough to drink.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.580
Okay, I'm gonna try that tofu.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.160
And you can see that tofu is just like

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.110
saturated with the curry sauce as well.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.529
You can actually squeeze this tofu

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:07.880
and curry sauce would come out.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.818
Look. (chuckles)

00:13:10.818 --> 00:13:13.630
Just juices with the
curry sauce, super good.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.687
What I love about this is that sourness

00:13:15.687 --> 00:13:18.437
that goes along with all the
spices in that fish curry.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.580
Really, really incredibly good.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.170
Okay, I'm gonna move back
in, grab some of that.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.440
Look at that, the entire cheek again.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.300
It's huge.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:31.040
Oh, and there's also eggplant
in there and the tofu.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.500
And again, you can just so easily

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.943
just drown your rice in the curry.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.830
It's just so unbelievably good.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.390
I'm just gonna take a
whole chunk, a mandible.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.340
Is that a mandible?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.260
Okay, this one is the,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.140
this one is the cheek right here.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.933
That's the cheek bit.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.870
Kinda skim your thumb through,
get all the bits of fish,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.150
the gooey bits, the gelatinous
bits, the gummy bits.

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.983
It's all good.

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:02.940
These are curry leaves.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:07.890
There's beansprouts in here.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:08.723
There's wing bean.

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:09.940
There's chilies and there's
shallots, I believe.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.420
And I think it's like a fish sauce.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.660
I'll put some of this onto my rice.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.740
I know my rice is pretty much

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.340
doused in the curry sauce already.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.283
It's all drowned up, but that's okay.

00:14:21.252 --> 00:14:23.512
Mmm, oh, that's wonderful.

00:14:23.512 --> 00:14:24.345
Oh, there's coconut in there.

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:26.270
You can really taste the shredded coconut.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.830
That is like amazingly refreshing

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.210
and just a totally different taste.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.863
And then finally, one more
dish we just had to try is the,

00:14:32.863 --> 00:14:34.440
it's a type of shell.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.620
Is it a seashell?

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.740
I believe so, right?

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.670
I think it's a seashell.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:38.790
And shat you're supposed
to do with these shells

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.890
is kinda suck, suck the top
so that the little shellfish,

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.777
the little shell just like,

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.340
just like plops out into your mouth.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:50.100
Oh, yeah, I got it in one go.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.394
Oh, that's wonderful.

00:14:51.394 --> 00:14:54.220
It's like a little squidy
textured little shell.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.640
And then you taste the
lemongrass in there.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.170
Another section of the fish
head that you don't wanna miss,

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.370
I will rehydrate it, is the eyeball.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:03.660
So we're gonna,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.430
look at the size of that eyeball.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.550
Actually, let me, I'm just gonna kinda,

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.483
whoa, look at the amount
of jelly material.

00:15:12.483 --> 00:15:13.316
Oh!

00:15:16.757 --> 00:15:17.700
Wow.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.360
That just melts in your mouth.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.880
There's so many jelly bits.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.033
And then the actual eyeball
is like a hard little,

00:15:27.713 --> 00:15:29.270
I can't even find the actual eyeball.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.270
Usually, it's like a hard little marble.

00:15:32.234 --> 00:15:36.530
Mmm, I just got like
some, the socket material.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.580
And then just to garnish,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:38.940
we've got some vegetables
here, some lettuce.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.920
There's some cucumbers.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.490
And this is a sambal, I
believe, with shrimp paste,

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.190
as well as a dark soy sauce
with chilies and shallots.

00:15:47.095 --> 00:15:47.928
Mmm.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.850
Here's another move that I saw

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.100
from the guy sitting at
the table next to us.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.281
Dude, you gotta try that.

00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:01.198
- Oh, okay.

00:16:05.198 --> 00:16:06.031
Mmm.

00:16:07.122 --> 00:16:08.648
Which one hits first?

00:16:08.648 --> 00:16:10.930
Mmm, those chilies are so nice.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.173
There's like tomatoeyness there,
and then the peppery curry,

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:19.122
and then the creaminess of that fish meat.

00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:19.955
Cool.

00:16:19.955 --> 00:16:24.200
- All that's left is the main
like head structure, bone,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.030
some, the jawline, and a
little bit of extra sauce.

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.070
But that sauce is so good,
you're gonna want to drink it.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.130
Okay, time to wash my hands.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.680
And then also, they give you
this little, this little card.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.060
We got table number,

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.383
we got table number, is that 189?

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.720
No, that's right, 189.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.370
That's about how good
your orientation will be

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:47.290
after eating that fish head. (laughs)

00:16:48.136 --> 00:16:49.680
- I can't believe it.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.650
It's like one of the 10
best meals in the past year,

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:54.483
I mean, easily.

00:16:54.483 --> 00:16:56.490
- The total price came to 144 ringgit,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.580
which is pretty expensive,
but we did get the largest,

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.370
most gigantic fish head that
they had for the entire day.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.830
You can get smaller fish heads

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:08.040
for only 45 ringgit or 55 or 65.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.550
We got the 120 ringgit fish
head, but it was so worth it.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:13.430
But definitely, a dish like that,

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.550
you should share between
a number of people.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.480
You should share it between
more than two people

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.832
like we did.
- Two. (laughs)

00:17:19.832 --> 00:17:20.665
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:17:20.665 --> 00:17:21.498
Well, Ying had a little bite,

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.110
but she was already
full from the last meal.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:25.570
But you can definitely
share that between like

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.290
four or five people and
still be very, very happy.

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:30.860
But that was so worth it.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.320
This is an amazing, an amazing restaurant.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.259
And again, I cannot emphasize
the relaxing state of mind

00:17:38.259 --> 00:17:40.850
and relaxing state of
stomach that you will be in

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.090
when you eat here because it's
so, ah, yeah, the fresh air.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:45.980
That was amazing.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.813
- Alright.

00:17:46.813 --> 00:17:47.646
- That was amazing.

00:17:47.646 --> 00:17:49.600
Alright.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.100
We're driving over to an
area of KL called Pudu,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.253
which is a very Chinese area of the city.

00:17:57.043 --> 00:17:58.072
(Ying speaks in foreign language)

00:17:58.072 --> 00:18:02.155
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:18:03.842 --> 00:18:05.998
(Ying speaks in foreign language)

00:18:05.998 --> 00:18:06.831
- Thank you.

00:18:06.831 --> 00:18:08.757
- Thank you very much.

00:18:08.757 --> 00:18:09.590
Oh, awesome.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.280
This is restaurant number three,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.090
totally different style of fish head.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.570
This is not a curry, but
this is more of a Chinese,

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.960
well, it is a completely
Chinese-themed fish head.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.210
- Together with the body, yeah, yeah.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.132
- Oh, and the body also.

00:18:21.132 --> 00:18:21.965
- Yeah.

00:18:21.965 --> 00:18:23.020
- Okay.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.853
- [Man] Mun Kee, yeah, Mun Kee.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:24.686
- [Mark] Oh, Mun Kee, okay.

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:25.519
- Yeah, Mun Kee.

00:18:25.519 --> 00:18:26.780
Sweet potato leaf or kangkong.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.673
- [Mark] Maybe kangkong.

00:18:27.673 --> 00:18:28.600
- Kangkong (mumbles).

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.433
- Awesome.

00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:30.270
- [Man] Okay, thank you, thank you.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.103
- Thank you very much.

00:18:31.103 --> 00:18:33.730
That's six different types of fish heads.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.748
There's the black bean,
the asam, the clear steam,

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:39.330
the ginger, the sambal and the Nyonya.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.050
I thought the Nyonya would
be really interesting

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.050
because that's the (mumbles).

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.790
That's the Malay-Chinese version.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.750
But then he said that that's totally out.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.130
They ran out for lunch.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.250
So we missed the lunch rush,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.530
but we ended up ordering
the clear steam fish head.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.290
That's another one of their
specialties, and that's gonna be

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.490
totally different from what
we've already eaten today,

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.589
the fish heads that we've
already eaten today so far.

00:18:59.589 --> 00:19:02.172
(upbeat music)

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.140
Fish head number three has arrived,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.020
and this is exceeding my, what
I even had imagined possible

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.190
as what is considered a fish head.

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.020
They like include, I
think they only take off

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.440
the tail, basically.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.420
This solid fish, you can
smell the ginger, the chilies.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:30.393
It's very like light and
refreshing and aromatic.

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:35.040
Yeah, it just looks like
very clean, very beautiful,

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.970
Chinese style steamed fish.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.280
Oh, it's so juicy, and you
can see, look at that flesh.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.380
Okay, you are gonna have to
be careful of bones here,

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.453
but look at that white
meat and then the juice.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.160
Onto the rice, and let me get
a little more of that juice.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:56.763
Okay, yeah.

00:19:56.763 --> 00:19:58.483
So be careful of the bones though.

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:06.344
Mmm, mmm.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:11.760
It's so, yeah, so clean and light tasting.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.410
You taste the soy sauce.

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.200
You taste the ginger.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.080
And I like how there's
a few sliced up chilies

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.913
to give it some heat.

00:20:17.913 --> 00:20:19.570
It's so juicy because it's steamed.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.920
They are definitely stretching

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.820
the definition of fish head here,

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.980
serving you the entire body
along with the fish head.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.480
And I'm totally okay with that.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.020
Oh, you know what, I
didn't even notice this,

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.540
but I think it's just the half a fish.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.790
So you get more meat on the body,

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.690
but then it's split down the middle,

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.300
so it's the half a head.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.390
Oh, that's perfect.

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.613
And then you can kinda
navigate your way around,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.480
grab some of that head meat.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.080
You can see the head has quite,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.180
that skin is very thick and like blubbery.

00:20:52.846 --> 00:20:53.679
And you know what else?

00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:57.320
You can taste the Chinese wine.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.160
- Is it plum?

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.993
I was gonna ask--

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.117
- I think the wine in there.

00:21:00.117 --> 00:21:01.040
- If you think it's plum or wine.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.627
- I think it's maybe rice wine.

00:21:02.627 --> 00:21:03.460
- Ah-huh.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.110
- You can taste that slight
like wine flavor in there

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.960
along with the soy sauce,
with the steamed ginger.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.510
But yeah, the ginger is
what really, is the key

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.470
flavor-defining ingredient
in this fish head.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.270
They have a side little bowl
of raw garlic and raw chilies,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:22.610
which I will go ahead and
sprinkle onto my plate of rice.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.070
That's gonna give it some extra kick.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.880
Oh, I'm going in for that ultimate bite.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.790
And I think I'm gonna add one more scoop

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.570
of that incredibly
delicious steaming sauce,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.193
full flavor overload.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.433
Oh, yes.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.830
That's delicious.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.343
The fish, again, is so fresh.

00:21:50.799 --> 00:21:53.920
It's, it's so lightly flavorful

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.420
and just emphasizes the
natural flavor of the dish.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.130
Okay, the next dish we got
is the steamed chicken.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.200
And this is called kampung ayam,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.210
which is like a village running chicken,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.330
steamed, with a ginger sauce on the side.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.453
Dip it into the ginger sauce.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.860
Oh, that looks incredible.

00:22:16.295 --> 00:22:18.203
Mmm, oh yeah.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.467
That is incredibly good.

00:22:20.467 --> 00:22:21.910
Oh, the chicken has the perfect texture,

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.370
that running texture,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.160
slightly chewy but full of flavor.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.030
And you can taste the sesame oil in there

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.670
and that ginger sauce.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.360
The ginger is just like
completely crushed.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.533
The oils have come out.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.800
Mmm.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.663
Oh, the chicken is incredible.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.180
But I'm always a huge
fan of steamed chicken

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.743
with the ginger sauce.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:48.140
Yeah, it's a great, great
like, just a great dish.

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.850
Finally, that kangkong, which
is the water morning glory,

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:52.960
stir fried with sambal.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.063
And I think there's some
shrimp paste in here too.

00:22:58.014 --> 00:22:59.450
Mmm, mmm.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.140
Always one of the best dishes to order,

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.053
vegetable dishes when you
come to the Malay peninsula.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.640
You taste the shrimpiness of it,

00:23:14.072 --> 00:23:17.440
and you can really taste the
smokiness of the wok on that,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.580
in that vegetable as well.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.080
There's always a massive chunk of meat

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.270
right on the top of
the head section there.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.500
Look at that.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.043
Rehydrate it a little bit.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.553
This is a move I just cannot resist doing,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.533
the rehydration move.

00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:38.185
Yes. (chuckles)

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:43.010
I have to admit, when he
set down the fish head

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.210
in front of us, the steamed fish head,

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.530
I was a little bit like
wow, that's pretty big.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.200
That's a lot of meat on there.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.970
But somehow, it just
kinda disappeared on us.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:54.930
That was so easy.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:55.990
It went down so easily.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.960
It was so like just refreshing,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.730
even though it being our
third fish head in a row.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.950
It just went down, and that
was incredibly delicious.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:05.480
Again, as you can see,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.760
just a completely different
style of a fish head.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.593
This was not a curry.

00:24:09.593 --> 00:24:11.700
This is a steamed fish
head, Chinese style.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.340
And again, I just cannot emphasize

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.630
what a joy it is to eat in Malaysia

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.910
because of the diversity of
flavors, cultures and cuisines

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.033
that make up Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.260
This has been a joyous day

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.090
of eating fish heads in Kuala Lumpur.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.520
This was not a comparison video.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.680
I had no intention to tell you

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.140
which one is the best because
they're all so different

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.740
and they're all so incredibly good.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.460
But my aim of this video
is to just give you a tour

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.370
and to check out some of these,

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.430
some of the best fish
heads that you will find

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.810
in Kuala Lumpur and just
share them with you.

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:50.870
So I will have all of the information

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.990
in the description box
below so you can check out.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.470
You can eat at all three places
in a row if you would like

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.550
or spread them out between days.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:03.550
Fish heads are truly one of the
tastiest sections of a fish.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.490
And that was a wonderful
day in Kuala Lumpur.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:08.350
So I wanna say a huge thank
you for watching this video.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.450

thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
