00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.370
Now that we know
what an angle is,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.260
let's think about how
we can measure them.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.810
And we already hinted
at one way to think

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.550
about the measure of angle in
the last video where we said,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.500
look, this angle XYZ seems
more open than angle BAC.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.920
So maybe the
measure of angle XYZ

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.440
should be larger than
the angle of the BAC,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.340
and that is exactly
the way we think

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.642
about the measures of angles.

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:25.100
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.790
is come up with an exact
way to measure an angle.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.890
So what I've drawn over here is
a little bit of a half-circle,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.650
and it looks very
similar to a tool

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.620
that you can buy at your
local school supplies store

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.882
to measure angles.

00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:40.465
So this is actually a little bit
of a drawing of a protractor.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.650
And what we do in something
like a protractor--

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.030
you could even construct
one with a piece of paper--

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.120
is we've taken a
half-circle right here,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.880
and we've divided it
into a 180 sections,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.390
and each of these marks
marks 10 of those sections.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.710
And what you do
for any given angle

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830
is you put one of the
sides of the angle.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.600
So each of the rays
of an angle are

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.160
considered one of its sides.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.520
So you put the
vertex of the angle

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.102
at the center of
this half-circle--

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:14.060
or if you're dealing with
an actual protractor,

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.110
at the center of
that protractor--

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.820
and then you put one
side along the 0 mark.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.546
So I'm going redraw this
angle right over here

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:27.920
at the center of
this protractor.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.480
So if we said this is Y, then
the Z goes right over here.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.500
And then the other ray, ray
YX in this circumstance,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.830
will go roughly
in that direction.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.150
And so it is pointing on the
protractor to the-- let's see.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.160
This looks like this
is the 70th of section.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.410
This is the 80th section.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.640
So maybe this is, I would
guess, the 77th section.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.550
So this is pointing
to 77 right over here.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.070
Assuming that I drew it the
right way right over here,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.380
we could say the measure of
angle XYZ-- sometimes they'll

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.900
just say angle XYZ is equal
to, but this is a little bit

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.586
more formal-- the measure
of angle XYZ is equal to 77.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370
Each of these little sections,
we call them "degrees."

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.010
So it's equal to
77-- sometimes it's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.890
written like that, the same
way you would write "degrees"

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.125
for the temperature outside.

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.750
So you could write "77 degrees"
like that or you could actually

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.427
write out the word
right over there.

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:37.010
So each of these
sections are degrees,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.260
so we're measuring in degrees.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.290
And I want to be clear,
degrees aren't the only way

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.070
to measure angles.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.290
Really, anything that
measures the openness.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.212
So when you go
into trigonometry,

00:02:46.212 --> 00:02:47.920
you'll learn that you
can measure angles,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.790
not only in degrees,
but also using

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.000
something called "radians."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.190
But I'll leave that
to another day.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.640
So let's measure this
other angle, angle BAC.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.150
So once again, I'll
put A at the center,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.460
and then AC I'll put along the 0
degree edge of this half-circle

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.920
or of this protractor.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.181
And then I'll point
AB in the-- well,

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:13.430
assuming that I'm drawing
it exactly the way that it's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.860
over there.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.443
Normally, instead
of moving the angle,

00:03:15.443 --> 00:03:17.740
you could actually move the
protractor to the angle.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.460
So it looks something
like that, and you

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.230
could see that it's pointing to
right about the 30 degree mark.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.480
So we could say that
the measure of angle BAC

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.700
is equal to 30 degrees.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.200
And so you can look
just straight up

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.230
from evaluating these
numbers that 77 degrees is

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.020
clearly larger than 30
degrees, and so it is a larger

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.080
angle, which makes sense
because it is a more open angle.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.780
And in general, there's a
couple of interesting angles

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.720
to think about.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.640
If you have a 0 degree
angle, you actually

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.300
have something that's
just a closed angled.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.890
It really is just a
ray at that point.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.310
As you get larger and larger or
as you get more and more open,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.880
you eventually get to a
point where one of the rays

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.300
is completely
straight up and down

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.980
while the other one
is left to right.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.570
So you could imagine
an angle that

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.670
looks like this where one ray
goes straight up down like that

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.860
and the other ray goes
straight right and left.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.050
Or you could imagine
something like an angle that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.480
looks like this where, at least,
the way you're looking at it,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.900
one doesn't look
straight up down

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.670
or one does it look
straight right left.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.520
But if you rotate it, it would
look just like this thing

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.440
right over here where one is
going straight up and down

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.700
and one is going
straight right and left.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.080
And you can see from our
measure right over here

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.330
that that gives us
a 90 degree angle.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.110
It's a very interesting angle.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.410
It shows up many, many times
in geometry and trigonometry,

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.370
and there's a special word
for a 90 degree angle.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.440
It is called a "right angle."

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.350
So this right over
here, assuming

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.490
if you rotate it around,
would look just like this.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.200
We would call this
a "right angle."

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.180
And there is a notation to
show that it's a right angle.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.090
You draw a little part of
a box right over there,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.370
and that tells us that this
is, if you were to rotate it,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.160
exactly up and down while
this is going exactly

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.940
right and left, if
you were to rotate it

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.240
properly, or vice versa.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.750
And then, as you
go even wider, you

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.960
get wider and wider
and wider and wider

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.120
until you get all the way to
an angle that looks like this.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.690
So you could imagine
an angle where

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.300
the two rays in that
angle form a line.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.900
So let's say this is
point X. This is point Y,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.410
and this is point Z. You
could call this angle ZXY,

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.050
but it's really
so open that it's

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.970
formed an actual line here.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.310
Z, X, and Y are collinear.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:04.560
This is a 180 degree angle where
we see the measure of angle ZXY

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.140
is 180 degrees.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.730
And you can actually
go beyond that.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.660
So if you were to go all
the way around the circle

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.617
so that you would get back
to 360 degrees and then

00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:16.700
you could keep going around
and around and around,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.120
and you'll start to
see a lot more of that

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.370
when you enter a
trigonometry class.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.010
Now, there's two
last things that I

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.226
want to introduce in this video.

00:06:28.226 --> 00:06:29.600
There are special
words, and I'll

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.580
talk about more types of
angles in the next video.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.410
But if an angle is
less than 90 degrees,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.830
so, for example, both of
these angles that we started

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.460
our discussion with are
less than 90 degrees,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.250
we call them "acute angles."

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.090
So this is acute.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.230
So that is an acute
angle, and that

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.210
is an acute angle
right over here.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.330
They are less than 90 degrees.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.822
What does a non-acute
angle look like?

00:06:59.822 --> 00:07:01.780
And there's a word for
it other than non-acute.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.530
Well, it would be
more than 90 degrees.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.200
So, for example-- let
me do this in a color

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.839
I haven't used-- an angle
that looks like this,

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:11.880
and let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.430
An angle it looks like this.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.960
So that's one side of the
angle or one of the rays

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.220
and then I'll put the other
one on the baseline right

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.720
over here.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.150
Clearly, this is
larger than 90 degrees.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.990
If I were to
approximate, let's see,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.640
that's 100, 110,
120, almost 130.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.520
So let's call that maybe
a 128-degree angle.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.641
We call this an "obtuse angle."

00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:40.140
The way I remember it as acute,
it's kind of "a cute" angle.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.230
It's nice and small.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.760
I believe acute in either Latin
or Greek or maybe both means

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.600
something like "pin" or "sharp."

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.800
So that's one way
to think about it.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.050
An acute angle
seems much sharper.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.400
Obtuse, I kind of
imagine something

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.590
that's kind of
lumbering and large.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:00.200
Or you could think
it's not acute.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.991
It's not nice and
small and pointy.

00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:03.490
So that's one way
to think about it,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.530
but this is just
general terminology

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.340
for different types of angles.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.080
Less than 90 degrees,
you have an acute angle.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.120
At 90 degrees, you
have a right angle.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.180
Larger than 90 degrees,
you have an obtuse angle.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.510
And then, if you get all
the way to 180 degrees,

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.468
your angle actually
forms a line.
