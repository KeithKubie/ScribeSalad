00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
- [Voiceover] We've seen
in several videos so far

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:06.751
that most of the waves that
humans have encountered

00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:09.886
in nature--waves in
the water, sound waves,

00:00:09.886 --> 00:00:12.286
or just waves traveling along a rope--

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:15.781
they were disturbances
traveling through a medium.

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:19.566
And so when light displays
or has wave-like properties

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:21.239
a very natural assumption

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.989
was, well, light must
also be a disturbance

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.184
traveling through some type of a medium

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:29.314
even if that medium
wasn't so easy to detect.

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:32.194
But they conjectured that
there is some type of medium

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:34.090
that light is disturbance
traveling through.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.163
They called it the luminiferous ether.

00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:38.800
And much of physics in the 19th century

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.821
was all around proving that
the luminiferous ether existed

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:47.745
and also figuring out what
our relative velocity was

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:50.851
in regards to that luminiferous ether.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:52.218
And why do we feel confident,

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.751
or why did they feel confident,

00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.827
that there was a relative velocity?

00:00:56.827 --> 00:00:58.917
Well, we talked about
that in the last video.

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.131
The earth is spinning and
then it's spinning around,

00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.288
it's orbiting around,
the sun at a nice clip

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:06.289
and then the whole
solar system is orbiting

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.391
around the center of the
galaxy at a nice clip.

00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.527
The galaxy itself might be moving,

00:01:10.527 --> 00:01:12.791
so if you have some
absolute frame of reference

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:14.753
that's defined by the ether,

00:01:14.753 --> 00:01:18.667
well we are going to be
moving relative to it.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.815
And if we're moving relative to it

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:22.752
well maybe you just
measure the speed of light

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:26.501
in different directions and
see whether the speed of light

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.257
is faster or slower in a certain direction

00:01:28.257 --> 00:01:30.105
and then that might help you identify--

00:01:30.105 --> 00:01:32.692
well, one, validate
that the ether exists--

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:35.791
but also think about what our velocity is

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.125
relative to the ether,

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:41.211
relative to that absolute
frame of reference.

00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:43.027
But the problem in the 19th century

00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:44.852
is that we didn't have any precise way

00:01:44.852 --> 00:01:48.985
of actually measuring--or
a precise enough way

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:51.586
of measuring--the speed of
light where we could detect

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:54.419
the relative difference
due to the light going

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:58.567
for or against, or into or away from,

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:01.983
the actual direction of the ether wind.

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:04.792
And so the experiment
that is usually cited

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.987
with first kind of breaking things open,

00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:10.679
starting to really make
a dent in this whole idea

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.679
of a luminiferous ether, is the
Michelson-Morley Experiment.

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:17.901
Michelson-Morley Experiment.

00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.489
They recognized, okay, we can't
measure the speed of light

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.217
with enough precision to detect
has it gotten slowed down

00:02:23.217 --> 00:02:26.724
by the ether wind or sped
up by the ether wind,

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:27.951
but what we could do,

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.953
and this is what Michelson
and Morley did do,

00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:33.088
and I'm gonna do an
oversimplification of the experiment,

00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:35.598
is that, okay, you have a light source,

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:38.490
you have a light source right over here.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.241
So, you have a light source.

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:45.352
And so that's going to send
light in this direction.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:47.688
It's going to send light just like that.

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.590
And what you do is you
have a half-silvered mirror

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.831
that allows half the light
to pass directly through it

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:56.811
and half of it to be reflected.

00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:59.984
So let's put a half-silvered
mirror right over here.

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:04.417
So, there's a half-silvered mirror.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:08.159
And so half of this light
will bounce off like this,

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.361
and this is just a simplification of it.

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.886
Let me do it a little neater than that.

00:03:12.886 --> 00:03:16.184
So half will bounce off like that.

00:03:16.184 --> 00:03:19.388
And then the other half will
be able to go through it.

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:20.781
Will be able to go through it.

00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:22.887
It's a half-silvered mirror.

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:25.889
And then we make each
of those light rays--

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.048
we've essentially taken
our original light ray

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:29.627
and split it into two--

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:34.297
well then we'll then
bounce those off mirrors.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.848
Bounce those off mirrors
that are equidistant.

00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:37.893
And there are some adjustments

00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.089
when you actually have
to factor in everything,

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.617
but just as a simple notion,

00:03:40.617 --> 00:03:43.259
these things are just
now going to bounce back.

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:46.693
So, this one is now going to bounce back.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:49.154
It's half-silvered, it can go through,

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:51.511
or part of it can go through, that mirror.

00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:52.823
So that's that ray.

00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:55.261
And then this one is going to bounce back.

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:56.492
This one's going to go bounce back.

00:03:56.492 --> 00:04:00.509
And part of it is going to
bounce into this direction.

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.927
And then you can detect what you see.

00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:05.450
You can detect what you see.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.949
So this right over here is a detector.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:09.820
And you might be saying

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.224
okay, Sal, well what's the big deal?

00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:13.384
You've taken a light
source, you've bounced,

00:04:13.384 --> 00:04:16.054
you've split the light rays,
you've put them back together,

00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:17.923
you've bounced them around a little bit.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:21.994
But think about if there
was a luminiferous ether

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:25.693
these light waves that are
going in orthogonal directions

00:04:25.693 --> 00:04:27.698
will be going at different velocities.

00:04:27.698 --> 00:04:29.918
Let's say if that luminiferous ether,

00:04:29.918 --> 00:04:34.337
if that luminiferous ether
wind was doing something

00:04:34.337 --> 00:04:36.551
like, let me see, if the ether wind

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:39.511
were in this direction,

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.588
if the ether wind were in that direction,

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.525
when the light wave is going that way

00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:48.184
it should be going faster,
and when the light wave

00:04:48.184 --> 00:04:53.184
is coming back it should be going slower.

00:04:53.277 --> 00:04:55.350
And so what Michelson and
Morley did is they said

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.319
okay, let's assume...

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.074
let's adjust our
apparatus right over here,

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:04.925
so when then these two
lights rays bounce off

00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:07.653
and come back together,
if there were no ether

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:10.432
you would have some basic
interference pattern.

00:05:10.432 --> 00:05:12.420
So, what do I mean by
interference pattern?

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.356
Well let's say that
you have maybe this one

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.377
bouncing from up here.

00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:19.084
Let me do that in a different color.

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.297
So the one bouncing from up here,

00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:26.237
the one bouncing from up here,

00:05:26.237 --> 00:05:29.396
let's say that looks like this.

00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:31.356
I'll just draw it as a longitudinal wave,

00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:32.981
just like this.

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:35.257
Best I had in hand-drawn
longitudinal wave.

00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:39.348
And then the one coming
from the other direction,

00:05:39.348 --> 00:05:43.284
the one that bounces here,
and then comes back like this,

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:47.727
is another longitudinal wave, like this.

00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:50.490
And when they overlap they
are going to interfere

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.034
with each other, either
constructively interfere

00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:54.821
or destructively interfere.

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:58.851
So you could have something like this.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:02.090
So let me copy and then let me paste it.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.818
So depending on how far or how fast

00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:06.466
each of these traveled,
you're going to have

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.488
different levels of interference.

00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:10.056
And you would have a difference,

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:11.391
depending on the orientation,

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.957
depending on what the
actual ether wind is doing.

00:06:13.957 --> 00:06:16.685
But what Michelson and Morley observed

00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:19.378
is that no matter how they
oriented this apparatus,

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.190
and they did it at
different times of the year,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.094
and they rotated it
around, and they rotated it

00:06:23.094 --> 00:06:26.177
in the vertical direction
and the horizontal direction,

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:27.564
no matter what they did

00:06:27.564 --> 00:06:30.408
they always got the same
interference pattern.

00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:32.486
The interference pattern did not change.

00:06:32.486 --> 00:06:34.928
And because the interference
pattern did not change

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:37.757
it implied that well, maybe this ether

00:06:37.757 --> 00:06:40.585
isn't really having an
effect on slowing down

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:43.141
or speeding up the light waves.

00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:45.984
So this is often called
one of the most famous

00:06:45.984 --> 00:06:48.317
failed experiments in physics.

00:06:48.317 --> 00:06:50.367
So let me write this down.

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.356
What's powerful about it is
that it was a failed experiment.

00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:55.457
Let me get my pen tool out.

00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:59.219
It was a failed, failed experiment

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:00.878
but it made people start to question

00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:03.653
well, maybe there isn't an ether,

00:07:03.653 --> 00:07:06.954
a luminiferous ether, maybe
light just somehow travels

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:08.421
through the vacuum.

00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.790
Maybe there is not this
absolute frame of reference

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.152
that's defined by the luminiferous ether.

00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:17.653
And I wanna be clear, it wasn't
this experiment by itself.

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:19.054
This experiment was one of many

00:07:19.054 --> 00:07:20.517
that started to put that doubt.

00:07:20.517 --> 00:07:22.084
But even after this experiment

00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:24.748
and they saw that there was no change

00:07:24.748 --> 00:07:26.156
in the interference pattern no matter how

00:07:26.156 --> 00:07:27.955
they oriented this thing,
whether is was going

00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:32.124
in the direction of the
hypothetical luminiferous ether

00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:33.368
or away from it, whatever,

00:07:33.368 --> 00:07:34.984
when they say no matter
how they oriented it

00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:36.528
they got the same interference patterns,

00:07:36.528 --> 00:07:38.293
people tried to come up
with other explanations

00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:41.915
that still might have been
okay with a Luminiferous Ether.

00:07:41.915 --> 00:07:43.552
Maybe the length got contracted

00:07:43.552 --> 00:07:45.216
in the direction of the motion.

00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:47.213
Maybe other things got affected.

00:07:47.213 --> 00:07:49.919
But this is a super important
experiment in physics

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:53.396
because, once again, it started to show

00:07:53.396 --> 00:07:56.883
that hey, maybe there is
no luminiferous ether,

00:07:56.883 --> 00:07:58.892
that light is just gonna
go through that vacuum

00:07:58.892 --> 00:08:01.295
and, as we'll see, is
going to be traveling

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:04.360
at the same velocity no matter what

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.821
frame of reference you look at it from.

00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.892
But we'll explore that
more in future videos.
