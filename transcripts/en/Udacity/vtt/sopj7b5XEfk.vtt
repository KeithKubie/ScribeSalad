00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.310
So the answer, is we only should crawl the

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.990
page if we have not crawled it already. And

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.270
the crawled variable keeps track of the page that

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.020
we've crawled already. So what we want to do is test

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.440
whether the page is not in crawled. If page

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.230
is not in crawled, then we should crawl it. If

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.170
it isn't crawled, well, we just keep going. We're

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.587
going to do nothing else. For this iteration through the while

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:27.514
loop, we're going to keep going through the while

00:00:27.514 --> 00:00:29.200
loop and check the next page. We're not

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.750
done right away, if this one was already crawled, but we don't want to crawl it.
