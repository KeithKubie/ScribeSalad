00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:02.547
- [Voiceover] A student
learns that ionic compounds

00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:04.730
have significant covalent character

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.304
when a cation has a polarizing
effect on a large anion.

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:10.217
So what are they talking about?

00:00:10.217 --> 00:00:12.214
So if I have a cation,

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:14.861
so this is my cation,

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:17.903
and then this is my large anion,

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:19.923
my large anion right over here.

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:21.293
And actually, let me do it this way,

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:23.453
let me make it a little
bit clearer 'cause a cation

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:27.493
still has electrons, so
you have your nucleus here,

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:31.429
of your cation, you have
your electron cloud,

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.429
you have your electron cloud
of your cation right over here,

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:40.239
but you have fewer electrons
than you have protons,

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.723
so you're going to have a positive charge.

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:45.904
And that's why we call it a cation.

00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:50.904
And the anion, it still
has a positive nucleus,

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:52.329
and it has an electron cloud.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.329
I'm drawing a large anion here, a large,

00:00:58.124 --> 00:01:02.381
a large, a large anion right over here.

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:05.291
That's an electron cloud,
but it has more electrons

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.311
in the cloud than it has
protons in the nucleus,

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.273
so it has a negative charge.

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:11.003
That is the anion.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.857
Now what they're saying is you start

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:14.761
to have significant covalent character,

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.235
remember covelent bonds or electrons

00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.542
are essentially shared between two atoms

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:21.804
when a cation has a polarizing
effect on a large anion.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:26.111
So one way to think
about is these electrons

00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:28.561
that are out here, well
they're gonna want to get away

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:30.407
from all their negative friends here.

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:31.823
Negative charges repel each other

00:01:31.823 --> 00:01:33.224
and they might want to spend more time

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:35.558
closer to this cation.

00:01:35.558 --> 00:01:37.137
And so their gonna start
having covalent character,

00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:39.215
they're gonna be more and more shared

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.839
between the two, and
there really is a spectrum

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:45.775
between ionic bonds and covalent bonds.

00:01:45.775 --> 00:01:47.795
And over here, you might
have a polarizing effect.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.699
These things spend more
time on the left hand side,

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.727
the way I've drawn it, than
on the right hand side.

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:53.515
So you're gonna have more of the electrons

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.034
and more of the negative
charge hanging out over here

00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:58.449
than on the right, that's
what they're talking about.

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:01.092
And as a result, the student hypothesizes

00:02:01.092 --> 00:02:05.707
that salts composed of small
cations and large anions

00:02:05.707 --> 00:02:09.006
should have relatively low melting points.

00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.021
Alright, so it should be
easy to take less energy

00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:13.432
to break them out of their,

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:14.861
kind of the salt lattice structure

00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:16.544
when they're in solid form.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.495
Select two compounds from the table,

00:02:18.495 --> 00:02:20.225
and explain how the data supports

00:02:20.225 --> 00:02:22.140
the student's hypothesis.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.719
Let's see, these are all salts here,

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:27.729
and if these were to disassociate,

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.828
or if you think about
what the cations would be,

00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:35.828
the cations, the cations that make up,

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:40.000
that make up these compounds,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.298
you have lithium, lithium,

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:48.298
you have sodium, and you have potassium.

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:51.517
And then the anions,

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:54.722
the anions that make up these compounds,

00:02:54.722 --> 00:02:59.722
you have iodide, you have
iodide and you have fluoride.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:04.156
Let me write it this way,

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:07.500
flouride and iodide.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.437
So which of these are small
and which of these are big?

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:15.093
Well, let's compare lithium,
sodium, and potassium.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:17.752
And we see lithium, sodium, and potassium,

00:03:17.752 --> 00:03:19.934
they're all group one elements.

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:21.560
And in general, as we go down a group,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.371
as we go down a column
in the periodic table,

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:27.132
we're adding shells,
and so size increases.

00:03:27.132 --> 00:03:30.395
So size increases as we go down like this.

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:35.395
Size, size increases.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.726
And so of these, lithium is
the smallest and potassium

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:42.396
is the largest of these three.

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:44.729
So lithium, let me write that down,

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:49.176
lithium is the smallest, smallest,

00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:52.752
and potassium is the largest of these,

00:03:52.752 --> 00:03:54.075
of these three.

00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:56.130
Now if you look at the anions,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.637
well you have once again,
fluorine and iodine

00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:02.330
are in the same, are in the same group,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.430
and iodine is below it,
it has way more electrons

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.055
and you've added way more shells here

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:08.677
is actually the important part.

00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:11.068
And so you can see that since iodine

00:04:11.068 --> 00:04:12.856
is larger than fluorine,

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:16.548
well iodide, which is when
they gain an electron,

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.393
it's gonna be larger than fluoride.

00:04:19.393 --> 00:04:24.393
So iodide, this one is larger,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.588
and the fluorine is smaller.

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:33.588
So let's see, lithium-iodide
is a case of small cation,

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:39.776
small cation and large, and large anion.

00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:43.216
And so that's actually the direction,

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:46.177
that's kind of the best example of small,

00:04:46.177 --> 00:04:48.069
of what the student is talking about,

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.914
small cation and large anion.

00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:55.914
Lithium iodide, lithium iodide
is a great example of that.

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.737
And as we can see, it has
the lowest melting point

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:01.456
of everyone on the table.

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:02.733
Now let's take the other extreme.

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.274
What happens if we take a large cation

00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:09.478
and a small anion.

00:05:09.478 --> 00:05:13.948
Well, let's see, they don't
have that combination here,

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:17.036
but let's see, if let's see, sodium,

00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:22.036
well sodium fluoride is interesting

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.490
because we have a larger,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.974
we have a larger cation,

00:05:26.974 --> 00:05:30.214
so this is a larger cation,

00:05:30.214 --> 00:05:33.070
and then we have a smaller anion,

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.949
smaller anion.

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.663
And notice, that has the highest,

00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:41.115
that has the highest melting point.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:43.495
And so these are two
that are good to compare.

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.270
So part a, we'll do that in blue,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.270
compare lithium iodide, which
has small, small cation,

00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:08.418
plus large anion, to sodium fluoride

00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:18.751
which has larger cation
plus smaller anion,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.770
smaller, smaller anion.

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:33.972
And we see, and we see,

00:06:34.753 --> 00:06:39.753
that their melting point's,
their melting point's,

00:06:40.396 --> 00:06:45.396
melting point's consistent
with hypothesis,

00:06:46.317 --> 00:06:51.317
consistent with hypothesis.

00:06:55.257 --> 00:07:00.257
The small cation, or lithium iodide,

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:05.922
I'll just write melting point,

00:07:05.922 --> 00:07:10.922
melting point lower,

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:14.409
lower, and actually much lower

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:19.409
than sodium fluoride's melting point.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:23.987
So at least if you compare those two

00:07:23.987 --> 00:07:26.008
and those seem to be good extremes,

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:27.228
if we took the lowest melting point,

00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:29.480
which completely typified
what the student was saying

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.966
as having a low melting point,

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:32.611
as we looked at the highest melting point

00:07:32.611 --> 00:07:35.873
which had a larger cation
and a smaller anion.

00:07:35.873 --> 00:07:36.989
And so just looking at that,

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:40.481
it seems to be consistent
with the student's hypothesis.

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.385
Alright, part B.

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.382
Identify a compound from the table

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:49.382
that can be dissolved in water
to produce a basic solution.

00:07:49.444 --> 00:07:53.020
Write the net ionic
equation for the reaction

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.677
that occurs to cause the
solution to be basic.

00:07:56.677 --> 00:07:59.103
Alright, so let's think
about how we can form

00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:00.543
a basic solution.

00:08:00.543 --> 00:08:02.447
So essentially, we would need to

00:08:02.447 --> 00:08:06.046
nab some hydrogens from
the water molecules

00:08:06.046 --> 00:08:08.983
in order to have some
hydroxide laying around.

00:08:08.983 --> 00:08:10.945
And so there's a couple of candidates here

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:12.083
that could do that.

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:15.427
You have all of these halides,

00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:17.958
you have the iodide,
you have the fluoride,

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.721
and the important thing to recognize

00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:24.785
is that hydrogen iodide
or hydrochloric acid,

00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:26.340
since we're dissolving it in water now,

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:31.340
hydroiotic acid is a strong acid.

00:08:32.923 --> 00:08:37.923
So let's see, HI, hydroiotic
acid, strong acid,

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:46.213
strong acid, while hydrofluoric acid

00:08:47.157 --> 00:08:52.157
is a weaker acid, is a weaker acid.

00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:57.002
So a strong acid is not going to be good

00:08:57.002 --> 00:08:59.022
at nabbing hydrogens.

00:08:59.022 --> 00:09:02.761
In fact, it wants to
give away its hyrdorogens

00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.404
really, really, really badly.

00:09:05.404 --> 00:09:10.161
So the iodine does not
seem like a good candidate.

00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:15.161
The fluoride does seem like
an interesting candidate.

00:09:15.347 --> 00:09:17.217
so let's take one of these,

00:09:17.217 --> 00:09:19.074
let's take one of these
candidates out here,

00:09:19.074 --> 00:09:20.858
you can use either the lithium fluoride

00:09:20.858 --> 00:09:22.088
or the sodium fluoride,

00:09:22.088 --> 00:09:23.465
let's just take, I know
we've already dealt

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:26.403
with the sodium fluoride,
so let's keep using that.

00:09:26.403 --> 00:09:29.108
So if you take sodium fluoride,

00:09:29.108 --> 00:09:31.999
sodium fluoride, and so let me,

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:35.958
since they say write
the net ionic equation

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:37.130
for the reaction that occurs

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.151
to cause the solution to be basic.

00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.076
So we're gonna focus on sodium fluoride,

00:09:42.076 --> 00:09:47.076
sodium, sodium fluoride is what we select.

00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:49.251
We select sodium fluoride,

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:50.993
that's the first part.

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:53.009
We identified a compound that
can be dissolved in water

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:56.318
to produce a basic solution.

00:09:56.318 --> 00:09:58.605
We select that, and now let's draw,

00:09:58.605 --> 00:10:00.161
let's do first the ionic equation,

00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:01.949
then we'll do the net ionic equation.

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:03.922
So if you dissolve this in water,

00:10:03.922 --> 00:10:08.346
you're going to have sodium cations

00:10:08.346 --> 00:10:10.145
dissolved in our aqueous solution,

00:10:10.145 --> 00:10:13.737
plus fluoride anions dissolved in our,

00:10:13.737 --> 00:10:18.737
dissolved in our aqueous solution,

00:10:19.326 --> 00:10:23.924
and it is going to be in equilibrium,

00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:28.641
in equilibrium with,
actually let me draw it,

00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:30.827
let me draw it this way,

00:10:30.827 --> 00:10:32.000
let me draw it this way,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
plus H2O, because that's what
it's going to react with,

00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:39.848
and obviously, I don't have to
say it's an aqueous solution,

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.485
it is the aqueous solution,

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:43.203
so it's making the solution aqueous.

00:10:43.203 --> 00:10:45.444
This is going to be in equilibrium with,

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:46.596
and I'll go to the next row here.

00:10:46.596 --> 00:10:48.406
If I was actually taking the AP test,

00:10:48.406 --> 00:10:50.263
well actually, let me just,

00:10:50.263 --> 00:10:51.865
let me just copy and paste it here,

00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:55.766
just so we don't have to
deal with it on two rows.

00:10:55.766 --> 00:11:00.766
So put it right over there.

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:04.451
So that is going to be in,

00:11:04.451 --> 00:11:09.164
that is going to be in equilibrium.

00:11:09.164 --> 00:11:10.883
Let me get the right tool out.

00:11:10.883 --> 00:11:13.669
That is going to be in equilibrium

00:11:13.669 --> 00:11:17.384
with this fluoride nabbing a hydrogen.

00:11:17.384 --> 00:11:22.384
So hydrofluoric acid, we could say HF

00:11:26.324 --> 00:11:31.324
in our aqueous solution, plus OH minus

00:11:31.664 --> 00:11:33.905
in our aqueous solution,

00:11:33.905 --> 00:11:38.340
and then you still have the sodium cation

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.103
in our aqueous solution.

00:11:41.103 --> 00:11:43.983
And so this, as you can see
will perform at equilibrium,

00:11:43.983 --> 00:11:45.863
and so you're gonna have
more hydroxide around,

00:11:45.863 --> 00:11:47.090
so you're forming your basic,

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.401
you're forming your basic solution.

00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:52.361
If this was an iodide right over here,

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:55.589
then this reaction would go
strongly in that direction.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:57.864
If this was hydrogen
iodide right over here,

00:11:57.864 --> 00:12:00.244
this wouldn't be some
kind of nice equilibrium.

00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:03.263
This would be a strong
acid, it would definitely

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:05.341
want to get rid of its hydrogens.

00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:07.501
So that's why we don't want
to use hydrogen iodide.

00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:09.091
We want to use hydrogen fluoride.

00:12:09.091 --> 00:12:10.922
When you put it in water,
it becomes hydrofluoric,

00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:14.184
it's likely to donate,

00:12:14.184 --> 00:12:16.406
when it's in its gassiest
form or it's by itself,

00:12:16.406 --> 00:12:18.205
we would call it a hydrogen fluoride,

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:19.912
but now when we put it in a solution,

00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:22.548
we can consider it to
be hydrofluoric acid.

00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:25.009
And so if you want your
net ionic equation,

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:26.623
well we don't have to worry too much

00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:29.247
about these sodiums that
are on both sides of this.

00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.081
And so if you just focus
on this right over here,

00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:36.081
this is your net ionic,
net ionic equation.
