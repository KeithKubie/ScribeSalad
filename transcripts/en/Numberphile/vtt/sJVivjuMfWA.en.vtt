TONY PADILLA: We're going to
do Buffon's needle trick.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.830
So this is named after Georges
Louie Leclerc, and this is a

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.336
method that he proposed
for working out pi.

00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:14.900
So basically he proposed that
you would chuck a bunch of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.420
needles just randomly
on a floor.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.300
You can work out pi
from that, yeah.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.820
BRADY HARAN: Go on, then.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.680
TONY PADILLA: Due to
the random nature.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.290
So anyway, we haven't got
needles, and we're not going

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.030
to do it on a floor.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.380
We're going to do it on
one of Brady's lovely

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.670
brown pieces of paper.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.150
And we're going to use matches
instead, because we're cheap.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.620
So what we want is we want to
draw some lines on this.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.690
So there's one line.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.710
And what we want is we want the
gaps between lines to be

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.410
two matches long.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.660
This is all very approximate.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.270
What we're going to do is we're
going to chuck a bunch

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.770
of matches on this board.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.040
So I'll just chuck the first
two completely randomly.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.860
We need a lot of matches
for this.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.140
If I counted these right,
we should have 163.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.390
Let's just spread them out.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.320
So hopefully, there should
be 163 matches randomly

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.730
distributed around this board.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.860
Now, this is what I've gotta do
now, is I'm going to count

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.140
how many matches cross a line.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.650
OK, so I reckon that one does.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.614
So you count, Brady,
that was 1, 2, 3.

00:01:26.614 --> 00:01:31.220
5, 6, 11, 12.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.430
13, 14, 51, and I
think that's it.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.880
52.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.140
52 matches that cross
the lines.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.890
There's 163 in total.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.480
Now, let's see.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.440
Let's do the following
calculation.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.340
So 163 divided by 52
is equal to 3.13.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.400
And that's not bad.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.016
That's not bad, I'm quite
happy with that.

00:01:54.016 --> 00:01:54.710
BRADY HARAN: That's
very close.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.850
TONY PADILLA: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.670
So pi is 3.141.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.170
So this is not bad.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.060
OK, so why isn't it perfect?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.990
Because this is not a
very large sample.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.750
Viewers could have a little
go themselves.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.440
Just literally play
the same game.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.090
If you've got more matches,
that's better.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.910
You'll get a better accuracy.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.310
There was a mathematician
called Lazarine.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.670
He used over 3,000 needles, and
he actually managed to get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.790
pi accurate to I think it was
about six decimal places.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.290
What we're seeing here is
something is akin to a Monte

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.695
Carlo simulation.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:34.730
That's what it's called.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.500
You basically take
a random sample.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.205
The reason you get pie out of
this is it's all to do with

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:44.120
the angle that the match takes
as playing some role here.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.670
And of course if you're working
in radians, if you go

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.800
through a full 360 degrees,
well, in radians that's 2 pi.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.990
OK, so that's where pi's coming
into this game, and

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.620
that's why you can get pi
out of this sort of

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.050
setup, because the angle.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.800
So we're going to try and
explain the maths of it now.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.430
Let me say, imagine that the
length of the match is l, and

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.740
that means that the distance
here is 2l.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.630
There's a few things that
play a role here.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.800
There's the position of the
center of the match, which

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.910
I'll call there.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.700
We'll say that's a distance
x from here.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.400
And then the other thing that
we're interested in is the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.900
angle the match is making.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.830
So let's just draw it,
I guess, like so.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.750
We're interested in
that angle beta.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.010
Assuming everything's
completely random.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.720
how do we measure the
probability of where the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.140
center of the match is?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.295
Well, the probability density
of the center of the match,

00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:51.360
which is position x, is just
given by essentially 1/l.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.545
The other thing that we're
interested in is

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:54.080
the angle it makes.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.940
So this is sort of a measure
of the probability of the

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.200
angle it's making.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.180
And basically, the angles that
we're interested in are

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.165
somewhere between 0 and pi/2
which is of course 90 degrees.

00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:06.200
This is where the
pi's coming in.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.410
Now, if we want to work out
essentially the probability

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.390
for the match to cross the
line, what we do is

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.920
we take these two.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.740
We have to do an integration.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.110
OK, now there's an important
point here.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.860
What's the condition for the
match to cross the line?

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.550
Well, the condition for the
match to cross the line is

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.410
that x should be less
than l/2 sine theta.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.700
So that means when we do the x
integration, we go between 0

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.620
and l/2 sine theta.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.257
OK, and of course when we do the
theta integration, we're

00:04:37.257 --> 00:04:40.210
going between 0 and pi by 2.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.150
So we do it, theta equals 0,
this is pi/2, 2 over l pi.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.810
2 over l pi.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.260
When we do the x integration, we
get an l over 2 sine theta.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.210
And then we integrate sine theta
between 0 and pi by 2.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.980
That gives me 1, and I've
got the 1/pi there, so

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.350
the answer is 1/pi.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.300
This tells me the probability
that you're going to cross the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.870
line, right?

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.670
So if I've got n matches, and
I want to work out how many

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.260
cross, let me call them--
so this is the n total.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.620
And I want to work out
how many cross.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.850
Then I just multiply
and total that.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.620
1/pi.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.400
So n total is 163.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.930
And n crossing was 52, I think
we got, didn't we?

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.200
OK.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.472
So what you see from that
if we've got 163/pi.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.440
Let's put an approximate
sign in there.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.570
Approximately 52, or if you
like, what we actually saw was

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.380
that pi, just rearrange
this equation, so

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.260
approximately 163/52.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.380
Yeah, I'm happy with that.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.620
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.010
That's good.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.970
So that's how it works.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.220
That's the theory behind it.
