Adriene: Hi I'm Adriene Hill.

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.220
Mr. Clifford: And I'm Mr. Clifford and welcome
to Crash Course Economics.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.849
Adriene: Today we're going to focus on macroeconomics
and talk about economic systems and the nations

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.000
that really like them. Wink, wink.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.499
Mr. Clifford: "Economic systems and the nations that
really like them. Wink, wink." What does that even mean?

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.010
Adriene: I'm trying to come up with a spicy
title for today's show. OK, try this one on.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.849
how about "economic systems and the nations
that are 'attracted' to them?"

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:22.529
Mr. Clifford: No. No.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.710
Adriene: Or when economic systems and nations
"hook up."

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.410
Mr. Clifford: I don't even know what to say.
Stan, roll the intro.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:35.200
[Theme Music]

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.500
Adriene: So to pick up where we left off,
we all have wants. Food, cell phones, a good

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.710
education, a $10,000 gold Apple watch, but
like the Rolling Stones tell us, you can't

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.440
always get what you want. We don't have an
infinite amount of resources like raw materials,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.150
workers, and time, so we have to make choices.
Speaking of, eugh, who likes this? I'm gonna

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.930
go change shirts. I'm gonna make another choice.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.610
So this shirt, it's way better, right? Anyway,
we as a social order have to figure out three

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.119
things. Number one: what to produce, number
two: how to produce it, and number three:

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.100
who gets it. Answer these three questions
and you've got an economic system!

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.799
There's a ton of backstory here about the
history and evolution of economic thought;

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.639
we'll get to that in a future video. In today's
video, we're gonna chat about the world today.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.899
Let's take a look at two different economic
systems: market economies and planned economies.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.149
Mr. Clifford: It all comes down to who owns
and controls the factors of production. These

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.460
are the major inputs required to produce stuff
and Karl Marx classified them as land, labor,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.710
and capital. He even wrote a book about it,
Das Kapital.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.649
In a planned economy, the government controls
the factors of production, and it's easy to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.799
assume that's the same thing as communism
or socialism but that's not quite right. According

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.759
to Karl Marx, "The theory of communism may
be summed up in the single sentence: abolition

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.319
of private property." So true Communism is
a classless society.

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.090
When I say classless, I'm talking about a
social order where everyone owns the factors

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.960
of production, and output is distributed equally.
Kind of like China, and Cuba and the former

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.679
Soviet Union, except not at all. In practice,
no country has ever been truly communist.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.280
There's a lot of countries that are socialist.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.860
Often, socialism has both private property
and some public ownership and control of industry.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.020
The goal is to meet specific collective objectives
and to provide free and easy access to things like education and healthcare.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.960
In both communism and socialism, there is
economic planning, and the government, usually

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.060
in the form of some bureaucratic agency, helps decide
what to produce, how to produce it, and who gets it.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.340
Now if an economy is completely controlled
by the government, down to the number of shoes

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.430
that should be produced, that's called a command
economy.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.470
Adriene: On the other side of the spectrum,
we have free market economies. In free market

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.600
or capitalist economies, individuals own the factors
of production, and the government keeps its nose

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.280
out of the stuff and adopts a laissez faire or hands-off
approach to production, commerce, and trade.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.100
In free market economies, businesses make
things like cars, not to do good for mankind

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.170
but because they want to make a profit. Since
consumers, that's me and you, get to choose

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.680
which car we want, car producers need to make
a car with the right features at the right

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.160
price. Economists call this the invisible
hand. Oooooohhhh.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.100
If consumers prefer one company's car, that
business will make more profit and have an

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.470
incentive to produce more cars. Car companies
that don't offer the cars people want will

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.570
disappear. Maybe you've heard of the DeLorean?
It was a cool looking car, but not a car that

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.110
many people wanted to buy. Apparently it was
expensive, underpowered, and poorly-made.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.300
And it didn't actually travel through time.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.890
Anyway, this concept applies to all other
markets, like cell phones or shoes. Scarce

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.500
resources will go to the most desired use,
and they'll be used efficiently, more or less.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.190
After all, if a business is wasteful and inefficient
or makes something that no one wants to buy,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.050
then some other business will make a similar
product that's either better or cheaper or

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.960
both. If there's no consumer demand for a
product, resources won't be wasted producing it.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.620
We often take markets for granted, but look
at the alternative. Assume instead that a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.350
government agency was in charge of deciding
exactly which types of cars and cell phones

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.380
and shoes to make. Do you think they could
quickly respond to changes in tastes and preferences?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.600
If there was only one government monopoly producing
cars, do you think they'd be produced efficiently?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.500
Mr. Clifford: So the invisible hand of the
free market is the idea that individuals and

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.340
businesses meet society's needs when they
seek their own self-interest. Competitive

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.400
markets with profit-seeking businesses will
have an incentive to produce high-quality

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.360
products as efficiently as possible. In the
words of Adam Smith, "It's not from the benevolence

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.070
of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that
we expect our dinner, but from their regard

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.010
to their own interest." Now, it looks like
the free market's perfect and we don't even

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.350
need a government, but that's not quite right.
There's a bunch of things the government must

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.820
do, because free markets won't.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.360
First, is maintain the rule of law. We need
laws and police and contracts and courts to

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.769
keep everything orderly. Second, we need public
goods and services, like roads and bridges

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.419
and education and defense, because goods can't
get to consumers if bridges are falling down,

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.550
and consumers can't make good choices if they're
not educated, and no one really cares about

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.569
buying the new iPhone if there's a bomb dropping
on your head. Third, the government sometimes

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.300
needs to step in when markets get things wrong,
but what does that even mean?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.889
Adriene: Well, let's go back to producing
cars. The free market produces what we consumers

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.530
want to buy, and when we buy, we're thinking
about what a car looks like. If it's the color

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.530
we want, maybe if it's safe, what it costs.
Most of us aren't worried about air pollution.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.150
We don't think much about who made our car,
what they were paid, what the conditions at

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.990
the factory were like; that's when government
steps in to regulate production. In a free

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.949
market economy like the United States, you
might think that the government doesn't tell

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.969
car producers what types of cars to produce
and how to produce them, except that it does.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.759
Cars need to meet strict emissions and safety
standards, and there are laws dictating how

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:12.359
much manufacturers can pollute and how workers
should be treated, and here's the big takeaway:

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.479
modern economies are neither completely free
market nor planned. There's a spectrum of

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.699
government involvement. For example, on one
end we have North Korea. They have a command

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.419
economy where production is entirely controlled
by the government. On the other end, we have

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:31.060
countries like New Zealand; they have private
property, few taxes, and few regulations.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.469
In the middle, we have the rest of the world.
So most modern economies are actually mixed

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.710
economies with both free markets and government
intervention.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.969
Mr. Clifford: And a great way to explain a
mixed economy is by looking at something called

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.759
"the circular flow model." Let's go to the
Thought Bubble. A modern economy is made up

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.529
of households, which are individuals like
you and me, and businesses. Businesses sell

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.999
goods and services to households in the product
market -- that's anywhere goods and services

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.080
are bought and sold. The households need to
pay for those goods and services, but where

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.999
do they get the money? The households earn
the money by selling the resources, like labor,

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.900
to businesses. Now, this is done in the resource
market. The businesses use the money they

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.169
earn from selling products in the product
market to pay for resources in the resource

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.300
market, and households use the money they earn in the
resource market to buy products in the product market.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.159
But there's another key player in the economy:
the government. The government also buys products

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:17.779
and resources. For example, they'll buy cars
from businesses and hire government employees

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.599
like policemen to drive them. The government
pays for public goods like roads and bridges

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:24.819
and public services like firefighters and
teachers. They also provide transfer payments

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.789
to individuals in poverty and subsidies to
businesses to produce things like fuel efficient

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.389
cars. But where does the government get the
money?

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:34.110
Well, they get some of it from taxing households
and businesses and they get some of it from

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.400
borrowing, but we'll talk about that later.
So basically, that's it. That's the circular

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.419
flow of products, resources, and money, and
the interactions between businesses, individuals,

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:44.650
and the government. Now, it gets more complex
when you add in international trade and the

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.710
financial sector, but for now, the simplified circular
flow shows how the modern economy works.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.629
Adriene: Thanks, Thought Bubble. We've established
that economies differ based on the amount

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:56.469
of government involvement, but it's important
to keep in mind that economies can change.

00:06:56.469 --> 00:07:01.420
Over time, Denmark and Canada have adopted
more elements of a planned economy, like universal

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.259
healthcare. China, on the other hand, has
added more free market elements to its economy

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:10.889
and now has less government ownership and
control of production, so communist China

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.419
actually has a socialist market economy. But
which type of economy is better and how much

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.229
should the government get involved?

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:21.659
It's hard to find support for command economies
outside North Korea, and may some nostalgic

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:25.659
Cubans and Russians. Those who support socialism
would point out Denmark's high standards of

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:29.839
living and low income inequality, but free
market enthusiasts might point out China's

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:35.229
massive economic growth and growing middle
class after backing away from central planning.

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:39.969
Ultimately, the optimal amount of government
involvement depends on your personal values.

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:43.320
For example, what, if anything, do you think
the government should do to help people in

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.550
poverty? Do you think it's up to each individual
to provide for themselves, come what may,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.439
or do you think the government should step
in as a safety net and help pay for food and

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:56.119
healthcare? What if the person made choices
that got them in financial trouble, like gambling

00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:01.499
or made them sick, like smoking? Should society
help then? Well, economists aren't really

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:04.339
good at answering these types of questions.
Sorry.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.979
It's not that they're heartless. It's just
they don't operate in the realm of feelings.

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:13.430
In the words of economist Thomas Sowell, "There
are no solutions, only trade-offs." Sure,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.039
it would be great if we could end poverty
or provide healthcare for everyone, but we're

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:21.719
gonna have to give something up in order to
do it. Forcing car producers to meet emissions

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:26.319
and safety regulations will increase production
costs and likely increase the price of cars,

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:29.939
but it also reduces pollution and fossil fuel
consumption, which will hopefully improve

00:08:29.939 --> 00:08:35.250
public health and save money in the long run.
There is always an opportunity cost, and deciding

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.539
if it's worth it--well, that's up to you and
your elected officials and a bunch of lobbyists.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:43.940
Deng Xiaoping transformed China from a country
with debilitating poverty and famine to the

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:49.160
economic powerhouse it is today. Regarding
this debate, he said, "It doesn't matter whether

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.699
a cat is black or white, if it catches mice,
it's a good cat." Which makes me think about

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.259
that green shirt, that was a good shirt. I'll
be right back.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:09:00.870
Mr. Clifford: So let's wrap this thing up.
In practice, almost all countries are somewhere

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.389
between the extremes of a command economy
and a completely free market economy. That's

00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:08.500
because mixed economies seem best at handling
the circular flow of goods, money, and resources.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.649
But the debate over free markets and government
control will never end.

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:16.579
Adriene: Well, actually, it will end, when
humanity ends, because microscopic organisms

00:09:16.579 --> 00:09:21.089
don't divide themselves into factions based
on economic theory, but anyway, that's why

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:25.649
it's vital for you to be informed about the
merits and the limits of economic systems

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:29.990
and be willing to support solutions that get
the job done, as opposed to getting stuck

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.399
in one ideology. Economic theories and models
can seem really great in the abstract, but

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:38.860
when they're kicked out into the real world
and actually have to govern the affairs of

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.759
billions of people, it turns out that some
flexibility is a very important thing.

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:45.919
Mr. Clifford: Thanks for watching; we'll see
