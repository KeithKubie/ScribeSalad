[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.024 --> 00:00:08.440
ERIC MARCUS: I'm Eric Marcus,
I make "Making Gay History."

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.148
SARA BURNINGHAM: And
I'm Sara Burningham,

00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:12.860
and I help Eric Marcus
make "Making Gay History."

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.818
ERIC MARCUS: We actually--
we make it together.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.940
You were just listening to a
woman named Edythe Eyde, a.k.a.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.570
Lisa Ben.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.790
Does anyone play word games?

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.910
Lisa Ben spells
a familiar word--

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.440
lesbian.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.522
She actually had chosen
the pen name Ima Spinster,

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:35.230
but her colleagues at
"The Ladder," which

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.270
was an early lesbian
publication, first published

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.600
in the 1950s, they didn't
think it was very funny.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.920
So she chose Lisa Ben instead.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.510
Lisa sang songs in the 1950s
and '60s in the gay clubs,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.090
and we'll explain a little bit
more about her in a moment.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.300
But she's just one of
about 100 or so voices

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.020
that I recorded when I was
working on a book, which was

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.760
then called "Making History."

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.380
I traveled the
country interviewing

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.399
people who were involved in
some aspect of the movement,

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.940
from Burbank, California, which
is where I interviewed Edythe

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.910
Eyde, to a few blocks north of
where I now live in Chelsea,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.110
with Vito Russo.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.490
That book was published in 1992.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.230
It was just released
this week in an e-book

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.020
by HarperCollins,
which is something I've

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.252
been working for for years.

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:26.710
So happily, you can read it,
but you don't have to read it,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.700
because you can just listen to
it with "Making Gay History."

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.730
SARA BURNINGHAM: So Eric did
these interviews, and then

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.490
stacked the tapes
very carefully,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.447
cataloged them meticulously.

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.530
ERIC MARCUS: What Sara is
being very kind about it

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.871
is that I am so thoroughly OCD.

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.370
When I had a New
York Public Library

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.130
come to take all
of my tapes, I just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.280
assumed everybody did that.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
SARA BURNINGHAM: No,
not everybody does that.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.495
ERIC MARCUS:
Stacked in perfect--

00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:56.450
it was a six-foot high
stack of tapes in trays.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.270
SARA BURNINGHAM:
And for every tape,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.160
for every person that
Eric interviewed,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.730
there's these
comprehensive field notes.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.270
The sun was shining that
day, the rain was pouring,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.419
the living room was musty,
the kitchen table had

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.280
vodka on it, the, you know--

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.470
all these really
incredible details

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.230
that he stored
alongside these tapes.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.560
So the tapes went off to
the New York Public Library,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.170
as you donated them
to the archive there--

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.590
ERIC MARCUS: In 2008.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.790
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.831
ERIC MARCUS: I originally
recorded the interviews

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:30.250
from 1988 through 1991.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.770
SARA BURNINGHAM: And
then why did you go back

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.660
to those tapes, Eric?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.825
ERIC MARCUS: I got fired.

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:41.380
[LAUGH] I got fired from my
job at an organization focused

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.315
on the prevention of
suicide, and thought,

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:44.440
well, what am I to do next?

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.550
I was 57.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.920
People don't like to
hire 57-year-olds.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.420
I called the New
York Public Library

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.961
to see what the status was of
my tapes, which they had agreed

00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.340
to digitize as part of the
transfer of my material

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.160
to them, and the tapes
had just been digitized.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.090
So I thought, hm, I
got 300 hours of audio.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.340
What am I going to do with it?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.440
So I started having
conversations

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.360
with lots of people
about what I might do,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.980
which led to an
educational project.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.440
So I asked my neighbor,
Sara Burningham,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.740
who lives directly across
the street from me.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.540
And I knew Sara had
been an audio producer,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.834
I said, can you cut tape?

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:24.250
SARA BURNINGHAM:
And I said, sure.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.750
What is it, though?

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.780
Because I knew that Eric had
written this book, but listen,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.790
all tape isn't created equal.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.460
If you're recording
these interviews

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.240
just so you can transcribe
them and sort of turn them

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.110
into a book, it's
not necessarily

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.630
going to be anything
that a person would

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.400
want to sit down and listen to.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.130
But I had faith in
Eric, even with my--

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.625
[LAUGH] --even with
some of my concerns.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.500
And so I said, sure,
let's take a look at it.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.207
And then I listened to
the very first tape, and--

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:54.540
well, you'll hopefully share
the experience in a minute.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.867
That it just blew my socks off.

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.700
ERIC MARCUS: These
people just come to life.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.690
I don't know why I asked--

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.790
I was working at CBS
News at the time,

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.320
and I asked one of
my colleagues who

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.520
had created "Morning Edition"
and "Weekend Edition" on NPR.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.250
I said, what do your colleagues
use to record interviews?

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.410
And he referred me to
one of his colleagues,

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.260
and that's the
equipment I bought.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.760
And I still thank my
30-year-old self all these years

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.210
later for recording these
interviews with broadcast

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.960
quality equipment.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.547
Because I couldn't
have used them

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:26.380
for the purposes of a
podcast, and podcasts,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.580
of course, didn't exist
then, unless they'd

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.307
been recorded with
broadcast quality equipment.

00:04:31.307 --> 00:04:32.890
SARA BURNINGHAM:
There's a bigger sort

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.130
of moral to this story, which
is future proofing your archive

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.480
as much as you can, right?

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.804
ERIC MARCUS: Yes.

00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:40.720
SARA BURNINGHAM: The
thing that was incredible

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.750
about it is when you hear
these voices and the ability

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.930
to deliver them
to new audiences,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.880
to new ears as a podcast, means
that people who would otherwise

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.740
have been forgotten--

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.830
it literally is-- it's
like bringing people back

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.950
to life in a strange way.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.140
ERIC MARCUS: I liked the
way first time around I

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.940
told everyone's
stories in print.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.650
And it wasn't--

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.482
I'm not a religious
person or even spiritual.

00:05:04.482 --> 00:05:05.940
I'm a "National
Geographic" reader.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.190
I like to think, though,
that these people wanted

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.350
to tell their stories
in their own voices,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.840
and that's what led
us to this project.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.990
Most of the people who were
featured in making history

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.730
died years ago.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.240
Edythe actually only died
just a few years ago.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.770
When she died, there
was no obit anywhere.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.520
SARA BURNINGHAM: Well,
this was the thing.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.000
When we came to make an episode
about Edythe, we started--

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.911
Eric tried to reach out to her.

00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:37.410
ERIC MARCUS: Yeah,
and I looked on--

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.810
her Wikipedia file said
that she was still alive.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.920
It turns out she was not.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:46.590
She had died just a short
time before, at age 95.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.920
You heard her
singing, and Edythe

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.360
wrote and sang popular
songs with her own lyrics,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.130
and some of her
own music as well,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.050
in the gay clubs in
the 1950s and '60s,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.133
because she didn't like
the entertainment that she

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:00.870
saw in the clubs.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.310
Much of it was derogatory.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.600
The entertainers often
played to the straight people

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.094
who would be allowed into the
girls clubs in the evenings.

00:06:10.094 --> 00:06:12.010
So they would play-- to
watch the girls dance.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.190
I mean, it sounds kind of--

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.160
it sounds creepy.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.030
SARA BURNINGHAM: She
said it was creepy.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.350
ERIC MARCUS: It was creepy.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.880
But the entertainers played
to the straight people,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.560
and she didn't like
the derogatory jokes

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.185
that they told.

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:22.059
So she decided, I will
write my own songs,

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:24.100
and I will write my own
music, and I'll sing them

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.010
in the clubs, and she did!

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.780
But she's better known for
having published the first--

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.860
what we would call a zine--

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.770
for lesbians in 1947.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.170
If you had a job, if you
were working at RKO Radio

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.836
Pictures in 1947 as a
secretary, and your boss said,

00:06:41.836 --> 00:06:43.710
you know, you're not
always going to be busy,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.540
but I want you to look busy.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.130
I don't want you to knit,
I don't want you to read.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.400
I want you to do something.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.310
What would you do?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.780
And Edythe decided she
would write a newsletter,

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.200
or magazine, she called it, for
lesbians, called "Vice Versa."

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.260
The tagline was "America's
gayest Magazine."

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.952
And in it, she shared her
own thoughts for the future.

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:07.410
There's one particular essay,
which she'll tell you about--

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.080
we'll play a bit of tape--

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.700
where she imagined the world
in which we live today.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.150
And in 1947, there was
no reason to believe

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.920
that LGBTQ people would even
have identities like LGBTQ, let

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.520
alone that we would
have equal rights.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.010
So here's a bit of--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.270
--oops.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.794
There is Edythe Eyde, and here's
a clip from her interview.

00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:30.460
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.890
- It was just some writing
that I wanted to do,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.430
to get it off my chest.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.000
And I was a very lonely
person, and I could sort of

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.970
fantasize this way by writing
the magazine, you see.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.780
Then-- oh, I'd write the BM--

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.090
the whatchamacallem.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.006
And that was just ideas that
happened off the top of my head

00:07:52.006 --> 00:07:53.380
that I would write
about and say,

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.210
wouldn't it be wonderful if?

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.340
Not fantasize, exactly, but--

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.010
- Imagine?

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.720
- Imagine about how things
might be in the future with us.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.760
- What were some of the
things you imagined?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.590
- Well, I imagined
that perhaps we

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.280
would have a lot of magazines,
and that perhaps even movies

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.530
might be made about us.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:16.030
I would hope that some day
we would not be looked down

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.410
on with so much disdain.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.290
- I think this
may be where you--

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.280
this is the column, this is
the article, "Here to Stay."

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.190
September 1947, volume
one, number four.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.500
"Whether the unsympathetic
majority approves or not,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.340
it looks as though the
third sex is here to stay.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.590
With the advancement
of psychiatry

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.776
and related subjects, the world
is becoming more and more aware

00:08:38.776 --> 00:08:40.150
that there are
those in our midst

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.700
who feel no attraction
for the opposite sex.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.620
Homosexuality is becoming
less and less a taboo subject.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.420
And although still considered
by the general public as

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.850
contemptible or
treated with derision,

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.350
I venture to predict that there
will be a time in the future

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.040
when gay folk will be accepted
as part of regular society."

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.350
That's pretty bold stuff.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.430
- Well, I guess it is.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:10.190
I never thought of it as
being bold at the time.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.570
I was just-- as I say, I was
just sort of fantasizing.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.076
But it all has come to pass.

00:09:17.076 --> 00:09:17.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.185
ERIC MARCUS: The
amazing thing is

00:09:19.185 --> 00:09:22.570
she wrote that magazine
on her office typewriter,

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.660
typed through twice, using
five sheets of carbon paper

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.759
each time, and
then distributed it

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:29.800
to her friends, who passed
it on to their friends

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.090
and onto their friends.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.410
And you can actually see a
copy of the original "Vice

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:37.960
Versa," all of the
issues, on our website,

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.090
if you go to the
Edythe Eyde episode.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.250
It's been scanned, and
we have a link to it.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.520
So you can see all of
the episodes she wrote.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.080
SARA BURNINGHAM: And so,
yes, so there was Edythe,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.290
typing onto carbon paper.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:55.390
And in fact, when you then
came to interview her those

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:00.610
30 years later, after she wrote
that column, finding her wasn't

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.164
that straightforward, was it?

00:10:02.164 --> 00:10:02.830
ERIC MARCUS: No.

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.940
It took 26 phone
calls to find her.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.020
Because I couldn't just
do a Google search.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.856
So I called people and wrote
to people to see where she was.

00:10:16.856 --> 00:10:18.730
It took 26 phone calls,
and on the 26th call,

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.396
she picked up her
phone and said, hello?

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.112
In later years-- I stayed
in touch with Edythe,

00:10:26.112 --> 00:10:27.820
especially right after
I interviewed her.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.320
I would call occasionally, and
whenever she picked the phone

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.900
up, she said, hello, Eric.

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.450
There was no phone ID then.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.690
I said one time, how
do you know it's me?

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.540
She said, well,
nobody else calls.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.460
So it's something that I
found with many of the people

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.440
I interviewed that they
were very, very isolated.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.090
They grew up in a
very isolated world

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.270
and lived in an isolated
world in part because

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.639
of their fear of even sharing
with anyone who they were

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:56.930
and what their identities were.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.916
Let's go on to Wendell Sayers.

00:11:08.916 --> 00:11:10.290
We don't have a
photo of Wendell.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.410
I didn't take pictures
of anybody I interviewed.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.380
It was a long time
ago, and I also

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.940
felt it would be a
little intrusive to ask.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.690
And in those days, people didn't
take pictures in the same way

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.590
that we do now.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.440
SARA BURNINGHAM: Well, and
both Wendell and Edythe

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.980
had used pseudonyms as well.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.930
Wasn't that the case?

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:28.860
ERIC MARCUS: Yes, they
didn't use their real names

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:29.450
in my book.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.050
They asked me to use
their pseudonyms.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.540
Wendell Sayers was Paul
Phillips in the book.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.460
He was in his mid-80s
when I interviewed him,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.400
and he was afraid that some
of his relatives in Kansas

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.090
might find out that he was gay.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.940
So we'd like to say that
these stories, the story

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.250
of the movement, the LGBTQ
civil rights movement,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.160
are told in small stories
and in big stories.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.980
Big stories with people like
Sylvia Rivera, small stories

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.900
like Wendell Sayers.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.900
People like Wendell contributed
generally in very small ways

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.410
to the movement, but in
those days, in the 1950s,

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.620
to be out at all,
to go to a meeting,

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.040
was a huge leap of faith.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.260
Because you could lose
your job, lose your family,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.100
lose your children,
and lose your home.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.630
So Wendell didn't
change the world,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.640
but his story is really
an important part

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.110
of the narrative.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.510
In 1920, he was sent
to the Mayo Clinic

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.570
by his father, who felt that
he might be a homosexual.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.340
They lived in western
Kansas, and Wendell's mother

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.950
drove him from western
Kansas to the Mayo

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.910
Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.015
And he said along the
way, they slept in a tent.

00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:42.640
They brought a tent
with them, and they

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.290
bought food at the
side of the road

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.920
and ate at the side of the road.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.020
And I said, why?

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.870
Stupid me, because
they were black.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.540
And most places would not--

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.450
actually, no one would
rent a room to them,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.320
and they couldn't
eat in restaurants.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.454
So this is a clip from
Wendell on his way--

00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:02.620
he's talking about coming
back from the Mayo Clinic,

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.750
after he's been diagnosed
as a homosexual,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.550
and his fears about
talking to his father.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.400
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.880
- So we went back home
and reported to Dad.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.672
I'd say this, that I
was an adopted child.

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.090
- Mhm.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.410
- And I often used to wonder
as a kid, what will he

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.800
do when he finds it out, see?

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.710
Will he put me out, or kick
me out, or will he accept me?

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.420
My dad was very understanding.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.050
I say understanding, I don't
think he actually understood,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:41.180
but he was willing to
accept, I should say.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.000
So he finally told
me, he says, well,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.020
since they don't know
what to do about it,

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:55.050
find you a friend that you
can trust and bring them home.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.050
He says, I don't want you
playing around on the streets,

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.300
or riding on the country
roads, 'cause you never know

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.762
who's going to step up on you.

00:14:08.762 --> 00:14:11.230
Bring them home.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.920
What you do in your
room is your business,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.859
because he didn't want
me out on the street.

00:14:16.859 --> 00:14:17.895
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:17.895 --> 00:14:19.270
ERIC MARCUS: What
Wendell's story

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.120
tells us is the threat that
psychiatry posed to gay people

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.350
in those days.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.530
That you could be diagnosed
and institutionalized,

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.950
and there were all kinds of
horrible treatments used to--

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.390
put this in quotes-- "cure"
gay people of their sexuality.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.060
And we all know that that's
not possible, but in those days

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.010
people didn't know that.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.770
But it's also the intersection
of sexuality, race,

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:46.000
and segregation.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.660
And Wendell was also adopted.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.120
So there were enormous fears
that he came home with,

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.050
but he overcame a lot.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:57.040
He wound up becoming
the first black attorney

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.460
to work for the Attorney
General of Colorado,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.820
and he worked in Denver.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.611
You won't read that in
the book, because he

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.800
asked me not to indicate
even where he had worked--

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.508
or I should say which
state he worked in.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.770
Wendell's story has
always stayed with me

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.430
because of what he said to
me on the step of his house

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.610
as I was leaving.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.940
He's this very powerful
man, even in his mid-80s.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:31.130
Crisp white shirt, thin tie,
gray press slacks, black shoes,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.020
polished shoes.

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.420
And he said, do you think
it's too late for me

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.820
to meet someone?

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.910
And he said, not for sex, he
said, it's too late for that,

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.910
he said, but for companionship.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.590
And I said, knowing
that I was lying,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.140
that it was never too late.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.930
But I knew from what he'd
already told me about his life

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:57.110
that the odds of him meeting
anybody were almost none.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.230
Because even in his church
he didn't let people

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.960
know he was gay.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.180
He had two friends in
his church who knew,

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.700
but they both died of AIDS.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.190
So he was alone again.

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.780
So he spent the rest
of his life alone.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.040
SARA BURNINGHAM: And that's--

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.100
with the podcast,
with the tapes,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.230
is the impact of
those stories, when

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.180
you hear them, when
you hear that person's

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:27.880
voice, and the ability for
them to whisper in your ear

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.810
their experience,
is just so unique,

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.000
and it tells you so much
more than dates and times.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:40.110
Eric could give a rundown
of the history of the DSM

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:44.560
and talk about the history of
conversion therapy and so on,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.269
but those--

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.060
ERIC MARCUS: It's not
nearly as interesting

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.584
as the stories themselves.

00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:52.000
And it's one of the reasons I
was a little reluctant, when

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.430
I was called by an editor
at Harper and Rowe,

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.917
which became HarperCollins,
commissioning this book.

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:00.250
Because he said he wanted me
write an oral history book.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.500
And I-- history was
incredibly boring,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.800
at least as I had been taught
it by Mr. Federbush at Russell

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:10.210
Sage Junior High School in
Queens, who sat behind his desk

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:13.232
and read from our
school textbook

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.190
about American history
for 45 minutes straight,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.359
and we took notes.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.616
Every once in a while,
he'd drop a bit--

00:17:18.616 --> 00:17:20.740
he would say that he was
at the Battle of the Bulge

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.690
during World War
II, and that was it.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.490
But that was most
interesting to all of us.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:25.240
We wanted to know what happened.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.650
He wouldn't talk about that.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.080
So I thought history
was boring until I

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.320
started interviewing people
and hearing their stories.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.610
SARA BURNINGHAM: And the
history is in the small moments,

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:41.590
and in that story of Wendell
and his mother and sleeping

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.780
in a tent by the side of
the road as he is driven

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.510
to the Mayo Clinic
to be diagnosed,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:51.430
and then also in bigger
moments, and by sometimes bigger

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.980
personalities as well.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:54.995
ERIC MARCUS: Yes.

00:17:54.995 --> 00:17:59.320
How many of you have ever
heard of Sylvia Rivera?

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.050
How many of you have ever
heard Sylvia Rivera's voice?

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.760
I'd forgotten what
Sylvia sounded like.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.800
Sylvia is a trans icon.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.910
And in this clip, she
describes the most famous event

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.840
in US LGBT history, at least
famous for us in New York,

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.260
the Stonewall uprising.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.734
So have a listen to Sylvia.

00:18:19.734 --> 00:18:20.660
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.600
- To be there, you
know, was just like--

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.950
oh, it's so beautiful.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:26.780
I just like-- you know, it's--

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.620
- Was it exciting?

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:28.870
- Oh, it was so exciting!

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.000
It was like, wow,
we're doing it!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:32.830
We're doing it!

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.400
We're-- we're fucking nanners!

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.690
ERIC MARCUS: The thing that--

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.280
- --you know, straights--
they just panicked.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.480
Inspector Pine really panicked.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:44.980
- Mhm.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:45.770
- He really did.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:46.720
- Mhm.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.573
- Plus he had no back up.

00:18:48.573 --> 00:18:49.540
- Mhm.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:55.360
- He knew-- he did not expect
any of the retaliation that

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.570
the gay community gave
him at that point.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.800
- You think all this was
in part because people

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.720
were so angry for so long?

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.160
- People were very
angry for so long.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.431
I mean, how long can
you live in a closet?

00:19:12.431 --> 00:19:15.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.720
ERIC MARCUS: It's easy to forget
how young the street kids were

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.290
at the Stonewall uprising.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.820
That picture you're
seeing is Sylvia in 1970,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.650
taken by one of the
icons of the movement,

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:28.132
a woman named Kay
Tobin-Lahusen, whose photos

00:19:28.132 --> 00:19:30.090
will be featured at the
New York Public Library

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.340
for the 50th anniversary
of Stonewall.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.150
Sylvia was 17 at the
time of the riots.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:37.830
They were kids.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.290
Almost all kids, and Sylvia
was living on the street

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.010
from the age of 11.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.890
There was no place in the world
for gender nonconforming people

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:49.970
like Sylvia in the 1960s.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.510
SARA BURNINGHAM: And that
anger that she expressed

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.060
is something that, as I
listened through these tapes,

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.630
and hundreds and hundreds
of hours of interviews,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:03.080
is this theme that comes
back over and over,

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.440
is that the moments
of radicalization,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.140
the moment at which
enough is enough,

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.130
and the anger sparks action.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.100
ERIC MARCUS: So often I said to
people, you were so courageous,

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.360
and no one ever said,
I was courageous.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.330
They all said
either, I was angry,

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.690
or I was looking for a
boyfriend or a girlfriend.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.490
So it's either
about anger or love.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.780
That's what has propelled the
movement, and that was it.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.680
SARA BURNINGHAM: Mhm.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.360
ERIC MARCUS: But
radicalization was a key thing.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.360
So many people had terrible
things done to them.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.460
One of those people who had
terrible things done to them

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.920
was Joyce Hunter.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.710
Joyce had every
reason to be angry.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:54.710
She had a horrific
childhood, almost Dickensian.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.415
She was born-- in those
days we would call it

00:20:58.415 --> 00:21:00.500
an out-of-wedlock child.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.480
Her mother was orthodox
Jewish, 16-years-old,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.320
and her father was
African-American,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.930
one of many children, and
was sent off to an orphanage.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.180
SARA BURNINGHAM: One of eight.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.930
ERIC MARCUS: Yeah.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.100
SARA BURNINGHAM:
Grew up an orphanage

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.310
and then was returned to
the care of her parents,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.672
which was an abusive home.

00:21:17.672 --> 00:21:19.130
ERIC MARCUS: Yeah,
when she was 14.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.230
SARA BURNINGHAM: When
she was 14, in the Bronx,

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.050
taken away from the
only family she knew,

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.340
in a sense, which were the
other kids in the orphanage.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.269
ERIC MARCUS: And she went on
to do extraordinary things.

00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:32.810
But I'll tell you
about that after we

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:41.490
play this clip of Joyce talking
about what she wished for.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:42.310
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:45.040
- One of the things that the
movement did for me, it gave me

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.410
a vehicle to express my anger.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.270
- What were you angry about?

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.140
- Everything.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.520
That I had been denied my life,
that I had no adolescence,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.860
my childhood was robbed.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.140
I always say that when I
come back in the next life,

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.630
I want to come out
a two, and I want

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.170
to be able to enjoy
being who I am.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:06.109
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:07.900
ERIC MARCUS: She had
an extraordinary-- she

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.610
has had an extraordinary life.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:13.364
She is still alive,
she's 79-years-old--

00:22:13.364 --> 00:22:14.780
SARA BURNINGHAM:
She was with us--

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:17.140
with Eric on stage at the
Bell House in Brooklyn

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.002
on Saturday night.

00:22:19.002 --> 00:22:21.460
ERIC MARCUS: It was standing
room only audience for the Big

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:27.370
Queer Podfest, and she was
greeted like a rock star.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.210
Joyce went on to become--

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:32.560
she was one of the
first staff people

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.447
at what has become HMI, earlier
known as the Hetrick-Martin

00:22:35.447 --> 00:22:37.780
Institute, and before that
it was known as the Institute

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.613
for the Protection of
Lesbian and Gay Youth.

00:22:39.613 --> 00:22:41.950
SARA BURNINGHAM: She was
co-organizer of the 1979 march

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.160
on Washington.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.370
ERIC MARCUS: She was a
co-founder of Harvey Milk High

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.870
School.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.140
SARA BURNINGHAM: She also
is a PhD research scientist

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.300
in AIDS and HIV prevention.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.820
ERIC MARCUS: And she was a
New York City human rights

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.600
commissioner.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.650
SARA BURNINGHAM: Human
rights commissioner--

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:58.090
ERIC MARCUS: Who has
spoken before the UN

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.020
on multiple occasions.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.150
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah, she was
part of the working group that

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.900
set up the organization that
is now Outright International.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.640
ERIC MARCUS: Yep.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.473
SARA BURNINGHAM: I
actually can't keep track

00:23:06.473 --> 00:23:07.890
of all of Joyce's achievements.

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:11.800
ERIC MARCUS: And she's
just totally understated.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.250
SARA BURNINGHAM: But the night
that changed it all for her

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:18.910
was in Washington
Square-- it was actually

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.460
during the day,
Washington Square Park.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.862
when she was beaten up.

00:23:22.862 --> 00:23:24.820
ERIC MARCUS: She was
beaten up, so badly beaten

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.680
she spent a month
in the hospital.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.530
And she couldn't continue
to do the work she was doing

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.080
after that, because she
couldn't stand for long hours

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.730
and she had been a sous chef.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.400
So the occupational
therapy folks sent her off

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.884
for evaluation
and they said, you

00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:39.550
should go to college,
to which she said,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.230
I don't have a
high school degree.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.410
So she got her GED.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.144
She got her bachelor's degree.

00:23:44.144 --> 00:23:45.310
She got her master's degree.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.750
She got her PhD.

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.120
As she said to me when
I interviewed her,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.750
they felt they were going to
put me six feet underground,

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.050
and what they did is they
sent an activist on her way.

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.790
And they did, and she's fierce.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.402
You don't mess with Joyce.

00:24:01.402 --> 00:24:03.110
At the time of Stonewall,
she was married

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.080
and had two children.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.445
So she also had to extricate
herself from a marriage,

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.070
because after she
tried to kill herself

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:11.540
when she was in her teens,
the psychiatrist who she met

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.529
with at the psychiatric hospital
where she spent a year said,

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:16.070
if you get married
and have children,

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.190
you'll get over your feelings.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.250
You can imagine how
successful that was.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:22.070
She got married.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.778
She had children.

00:24:22.778 --> 00:24:24.880
She did not get over
her feelings for women.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.680
And she's now she's a
mother, grandmother,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.730
and a great-grandmother.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.910
And you can hear her whole
story at Making Gay History.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.750
It's one of my favorites
among favorites.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.790
So Perry Watkins--

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.210
Perry's problem
wasn't coming out.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.961
Perry was out.

00:24:42.961 --> 00:24:45.210
He was out from the time he
was a high school student.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.275
I won't tell you exactly how
everyone knew he was out, but--

00:24:51.275 --> 00:24:52.900
SARA BURNINGHAM:
Listen to the episode.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.566
ERIC MARCUS: Listen
to the episode, yes.

00:24:54.566 --> 00:24:56.747
This is for a general audience.

00:24:56.747 --> 00:24:58.580
The problem with Perry
was that the military

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.390
didn't want to know that he
was gay, even though they

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.309
knew he was gay.

00:25:02.309 --> 00:25:03.850
I'll play you the
clip, and then I'll

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.734
explain a little
more about Perry.

00:25:05.734 --> 00:25:06.400
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.860
- I was not trying to
go into the military.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.680
That's why I told them I was--
that's why I find it absolutely

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.782
ludicrous that the army
is in court saying,

00:25:14.782 --> 00:25:15.740
we don't want this man.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.780
Well, why the hell
did you take me?

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.400
- Right.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.260
- And why am I the
one that is being

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.430
accused of being at fault?

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.200
It is amazing.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.030
But no, I checked the block yes.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.190
They sent me into
a psychiatrist,

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.810
who said to me, why did
you check this box yes?

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.810
And I went, because you asked me
to fill out the form honestly.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:36.760
Well, do you object to
going in the military?

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.700
No.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.200
I didn't want to
go in the military.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.250
Who did?

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.200
- Right.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.760
- But I certainly
had no objection

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.780
to serving my country.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.640
- You were raised to be honest.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.810
- Extremely so.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.560
Why I really checked the
box was because I thought

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.700
if I go into the
military, I'm not

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.200
going to hide the
fact that I'm gay.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.330
I know myself well
enough to know that.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:05.450
So when I get thrown out,
Mom will be angry if I lie.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.027
That was why I checked the box.

00:26:08.027 --> 00:26:10.610
When I get put out of there, my
mom will be more angry with me

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.910
for lying than why didn't
I just tell the damn truth

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:17.030
to begin with?

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.420
[END PLAYBACK]

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.550
ERIC MARCUS: Perry served for 15
years before he was thrown out.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.942
And all along the way,
they knew that he was gay.

00:26:24.942 --> 00:26:26.400
What prompted them
to throw him out

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.680
was that they kept revoking his
security clearance every time

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.471
he was transferred.

00:26:29.471 --> 00:26:31.350
And the fourth time, he had it.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.200
And so he sued, and
then they threw him out

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.520
because he was gay, even
though they knew he was gay.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.500
He even performed overseas
in his alter ego character,

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.982
Simone, in drag.

00:26:44.982 --> 00:26:46.440
When Perry talked
to me about this,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.880
he said-- because
I asked him, why

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.796
did they take you, even
though you checked off

00:26:49.796 --> 00:26:51.450
the box that you were gay?

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.180
And he said that
he'd like to see

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.760
a study of all the black men
who had checked off homosexual

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.100
and were sent to Vietnam,
and all the white men who

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.840
were sent who
checked on homosexual

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.246
and were not sent to Vietnam.

00:27:03.246 --> 00:27:04.620
And his theory
was that they just

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.020
figured that a gay black man
would come back in a body bag.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.490
As subsequent
studies have shown,

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.560
black men were more
likely to be sent

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:17.765
into combat than white men.

00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:19.140
We don't have
statistics on that,

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.598
and we're hoping
a graduate student

00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:23.340
who listens to this
episode will research it.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.470
So Perry survived the military.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.810
And after a nine-year
court battle,

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.990
he was the first gay person to
be reinstated in the military.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.460
But he died of AIDS in
1996, just three years

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.380
after he served as
the Grand Marshal

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.679
in the New York
City pride march.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:41.220
I'm guessing that
no one in this room

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.640
has ever heard of Perry Watkins.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.180
Well, let's see a show of hands.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.290
How many people ever
heard of Perry Watkins?

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:46.020
Yeah.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:48.330
One of the joys for us
is bringing these stories

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.425
to life for people who
should be remembered,

00:27:50.425 --> 00:27:52.050
whose stories were
important, and would

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:53.789
have been forgotten otherwise.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.830
When I talked to Perry, I asked
him about being a trailblazer.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.320
And he said he did not
choose to be a trailblazer,

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.970
but he felt compelled
to be one because

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:10.165
of what was done to him.

00:28:10.165 --> 00:28:11.540
SARA BURNINGHAM:
Yeah, he said he

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.479
had no choice but to
stand up and fight.

00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:15.020
Just because it
was-- he said simply,

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.170
it was the right thing to do.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.630
But sometimes, standing
up and fighting sort of

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.715
comes in quite a lot
of different forms.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.590
Sometimes it's sitting
down and writing.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.020
ERIC MARCUS: Yes, and
this is Dear Abby.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.230
Some of you may know who she
is, a lot of you may not.

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.320
She was-- is there an
equivalent today of Dear Abby?

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.037
There isn't.

00:28:37.037 --> 00:28:38.870
This was a time when
people read newspapers,

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.710
and Dear Abby was the most
famous columnist in the world,

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.080
except for her twin
sister, Ann Landers,

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.715
who was also the most famous
advice giver in the world.

00:28:48.715 --> 00:28:50.840
When I was a kid, we would
get the papers on Sunday

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.298
when my grandparents
came to visit,

00:28:52.298 --> 00:28:55.430
and my grandmother always read
Dear Abby and Ann Landers.

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.620
And people wrote to them
about all kinds of things.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.560
When Dear Abby started writing
about gay people in the 1960s,

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:07.551
it was before gay
people were really

00:29:07.551 --> 00:29:09.300
able to stand up and
speak for themselves,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.674
and she was a
voice of authority.

00:29:10.674 --> 00:29:13.140
She was the first
national figure--

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:15.780
respected figure to come out
in support of gay people.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.400
She took a stand, and she
changed hearts and minds.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.840
I'm going to play a little
bit of a clip from her

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.580
about the reaction she got when
she wrote things in the paper

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.224
about gay people.

00:29:33.224 --> 00:29:34.080
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.245
- There was a column
that you wrote.

00:29:36.245 --> 00:29:37.620
This was the woman
who complained

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.036
about the new
neighbors next door,

00:29:39.036 --> 00:29:40.380
a strange man and the couple.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.650
- Well, the letter was,
this is a nice neighborhood,

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:47.500
and we're very disgusted
with these types.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.990
What can we do to
improve the neighborhood?

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.230
And my answer was
you could move.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.090
The gays thought
it was hilarious.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.520
But other than
just being amusing,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.000
entertaining, there was
a good message there.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:00.750
- Which was?

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.791
- Which was it was they
have a right to be there.

00:30:02.791 --> 00:30:04.800
If you don't like
it, you could move,

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.750
because they have as
much right to be them

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.002
as you have to be yourself.

00:30:08.002 --> 00:30:08.502
- Mhm.

00:30:11.184 --> 00:30:12.600
How much of an
impact do you think

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.250
you've had as one
person on this issue?

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.850
- I think I would--

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:20.010
well, I won't say first--

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.640
I was one of the first person
at the national level that

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.540
wasn't gay.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.680
I wasn't defending myself.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.045
I was defending everyone's
right to be themselves-- gay,

00:30:29.045 --> 00:30:30.237
straight, no matter.

00:30:30.237 --> 00:30:32.320
- And that was in the 19--
beginning of the 1950s.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.530
- It took-- people told
me it took a lot of guts.

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.602
But I was happy to have
a platform such as I had.

00:30:38.602 --> 00:30:39.910
[END PLAYBACK]

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.370
ERIC MARCUS: I just want you
to picture for a moment what

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:42.630
it was like to interview Abby.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.360
I grew up in a time
when Abby was as famous

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.970
as Ellen DeGeneres.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.920
And I pulled up to
her small mansion--

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.890
her mansion in
Beverly Hills, and--

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.060
double height doors,
French provincial--

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:04.200
or French Second Empire crossed
with God-knows-what Hollywood.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.830
And she answered the door.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.110
And she was dressed--
she's five feet tall,

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.780
dressed in lavender
hostess pajamas

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.080
and pink fluffy slippers.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.920
Does anyone wear
hostess pajamas anymore?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.180
SARA BURNINGHAM: No, when
I listened to the tape

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.764
and you told--

00:31:18.764 --> 00:31:20.888
[LAUGH] --when you just
started writing the scripts

00:31:20.888 --> 00:31:22.770
talked about the hostess
pajamas, I was like,

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.837
[GASP] that's a thing?

00:31:23.837 --> 00:31:24.337
[LAUGH]

00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:25.334
ERIC MARCUS: [LAUGH]

00:31:25.334 --> 00:31:27.500
SARA BURNINGHAM: Why didn't
I know about that thing?

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.500
That's the best thing!

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:30.710
Lavender hostess pajamas.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:32.760
And I'm picturing fluffy
mules, am I right?

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.260
Or not?

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.800
ERIC MARCUS: Yes, they were.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.050
But she insisted--
with Abby, I had

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.600
to send her the edited
interview and the introduction

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.320
for approval.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.180
And the only thing she cut
was the pink fluffy slippers.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.600
Abby got tons of hate
mail for the things

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.240
she said when she took
a stand for gay people

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.956
and also other issues
that she wrote about.

00:31:56.956 --> 00:31:58.650
But some of the
letters in response

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.630
to her comments about
gay people would

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.620
remind her to be a good
Christian woman, to which she

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.280
would respond, thanks, but I
hope I'm a good Jewish person.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.414
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLES]

00:32:09.414 --> 00:32:10.830
ERIC MARCUS: Now,
a sense of humor

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.210
was an essential tool that
activists called on, especially

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.360
in the years after the
Stonewall uprising.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.640
So from one national treasure,
Dear Abby, two people who

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.370
ought to be national
treasures, that

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.860
is, on the left,
Kay Tobin-Lahusen,

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.159
on the right Barbara Gittings.

00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:32.700
They are known to
some of us, anyway,

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.720
as the mothers of the movement.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.000
These happy warriors were so
inventive in their activism.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.660
They had enormous fun
fighting for their rights

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.822
and our rights.

00:32:43.822 --> 00:32:45.530
They were involved in
the movement from--

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:48.197
Barbara from the 1950s,
they met in the early '60s,

00:32:48.197 --> 00:32:49.530
and carried on through the '60s.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.840
There's a famous
photo of Barbara

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.530
in a protest march in 1965
in front of the White House.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.590
Kay is not in the photo because
she was behind the camera.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.770
You can see those photos
also on the website.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:05.480
So they had a lot of fun.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.979
SARA BURNINGHAM:
Yeah, their tapes--

00:33:06.979 --> 00:33:12.228
so Eric interviewed
Barbara and Kay in 1980--

00:33:12.228 --> 00:33:12.978
ERIC MARCUS: 1989.

00:33:12.978 --> 00:33:16.110
SARA BURNINGHAM: --1989, over
the course of two sessions.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.854
And so there's about eight
hours worth of interviews,

00:33:19.854 --> 00:33:22.020
but the thing that's just
really wonderful about it,

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.090
for me, listening to
it 30 years later,

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.444
is just the laughter that just
comes up over and over again.

00:33:27.444 --> 00:33:29.860
And also, the really, really
adorable thing with these two

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.070
is just the way in which they
finish each other sentences,

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.760
over.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.590
Which is a challenge
when editing audio,

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.960
[LAUGH] but really, really
just heartwarming to hear.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.838
ERIC MARCUS: So I'm
going to play a clip.

00:33:42.838 --> 00:33:44.296
Before I play the
clip, I just want

00:33:44.296 --> 00:33:46.102
to explain why they're
holding dinosaurs.

00:33:46.102 --> 00:33:48.060
They continued to be
involved with the movement

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.000
after Stonewall and went
to the first meetings

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.520
here in New York with
the Gay Liberation Front,

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.196
with a man named Frank
Kameny, also featured

00:33:56.196 --> 00:33:57.570
in one of our
episodes, who's one

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.910
of the most important people
in the early movement.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.950
And they were called
out for being dinosaurs

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:06.140
because they were in their 30s.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.590
And Kay went out and
bought these two dinosaurs,

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:12.370
which they carried with them
to every meeting thereafter.

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:17.250
So this clip is from 1971, the
American Library Association

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.090
convention in Dallas.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.590
Barbara loved books,
and beginning in 1970,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.980
created a reading list of
all the LGBTQ books that

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.110
were out there for the
American Library Association

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.276
for their annual convention.

00:34:29.276 --> 00:34:32.219
The first year, everything fit
on one side of an 8 and 1/2

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.170
by 11 sheet of paper.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.199
The second year, in
1971, all the books

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:41.850
fit on two sides of a
legal sized sheet of paper.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:44.130
But no one was paying attention
to their reading list.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.604
So they decided that--

00:34:46.604 --> 00:34:49.020
and also no one was going to
their booth or the conference

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.559
floor.

00:34:49.559 --> 00:34:51.600
So they decided they had
to do a little something

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.440
to get a bit more attention.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.710
So they decided to
transform their booth.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.870
And this is Barbara
and Kay talking

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.424
about how they improvised.

00:35:01.424 --> 00:35:02.090
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.840
- Well, we decided to bypass
books and show gay love live.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:09.120
So we called it
Hug a Homosexual.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.730
And we stripped it down
to the bare gray curtains,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.620
and we had a sign up,
"men only" at one end,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.750
and "women only" at the other.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.805
And we stationed ourselves--

00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:16.555
- Same sex kisses.

00:35:16.555 --> 00:35:19.530
- --all four of us under
the signs, to give--

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.320
free, mind you, free--
same sex kisses and hugs.

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.460
Well, let me tell you,
the aisles were jammed,

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.890
but nobody came into the booth.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:30.012
- And "Life" magazine was there.

00:35:30.012 --> 00:35:31.960
- "Life" magazine
photographer was there,

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.620
two Dallas television stations
had sent camera crews--

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.370
- Right, the lights
were going all around.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.490
- --and I say, people
were rather intimidated.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.570
Yes, the lights were
on, and all these people

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.710
jammed in the aisles, craning
their necks to see the action,

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.270
but nobody wanted to take part.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:46.330
So we did the action.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.780
We kissed and embraced
each other for two hours.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.804
We handed out copies
of the bibliography.

00:35:50.804 --> 00:35:51.970
We called out encouragement.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.720
We kissed and hugged
each other some more.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.550
Alma Routsong was
an absolute peach.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.110
She and I were on
the female end,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.651
and a couple of the
men on the other,

00:35:59.651 --> 00:36:02.490
and we did all this ourselves.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.852
That really put us on the map.

00:36:03.852 --> 00:36:05.560
- So there we were on
the 6 o'clock news,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.320
and the library
people were livid.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.246
They said we have all
these famous authors here,

00:36:10.246 --> 00:36:12.519
and all they cover
is this kissing!

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:13.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.080
- They put us on
the 6 o'clock news,

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.016
they put us again on
the 11 o'clock news,

00:36:18.016 --> 00:36:19.140
and again the next morning.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.480
This was news!

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:21.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.435
- This made the local news.

00:36:23.435 --> 00:36:24.405
- Yes!

00:36:24.405 --> 00:36:25.360
- In Denver?

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:25.860
- Dallas!

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.460
- Dallas!

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.660
- Dallas!

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.460
It was wonderful.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.660
And really, our spirits
soared, because we--

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.840
really, the booth
also had a message

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.270
that was useful in
any arena, and that

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.670
is that gay people are
not willing anymore

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.750
to be subject to a
special double standard.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.830
We should have the same right to
express our affection publicly

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.300
as heterosexuals have.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.726
No more, but no less.

00:36:52.726 --> 00:36:53.955
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:53.955 --> 00:36:55.580
ERIC MARCUS: Barbara
knew how to smile,

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:59.270
and she knew how to wield
that smile like a sword.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:04.957
We just spent some time with
Kay Lahusen in the retirement

00:37:04.957 --> 00:37:06.040
community where she lives.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.890
Kay is now 88.

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:09.319
Barbara died in 2000--

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:10.235
SARA BURNINGHAM: 2007.

00:37:10.235 --> 00:37:10.985
ERIC MARCUS: 2007.

00:37:10.985 --> 00:37:12.180
Yes, a long time ago.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.712
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:13.712 --> 00:37:15.920
ERIC MARCUS: When we went
to interview Kay last year,

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.980
she let drop that she hosts
a gay table at her retirement

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.110
community once a month.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.624
So what did we have to do?

00:37:22.624 --> 00:37:23.540
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.420
We invited ourselves.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.220
ERIC MARCUS: So--

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.636
SARA BURNINGHAM:
If you subscribed

00:37:29.636 --> 00:37:32.590
to Making Gay History, you
will be hearing that dinner

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.752
that Eric went to--

00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:34.460
ERIC MARCUS: Yes.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.751
SARA BURNINGHAM: --on Thursday.

00:37:35.751 --> 00:37:38.609
It's a little special extra
bonus episode for Pride.

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:40.650
ERIC MARCUS: There were
eight of us at the table,

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.600
and it was an astonishing
evening of hearing stories

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.700
about people's lives.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.720
And Kay, even though she's had
a stroke, is in a wheelchair,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.460
you still don't cross her.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.460
SARA BURNINGHAM: [LAUGH]

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.370
ERIC MARCUS: She rules the
roost and sets an example

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:59.210
for other elders
about how we should be

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.140
treated throughout our lives.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.057
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah.

00:38:02.057 --> 00:38:04.515
ERIC MARCUS: So so far we've
heard some of the big stories,

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.980
some of the small stories,
some of the public history,

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.590
and some of the personal
struggles that were the steps

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:14.806
of the path toward
LGBTQ+ civil rights.

00:38:14.806 --> 00:38:17.180
One of the most significant
players in the post Stonewall

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.580
period is Vito Russo.

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.620
How many of you have
ever heard of Vito Russo?

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.900
Vito famously wrote a book
called "The Celluloid Closet."

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.090
It was published in '81.

00:38:30.669 --> 00:38:32.960
It's about how gay people
were portrayed in the movies.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.560
He was a movie
archivist and expert,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.880
and his theory was that the
public's image of gay people

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.380
is shaped by what they
see in the movies.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.650
And reading his book, I
was stunned by how true

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.350
that seemed.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:50.150
I found his book on a
shelf at Harper and Row

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.600
when I was a temp there in 1981.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.360
I was out, but
not so comfortable

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.640
that I decided to
wait until lunch hour

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.140
when everybody was
out of the office

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:03.390
to go into the
editor's office, where

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.634
I had noticed Vito's book, to
pull the book off the shelf.

00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:08.550
And then seven years
later, I was commissioned

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.850
to write "Making History," what
became "Making Gay History,"

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:14.390
which I always find striking.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.690
Vito is one of those
people who inspired me,

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:20.630
but we'll get to that after
we listen to his clip.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.150
Now, he was one of the first
interviews I did for the book

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:26.317
in 1988, because it was
a race against time.

00:39:26.317 --> 00:39:28.400
Many of the activists I
interviewed were very old,

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.550
and many of the men had AIDS.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.890
And I knew Vito's
time was short.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.530
Vito was famous not
just for his book,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.470
but also he was one of
the co-founders of GLAAD.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:40.790
He was a co-founder of ACT UP.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.430
He was also very involved in
the Gay Activist Alliance,

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.140
which was one of the
first groups that

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:48.790
formed in New York right
after the Stonewall uprising.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:55.540
He was already sick at the time
I interviewed him and did not

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.430
look well when I spoke with him.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.920
He had cared for his
partner, who had died,

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.999
and he didn't know
how long he had.

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.790
What he knew was that
he wanted to survive.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.790
He wanted to survive AIDS,
in part, as he told me,

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.610
so he could be around to kick
people's asses for failing

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.110
to deal with the crisis.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.750
But he was also thinking
about his place in history,

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.110
and that's the clip
we'll play for you.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:22.910
How Vito thought about
what he had done and how

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:24.730
he might be remembered.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:25.650
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:27.770
- I find it
interesting, from what

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.779
I know about the history
of the gay movement,

00:40:31.779 --> 00:40:33.820
that there always have
been and there will always

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.040
be people who are willing
to put their lives

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.650
on the line for these ideas.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:42.370
Starting from Germany, in
the turn of the century,

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.930
in 1895, and then into
the early teens and '20s.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.060
There were a group of
people in Germany, headed

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.735
by Magnus Hirschfeld,
who were willing to put

00:40:51.735 --> 00:40:53.110
their lives on
the line, and they

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:54.580
were willing to
make a movie called

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.996
"Different From
the Others," which

00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:58.120
the Nazis seized and burned.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.420
Then in the 1940s
and 1950s, there

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.380
were the Harry Hays, and
the Barbara Gittings,

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:03.850
and the Mattachine Society.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:05.970
And then in the
'60s, gay liberation.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:08.530
It's the more
radical issues that I

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:11.070
think are still going
to be fought over,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.587
whether gay people have a
right to adopt children--

00:41:13.587 --> 00:41:14.170
- Get married.

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.670
- --get married, teach
in the public schools,

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.430
which they do now, you
know, but be open about it.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.930
- Right.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:21.429
- And those battles
are battles that

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:23.812
are going to be fought long
after you and I are gone.

00:41:23.812 --> 00:41:25.270
But you have to
make a contribution

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.930
while you're here--

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.346
I mean, that's
been my whole life,

00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:29.750
is to leave my book behind.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.360
That I know after
I'm dead, that book

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.860
is going to be on
a shelf someplace,

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:35.050
and what I have to
say will reach people.

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.790
And the things I've written--

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.860
you know, because it's like--

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.810
who was the person
who said that?

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:42.160
Pedro Almodovar.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:49.210
He said the thing is, you can't
regret your life, otherwise

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.800
why did you live?

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.680
What was the point of
having a life if you didn't

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.750
say something or do
something that was going

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.417
to survive after you're gone?

00:41:58.417 --> 00:42:00.250
And that's the way I
actually feel about it.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:02.170
I really feel the
reason why I'm here

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.260
is so that I could leave
this book and these articles

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.450
so that some
16-year-old kid who's

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.510
going to be a gay activist
in the next 10 or 15 years

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.520
is going to read them and
carry the ball from there.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.620
And that'll happen.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.590
Happened with me.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.090
- Mhm.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.290
- Harry Hay passed the
ball to the Mattachine,

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.290
and they passed the ball to us.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.290
- And you'll pass it on.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.282
- Mhm.

00:42:23.282 --> 00:42:24.780
[END PLAYBACK]

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.630
ERIC MARCUS: I like to
think that Vito passed

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.780
the ball to me, in
sharing his story with me,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.460
and through "Making
Gay History."

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.921
It's not a book, but
it is an anthology.

00:42:35.921 --> 00:42:38.170
You don't take it off a
shelf, but you put ear buds in

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.990
and you listen to the stories.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.800
And I like to think that Vito
will inspire future generations

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:48.910
to resist, to fight back,
to fight for their rights.

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:51.720
And I like to think that
by sharing these stories,

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.830
Sara and I have the opportunity
to pass the ball to all of you,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.665
to carry it forward.

00:42:58.665 --> 00:43:00.540
SARA BURNINGHAM: There's
nothing like hearing

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:03.740
folks speak for themselves.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.326
And now, having--
we're at what, 2.7--

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.610
sorry, 1.7 million downloads.

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.814
ERIC MARCUS: 1.75
million downloads.

00:43:13.814 --> 00:43:15.230
SARA BURNINGHAM:
[LAUGH] Downloads

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.964
in 206 nations and
territories around the world.

00:43:18.964 --> 00:43:20.880
We had to add the nations
and territory thing,

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.220
so we were really excited
to see the number 206.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.380
And we went to do a
presentation somewhere,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.750
some international
nonprofit, and we

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.402
said just as we were
about to start it,

00:43:29.402 --> 00:43:30.610
I was going through my notes.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.080
And as we said, 206
countries, and I was like,

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.674
oops, wait, are
there 206 countries?

00:43:36.674 --> 00:43:41.220
[LAUGH] And so, yes--

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:45.380
as many places-- as countries
that compete in the Olympics.

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.464
That's where we are.

00:43:47.464 --> 00:43:49.130
ERIC MARCUS: So Vito
was the final clip,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.821
and we'd love to take questions.

00:43:50.821 --> 00:43:52.320
If you have questions,
you just need

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.778
to step up to the
microphone that's

00:43:53.778 --> 00:43:56.460
on either side of the room
and ask your questions.

00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.090
I also have a couple
of incredible letters

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.590
we've had from
people, which I would

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:03.480
be happy to read if
there are no questions,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.840
but also very happy to
take your questions.

00:44:10.744 --> 00:44:13.131
Sure.

00:44:13.131 --> 00:44:13.672
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:13.672 --> 00:44:14.463
Thank you for this.

00:44:14.463 --> 00:44:15.140
This is lovely.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.510
I have a question about
5, 10, 15 years from now.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:23.830
The way that this type of
material is saved today

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.620
is oftentimes via
YouTube, or it's

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.740
some other sort of social media
or technology enabled platform.

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:33.430
And so how is that going to make
the job of the next person who

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.317
has to do this and make "Making
Gay History," like, 5.0?

00:44:37.317 --> 00:44:39.400
How are they going to work
with all that material?

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.070
It's almost like it's
too much, but it's

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.500
good there's so much of
it to sort of dissect

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.370
or to look through.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:46.204
See what I'm saying?

00:44:46.204 --> 00:44:47.453
ERIC MARCUS: It's a challenge.

00:44:47.453 --> 00:44:49.420
I generally encourage,
when I travel and people

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.540
ask about recording stories of
people in their communities,

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.340
I recommend that
they, again, use

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.670
the best equipment possible,
and then store their files

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:58.254
carefully.

00:44:58.254 --> 00:45:00.170
But you're right, the
platforms keep changing.

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:02.920
So when I first donated my
archive to the New York Public

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.530
Library, they were
going to transfer

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:08.290
all of the cassette tapes to--

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:12.310
I think it was 24-karat
gold-plated CD-rom.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:15.930
They took so long in raising
the money for the transfer

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.960
that by the time they did the
transfer, it was MP3 files.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.817
And MP3 files are no
longer used, are they?

00:45:22.817 --> 00:45:25.150
SARA BURNINGHAM: There's some
changing in the protocols,

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.700
I think.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.074
I mean, you guys will
know better than we do.

00:45:28.074 --> 00:45:30.490
ERIC MARCUS: So the challenge
for even the New York Public

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.590
Library, which is where
my archive resides,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.240
is to keep updating the platform
on which these things are

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.200
stored.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.700
I have absolutely no answers.

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:43.510
I do know that we backup
everything three, four times,

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.490
so that we have
multiple places for it.

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:48.610
And the podcast itself will be
transferred to New York Public

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:52.640
Library for them to store, and
they'll have to worry about it.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.950
But it is a concern.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.033
SARA BURNINGHAM: But also
in terms of the breadth,

00:45:56.033 --> 00:45:58.660
just the sort of the breadth,
the sheer number of stories,

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.930
I think that's also
so much of this I

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.640
think is a sort of map analogy.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.580
That when Eric said about
writing "Making History"

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:11.800
and tried to map
out who you were

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.340
going to speak to, this was
a time where, as he said,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.170
he couldn't, like, go to
Google or any of those things.

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:23.059
So you went through each
issue at "The Advocate"?

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:25.600
ERIC MARCUS: From 1968, every
single issue of "The Advocate,"

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.300
to build a timeline.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.370
There were no timelines.

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:29.440
SARA BURNINGHAM: And
trying to find what

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:32.679
was the real name behind
the pseudonyms of people.

00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:34.720
And in fact, someone who
we recently interviewed,

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.260
one of the guests
at Kay's gay table

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.830
said, that back in
those days, there

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.330
were only 12 people
in the movement,

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.390
and the rest was done
with mirrors, anyway.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.390
So I think that one of the
great things is the scale

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:54.880
and the number of stories
to be told now is great.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.310
If there are that many people
from whom you can hear,

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:58.730
that is really fantastic.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:02.980
And then it's about
finding the piece

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:07.627
of the puzzle that speaks to
you and telling those stories.

00:47:07.627 --> 00:47:10.210
ERIC MARCUS: Well, the challenge
is there is so much material.

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:13.160
No one wants to listen
to the eight hours

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.400
we have of Barbara
Gittings and Kay Lahusen.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.410
There are scholars
who will want to.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.050
But what the podcast offers is
something that's digestible.

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:21.652
You get a taste.

00:47:21.652 --> 00:47:23.860
I was talking to a young
man on Saturday night, who's

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.290
just graduated from
Wash U. in St. Louis,

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:29.311
and he said a friend gave him
the book "Making Gay History."

00:47:29.311 --> 00:47:31.060
And he said I just
don't have the patience

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.726
to read a whole book, but then I
discovered there was a podcast.

00:47:33.726 --> 00:47:35.650
And so it was like
the magic words.

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.150
Most people didn't
have the patience

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:38.950
to read a 550-page book.

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.280
I barely had the
patience to write one,

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.070
but I was being paid to do it.

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.370
But just as an aside about
the title of the book,

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:47.242
the original title
was "Making History."

00:47:47.242 --> 00:47:49.450
And the reason it was called
"Making History" and not

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:50.890
"Making Gay History"
the first time around

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:52.432
was because the
publisher was worried

00:47:52.432 --> 00:47:54.348
that the salesforce would
have trouble selling

00:47:54.348 --> 00:47:57.070
a book with "gay" in the title,
and that bookstores would not

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.222
shelve the book face out if the
word "gay" were in the title.

00:48:00.222 --> 00:48:01.930
For the second edition,
10 years later, I

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.030
suggested we put the
word "gay" in the title,

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:05.140
and no one objected.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.140
So it's called
"Making Gay History."

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.530
And that's how we came up
with the title of the podcast.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:12.682
Other questions?

00:48:12.682 --> 00:48:14.140
SPEAKER: We have
time for one more.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.080
ERIC MARCUS: One more question.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:17.660
Yes, Becca?

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.520
And then I want
to read one letter

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.530
from one of our listeners.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.690
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:25.350
I'm just curious
if there's anyone

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:29.039
that you wanted to interview
that you didn't have a chance

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:29.580
to talk with.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.147
ERIC MARCUS: Yes, two people.

00:48:31.147 --> 00:48:33.480
Let's just see-- there are
so many people I wish I'd had

00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.490
the chance to talk to
but two in particular--

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:38.910
Bayard Rustin and
Leonard Bernstein.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:40.647
Bayard Rustin played
an important role--

00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:42.480
we don't have time to
talk about that here--

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.670
but was not recognized
as a gay person

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:48.870
at the time he was involved in
planning the 1963 civil rights

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.840
march on Washington.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.230
And Leonard Bernstein I
almost got to interview.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.005
Leonard Bernstein was
famously closeted.

00:48:57.005 --> 00:48:58.380
One of my friends
worked for him.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:48:59.838
Initially he said,
no, and then she

00:48:59.838 --> 00:49:03.360
called me very late
in my work and said,

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.140
he's thinking he'll do it.

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.150
And then two weeks
later, he died.

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.180
And he was going to
come out in the book,

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.520
which would have been nice
for me, but he didn't.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.420
So I just wanted to read
one story of someone who

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.850
was inspired by the podcast.

00:49:17.850 --> 00:49:21.410
And I hope that many people
are inspired to take action.

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:23.160
We've heard from quite
a few people who've

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.954
talked about changing
their majors,

00:49:24.954 --> 00:49:27.120
getting involved in things,
because the people whose

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.680
stories they've
heard in the podcast

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.010
provide a roadmap for how
they can change the world.

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:34.226
Most of the people who are
featured in the podcast

00:49:34.226 --> 00:49:35.850
changed the world at
a time when no one

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.000
believed it was possible.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.010
SARA BURNINGHAM:
And actually, this

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.230
opened up a really lovely
intergenerational two-way

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:41.100
street.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.600
Because a lot of
the emails that we

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:46.290
get, people address
to Kay Lahusen,

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:49.470
because one of her things
is whenever Eric calls her,

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:51.692
she says to him, what
have you got for me, Eric?

00:49:51.692 --> 00:49:54.233
ERIC MARCUS: [LAUGH] Yes, the
latest news, what have you got?

00:49:54.233 --> 00:49:55.691
SARA BURNINGHAM:
[LAUGH] And so now

00:49:55.691 --> 00:49:58.560
people write into "Making Gay
History" with what they've

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.890
got for Kay.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:01.210
ERIC MARCUS: Yeah.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.670
This is not one of them.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.290
"Hi there, I grew
up in what would now

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.320
be described as an alt-right
military family in Texas.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.790
Coming out for the
first time at 16

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:11.804
was one of the hardest
experiences of my life.

00:50:11.804 --> 00:50:13.720
My father wanted to kick
me out, but my mother

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.669
wanted me to stay and go
through conversion therapy.

00:50:16.669 --> 00:50:19.210
Through a lot of strife and hard
work, I was able to get out,

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:23.290
and now I am a 25-year-old
engineer working in Manhattan.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.660
Growing up, I clung to
whatever stories of gay history

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.670
I could learn, just for
the sake of remembering

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.670
that there was more to
this community experience

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:30.950
than my own.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.610
I really related to Morris
Kight's sentiment that he never

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:37.000
doubted that he was
inferior, no matter--

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.307
he never doubted that
he was not inferior,"

00:50:39.307 --> 00:50:40.390
I think is what he meant--

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.750
SARA BURNINGHAM: Yeah.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:43.166
ERIC MARCUS: "--no matter how
much he was told and treated

00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:43.700
so.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.520
One thing that's really
struck me listening

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:48.580
to these interviews is how
grassroots-based so many

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.400
of these societies and
organizations originally were.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:54.490
It has inspired me to create
an organization of my own.

00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:56.950
I'm now working with a small
group of other gay engineers

00:50:56.950 --> 00:51:00.250
from various firms to create
a society for gay engineers

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.200
to meet and for
professional education

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.140
on the experiences of queer
people within my industry.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:08.170
It's very early now and
just getting started,

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.520
but hearing about these
societies in the 1950s,

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.090
'60s, and '70s with no
resources and based out

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:15.250
of someone's living room
is really motivating

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.660
me to keep it moving.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.690
It makes me feel like we're part
of a tradition of queer people,

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.510
recognizing a deficit in how
we're treated in society,

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.975
and just starting where we
can and doing whatever we can.

00:51:25.975 --> 00:51:27.850
Thank you so much for
producing this podcast.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:31.600
It warms my soul and reminds
me of the continuity of us.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.540
Queer people as a community have
continually survived the worst

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.200
and looked out for our own.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.395
And as a man without a real
family to fall back on,

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:41.320
it gives me pride in the
strength of my chosen family.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.570
With peace and
blessings and thanks."

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.650
That came to us on
December 13, 2017.

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:53.530
So thank you so much, Becca
Gulata, for arranging today.

00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:56.297
Thank you, Google, thank
you all for attending,

00:51:56.297 --> 00:51:58.255
thank you, Sara, for
sharing the stage with me.

00:51:58.255 --> 00:52:01.422
SARA BURNINGHAM: Thanks,
Eric, for everything you did.

00:52:01.422 --> 00:52:02.380
ERIC MARCUS: Thank you.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.880
