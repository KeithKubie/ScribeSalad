1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,150
Oh, superhero movies are kind of
fundamentally ridiculous and silly.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,910
I love comics. I grew up on
him and stuff, but they never,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,630
they never take physics into account
or it's always like you get hit with a

4
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:13,560
gamma ray, you get powers,
right. It's like, why would
it choose to give you powers?

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,010
It would just melt you. Like, that's
not how forces in the universe work.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,350
They don't, you know, generally
speaking, mystically, you know, no,

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,300
never gets enhanced in real life
by like nuclear radiation. No,

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,810
I don't think that's ever,
ever happened at the boat.

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,610
The best theory would
probably be like Godzilla.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,010
Like some monster was born of it
that came out of the ocean. Well,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,290
there was a time where vice
went to Chernobyl and uh,

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,780
this was back when vice was really vice,

13
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:42,990
when Shane Smith was going all these
journeys and shit. That was what was nuts.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,830
Yeah. Before vices, sort of vice. I
mean, vice still does some great stuff,

15
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:51,460
but vices just as huge
multimedia corporation now. Yeah.

16
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,370
And back then, uh, Shane
went to Chernobyl and, uh,

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,460
they were hunting like these
radioactive wolves. Oh my God.

18
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,540
Radioactive Wolves and Chernobyl and
like, you know, there are mutating,

19
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,770
there's fish in the water that are
enormous and they're fucking weird. Yeah.

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,730
And you can never eat them.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,030
They're like the fuel efficient or the
plant in a sentence like with three eyes.

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,700
Right, exactly. Yeah. But it's real.

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,540
Like they really do have these animals
that live in this highly radiated area

24
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:19,920
and they've managed to survive.

25
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,360
I just guy mean that the,

26
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:25,950
the level of the levels that we,

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,160
that we have taken to get an energy
and affected our environment. We,

28
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,530
you ever dropped San Diego,

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,520
you know that ride me drive down and you
look to the right hand side. Oh look.

30
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,790
Nuclear power plant. Right. I could
throw a rock and hit it from the highway.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,900
Like what in the fuck is that doing
there? Yeah. So close to the water.

32
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,860
Well, I think it needs to be close
to the water for cooling. Oh yeah.

33
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:50,540
That's how they cool the reactor core.
Okay. I think notice how I say that,

34
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,350
like I know what I'm talking about.
That makes sense. Yeah. There's a,

35
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,160
there's a nuclear physicist right now.
Nope. Well, that was the Fukushima thing,

36
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,830
you know, that's, that's what's
happening over there. Yeah.

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,500
They still don't have that thing
under wraps. Well and that,

38
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:05,820
that volunteer army of, of Japanese
people older than 70 that were like,

39
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,550
I don't have long. I'll go work
there. I'll go clean it up.

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,940
They're all going back in time.
They're all 39 you go there.

41
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,280
It's like a Stephen King movie.
Amazing. I knew twilight's years old.

42
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:16,470
They don't want to tell anybody
the commission. I didn't know that.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,570
What got done one on the way to San Diego.
Yeah.

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,290
Probably broke how everybody
around it's dead. Yeah.

45
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,400
Cause everyone was throwing
rocks. So Joe Washes. Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:27,330
But maybe they woke up and like
1980 and they go, hey guys,

47
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,420
maybe this isn't a good place for
a fucking nuclear power plants.

48
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,370
Steam generators failed in 2013 Jesus,
the steam generators.

49
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,290
There it goes. There it is the fuck
out of here with that. It's sober.

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,540
Meanwhile that's still there. Like the
core is still there. They can't move it.

51
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,780
It's currently in preparation
to be decommissioned. Jeez.

52
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,860
A however long that takes. Even
Jay's even that means, man,

53
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,960
go fishing around that fucking thing.
Good luck.

54
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,780
You'll catch a big fish though that
no weird. They'll have human hands.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,690
I'll talk to you. Don't, what?
Would they talk with thoughts?

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,220
Yeah, right. They just stare at you
and I enter your mind. Fukushima,

57
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,990
they were doing something where they dug
this giant swimming pool and all around

58
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:15,190
this giant swimming pool they dug,
they put like ice cores.

59
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
They put like some sort of cooling element
so they could freeze all the nuclear

60
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,670
waste to an insanely cold
temperature. Wow. It didn't work.

61
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,780
This is like a strategy that they were
developing, but apparently it fell apart.

62
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,760
I don't know what the fuck
to do. It's just you just
don't, you can't do anything.

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,590
I mean, I like, they gotta do something.

64
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,620
We've got to keep trying to shoot
it in a space. I don't know.

65
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,900
The aliens are going to get mad at us.
