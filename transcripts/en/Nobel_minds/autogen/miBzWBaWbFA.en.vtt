come up with reasonable solutions to
 

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:08.129

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300
the ABS functional and so it was always
 

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.330
the ABS functional and so it was always
we were always at always talking about

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:43.340
we were always at always talking about
 

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:48.110
we were always at always talking about
current power and perth voltage and

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120
current power and perth voltage and
 

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.200
current power and perth voltage and
things like you know we had that

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.210
things like you know we had that
 

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.090
things like you know we had that
transformers and all that because this

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.100
transformers and all that because this
 

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.530
transformers and all that because this
is what he was doing and I was in a way

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540
is what he was doing and I was in a way
 

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.170
is what he was doing and I was in a way
and I was always explaining to me how

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180
and I was always explaining to me how
 

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.460
and I was always explaining to me how
they were working with my dad playing

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:04.470
they were working with my dad playing
 

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.100
they were working with my dad playing
chess and doing

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:07.110
chess and doing
 

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:18.930
chess and doing
I mean learning about physics yes

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:18.940
 

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.860
yeah you know I mean working with

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:20.870
yeah you know I mean working with
 

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.620
yeah you know I mean working with
graduate student is like with your

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:23.630
graduate student is like with your
 

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.960
graduate student is like with your
family being with reading your family I

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:25.970
family being with reading your family I
 

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.120
family being with reading your family I
mean that's the way I always traded my

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.130
mean that's the way I always traded my
 

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.880
mean that's the way I always traded my
students we with Tara labs together with

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:33.890
students we with Tara labs together with
 

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.660
students we with Tara labs together with
discussing we you know we can switch

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:37.670
discussing we you know we can switch
 

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.690
discussing we you know we can switch
spend together and so on I mean always

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:40.700
spend together and so on I mean always
 

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.190
spend together and so on I mean always
thinking about what we want to achieve

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.200
thinking about what we want to achieve
 

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.300
thinking about what we want to achieve
and and that planes bring the students

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:49.310
and and that planes bring the students
 

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:57.180
and and that planes bring the students
and the faculty together you know then

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:57.190
and the faculty together you know then
 

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.160
and the faculty together you know then
we are aging you know the faculty is

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:00.170
we are aging you know the faculty is
 

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.910
we are aging you know the faculty is
aging but we were nude you know students

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920
aging but we were nude you know students
 

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.970
aging but we were nude you know students
are nude and so we always close to the

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:06.980
are nude and so we always close to the
 

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.030
are nude and so we always close to the
very very young student and I'm very

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.310
time we could you could see things
moving in this time scales and of course

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320
moving in this time scales and of course
 

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.960
moving in this time scales and of course
we are not moving in this time scale but

extremely fascinating then came the

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:09.610
extremely fascinating then came the
 

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:14.370
extremely fascinating then came the
second applications and the second

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:14.380
second applications and the second
 

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.950
second applications and the second
application is if you are producing this

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:16.960
application is if you are producing this
 

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.160

very very short pulses then you can

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:20.170
very very short pulses then you can
 

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.130
very very short pulses then you can
produce if you are smart you can produce

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:23.140
produce if you are smart you can produce

problem with Donna is fact because the

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000
problem with Donna is fact because the
 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.840
problem with Donna is fact because the
power but you because the pauses are

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:36.850
power but you because the pauses are
 

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.600
power but you because the pauses are
short so power what we are trying to get

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:39.610
short so power what we are trying to get
 

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.060
short so power what we are trying to get
can be very high but

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.070
can be very high but
 

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:44.610
can be very high but
at one point you are breaking down the

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:44.620
at one point you are breaking down the
 

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.009
at one point you are breaking down the
laser because the power the peak power

00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:47.019
laser because the power the peak power
 

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:51.930
laser because the power the peak power
is too high and that's of a clamp clamp

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:51.940
is too high and that's of a clamp clamp
 

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.889
is too high and that's of a clamp clamp
down the laser power but we can produce

00:16:55.889 --> 00:16:55.899
down the laser power but we can produce
 

00:16:55.899 --> 00:16:58.470
down the laser power but we can produce
and it's where we come came up with

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480
and it's where we come came up with
 

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.370
and it's where we come came up with
Donna with this idea of CPA which it

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:02.380
Donna with this idea of CPA which it
 

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.789

chirp pause amplification which could
circumvent these problems of the laser

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640
circumvent these problems of the laser
 

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.169
circumvent these problems of the laser

Nobel prizes was awarded you know

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.150
Nobel prizes was awarded you know
 

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.650
Nobel prizes was awarded you know
because of my work with laser with very

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:31.660
because of my work with laser with very
 

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.130
because of my work with laser with very
very short tours laser and why do you

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:35.140
very short tours laser and why do you
 

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.890
very short tours laser and why do you
what why do you want to appear in like

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:37.900
what why do you want to appear in like
 

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.919
what why do you want to appear in like
very short pulse lasers is because these

00:17:40.919 --> 00:17:40.929
very short pulse lasers is because these
 

00:17:40.929 --> 00:17:43.350
very short pulse lasers is because these
pulses will be also important for

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360
pulses will be also important for
 

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.630
pulses will be also important for
communications very important for

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640
communications very important for
 

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.100
communications very important for
telecom for communication in general

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.110
telecom for communication in general
 

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.610
telecom for communication in general
very important also in a medical world

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:50.620
very important also in a medical world
 

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.390
very important also in a medical world
very important for many of disciplines

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400
very important for many of disciplines
 

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.700
very important for many of disciplines
and because because with these very

00:17:59.700 --> 00:17:59.710
and because because with these very
 

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.240
and because because with these very
short pulses you would be able really to

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.250
short pulses you would be able really to
 

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.409
short pulses you would be able really to
to observe or to track down you know

00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:06.419
to observe or to track down you know
 

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:11.789

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.100
gives you the ability to produce over
 

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.169
gives you the ability to produce over
very short times extremely high peak

00:18:31.169 --> 00:18:31.179
very short times extremely high peak
 

00:18:31.179 --> 00:18:35.340
very short times extremely high peak
power so we can use that for nuclear

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:35.350
power so we can use that for nuclear
 

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.669
power so we can use that for nuclear
physics and maybe also try to understand

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679
physics and maybe also try to understand
 

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:42.530
physics and maybe also try to understand
events which are happening in the cosmos

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:42.540
events which are happening in the cosmos
 

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.100
events which are happening in the cosmos
because you can reproduce the highest

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.110
because you can reproduce the highest
 

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.710
because you can reproduce the highest
temperature so highest pressure so

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720
temperature so highest pressure so
 

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.370
temperature so highest pressure so
highest field so highest

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:53.380
highest field so highest
 

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.000
highest field so highest
garetty so you can you can release with

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.010
garetty so you can you can release with
 

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.820
garetty so you can you can release with
simulate and bring back into the lab

00:18:59.820 --> 00:18:59.830
simulate and bring back into the lab
 

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.760
simulate and bring back into the lab
what is happening in the cosmos and in

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:02.770
what is happening in the cosmos and in
 

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.890
what is happening in the cosmos and in
life you know

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:04.900
life you know
 

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:11.460
life you know
