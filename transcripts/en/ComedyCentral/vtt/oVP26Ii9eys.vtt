00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.305
PINKERTON GOES TO HIM, AND SAYS,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.074
WE GOT TO GET YOU THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.377
A DAY BEFORE THEY'RE
GONNA KILL YOU, SO--

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:12.713
HE TOOK OFF HIS LITTLE
POP-TART HAT,

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:13.981
OR WHATEVER THAT WAS.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.382
UH, WHAT WAS IT CALLED?

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:18.385
A POP--POPEYE, POPEYE--

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.853
IT WAS A CALLED A...

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.189
HIS HAT, IT WAS A STOVEPIPE.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.358
LINCOLN SAYS, SORRY, STOVEPIPE.

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.961
I GOT TO BE INCOGNITO.
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.763
THEY SNEAK HIM OUT TO THE TRAIN.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.366
PEOPLE CAN SEE HIM,
BUT THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S HIM,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.302
BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A BEANIE
AND A SHAWL.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:36.904
KATE WARNE IS LIKE,

00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:41.241
I NEED TO GET MY INVALID BROTHER
INTO THE TRAIN.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:43.143
THEY GET ON THE TRAIN.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.379
"ZU-DI-DI-DOO, DI-DI-DOO."

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.983
LINCOLN IS ON A TRAIN INTO D.C.
TO BECOME THE PRESIDENT.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.519
SO PINKERTON HAD TO GET LINCOLN

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.789
THROUGH BALTIMORE EARLY
TO GET TO D.C.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:56.990
WITHOUT BEING KILLED,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.260
BECAUSE THERE ARE ASSASSINS
IN BALTIMORE

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.330
WAITING FOR LINCOLN TO SHOW UP
AT, LIKE, NOON.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.401 line:0%
 
THEY GET TO PRESIDENT STATION,
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND,

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.736 line:0%
 
AT 3:30 IN THE MORNING.

00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:10.737 line:0%
 
AND THE CONDUCTOR'S LIKE,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.339 line:0%
 
WE HAVE TO STOP,

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.575 line:0%
 
BECAUSE THERE'S A SOUND
ORDINANCE.

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.610
PINKERTON'S LIKE,
WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.245
THERE'S A [bleep]
SOUND ORDINANCE?

00:01:18.345 --> 00:01:19.913
WHAT THE [bleep]
AM I GONNA DO?

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:21.715
OKAY.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.350
WE'LL GET SOME [bleep] HORSES.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.886
[laughs]

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:30.657
SO THEY HOOK UP THIS TRAIN CAR
TO HORSES,

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:35.796
AND DRAG THE TRAIN CAR ON
THE TRACKS THROUGH BALTIMORE.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.665 line:0%
 
THEY GET TO CAMDEN STREET
STATION,

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:39.800 line:0%
 
WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO PICK UP

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.269 line:0%
 
THE WASHINGTON-BOUND TRAIN.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.905
NO TRAIN.
TRAIN'S LATE.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.874
SO THEY SAT THERE.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:49.843
IT'S BASICALLY
ASSASSINS EVERYWHERE.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.812
AND THEY COULD HEAR
PEOPLE SAYING,

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.281
THIS [bleep] LINCOLN
IS A PIECE OF [bleep].

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.450
THE SOUTH WILL RISE.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.619
PINKERTON'S LIKE,
IF THESE GUYS FIND OUT

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.221
THAT WE'RE IN HERE
WITH LINCOLN, WE'RE DEAD.

00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.890
WE'RE ALL OF US DEAD.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.225
YOU HOLD ON TO YOUR PANTIES.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:08.762
[laughing]

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.164
NO, HE WOULD NOT HAVE--
ALL RIGHT.

00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:12.399
OKAY.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:13.467 line:0%
 
THE WASHINGTON-BOUND TRAIN
FINALLY SHOWS UP.
