00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.640
SPEAKER: Five, four,
three, two, one, fire.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.730
NARRATOR: The Cold War saw a
lot of nuclear weapons testing,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.079
by the US, Soviet Union,
UK, France, and others.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.910
The US did much of
their early testing

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.370
at Bikini Atoll in
the South Pacific.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.150
The Soviets chose a remote
part of what's now Kazakhstan.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.670
The story of Bikini Atoll is
not a proud one for the US.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.960
Local residents there
were shuffled inexpertly

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.110
around nearby islands
before the testing,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.090
and many were still exposed to
dangerous levels of radiation.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.055
But, as embarrassing as
that episode is for the US,

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:43.200
it's nothing compared to
what happened in Kazakhstan.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.940
In 1949, the Soviet
Union detonated

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.000
their very first
atomic bomb in an area

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740
called Semipalatinsk, known
locally as The Polygon.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.260
The region was roughly
the size of New Jersey,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.410
and according to one of
the programs architects

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.060
it was uninhabited.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.270
As it turns out,
that claim was off

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.290
by about 1.5 million people.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.120
It's hard to know whether the
Soviet military was simply

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.690
callous in its choice of test
site, or downright sinister.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.140
There are reports of
villagers being instructed

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.610
to step outside their
homes before detonations so

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.480
that the effect of
radiation exposure

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.310
could later be studied.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.040
Either way, for 40
years, from 1949 to 1989,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.540
the Soviets detonated nuke
after nuke here, as many as 456

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.700
of them.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090
That's so many that the
explosions became almost

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.270
commonplace for some villagers.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.710
Almost every day,
recalled one woman.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.210
Announcements on the
radio at noon would say,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.080
now there's going to be a
test of nuclear weapons.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.310
Everything would shake.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.960
The windows in my classroom
were shattered by the shock wave

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.090
from one of the blasts.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870
All these tests laid
waste to the environment.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.020
Rivers and water sources
were contaminated,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.670
farmland was tainted,
and the people

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.080
began to suffer
almost immediately.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.420
Cancer rates skyrocketed,
as did mental disabilities,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.610
infertility, depression,
and harrowing birth defects.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.250
All in all, around
200,000 people

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
are believed to have suffered
directly from radiation.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.960
The weapons testing
finally ceased

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.780
with the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1989,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.420
but the shadow cast by
the program remains long.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.890
To this day 1 in 20 children
born in The Polygon area

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.420
suffer deformities.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.120
The suicide rate is four
times the national average.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.630
And then there's the fact
that when the site closed,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.380
Russia essentially
just walked away,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.020
leaving untold amounts of
radioactive material behind.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.060
The towns in and
around The Polygon

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.480
were poor enough that scavenging
metal from the old facilities

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.940
became commonplace, further
subjecting locals to radiation.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.530
The United States
caught wind of this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.170
and launched a massive effort
with Russia and Kazakhstan

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.210
to secretly clean
up the test site.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.210
A mission that wasn't
finished until 2012.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.130
The moral of the story,
as if it needs one,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.040
is that nuclear testing
can leave a mark

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.740
on a place for generations.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.890
The residents of Bikini
Atoll still understand this,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.120
and Kazakhstan understands
it maybe best of all.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.860
So well in fact
that the country has

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.230
helped lead the charge to ratify
the comprehensive nuclear test

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.660
ban treaty.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.405
The treaty calls for nothing
less than a worldwide end

00:03:21.405 --> 00:03:25.100
to all nuclear detonations,
though it won't go into effect

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.310
until it's ratified by all 44 of
the key nations who created it.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.590
Russia, notably, has
ratified the treaty, perhaps

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.290
with the memory of the
polygon fiasco still fresh.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.770
And in fact today there are only
eight holdouts, China, Egypt,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.690
Iran, Israel, India,
Pakistan, North

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.990
Korea, and the United States.
