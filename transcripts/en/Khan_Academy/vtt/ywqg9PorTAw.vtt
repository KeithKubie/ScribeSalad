00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
I think we're now ready to
start talking about some

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.410
general trends in the
periodic table.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.680
And the first one that normally
comes up in a lot of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.210
first-year chemistry classes,
and it even shows up on some

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.940
chemistry standardized
tests, is the notion

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.745
of ionization energy.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.590
And what this is, is essentially
the energy

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.290
required to remove an electron
from the neutral

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.580
version of that atom.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.950
So let's see.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:41.380
Energy to remove an electron.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.080
And just in case you haven't
been exposed to the idea of

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.940
what an ion is, I guess this is
a good time to explain it.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.730
And then this will make sense.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.760
So an ion is essentially any
atom or molecule -- and we'll

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.800
talk about molecules.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.470
Molecules are just combinations
or groups of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.750
atoms that are all bonded
together in some way.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.990
And we'll talk about bonding
in a few videos from now.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.750
But it's an atom or a molecule
in which the protons don't

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.446
equal the electrons.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:13.140
And if the protons don't equal
the electrons, then you have

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.950
some charge.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.250
If you have more protons than
electrons, you have a positive

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890
charge, right?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.520
So let's say if you
have hydrogen.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.530
Let's say you have hydrogen.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.720
Normally it's neutral, right?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.850
It has no charge.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.220
But let's say you were to remove
an electron from it.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.940
So now you have hydrogen
plus an electron.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.820
Hydrogen only has one
electron outside.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.760
So now it just has a proton on
the inside, no electrons on

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.190
the outside.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.360
So now it has a plus
one charge.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.190
We could write a minus
one there.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.860
And now, what we've done in
this, I guess we could say,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.235
this procedure or this reaction
is, we've removed

00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:49.970
we've ionized hydrogen.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.410
We've removed an electron.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.160
And in this case, this type of
ion that hydrogen is, where

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.070
your protons are greater than
your electrons, and this is

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.840
just a nice word to know.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020
This is called a cation.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.610
A cation is an ion with
a positive charge.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.550
Now you just as easily could
have a situation where you

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.075
have a, let's say -- I don't
know, let me take an element

00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:14.430
-- let's say we start
with chlorine.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.810
Cl, right?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.880
In a stable form in has seven
valence electrons.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.870
Why don't we add an
electron to it.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.500
And now this will actually
be pretty stable.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.640
It will have eight valence
electrons, but it'll have a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.840
negative charge.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.490
So this, right here, this
is a negative ion.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.200
And that's known as an anion.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.220
Anion.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.770
The way I remember it is, in
a lot of words, a means the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.750
opposite or a negation.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.550
Right?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.800
The a prefix.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.930
So a, anion, means
a negative ion.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.910
And then, obviously, cation
is the other.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.920
But ionization energy, it really
should maybe be called

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.860
cationization energy, because
it's the energy required to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.310
remove an electron, not remove
or add an electron.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.670
So it's really the energy
required to turn something

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.140
into a cation.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.810
So we've already discussed the
periodic table, and we'll get

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.840
to this chart in a second.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.400
But just based on what we
already know, which elements

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.060
will it be harder to remove an
electron from and which ones

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.740
will it be easier?

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.720
We already talked about -- let's
start with group one,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.610
just because it is group one.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.200
Group one is right here.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.900
And we'll start especially
with the alkali metals.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.340
We can put hydrogen
aside for now.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.960
But all of these guys we've
talked about a lot.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.890
In order for them to get to
the magic number eight in

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.820
their outermost shell, the
easiest way for them to do it

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.520
is just to get rid of that one
valence electron they have in

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.200
their outermost shell.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.090
Let's say potassium,
right there.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.210
Potassium has one valence
electron in its fourth shell.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.850
If it just got rid of it,
then it has eight

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.640
in its third shell.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.440
Then it looks a lot like argon
from an electron configuration

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.960
point of view, which
would be nice.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.736
So these guys really want
to give away electrons.

00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:13.160
So it requires very little
energy to ionize them or to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.390
cationize them, to take
away their electron.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.130
So this is low ionization
energy.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.200
And I think you see where
this is going.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.640
What about these guys?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.980
What about neon?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.370
How hard is it to remove
an electron from neon.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.780
Well neon is completely
satisfied.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.930
It doesn't want to even deal
with any of this reaction

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.540
business and bonding business.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.070
It's like, you know what?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.050
I've achieved happiness
in life.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.380
Don't mess with my electron.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.880
So it really doesn't want to
give away its electrons.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.360
Neon, or krypton, or argon, or
any of these noble gases.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.460
So to remove an electron from
one of these guys requires a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.190
lot of energy.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.910
So this is a high ionization
energy.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.730
So in general, as you go from
left to right across the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.230
periodic table, it goes
from low to high.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.300
And some people memorize this,
but you really don't have to

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.930
memorize it.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.190
You just say, look, these guys
have one extra electron that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.270
they're always trying
to get rid of.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.520
These guys have two.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.920
Ideally they'd want to
get rid of, maybe,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.190
both of their electrons.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.570
But the first electron doesn't
want to jump off as much as

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.590
the first electron here, because
the first electron

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.780
here, you get rid of it, you
immediately get to the super

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.060
stable state.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.470
And that trend just becomes
more and more true.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.750
This guy, definitely, under no
circumstances wants to give

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.970
away an electron.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.770
This guy is so close to being
like neon that he definitely

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.240
doesn't want to go a
step backwards and

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.600
look more like oxygen.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.430
So he doesn't want to get
rid of an electron.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.640
So the trend is pretty clear.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.490
Anytime you're confused about
the trend, just look at the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.300
extreme cases.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.390
This guy wants to give
away electrons.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.560
This guy wants to
get electrons.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.680
So if you say, what's the energy
required to take away

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.900
an electron?

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.730
Well this guy's almost going
to give it to you.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.540
While this guy's going to be
very hard, especially neon, to

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.260
take away an electron.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.350
Now what happens
as you go down?

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.590
As you go down in this
direction, let's say you go

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.110
along a group, right?

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.200
We already established that
these alkali metals like to

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.560
give away electrons.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.970
But as you go down,
the electron cloud

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.290
gets bigger and bigger.

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.750
And you could say this 55th
electron -- there's 55

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.600
protons, there's also in a
neutral cesium atom, there's

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.020
also 55 electrons -- that 55th
electron is a lot further away

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.170
from the nucleus of this atom
than the third electron is in

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.810
the case of lithium.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.300
So this, the 55th electron, not
only does it want to be

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.270
given away, but it has even
a weaker attraction to the

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.980
nucleus than the third electron
does in lithium.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.820
So because you're getting larger
and larger as you go

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.250
down a group, and the electrons
are getting further

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.320
and further away from the
nucleus, this guy wants to

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.570
give away his electrons even
more than lithium does.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:52.220
Right?

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.580
So ionization energy decreases
as you go down.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.440
Even though xenon really wants
to keep his electrons, he's a

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.050
little bit more willing to give
them away than neon is.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.400
Right?

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.700
So in general, the ionization
energy, or the energy required

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:18.780
to ionize an atom, will
increase as you go up.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.090
Right?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.330
And if you ever forget it, don't
memorize these things.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.470
Because that might be useful
for just one test, but then

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.990
later in life when you're 42
and someone asks you, hey,

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.710
what has a higher ionization
energy, cesium or fluorine?

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.940
You might have forgotten it.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.890
But then if you look at a
periodic table, you'd say, you

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.250
know, cesium has this one
electron that it's just dying

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.910
to give away.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.400
It's super far away
from the nucleus.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.340
That 55th electron just really
wants to leave. While

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.170
fluorine, that ninth electron
just needs one more electron.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:51.630
Well let's say neon.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.510
Neon is super happy.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.250
All the electrons are in the
stable configuration.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.860
They're close to the nucleus.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.320
There's a lot of attraction
with the

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.470
protons in the nucleus.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.550
They definitely don't want to
give away their electrons.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.430
So if you talk about the energy
required to remove

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.870
them, very low energy
at cesium, very

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.320
high energy at helium.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.210
So that's the trend.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.520
And this is just, this trend
we'll see often, this is your

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.530
willingness to give electrons.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.880
And this is how much you want to
hog electrons or keep them

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.470
to yourself.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.320
And this right here, this is
actually -- I got this off

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.840
Wikipedia -- this
is the actual,

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.600
measured ionization energies.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.020
And people looked at
patterns like this.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.799
I'm not sure if they actually
looked at the ionization

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.520
energy, but they looked at
patterns like this, and this

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.450
is actually where they came up
with the periodic table.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:44.110
Because they said, look, as we
increment up the number of

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.100
protons that we have in an atom,
and likewise, the number

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.020
of electrons, we see these
repeated patterns, or these

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.940
periods, in the elements.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.710
So this is hydrogen.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.210
So hydrogen's ionization
energy is around 13 1/2

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.990
electron volts.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.670
Right?

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.920
Which is a unit of energy.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.530
It can be converted into
joules, if you like.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.310
But then all of a sudden, helium
is a lot more stable.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:11.980
It takes almost double the
energy to remove that second

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.090
electron from helium because
it's so stable.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.660
But as soon as you do that, as
soon as you go from helium,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.960
this point right here, that
point right here is lithium.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.330
Right?

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.990
Lithium is atomic
number of three.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.350
Let me put that in.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.480
This is lithium.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.760
All of a sudden, to remove an
electron from lithium it only

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.480
requires five electron volts.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.450
So less than half of what it
required for hydrogen.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.990
Then as you go to the right
of the periodic table, the

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.340
ionization energy keeps
increasing.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.240
These little divots
are interesting.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.770
We could talk about that, maybe,
in a future video.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:48.940
But the ionization energy
increases all the way to neon.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.020
And then you get to neon and
then you add one more-- see,

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.850
neon is a noble gas, it's
completely happy -- then you

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.910
add one more electron and
you get to sodium.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.520
And you say, oh, now sodium,
it's really easy to take away

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.046
that electron.

00:09:59.046 --> 00:10:01.370
And the ionization
energy drops.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.390
Not only did it drop,
but here it dropped

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.520
slightly below lithium.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.570
So you see this general trend.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.600
So these are the noble
gases right here.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.250
Let me make sure you can see
them all in the video screen.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.300
Helium.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.100
Very hard to remove that
eighth electron.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.600
Neon.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.300
It's very hard, but a little
easier than helium.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.430
And that's because neon is
a little bit bigger.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:24.170
The electrons are a little bit
further away from the nucleus.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.100
Argon.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.390
Same pattern, but it's
actually interesting.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.830
Argon is actually not that
different than hydrogen.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.520
Krypton.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.010
Same thing.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.850
It's hard to remove
that electron.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:37.050
But it's actually no harder to
remove the electron on krypton

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.080
than on hydrogen.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.830
And xenon.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:44.260
And you go all the
way out to radon.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.680
And you can see, you know, why
is the distance between these

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.180
increasing?

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.930
Well if you remember the
periodic table, all of a

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.600
sudden when you go after argon,
then you have all of

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.780
the d-block elements
that go in.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.490
So after you get to
argon, notice.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.470
This is where you only had
s- and p-block elements.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.560
Now all of a sudden the d-block
elements show up.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.120
So you have more subshells
to fill up.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.590
And now all of a sudden, before
you get to radon,

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.480
you're starting to fill
out the f-block, too.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.320
And that's why that distance
is increasing, because you

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.230
have to also fill out
the f elements.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.820
But the general trends
that we just

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.210
discussed, they apply here.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.530
That as you go to the right
along the periodic table, it

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.670
becomes harder and harder to
remove an electron because

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.430
everyone wants to get to
the magic number eight.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.800
And it's very hard to remove
them from a noble gas.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.190
But then as you go one more
above that, this guy would

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:39.500
love to give away his electron
and get back to a

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.320
configuration like neon.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.380
And then the other trend is,
as you go down a group-- in

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.670
this case, these are the
noble gases-- the

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.140
ionization energy decreases.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.630
And that's because the overall
radius of the atom increases,

00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:00.670
so the valence electrons in
radon are a little bit less

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.520
strongly attracted than the
valence electrons in helium.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.700
Anyway, I think that's it
for ionization energy.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.100
I'll continue this
in another video.

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.540
We'll talk about metallic
character and

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.790
electronegativity.
