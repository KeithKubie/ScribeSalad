BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: All
right, hi, everyone.

00:00:01.923 --> 00:00:05.930
And welcome to this segment
of today's discussion

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.750
here at Google about
gender equality

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.910
and women's empowerment.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm Brigitte Gosselink.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.560
I'm part of google.org which
is Google's philanthropic arm.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.090
And I'm joined here today
by Gary Catona and Aubrey

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.800
Logan, who are here to premier
the song, "My Voice Matters,"

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.610
today on YouTube Live.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.309
So I thought I would just give a
quick introduction to Gary, who

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.600
has been here at Google before.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.400
Welcome back, Gary.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.755
GARY CATONA: Thank you.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:35.180
Nice to be here.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.600
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: So Gary's
insights into human voice

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.750
have established him as a guru
and scientist of the voice.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.690
His revolutionary
voice-building system,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.400
known as the Catona
Method, earned him

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.886
the title, the Maestro
of Voice and a reputation

00:00:48.886 --> 00:00:50.760
as a rebel in the field
of vocal development.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.090
We like rebels here,
so you will be at home.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.190
He has taught some of
Hollywood's most successful

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.930
singers and entertainers,
names that you know well,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.000
Whitney Houston, Andrea Bocelli,
Seal, Steven Tyler, Usher,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.400
Shakira, Robin Thicke, Lorde.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.800
I feel like perhaps
every Grammy maybe

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.420
is attributed to
you with that list.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.100
And today he's
committed to teaching

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.810
his voice-building
system to the world.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.960
So, Gary, thank you so much
for being here with us today.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.918
GARY CATONA: Thank you.

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:17.614
Nice to be here.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.030
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
So, obviously,

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.830
this list of singers you've
taught is quite impressive.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.381
And you are known for this
innovative voice-building

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:24.880
system.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080
Can you tell us a little
bit more about the system?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.152
I understand it's pretty
scientifically based.

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:32.610
Share a little bit about that,
and what makes it different.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.166
And kind of what's
at the crux of it?

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.290
GARY CATONA: Well, I call
what I do voice building.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.110
And I think that
name says it all.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.080
I have developed a way
of building the voice.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.480
Think of the voice in
terms of its musculature.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.740
When you speak or sing,
you're using muscles.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.680
I developed a way of
exercising those muscles that

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.670
maximize the potential
in those muscles,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.570
and I could literally
build a voice.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:00.600
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: I
think later today you're

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.210
going to show us a
little bit of the method.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.960
But can you talk a
little bit about what's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.640
going on in the method that you
use, sort of scientifically,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.340
physiologically.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.820
You talk about it a muscle.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.830
What about what you
developed is different

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.650
and helps to actually do that
building that you talk about?

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.050
GARY CATONA: Well, most teachers
think of the voice as something

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.610
that you're born with.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.110
Right?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.420
You have, like, you
have brown eyes,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.590
and you have a
certain kind of voice,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.850
a certain kind of hair color.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.510
What I've discovered is that
the voice is a potential.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.980
And because it's
controlled by muscles.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.980
So I've developed
a way of isolating

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.030
the muscles of the voice
box and the throat,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.850
and building those
muscles in such a way

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.732
that you build power, resonance,
and range into the voice.

00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.190
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: So it's
possible I could learn to sing,

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.116
after all.

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:45.240
GARY CATONA: It's possible.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.750
Not a guarantee.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.940
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: All right.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.020
So, obviously, this has
been your life's work.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.820
What's brought
you to this topic,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.950
to really getting involved
in women's empowerment?

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.777
And how has your work,
if at all, influenced

00:03:00.777 --> 00:03:02.860
the way that you think
about this particular topic

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.570
today that we're
talking about today?

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.100
GARY CATONA: I have a surprising
answer for you on that one.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.660
Would you believe that
my first intuition

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.980
about the idea of a
voice having significance

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.270
began with none other
than Muhammad Ali.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.590
He was on my first
students years ago.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.290
When he was promoting
peace throughout the world,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.070
and talking about
racial discrimination,

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.140
and I was working
with him, because he

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.290
had a vocal difficulty.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.740
He had Parkinson's
syndrome, which

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.730
reduced the power of his voice.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.480
And, in building
his voice back, we

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.430
had many, many
moments of discussion

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.094
about what a voice is.

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.510
And he would often say to me,
he say, Gary, what I want do

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.847
is raise my voice.

00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:46.930
Because I know that I gotta
raise-- we gotta raise

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.731
our voices.

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:49.730
And he said that over,
and over, and over to me,

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.140
and it stuck with me.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.870
Through the years,
as I began working

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.430
with a whole variety of people,
some very famous people,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.590
and realizing how significant
the voice really is,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.310
it was only a matter
of time before I

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.880
began thinking about this idea
of everybody's voice matters.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.710
It's not just Muhammad
Ali, or Whitney Houston,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.820
but everybody has a voice.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.410
Everybody has a potential.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.620
And if you think of the
voice as a metaphor.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.330
Right?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.899
Your voice, you
raise your voice.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.640
Your voice is
really who you are.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.149
When you speak, when you
express yourself, when you sing,

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.087
you're expressing your essence.

00:04:23.087 --> 00:04:24.920
Why do you think you
hear this all the time?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.720
Raise your voice for this.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.410
Raise your voice for that.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.630
Because it really is that.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.000
It really is the
essence of who you are.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.200
So that was the origin
of "My Voice Matters."

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.980
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK:
And so you and Aubrey

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.800
co-wrote the song that we're
about to hear Aubrey perform.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.320
Can you just talk a little
bit about the song itself,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.490
the motivation behind it, and
what you hope people take away

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.390
from the sun when they hear it?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.250
GARY CATONA: Well, as I said,
over the past couple years

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.950
and working with a whole variety
of people, including people

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.240
with dysfunctional
voices, this concept

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.630
of the meaning of the
voice came into my mind.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.320
And then I-- believe it
or not-- I was teaching.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.470
I was teaching a
student and talking

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.220
about how important
the voice is,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.805
and this phrase "my voice
matters" came to me.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:15.930
It was an interesting idea.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.800
My voice matters.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.610
Very clever, and it says so
much-- integrity, strength,

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.340
power, self-affirmation.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.460
So I took the idea to my good
friend, an incredible musician,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.820
Nick Milo.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.581
I said, Nick, I have this idea
for a song, "My Voice Matters."

00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:36.080
What do you think
we can do with it?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.760
So we came up with
a musical idea.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.100
We worked on it,
worked on the lyrics.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.800
And we fashioned a
really cool song.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.360
And then we realized the
song wasn't quite right.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.100
It was great, but not
as great as it could be.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.712
Lo and behold, Aubrey Logan
walks into the picture-- one

00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:54.170
of my students,
one of the greatest

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.120
voices I've ever taught.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.203
And she also happens to
be an exceptional musician

00:05:57.203 --> 00:05:58.520
and songwriter.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.460
And we invited Aubrey to come
in and to, you might say,

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.480
complete the song.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.040
And she made a major
change in the song,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.080
and we have this masterpiece
that you should download,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.800
everybody listening in.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.600
Download, because the money's
going to the charities.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.590
So it's important you
download the song.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.020
Go to makemyvoicematter.org,
download the song,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.355
and make your voice matter.

00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:24.730
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Aubrey,
when you first heard the song

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.340
and came in to complete it,
what drew you to collaborating

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.385
on this project?

00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:30.760
AUBREY LOGAN: I
think the concept

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.220
of having this panel
here today, that

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.260
spoke before we came
here together today,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.027
I heard that Aimee
Mullins was coming.

00:06:40.027 --> 00:06:41.360
I heard that Melissa was coming.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.700
I heard that these
ladies were coming today

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.690
to speak about what
they've been doing

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.670
and what their life's work is.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.120
And I realized that
these are powerful women

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.870
from all over the world.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.170
And I've been told before,
even as a little kid,

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.606
you talk really loud.

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.360
I said, oops, I
didn't know that.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.650
And so, maybe I
suppressed that later on.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.650
But I realized, when I
heard the title the song,

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.672
"My Voice Matters," it kind
of made me pay attention.

00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:11.130
GARY CATONA: It
resonated with you.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.690
AUBREY LOGAN: It did.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.190
Thank you.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.060
It resonated with
me, and so, when

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.100
I learned what this event
today would be about,

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.474
and what we would
be celebrating,

00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:20.320
and what the
charities were about,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.320
it gave me a lot of inspiration
to write some verses.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.097
And you'll hear those
a little bit later.

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:27.180
BRIGITTE GOSSELINK: Great.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.680
Well, Gary, I think I'll
turn it over to you.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.100
Gary is going to
demonstrate some

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.359
of his voice-building techniques
with Aubrey, who actually

00:07:34.359 --> 00:07:36.150
knows how to do them
and has a great voice,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.570
and then with the rest of us.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.740
So bear with us here.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.157
I'll turn it back
over to you all.

00:07:41.157 --> 00:07:43.114
GARY CATONA: OK, here's
what we're going to do.

00:07:43.114 --> 00:07:45.150
We're gonna give everybody
watching this program

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.150
a chance to experience what it
means to have your voice built.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.980
The same exercise that
Whitney Houston has used,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.110
Andrea Bocelli, and
countless other people.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.250
So what I'm going to do is
give Aubrey a voice lesson,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.204
a small version of
the voice lesson.

00:08:00.204 --> 00:08:01.620
Then we're going
to have her sing.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.140
But I want you to watch
this, and you get the idea.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.410
When I talk about the
musculature of the voice,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.034
you'll get the idea
of what I'm talking

00:08:08.034 --> 00:08:09.460
about when you hear her voice.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.340
You ready, Aubrey.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:10.680
AUBREY LOGAN: Yes.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.050
GARY CATONA: Don't screw up.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.870
AUBREY LOGAN: OK.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.698

hearing muscles stretch.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.495
That's what you're hearing.

00:08:42.495 --> 00:08:44.630
All of that tone, how
rich and full it is,

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.250
that's because we're accessing
the musculature of her throat,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.367
and you can hear it.

believe it or not,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.540
is give you the chance of
doing a few of the exercises

AUBREY LOGAN: Yeah.

GARY CATONA: I use the
vowel sounds like barbells.
