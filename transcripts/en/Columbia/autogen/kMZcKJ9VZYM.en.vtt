relationship so there is an example so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
relationship so there is an example so
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.590
relationship so there is an example so
we have the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
 
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.350
 
that usual group there so we have two

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360
that usual group there so we have two
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.940
that usual group there so we have two
generators and there's no relationship

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950
generators and there's no relationship
 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980
generators and there's no relationship
between them so you sort of get these

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990
between them so you sort of get these
 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.719
between them so you sort of get these
Infinity Ward legs so if you have

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.960
degenerates and B since there's a
relationship between that you can sort

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
relationship between that you can sort
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.789
relationship between that you can sort
of start getting a B a B and you could

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799
of start getting a B a B and you could
 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.480
of start getting a B a B and you could
sort of have this amazing network

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490
sort of have this amazing network
 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.249
sort of have this amazing network
similarly if you look at this which is

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259
similarly if you look at this which is
 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.520
similarly if you look at this which is
about two generators and they commute

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
about two generators and they commute
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.990
about two generators and they commute
with each other you get nothing but the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000
with each other you get nothing but the
 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.680
with each other you get nothing but the
claim for group and then this is just a

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690
claim for group and then this is just a
 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.510
claim for group and then this is just a
direct product of two of these same

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520
direct product of two of these same
 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.669
direct product of two of these same
infinite legs these are just some basic

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679
infinite legs these are just some basic
 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.680
infinite legs these are just some basic

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.760
 
so this meetup gave us sort of an idea

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770
so this meetup gave us sort of an idea
 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.100
so this meetup gave us sort of an idea

effectively what you're trying to do is
you start with the vertex and then you

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:48.920
you start with the vertex and then you
 

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.090
you start with the vertex and then you
keep track of all other vertices that

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100
keep track of all other vertices that
 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:53.830
keep track of all other vertices that
must be in the same component so if you

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840
must be in the same component so if you
 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.380
must be in the same component so if you
have worked X every vertex as every

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:56.390

other vertex it's not connected to it
must be in the same joint component so

must be in the same joint component so
 

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.980
must be in the same joint component so
you start with a vertex B and you add it

you start with a vertex B and you add it
 

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.040
you start with a vertex B and you add it

building up this one joint component
 

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.000
building up this one joint component
you're using a logic that it's in the

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:25.010
you're using a logic that it's in the
 

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.010
you're using a logic that it's in the
same joint component for sure if it's

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.020
same joint component for sure if it's
 

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.870
same joint component for sure if it's
not connected and so you sort of build

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:28.880
not connected and so you sort of build
 

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.970
not connected and so you sort of build
up this list L and then finally when you

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:30.980
up this list L and then finally when you
 

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.980
up this list L and then finally when you
can no longer add vertices to how we

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:32.990
can no longer add vertices to how we
 

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.260
can no longer add vertices to how we
look at L and you say okay if now I have

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.270
look at L and you say okay if now I have
 

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.300
look at L and you say okay if now I have
all the vertices that have been added L

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:37.310
all the vertices that have been added L
 

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.980
all the vertices that have been added L
they're all in the same joint component

they're all in the same joint component
 

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.210
they're all in the same joint component
and therefore the graphs not really

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:40.220
and therefore the graphs not really
 

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.510
and therefore the graphs not really
joints they all have

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520
joints they all have
 

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.760
joints they all have
the same component whereas if you have

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:43.770
the same component whereas if you have
 

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.070
the same component whereas if you have
sort of you just sort of you know some

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080
sort of you just sort of you know some
 

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.170
sort of you just sort of you know some
set of vertices in a you know that your

set of vertices in a you know that your
 

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.520

graph wasn't going to where it was

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:49.530
graph wasn't going to where it was
 

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.340

that's one component than the remainder

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:51.350
that's one component than the remainder
 

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.770
that's one component than the remainder
so this is sort of a basic algorithm to

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:03.240
whoever this by this condition I like to
 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.880
whoever this by this condition I like to
see a best condition which stands for a

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:04.890
see a best condition which stands for a
 

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.480
see a best condition which stands for a
component full support that came from

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:08.490
component full support that came from
 

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.060
component full support that came from
paper by dhania Thomas that we sort of

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.070
paper by dhania Thomas that we sort of
 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.300
paper by dhania Thomas that we sort of
used and again implemented using both

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:14.310
used and again implemented using both
 

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.980
used and again implemented using both
legs and I suppose Buster with various

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:15.990
legs and I suppose Buster with various
 

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.160
legs and I suppose Buster with various
different conditions and so the idea

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.170
different conditions and so the idea
 

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.530
different conditions and so the idea
behind this is you look at the graph of

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540
behind this is you look at the graph of
 

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.750
behind this is you look at the graph of
gamma of the coxeter group and you

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760
gamma of the coxeter group and you
 

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.090
gamma of the coxeter group and you
generate a new graph which is known as

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100
generate a new graph which is known as
 

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.820
generate a new graph which is known as
gala for and it's basically what's

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:28.830
gala for and it's basically what's
 

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.550
gala for and it's basically what's
called The Associated for cycle graph

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560
called The Associated for cycle graph
 

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.440
called The Associated for cycle graph
which basically you take all the four

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:33.450
which basically you take all the four
 

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:34.880
which basically you take all the four
cycles and galaxies look at all the

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:34.890
cycles and galaxies look at all the
 

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.680
cycles and galaxies look at all the
squares in gamma and each of those

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:36.690
squares in gamma and each of those
 

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.980
squares in gamma and each of those
become vertices in gamma four and you

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:39.990
become vertices in gamma four and you
 

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.500
become vertices in gamma four and you
connect two of these vertices in gamma 4

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:42.510
connect two of these vertices in gamma 4
 

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.770
connect two of these vertices in gamma 4
if the two squares in gamma shared two

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:45.780
if the two squares in gamma shared two
 

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.780
if the two squares in gamma shared two
edges or share it with you so that's

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:47.790
edges or share it with you so that's
 

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.030
edges or share it with you so that's
sort of looking at these squares and

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040
sort of looking at these squares and
 

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.340
sort of looking at these squares and
then you generate this this graph based

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.350
then you generate this this graph based
 

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.010
then you generate this this graph based
on overlapping squares and then finally

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:55.020
on overlapping squares and then finally
 

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.380
on overlapping squares and then finally
we would give you to look at this graph

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:57.390
we would give you to look at this graph
 

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.630
we would give you to look at this graph
when you try and find the component of

00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640
when you try and find the component of
 

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.170
when you try and find the component of
the graph which is a connected component

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:02.180
the graph which is a connected component
 

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.180
the graph which is a connected component
and what's known as it has full support

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:05.190
and what's known as it has full support
 

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.040
and what's known as it has full support
so what that means is that the component

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.050
so what that means is that the component
 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.350
so what that means is that the component
gal4 if you look at that component then

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360
gal4 if you look at that component then
 

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.060
gal4 if you look at that component then
the associated vertices back again

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:11.070
the associated vertices back again
 

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.280
the associated vertices back again
though you cover all of gamma so your

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.290
though you cover all of gamma so your
 

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:15.980
though you cover all of gamma so your
connected component gamma 4 and then the

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:15.990
connected component gamma 4 and then the
 

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.410
connected component gamma 4 and then the
associate vertices give you all again

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420
associate vertices give you all again
 

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.450
associate vertices give you all again
what's known as opponent with full

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:20.460
what's known as opponent with full
 

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.060
what's known as opponent with full
support and that's sort of tells you

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:23.070
support and that's sort of tells you
 

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.860
support and that's sort of tells you
whether Iran and you also obviously

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:24.870
whether Iran and you also obviously
 

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.570
whether Iran and you also obviously
matrix not a joint so it's not taking

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580
matrix not a joint so it's not taking
 

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.850
matrix not a joint so it's not taking
orders gyro and therefore staple order

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860
orders gyro and therefore staple order
 

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.490
orders gyro and therefore staple order
one so that's sort of what we spend a

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500
one so that's sort of what we spend a
 

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.400
one so that's sort of what we spend a
lot of time on all right I'm excited

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.410
lot of time on all right I'm excited
 

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.560
lot of time on all right I'm excited
I've spent a lot of time on this

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:35.570
I've spent a lot of time on this
 

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.620
I've spent a lot of time on this
implementing this and then I mean this

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:39.630
implementing this and then I mean this
 

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:40.970
implementing this and then I mean this
going to talk about some examples and

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980
going to talk about some examples and
 

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.050
going to talk about some examples and
then after that all we will actually

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:42.060
then after that all we will actually
 

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.640
then after that all we will actually
talk about there those four higher

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:43.650
talk about there those four higher
 

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:44.900
talk about there those four higher
orders it because right at least getting

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:44.910
orders it because right at least getting
 

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:57.800

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:57.810
upper they found us because if that's
 

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.170
upper they found us because if that's
where they can get that sharp upper and

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180
where they can get that sharp upper and
 

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.480
where they can get that sharp upper and
lower thickness so they make specifics

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.490
lower thickness so they make specifics
 

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.830
lower thickness so they make specifics
they started building up the most fair

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:06.840
they started building up the most fair
 

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.990
they started building up the most fair
which is the border zero to join and

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000
which is the border zero to join and
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.740
which is the border zero to join and
they and

our city surveillance particular one
starting with this this would be labeled

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:26.389
starting with this this would be labeled
 

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:28.629
starting with this this would be labeled
B zero so this would be big of order

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639
B zero so this would be big of order
 

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.810
B zero so this would be big of order
five so what we were you know one of the

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:31.820
five so what we were you know one of the
 

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.519
five so what we were you know one of the
things was to try to understand and

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:33.529
things was to try to understand and
 

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:37.090
things was to try to understand and
modify that Orion see

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:37.100
 
 

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.630
 
so for example if you add its edge

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.640
so for example if you add its edge
 

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.240
 
in the bottom this reduces their keys

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.250
in the bottom this reduces their keys
 

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.090
in the bottom this reduces their keys
from order six to order to five so the

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100
from order six to order to five so the
 

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.060
from order six to order to five so the
order of thickness goes down that one

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.070
order of thickness goes down that one
 

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.769
order of thickness goes down that one
it's because you can see those there's

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779
it's because you can see those there's
 

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:56.240
it's because you can see those there's
this uh breath inside it which has

you like go to the deepness complex you

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:02.340
you like go to the deepness complex you
 

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.810
you like go to the deepness complex you
can sort of force any path and whatever

can sort of force any path and whatever
enlarger got to go Buddhist but one of

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260
enlarger got to go Buddhist but one of
 

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.360
enlarger got to go Buddhist but one of
the things you're still working on is

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:11.370
the things you're still working on is
 

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:16.780
the things you're still working on is
how to generalize

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:16.790
 
 

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:24.210
 
okay so this is one above okay

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:24.220
 
 

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.160
 
really so we can get an up-or-down get a

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:27.170
really so we can get an up-or-down get a
 

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.000
really so we can get an up-or-down get a

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.549
 
so at the start of the summer we have

00:12:42.549 --> 00:12:42.559
so at the start of the summer we have
 

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:46.720
so at the start of the summer we have
this theorem by document system which

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:46.730
this theorem by document system which
 

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:47.410
this theorem by document system which
says that

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:47.420
says that
 

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.259
says that
WMS think of support if and only if

gamma can be formed by thinking thick
unions and coating so what does that

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:55.100
unions and coating so what does that
 

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.229
unions and coating so what does that
mean

00:12:56.229 --> 00:12:56.239
mean
 

00:12:56.239 --> 00:13:08.280
mean
so if you start with graphs

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.290
 
 

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.690
 
both of these are gonna be second

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:09.700
both of these are gonna be second
 

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.720
both of these are gonna be second
quarters here because their joins

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:11.730
quarters here because their joins
 

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.080
quarters here because their joins
between the vertical literacy sort of

between the vertical literacy sort of
 

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.940
between the vertical literacy sort of
for example their disease language for

for example their disease language for
 

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.100
for example their disease language for
that's when you could take their stick

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.110
that's when you could take their stick
 

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.940
that's when you could take their stick
Union so they're thick rats and if they

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:23.950
Union so they're thick rats and if they
 

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.670
Union so they're thick rats and if they
share a subgraph rules say that this

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.720
 
basically generalizing the result that

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.470
 
so basically to construct a random graph

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480
so basically to construct a random graph
 

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.600

what we do is we first fix the number of

what we do is we first fix the number of
 

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.050
what we do is we first fix the number of

this is the model by tradition many so

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:35.910
this is the model by tradition many so
 

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.920
this is the model by tradition many so
the important things here that this

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:39.930
the important things here that this
 

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.470
the important things here that this

secondly one directed under it means

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:44.460
secondly one directed under it means
 

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.240
secondly one directed under it means
that the edges don't have directions

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.250
that the edges don't have directions
 

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.940
that the edges don't have directions
it's X the simple means that there are

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:49.950
it's X the simple means that there are
 

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.520
it's X the simple means that there are
there's at most one edge between two

there's at most one edge between two
 

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:58.100
there's at most one edge between two
vertices and there are no salt and while

constructing this graph

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480
constructing this graph
 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.020
constructing this graph
the way we do it is we fix a certain

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.030
the way we do it is we fix a certain
 

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.750
the way we do it is we fix a certain
probability P for every edge and the P

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760
probability P for every edge and the P
 

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.880
probability P for every edge and the P
is sort of constant in the sense that

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:07.890
is sort of constant in the sense that
 

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.040
is sort of constant in the sense that
the probability of having an edge

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.050
the probability of having an edge
 

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:12.170
the probability of having an edge
between these two versus the same as the

between these two versus the same as the
 

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.370
between these two versus the same as the
timing abilities or any other so we're

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380
timing abilities or any other so we're
 

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.410
timing abilities or any other so we're
not doing something like this edges

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:18.420
not doing something like this edges
 

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.590
not doing something like this edges
relative began this one like each of the

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600
relative began this one like each of the
 

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.980
relative began this one like each of the
answers it's all the constant and

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:24.990
answers it's all the constant and
 

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.690
answers it's all the constant and
secondly the speeds independent of the

secondly the speeds independent of the
 

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.610
secondly the speeds independent of the
number of edges so just because there

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620
number of edges so just because there
 

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.990
number of edges so just because there
are two edges here does not mean that

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000
are two edges here does not mean that
 

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
are two edges here does not mean that
the probability of a prodigy will

fairly so we're investigating thickness

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:44.020
fairly so we're investigating thickness
 

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.250
fairly so we're investigating thickness
of random graphs and the way we look at

of random graphs and the way we look at
thickness is so consequently

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:48.970
thickness is so consequently

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.740
example as I say we have a line which
covers both ends so if we remove a few

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:16.750
covers both ends so if we remove a few
 

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.870

to generalize this so the reason that

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.050
to generalize this so the reason that
 

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.720
to generalize this so the reason that

improving this is the 1/2 equals 1 minus
 

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.040
improving this is the 1/2 equals 1 minus
1/2 so when you take the binomial

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.050
1/2 so when you take the binomial
 

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:40.530

some of these things simplify and it
gets rid of the need for

00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:45.929
gets rid of the need for
 

00:24:45.929 --> 00:24:49.169
gets rid of the need for
not an extra fact is that we have to

00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:49.179
not an extra fact is that we have to
 

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:55.080
not an extra fact is that we have to
introduce so this is the some years I

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:55.090

would try to generalize the the result

00:24:59.030 --> 00:24:59.040
would try to generalize the the result
 

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:06.020
would try to generalize the the result
to a more generally and we proved it for

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:06.030
 
 

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.160
 
so I couldn't prove for all P but we

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.170
so I couldn't prove for all P but we
 

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:11.220
so I couldn't prove for all P but we
proved it for this range you should know

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:11.230
proved it for this range you should know
 

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:19.620
proved it for this range you should know
that each and so the proof to prove this

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:19.630
that each and so the proof to prove this
 

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.500
that each and so the proof to prove this
we took the original proof in the

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:22.510
we took the original proof in the
 

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:25.799
we took the original proof in the
analysis paper which is about like four

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:25.809
analysis paper which is about like four
 

00:25:25.809 --> 00:25:33.270
analysis paper which is about like four
pages on and so this limit here so we

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:33.280
pages on and so this limit here so we
 

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.090
pages on and so this limit here so we
posted some other grounds for I go in

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100
posted some other grounds for I go in
 

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:46.350
posted some other grounds for I go in
and we have this function f of N and we

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360
and we have this function f of N and we
 

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.549
and we have this function f of N and we
prove that it's some who and using so

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559
prove that it's some who and using so
 

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:55.200
prove that it's some who and using so
using those three results we get call

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.210
using those three results we get call
 

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:59.160
using those three results we get call
this number alpha and then we need to

00:25:59.160 --> 00:25:59.170
this number alpha and then we need to
 

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.310
this number alpha and then we need to
find we need to prove that F of 18 will

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320
find we need to prove that F of 18 will
 

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.530
find we need to prove that F of 18 will
be less than or equal to alpha minus

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:04.540
be less than or equal to alpha minus
 

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.990
be less than or equal to alpha minus
alpha squared so this is this is alpha

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000
alpha squared so this is this is alpha
 

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.230
alpha squared so this is this is alpha
minus alpha squared for various

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:13.240

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.810
 
so nine took like

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:22.820
so nine took like
 

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.210
so nine took like
so what this the data this is using is

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:28.220
so what this the data this is using is
 

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.930
so what this the data this is using is
the number of the graphs the total

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:31.940
the number of the graphs the total

number of the craftsman n vertices and
 

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.440
number of the craftsman n vertices and
also the total number of clicks in those

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:38.450
also the total number of clicks in those
 

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:41.050
also the total number of clicks in those
thick raps so if the nine that took

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:41.060
thick raps so if the nine that took
 

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.890
thick raps so if the nine that took
about two days to compute for ten it

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:44.900
about two days to compute for ten it
 

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.000
about two days to compute for ten it
would be in completely long time so we

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:49.010
would be in completely long time so we
 

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.430
would be in completely long time so we

is greater than zero below that it's
 

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:07.840
is greater than zero below that it's
listed there so it's and so the rate we

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:07.850
listed there so it's and so the rate we
 

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:14.520
listed there so it's and so the rate we
proved it for was most of this range
