00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.460
- [Instructor] We are told
that researchers suspect

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.710
that myopia, or nearsightedness,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.540
is becoming more common over time.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.510
A study from the year 2000
showed 132 cases of myopia

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.650
in 400 randomly selected people.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.550
A separate study from
2015 showed 228 cases

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.970
in 600 randomly selected people.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.510
So what we're going to do in this video

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.210
is do a hypothesis test
to see if we have evidence

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.990
to suggest the researcher
suspicion that myopia

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.570
is becoming more common over time.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.530
If at any point you are
inspired, I encourage you

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.230
to pause the video and
try to work through things

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.820
on your own, but here I go.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.460
I'm going to do it with you.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.340
So let's just start
off by setting our null

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.430
and alternative hypothesis.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.540
So remember, our null
hypothesis, this would be that

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.920
the known news here.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.080
So that would be that
contrary to their suspicions,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.340
that myopia is not becoming more common.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.490
And so the way that we're
measuring more common over time

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.490
is we could look at
the proportion of folks

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.110
who have myopia in 2015 and compare that

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.280
to the proportion in 2000.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
So our null hypothesis is
that there's no difference.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.960
Is that the true proportion
of folks who have myopia

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.610
in 2015 is equal to
the proportion of folks

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.080
who have myopia in 2000.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.550
And then our alternative
hypothesis, remember,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.570
they are, they suspect it's
becoming more common over time.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.600
So that would be a situation
where our true proportion

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.600
in 2015 is greater than the
true proportion in 2000.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.520
In this scenario, myopia would be becoming

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.120
more common over time because
2015 happens after 2000.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.870
So before we even go about
testing our null hypothesis,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.220
seeing if we can reject or not,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.900
which would suggest our alternative,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.350
you have to look at your
conditions for inference.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.630
And we've done this many times before.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.280
You have your random
condition, and it looks like

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.810
we meet that because in both
of the samples we have 400

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.610
randomly selected people,
randomly selected people.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.870
So that looks good.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.700
Then you have your normal condition.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.930
And to meet your normal condition,
your number of successes

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.110
and failures in each of the
samples have to be at least 10.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.480
And we see that that is the case.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.750
We have 132 successes so to
speak, not that it's a success

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.780
for someone to have
myopia, but the way this is

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.750
being constructed that would be a success.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.130
And then 400 minus 132 failures.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.660
In each case, either of those numbers

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.720
would be greater than 10.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.810
And same thing for the sample from 2015,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.840
so we're meeting both of those.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.930
And then the last condition
that we always talk about,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.690
is the independence condition.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.340
And two ways to get there,
either you are sampling

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.810
with replacement or you feel
good that your sample size

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.410
is no more than 10
percent of the population.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.650
And I think it is safe to say
that even this larger sample

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.430
of 600, that there is more
than 6,000 people out there.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.240
And so I think it's reasonable
to say that we're meeting

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.320
that independence condition.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.970
Even though they're not
making it explicit here.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.100
But it's good to always think about this.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.590
Now the next thing you wanna
do in a hypothesis test

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.030
is set your significance
level, your alpha.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.843
And I'll set my
significance level to 0.05.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.390
So we're not going to
assume the null hypothesis

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.135
and say, well what is the
probability of getting a

00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:25.135
difference between 2015
and 2000 that is at least

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.290
as large as the one that we got.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.850
And in that probability is less
than our significance level

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.000
then we would reject our null hypothesis

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.350
and that would suggest the alternative.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.880
If that probability is greater
than our significance level,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.270
then we fail to reject the null hypothesis

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.920
and we fail to have evidence
for the researchers suspicion.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.060
So let's move ahead with that.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.690
So what we wanna do, let's
come up with a Z value,

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.590
or a Z score.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.590
So our Z is going to be
equal to a sample proportion

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.030
in 2015 minus our sample
proportion in 2000.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.190
All of that over a
standard deviation of the

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.470
sampling distribution of
the difference between

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.470
the sample proportions in 2015 and 2000.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.610
Now, this is going to be,
and I will say approximately

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.860
equal to, we can calculate
this numerator exactly,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.850
but this denominator we
are going to estimate.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.960
So this numerator is going
to be, let's see, in 2015,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.260
I'll use some different
colors, 2015 we have 228

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.550
cases out of 600.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.030
So it's 228 out of 600.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.030
And then in 2000, we have
132 cases out of 400.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.090
So minus 132 over 400.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.830
And then all of that over the square root.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.870
And what we use in the denominator here,

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.123
under the radical sign, is we
use the combined proportion.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.690
Could write that as P hat sub C.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.330
And the reason why we use
the combined proportion,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.920
we talked about this in previous videos,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.480
is remember, when we do a hypothesis test,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.960
we assume that our null
hypothesis is true.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.490
And if our null hypothesis
is true there's no difference

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.730
between our proportions in 2015 and 2000.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.100
And so to get a better estimate
of the true proportion,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.470
well we should just add up our samples.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.030
So our sample size would be 600 plus 400

00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:36.864
and the number of cases of
myopia would be 228 plus 132.

00:05:39.605 --> 00:05:40.438
Plus 132.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.290
Which would get us to,
what is this, 360 over 1000

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.570
which is equal to 0.36.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.720
And there, and we can use
that inside the expression

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.650
when we're trying to estimate
our standard deviation

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.570
of this sampling distribution.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.410
So this is going to be
0.36 times one minus 0.36,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.410
which would be 0.64 over
the sample size in 2015,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.180
which is 600, plus 0.36 times 0.64

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.310
over the sample size in
2000, which is equal to 400.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.810
And let's see, before I
even get my calculator out,

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.770
I think I can simplify this a little bit.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.770
228 over 600, 228 divided
by 6 is going to be

00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:39.623
equal to 38, so this would be 0.38.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.520
Let's see, 132 divided
by four would be 33,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.513
so this would be 0.33.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.080
And so our entire numerator
is going to be 0.05, 0.05.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.530
And so noW I can put
this into my calculator

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.530
and I will get 0.05 divided
by the square root of,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.910
let's see, I'm gonna have
0.36 times 0.64 divided by 600

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.900
plus 0.36 times 0.64 divided
by 400 is going to get me

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.430
approximately 1.61.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.023
So this is going to be approximately 1.61.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.900
And so one way to think about it is,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.010
the difference that we got
between our sample proportions,

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:50.010
between 2015 and 2000 of 0.05,
but that is 1.61 standard

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.100
deviations above our mean of
our sampling distribution,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.840
if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.800
And so from this, we can
calculate our P value.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.420
Remember, our P value,
our P value is equal to

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.020
the probability that our Z
score is at least that big,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.023
is greater than or equal to 1.61.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.467
And one way to think about
it, if you look at the

00:08:17.467 --> 00:08:20.440
sample distribution, I
really could just look at any

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.030
normal distribution now
since we normalized for a Z,

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.820
so we're looking at 1.61 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.540
So Z is equal to 1.61.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.300
So we're thinking about
this area right over here.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.580
That would be our P value.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.023
And to help us with that,
we can get out a Z table.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.490
And we see this Z table
gives us the cumulative area

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.090
up to some Z score, and
so we would just have to

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.260
whatever this gives us, we would just

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.830
have to do one minus that.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.830
So if we go to 1.61, we get 0.9463.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.740
So it would be one minus 0.9463.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.740
Is equal to one minus
0.9463, which is equal to,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.230
let's see, it's 0.0537.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.170
And notice, this P value
is ever so slightly higher

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.630
than our significance level.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.890
But this is why we wanna
set our significance level

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.723
ahead of time.

00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.360
We don't wanna get tempted
to say oh, I'm so close,

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.100
let me just raise my significance
level a little bit more

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.010
so that I can reject my null hypothesis

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:34.480
and then I can have something

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.910
that I can tell my friends about.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.310
No, that would not be good science.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.150
That would not be good statistics.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.220
We have to be disciplined.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:47.220
So here, because our P
value, our P value is greater

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.330
than our significance level,
even though it's very,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.200
it's by a very small amount,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.200
we fail to reject our null hypothesis.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.900
And another way to think about
it, in terms of the context

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.190
of the question, we can
say that there is not

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.190
enough evidence to suggest that myopia

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.170
becoming more common over time.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.170
Myopia becoming more common over time.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.723
And we're done.
