00:00:01.124 --> 00:00:03.290
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): Sal
Khan lives in California,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.170
outside of San Francisco.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.840
Sara Shadid, halfway
around the globe in Dubai.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.420
Their lives are interconnected,
but Khan doesn't know it.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.470
This is a story
about how one man

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.190
is helping to educate
the world, but has never

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.110
seen any of his
students face to face.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.030
DAN SIMON: Where does
this passion come from?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.510
SALMAN KHAN: I think I've
always enjoyed teaching.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.301
DAN SIMON (NARRATING):
It's about a man who

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:29.300
gave up a lucrative
career in Silicon Valley

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.090
for what might look
like a boring desk job.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.184
SALMAN KHAN: Right now,
I'm cash flow negative.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:36.350
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): But
it was never about money.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.550
And with his drive
and education,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.530
Khan could have made millions.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.620
He was valedictorian
of his high school,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.690
with a perfect math
score on the SAT.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.770
Then came MIT, Bill Clinton
handing him his diploma.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.850
Next, Harvard Business School.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.600
He was lured into hedge
funds and did well.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.815
But Khan, who has a wife and
son to support, gave it up.

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:00.190
SALMAN KHAN: A lot of people
thought I was kind of crazy.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.030
Obviously, when every
waking hour you have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030
you would sneak into a
room and make math videos

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.010
and put them on YouTube, people
kind of question what's up.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.760
DAN SIMON (NARRATING):
Here's what's up --

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.910
Khan's YouTube videos.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.030
SALMAN KHAN (ON YOUTUBE): Let's
do a couple more examples,

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.120
and I think you might get it.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.536
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): They've
been clicked on more than 9

00:01:16.536 --> 00:01:18.890
million times from
users around the world.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.842
The topics range from math
to chemistry to economics.

00:01:22.842 --> 00:01:24.300
SARA SHADID: From
every curriculum,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.330
they can use the videos.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.590
He's really helpful.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.256
DAN SIMON (NARRATING):
One of his users,

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:32.250
19-year-old college sophomore
Sara Shadid in Dubai.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.420
She says the videos
made all the difference

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.720
in helping her conquer calculus.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.750
SARA SHADID: Before
each and every exam,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.970
I take two days checking
all of his videos

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.050
and understanding the
small details he explains.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.120
DAN SIMON: This
gigantic virtual school

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680
originates from the
smallest of places,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.130
from a tiny converted closet
inside Sal's master bedroom.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.450
This is where he's able to
reach an estimated 80,000

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.442
knowledge-seeking users a month.

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.650
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): It
all started a few years ago

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.510
when a cousin wanted some
online math tutoring.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.290
Pretty soon, other
relatives started

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.030
asking for similar help.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.160
Suddenly, people he didn't
know started watching.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.810
DAN SIMON: People must
have put in math terms,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.060
and suddenly they find you.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.450
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, I think
that's just completely right.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.970
It's that small
subset of people who

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.250
go to YouTube and do a
web search for greatest

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.289
common divisor.

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:23.580
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): People
did it, and it caught on.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.920
It's now called
the Khan Academy.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.640
The videos are short and simply
produced-- only his voice--

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.530
SALMAN KHAN (ON VIDEO): So
that's your slope of the--

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.738
DAN SIMON (NARRATING): With
a simple black background

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:33.570
and graphics.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.153
SALMAN KHAN: There
are a lot of people

00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:39.040
who need help with
math, science, whatever.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.920
And I think they find
these YouTube videos

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.172
as kind of the ideal nuggets
to fill in their gaps.

00:02:44.172 --> 00:02:45.880
DAN SIMON (NARRATING):
These mini classes

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.000
filled in Sara Shadid's gaps,
who says she and her friends

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.590
refer to Khan as the man
with the colored fonts.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.860
Whatever you call
him or his teachings,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.940
the success of his site
has validated that decision

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.290
to walk away from hedge funds.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.820
