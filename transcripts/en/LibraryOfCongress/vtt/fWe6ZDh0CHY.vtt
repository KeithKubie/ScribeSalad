00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.690
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.990
If I could ask you to take a seat.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.130
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.190
I'm the Director of the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.770
of Congress and on behalf of the
staff, I want to welcome you today

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.430
for what is the latest presentation
of our Botkin Lecture Series

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330
and I should say this is the
first presentation of 2016

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.230
and it's a very special
presentation.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.540
The Botkin Series for the
American Folklife Center allows us

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.840
to do a few things.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.740
Most importantly, it allows
us to present the latest

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.000
and best scholarship in folklore,
ethnomusicology, oral history,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.660
and cultural heritage
studies of all kinds.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.770
But also is an important strategy
for us regarding acquisitions.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810
These lectures are
tape-recorded and will become part

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.730 position:56%
of our permanent collections at the
library, so if you want to come back

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.810
and listen to it you can, but it
also will eventually be prepared

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.570 position:56%
for webcast so that it can be shared

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.590
with Internet patrons
throughout the world

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.600
who obviously cannot make it here.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.840
So with that said or that caveat,
if you have a cell phone turned

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.620
on please take a moment
to turn it off.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.190
And now to the special part, this
is a special lecture today for us

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.580
because it allows us to
celebrate one of our partners

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.280
and collaborators, The
Country Dance and Song Society

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.920
who are celebrating their
centennial this year.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.390
Our correspondence files at the
American Folklife Center are full

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.850
of letters dating back to 1974
between the two organizations

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.460
and over the years, has
donated books to our collections

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.960
and we've collected a
full run of the magazine

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.050
"Country Dance and Song."

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.420
We helped plan the move of CDSS's
library from a private home

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.820
to the University of New Hampshire

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.080
and CDSS awarded AFC a grant
a few years ago to help

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.710
in the digitization of our James
Madison Carpenter collection

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.620
which was terrific and
we're so thankful and CDSS

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.240 position:56%
and AFC have collaborated on several
successful lecture and dance events

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.830
over the years celebrating
the acquisitions

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.990
of the Anthony Grant
Barrand Collection.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.410
So continuing in this
long tradition,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.470
when I first came here a few
years ago, I was pleased to meet

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.010 position:56%
with CDSS's Executive Director Rima
Dael here at the Library of Congress

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.550
about how the American Folklife
Center could be involved

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.880
and could support the
centennial celebration of CDSS

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.660
and to plan today's lecture
and dance demonstration.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.510
So let's just take a moment
to give a round of applause

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.510
to Country Dance and Song Society.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.620
[ Applause ]

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.830
And here's to another 100 years,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.660
though we probably won't be
there then, but anyway now,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.870
allow me to introduce today's
speaker Dr. Graham Christian.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.320
Graham Christian is a dance
historian, English dance leader,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.370 position:56%
choreographer, director and
musician for Amherst, Massachusetts.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.990
He holds a doctorate in 17th
century English literature

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.360
from the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.290
and he is also a librarian who
holds a master's degree in library

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.350
and information science from
Simmons College; a Renaissance man.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.700
In addition to having authored
"The Playford Assembly," which were

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.980
for sale out there today and
I think have sold out in fact,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.570
he writes the Dance History
column, "Tell Me More,"

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.690
for the CDSS newsletter
and appears as caller

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.100 position:56%
for English country dances all over
the U.S. and is a frequent presenter

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.670
at academic conferences
lecturing and talking

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.710
about the history of social dance.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.440 position:56%
And I also want to welcome and
thank him, because he donated a copy

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.410
of "The Playford Assembly"
to our collections today

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.170
so we're very appreciative of that.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:42.110
But with so with all of that
said now, please join me

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.510
in welcoming today's Botkin
lecturer, Dr. Graham Christian.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:57.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.530
&gt;&gt; Graham Christian: Well thank
you for those kind remarks

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.670 position:56%
and I also want to thank Nancy
Gross, Jennifer Cutting, Thea Austen

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.100
and my editor at Country
Dance Song Society,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.810 position:56%
Pat McPherson for making this
possible and I'm thrilled to see all

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.920
of you here on a wintery
Saturday afternoon.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.920 position:56%
So thank you for making time for us.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.600
It's a real honor for the
Country Dance and Song Society

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.300
to present a lecture as part
of the Benjamin Botkin series.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.880
Benjamin Botkin's work among
other things was concerned

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.660 position:56%
with addressing the ways in which
folklore can be a force for a change

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.430
in people's lives and
that it is a living thing

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.210
and that forges a deep connection
to the work of Cecil Sharp

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.620
and I'll have occasion to refer to
some degree to Cecil Sharp's work

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.280
as a dance historian
re-constructor and champion

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.570
in the course of my remarks.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.650
So I'm going to speak
fairly informally today,

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.560
so let me give you a sense of the
overall structure of the next hour

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.010
and change, which is that I
will speak for a little while

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.860
about the nature of this kind of
dance that we do and its history.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.820
I'll speak a little bit about
the creation of the book

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.540
and what we hope its
significance will be

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:30.120
and then I will invite
my captive dancers,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.470
my performers who are seated along
the front row here to come up

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.230
and join me and we will show you
some very wonderful characteristic

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.210
dances included in the collection,
but then also say something

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.180
about the form of English
country dance its story

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.240
and then I hope we will have
time for a few questions

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.910
if any have arisen from the course
of our dance or from my lecture.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.850
So, I am very nearsighted.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.410
So I'm fairly confident
that there are many friends

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.280
out in the audience, but I
wouldn't really know that,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.380
so I'm going to make the working
assumption that some number

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.850
of you are only slightly acquainted

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.410
with English country
dance as a form.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.120
So I'll say a few words
about that before I continue

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.130
with my other remarks.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.410
So the English country
dance, what is it?

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.450
Let me start by saying
what it is not.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:38.500
Typical questions that English
country dancers and leaders get.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.300
So, do you dance in fancy costumes?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:43.770
No, not so much.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:49.960
You could, you could turn up at a
ball or an event dressed for 1780

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.050
or 1650 that would be fine
and people would make remarks

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:59.340
about your apparel, but we are
not really historical dancers

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.640
in that sense.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.820
We are not reenactors of a
specific historical moment.

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.210
We are not reenactors.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.520
We are not re-constructors
in that sense.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.110
We are not reliving the moment
of the English Civil War

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:21.060 position:56%
or the American Civil War or Regency
England in Jane Austen's day.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.210
We are not reenactors
in that sense at all.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.950
We are very interested in the
kind of work that those dancers

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.830 position:56%
and their scholars do because they
are invested in the history of dance

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.870
as we are and we trade tips and
comments and some people dance

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:40.750
in both communities, but ours
is a different tradition,

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.520
it's a living tradition
rather than a reconstruction.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.090
Are you members of The Society
of Creative Anachronism?

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.210
No, no we're not.

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.650
Although, a great deal
of very dedicated,

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.990
very interesting scholarship
has come out of the Society

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.360
for Creative Anachronism.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.750
Are you familiar with the
study for Creative Anachronism

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.390
to some degree -- enough?

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.470
Some very interesting material has
come out of the SCA, as well as,

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.200
some interesting new
dances in the style

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.350
of the early Playford generation
dances, but we don't do that.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:28.700 position:56%
Is it that thing where you dance all
in a line in boots and cowboy hats?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.860
No. That's line dancing.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:39.510
It is associated with country
life, but not the same country.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.170
[ Laughter ]

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.800
So are you square dancers?

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.920
Not quite.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.850
And then as a historian I have
to pause and say, square dancing

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.560
as done in this country,
all its forms,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.940
is really a fairly direct lineal
descendant of English country dance

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.970
to what I will sometimes say
is, "No, what we do is more

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.340
like the grandmother
of square dance."

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.530
And then if their eyes have
not glazed over yet I will go

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.690
into somewhat more detail about
the likely train of descendants.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:24.830
Are you countra dancers?

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:30.680 position:56%
Well, many of us are countra
dancers and what I will then say is,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.330
"What we do is more
like the direct ancestor

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.890
of American countra dancing,
American social dancing."

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.910
And one of the last dances that
we will perform altogether,

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.480
The Young Widow, is such
a direct connection.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.270
So one of the things that
you will be reminded of is

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:54.940
that English country dance comes
to this country, no surprise,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.530
with the English colonists
and is very rapidly adopted

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:06.430
and then adapted and changed
already by 1791 collections

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.170
of what I would class really

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.850
as English country dances
are called "contra dances."

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:17.090
They don't have the recognizable
swings and stomps and sweating

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:24.450
of contemporary contra dance.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:28.740
We are not averse to a
good healthful sweat,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.040
but it is a little different.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.100
So we are not any of those things.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:42.080
So English country dance, so
real history; how old is it?

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.510
Anyone's guess.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.210
There are tantalizing indications
in the written record that go back

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:55.560
as far as 1530 and these records
had to do with designating names

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.840
that are later associated with
known English country dance tract,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.670
things like "Trenchmore" and "The
Shaking of the Sheets" and so on.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:09.820
Even better, there are numerous
early written references to a "Hey"

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.260 position:56%
or a "Hey Dugee" which it seems more
and more as we understand the form

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:19.010
and its history better and better
is really probably the core

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:23.230
or the central form of English
country dance; the weaving figure

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.820
which you will see a couple of
manifestations for 3 dancers

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.930
in probably its ur form and
then later sometimes for 4,

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.890
sometimes for 6, occasionally
for 8 and so forth.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:40.020
So there are those references
that go back as far as 1530,

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.990 position:56%
but in the absence of a rather
detailed written choreographic track

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.230
for any of these dances,
a shrewd historian has

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.990
to attach doubt to all of it.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:57.190 position:56%
A shrewd historian has to say, could
be the same but we'll never know.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.400
We'll never know until
we recover a manuscript

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.280
in which someone describes dance in
the way that the first manuscripts

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:12.640
and the first printed collection
of dances give evidence to.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.750
So that first printed collection,
the famous 1651 collection,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.380
it was called the "English
Dancing Master."

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.470
Later editions dropped
English, I think assuming

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.980
that everyone would take
English for granted.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.910 position:56%
And it was printed in 1651 for a
young publisher named John Playford.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:41.310
In 1651, England was
under the protection

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.880
of the commonwealth
under Oliver Cromwell.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:50.360
King Charles I had
lost his head in 1649;

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.120
John Playford was a
fairly unashamed royalist.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.460
He started his publishing career
among other things publishing

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.130
somewhat provocative
pro-royalist tracts.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.660
This was as soon as he earned
his independence as a publisher

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:10.730 position:56%
and this rapidly got him in trouble,
in fact, it got him some jail time

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:18.000
and when he emerged from
pokey he decided to retreat

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.800
to the safer fields of dance
and music and this was one

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.260
of his first publications.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.320
It was a music collection that
he published around the same time

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.360
in collaboration with
his former master.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:35.260
So this had 105 dances
and this was a first,

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.100
there were so many novelties
with this collection.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.190
A bird's-eye overview of the
way that the dancers would look

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.800
in their opening formation.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.740
A description of simple
step sequences,

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.620
mostly singles and doubles.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:59.040
A description of the format
and its typical shapes

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.820
and a verbal description
of the figures.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.280
So where did this collection
come from?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.650
We can be sure of several things.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.250
First, that it was not the
creation of John Playford.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.810
We're grateful to him forever,
but he was primarily a publisher

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.810
and he had a shrewd
eye for a good deal.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.740
He may, may had played
some part as an editor

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.370
in the early dance collections,
but was unlikely to have written

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.800
or created any of the dances.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.740
He was a collector and publisher.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:42.480
And so this collection not written
by him, is likely to be the fruit

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.010
of a long period of gestation.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.840
Some of the dances likely go back
to the turn of the 17th century,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.070 position:56%
some again, temptingly could go back

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.450
to the first quarter
of the 16th century.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.280
So, this was the fruit
of a kind of tradition;

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.990
why publish such a volume is 1651?

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.160
First, public assemblies
were widely discouraged

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.590
by the puritan commonwealth
and this was great opportunity

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:15.390
for private individuals to gather
in their homes and do something;

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.530
you could gamble, you could
drink or you could dance

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.980
and this was a good option.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:25.090
And many of the dances in the early
collections reflect this reality,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.890
dances for small numbers.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:30.710
And we will have a total of
10 dancers a little later

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.370
in the afternoon that you'll see.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.800
And in the early decades of
English country dance post 1651

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.940 position:56%
that would have been a very typical
number, a very small set of longways

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.380
and I'll talk later about
the considerable expansion

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.190
of its popularity, but early on
that would have been very typical.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:58.840
So this form experiences a wide
and immediate success, so wide

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.650
and so immediate that it does lead
one to suppose that some forms

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.260
of these dances had been done
and danced not only in England

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.380
but in other places
even before 1651.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.590
By 1653, etched as just one for
instance, Bulstrode Whitelock's

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:20.590 position:56%
who was Oliver Cromwell's ambassador
to the court of Queen Christina

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:26.360
of Sweden records having endured
many bizarre conversations

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.190
with Queen Christina,
but among other things,

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:32.020
that they did a whole set
of English country dances

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.950 position:56%
and Bulstrode was expected to be
proficient in them and to know them,

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.870
but they already knew
them at the Swedish court.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.950
They just wanted him to
show them his best stuff;

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:46.160
1653 so that's either he
had a copy or he knew them

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.780
and the Swedes knew them.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.720
So that's impressive.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.080
The English Court in exile, the
young Charles II and his mother

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.840
and all of their attendants
fled most of them to France,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.920
some of them to Holland and
Belgium and they took the dance

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.400
with them we are pretty sure.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.720
So the French Court started to
know these dances in the 1650s.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:12.120
In the early 1680s, King Louis
sent one his dancing masters,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.640
Andre Lorin, over to England

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.660
to explore this curious,
interesting new format.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.260
And Andre Lorin notated a number
of dances, brought them back

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:28.890
and wrote them down in an
early visual notation system

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.540
and I may have cause to
refer to that shortly.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.810
So what was novel about this dance?

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.810
Why does it take off as it does?

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.350
And it will expand
considerably as you'll see.

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.680
What's novel about this dance?

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.880
Well, social dancing
has been us forever.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:50.610
I've always thought you
could just swing a stick

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.220
at a rock somebody will
hop up and down to it.

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:00.660
But this is novel because the
large group social dancing

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.540
up to this point in Europe
had largely consisted of sort

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.270
of like a conga line
but hand-in-hand rather

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.470
than waist-to-waist, so going
around and around in a room

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.830
with a step sequence; I'm
being a little dismissive

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.240
because there's some
really interesting forms,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.850
but a lot of circles and
lines and a lively movement,

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.950
you can see some evidence of
that in Brueghel's paintings,

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:28.060
he has a famous painting
of "The Kermis Fair."

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:33.560 position:56%
And you can see the kind of activity
there, often it's seen as heartiness

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:40.420
and such rural customs, or there
were some solo steps you could do,

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.720
the galliard.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.160
There were some couple dances
that you could do like the volta,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.840
but this format, this
English country dance format,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.680
was quite distinctive
because in the line dance

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.910
or the circle dance you
catch on eventually,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.390
you figure it out eventually.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.180
Everybody draws you into the
movement and you catch on.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.660
In solo dance or dance for two
people, it's either a performance

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.900
for you and your friends or your
courtiers or you can operate

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.090
in happy disregard every
other couple on the floor.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.890
You and your partner could
be doing the volta like mad

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.270
and everybody else can be doing
the volta and you don't care.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.640
This dance is distinctive
because it is so much cooperative.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:33.310
It necessitates that everyone be
aware, awake and work together

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:37.070
to make the progressions function
properly and to allow everyone

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.820
to participate with a good will.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.390
So that was quite distinctive.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:48.690
It's unlikely that the English
alone devised the format.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.720
There are precidents for the format

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:55.850
in Italian country dance
back into the 15th century.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.420
Who can say who invents
a dance form?

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.060
Maybe the Italians came up
with it, maybe they didn't,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:08.420
but my perception is that for
Italian dancing masters and dancers

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:13.690 position:56%
who had a wide and vey
imaginative social dance repertoire.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.320
This kind of longways
format with the progression,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.870
and I'll talk about that in
a second, was but one arrow

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.720
in their quiver, they could
do so many other things.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.260
Here is Chiaranzana and it does
this thing, on to the next.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.940
But that the English seized
upon it with the will,

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.140
that they understood this as
somehow congenial to their sense

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.170
that there was precedence
and there was rank

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.900
and that were leading people

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:48.120
and following people,
but not too much so.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.210
And as English political life and
English social life progressed,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.470
it became I think a better
and better mirror of the way

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.050
that they saw the world, and I'll
talk more about that in a moment.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:03.480 position:56%
So the progression format, the other
distinctive feature in addition

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.400
to the longways, so in the
progression format you must work

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.700
with other people.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.660
You have a partner as you
often would in a couple dance

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.950
and you move together in
cooperation with other couples up

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.000
and down what is called a
longways, and at the end

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.770
of a progressive figure you have
moved on and danced with a new set.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.650
So that's really the
heart distinctive figure

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:37.060
of the Europeans get
fascinated with.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.750
The English continued to dance
in a somewhat older format,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.920
which we call the set dance,
for a relatively long time.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.730
They, and the set dance
is a format you will see,

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.750
the set dance will be the first
dance that we will do altogether

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:57.840 position:56%
and that set dance will evoke that
classic English country dance figure

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:01.650
of the "hey," and what
you will see in effect is

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:05.900
that the hey progresses people and
then returns them to their places.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.000
So there's no final
progressive figure.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.820
There were dances for
fixed numbers of people

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.700 position:56%
where there was progression, so
that you would have a leading couple

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.930 position:56%
and then the next couple would lead
and then the next couple would lead,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:19.440
but this sort of ur format

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.660
of the set dance there is no
progression in that true sense.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:28.480
And the English continued to use
that form at least through 1670

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.300
which was the 4th edition
of "The Dancing Master."

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:37.400
After 1670, the English in effect
stopped creating new dances

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.700
for fixed numbers of people.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:47.640
It's all longways progressive
dances for another 120 or so years.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.760
There is a footnote to make on
the realities of the set format,

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.290
which I will make in a moment.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:24:03.010
So the French invest some time
and energy into understanding

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.390
and then notating the format.

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.650
Lorin's format was examined
carefully and then revised

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.310
and altered substantially by
two gentlemen named Beauchamp

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.150
and Feuillet and they
were interested

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.200
in discovering choreographing
a notation system

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:24.310 position:56%
which would spare one -- once one
understood the complex symbol system

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:26.560
-- the necessity of words.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.790
And for simpler English
country dances, contra dance,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.640
it was fairly easy to
notate in this format.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:39.400 position:56%
The significance of this for English
country dance aficionados was

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.750
that it meant that now
the form could easily

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.410
and rapidly become international.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.930
So once you had your collection,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.040
once you had your [foreign word]
Nouveau Contra Dance of the year so

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.080
and so and so or 1712,
whatever it might be,

00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:00.380 position:56%
you could read off the page once you
understood the notation system no

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.000
matter your language.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.500
So that then the form could spread
rapidly to Belgium, to Holland,

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.480
to Germany, to France, of
course, to Spain, to Italy so all

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.730
of those countries could rapidly
read off the notational format

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:18.510
and create their own
dances in the form.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:23.460
And it's my perception that
these combined factors,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:28.300 position:56%
the appeal of the quasi or gradually
democratic nature of the form,

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:33.250
and it's accessibility through
this notational system assured its

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.270
international success
and between 1650

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.460
and let's say 1820-1825 something

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.670
like 30,000 English country
dances were published

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:50.000
which is an extraordinary
record and if you include some

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.730
of the related formats such
as the coterie, the cotillion

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.620
and alternate format dances
that are created in Spain,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.620
in Italy and again in France.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.550
The number is certainly that
high and probably higher

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.530
and in this country too as well,

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:14.470
so those early contra dances
are certainly within the family.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.980
There were some considerable
changes in style and format

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.420
as the dance form went along.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:25.790
Early on, it seemed like an obvious
descendent of a renaissance dance,

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.970
they wouldn't have
called it that at time,

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:32.420 position:56%
but what we now term renaissance
dance with step sequences of singles

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.510
and doubles of rather processional
feeling to many of the dances,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:41.050
but there's a fairly rapid change
particularly as the French catch

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:45.210
on to the form and an effort
to incorporate the latest

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:52.250
in fancy footwork from France --
and this underscores its success.

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:59.690
The French with their somewhat
more teared social system almost

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.240
instantly become uncomfortable
with the political implications

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:10.960
of longways and they immediately
reinvent it as early cotillon

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.340 position:56%
or later it would called cotillions.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.400
The early cotillon were dances for
two couples, again, non-progressive

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.910 position:56%
so a fixed number and then for three
couples or three and three dancers

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:26.920
and then for four couples.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:31.730
And that format the four couple
square dance cotillon gets

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:38.660
reintroduced in England
in the 1760s, 1767-1768

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.220
and that is an immediate success

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:49.010
and thereafter the cotillion shares
the stage with country dances

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:55.470
in England and elsewhere
really through around 1815

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.920
at which point another
thing happens which is

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.390
that the quadrille is devised.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.550
The quadrille -- it is
not a true descendent

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:07.930
of the cotillion or cotillon.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:14.680 position:56%
The format of the cotillion was
this; it was in effect a step dance,

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:22.270 position:56%
a dance for a fixed number and there
were unchanging bracketing figures,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.820
circles, stars, circle
for men, circle for women.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.010
And those nine or ten
figures depending

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:34.130
on which dancing master you ask,
did not change from cotillion

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.720
to cotillion, but there was a new
figure written that intervened

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:40.520
between the bracketing
figures every time.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:45.290
So in the cotillion format,
once you knew your nine changes

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.950
as they called them,
those fixed figures,

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.270
all you had to learn
was the new figure,

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.450
but it was a relatively long
sequence doing a whole cotillon was

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.340
about ten minutes.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.770
And it was succeeded
by the quadrille

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:04.250
and the quadrille does not
have those intervening those

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.150
characteristic unchanged
figures time to time.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.660
What it has instead is in effect
five simple four-couple square

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.790
dances stuck together, so
they're just stuck together

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:20.060
with five different
tunes to do them to.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:27.500
There was very little variation in
those quadrille dances from 1815

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:33.450
to oh, now, very little change.

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:38.060
Very occasionally a dancing master
in the 1820s, 1840s would try

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.770
to interject a new
dance among the five,

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.330
but generally it doesn't takeoff,

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:47.780
so if you see the lancers quadrille
that's pretty much the quadrille;

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.250
that's pretty much the quadrille.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.190
The advantages of the
quadrille were twofold.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.630
Like the cotillion, it's
a dance for four couples,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.980
so that meant that you
could exclude the riffraff.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.310
You and seven friends could get
together and do your cotillon,

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:10.920
cotillion and make sure that the
wrong element did not get in.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:15.040
And quadrille shared that reality
with it, but the other advantage

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.800
of the quadrille was that
once you knew the five dances,

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.580
you never had to think again.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.250
And so the quadrille with
its relative simplicity

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:27.350
and its exclucivity begins

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.620
to push the English country
dance off the stage after 1815.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:37.060
And its co-conspirator was a dance
of a very different character,

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.090
the shocking-shocking waltz, where
you got to stand belly to belly

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:45.590
with your partner arm and
arm and turnaround the floor

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.050
and now we are back to the
volta; turning around and round

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:49.350
on the floor and happy

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.210
to disregarded every
other couple on the floor.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.830
And so post 1820, the
quadrille in partnership

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:00.410
with some other fairly simple
almost apart again dances

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:05.020
and then interleaved with
mazurkas, waltzes, schottisches,

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.490
and other couple dances, push
the English country dance

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:14.370
out into village life essentially,
out into the American colonies

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:18.230
and out into special
occasions like Fezzywig's Ball

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:21.740
or novelty parties,
dressed up parties.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.240
So you will see English country
dances, whether designated as such

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.310
or not, turn up as occasional
features in ball programs

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.720
through to the end
of the 19th century.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.300
But in effect the form
has all but disappeared.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.550 position:56%
It is a living dance form out in the
villages, but it has been forgotten

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.490
by the greater part of society.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:52.710
So this is the point at which
Cecil Sharp steps into the story.

00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:00.170
On Boxing Day in 1899 he saw a
group of dancers doing, in fact,

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:04.520
a Morris dance and
he was enthralled.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:09.020
Cecil Sharp was a musician and
a music educator at the end

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.850
of the 19th century, into the early
20th century, and he was already

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:20.210
up to his shoulders in the search
for authentic English folk culture

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.000
and he had focused his attention
up to that point largely

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.830
on English folksong, but here
was an opportunity to invest

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:31.660
in what he viewed as
authentic English folk dance.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.810
First the Morris and the
sword, and then he began

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:41.150
to investigate English country
dances done as social dances

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:45.300
and found a number of them
in the villages and some

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:51.710
of those were tenacious
survivals from the high period

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:55.260
of English country dance in the
18th and early 19th century.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.110
Some of them were new
creations for --

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:02.910
that had occurred in the course of
the 19th century in village life.

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.110
And then he began to explore
the Playford collections

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:10.820
and it really is to him
and his pioneering work

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.900
that we owe what we know

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:19.680
about English country dance
and our interest in it.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.200
Cecil Sharp has come in for a great
deal of ribbing in the last 20

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.000
or 30 years for his
sexism, his high-handedness,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.450
for some wishful thinking
that populated his thinking

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:38.380
about English country dance.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:46.510
But I think he deserves much
credit given how little was known

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.930
or understood about the social
environment of the 17th century

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:55.090
in England, of how the notation
system worked, how little was known

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.370
about the Beauchamp-Feuillet
notation system (which Cecil Sharp

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.580
did also investigate, in the course

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.570
of his researches) given
how little was known

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.130
about the social environment
of the time,

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.810
the work that he did was
really extraordinary;

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.640
really-really remarkable.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:17.230
And it is, it's stunning to look
back at his dance interpretations

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:19.180
and see how much he got right.

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:26.350
So that's a really striking
triumph on his part.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.230
So Cecil Sharp having
discovered this dance format,

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:36.090
having begun to investigate it in
the Playford collections and began

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:41.310 position:56%
to publish his findings in "The
Country Dance Book" a book he issued

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:45.620
in six parts, the last at
which was issued posthumously.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:51.900
And he viewed English country
dance as a number of things.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:35:00.650 position:56%
First it was a wholesome and healthy
alternative to the degraded culture

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:04.290
of the early 20th century.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:11.070 position:56%
And there were certain trends and
tendencies that he viewed with alarm

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:18.120
in contemporary culture;
jazz, animal dances.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.350
There were such things.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.260
They were a great craze
across Europe

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.550
and if you would mime being
a great big wooly bear.

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:31.220
The cakewalk, Americanism,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:39.830
and on the other side
the degraded affectations

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.970
of pseudo-classical movement.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:47.790
So being Isadora Duncan
wasn't any better.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.250
And this was wonderful healthy
alternative to all of that.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:36:00.250
And this was an opportunity for
England to claim a distinctive,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:05.960
authentic and rich,
beautiful, home culture.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.750 position:56%
He noted -- had noted even before he
began his researches into dance --

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:15.730 position:56%
he had noted with some dismay that
all across Europe through the course

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:21.330
of the 19th century there had been
waves of cultural nationalism,

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:27.520 position:56%
attempts to both define a national
character and then to find its roots

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.730
and define its parameters.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.030
And you can see this going, running
right through Italian culture,

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:37.860
German culture, French
culture all across Europe:

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.880
finding your great
national dance form,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.180
finding your greatest
national novelist,

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.700
finding your musical style,
finding your national costumes.

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:51.360
The late 19th century is the
great period for national costume.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:55.560
And the English as he
noted, were somehow lacking

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:01.100
when they were trying to do folk
dance it turned out to be Swedish

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.030
and when they sang folksongs
they turned out to be German.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:13.080
And I've forgotten which music
critic it was who derided England

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:17.930
as "The land without
music; das land ohne musik."

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.710
Which must have stung the
English for a longtime.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:28.210
But here was an authentic English
folk culture and better yet,

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:33.060
as with his musician's background
he investigated the tunes assigned

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:38.810 position:56%
to the dances, many, many, many of
them were wonderful, rich folksongs.

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:42.660 position:56%
So there was a rich overlap with the
work that he had already begun to do

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:45.740
in the investigation of
the English folksong.

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:50.050
So here was a full package
of an English folk culture

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.560
that he could embrace
and then champion,

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.770
and champion it he certainly
did, founding a Folk Dance

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.630
and Song Society in England
and coming to this country,

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:05.790
not at all long afterward, in
the midst of the First World War,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:10.180
and founding similar society in
this country with the reasoning

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.880
that given the heavy influx of
English colonization in the 17th

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.330
and 18th century he
was justified in trying

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:24.740 position:56%
to found an English folk dance
society counterpart in this country.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.400
And certainly that was
seized up and embraced

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:30.030
in Boston and New York both.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:34.830
And I will leave aside for a
moment to the 100 year argument

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.430
about whether the Boston Society or
the New York Society is the elder

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.610
and we will just take that
outside later [brief laughter].

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.020
Hard to believe.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.190
So, where does that leave us now?

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:06.710
In 1990, there's an abrupt
for you, in 1990 Jenny Shimer

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:11.980
and Kitty Keller published a
book called, "The Playford Ball."

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:15.200
What was the Playford Ball?

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.170
Well, English country dance in this
country had been through a couple

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:27.830
of waves of success
and then relative ebb.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:33.770
So the success, there had been
a wave of excitement shortly

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.960
after Sharp's visit here

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.190
which justified his
foundation of the society.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.990
And there was another
wave of success

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:45.060 position:56%
in the wake of the Second World War.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:51.510
And there was another in the wave
of flower power and rock and roll

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.500
and all of that back to the
earth good stuff in the 60s,

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.940
so in the 1970s and following
another great wave of success.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.710
And this had had these waves

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.740
of success had had
several implications.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:11.380
In the early generations of the
dancing of the Playford tradition

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:17.600
in this country, the work of
Cecil Sharp was sacrosanct,

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.480
more than he would have desired.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.470
He was in fact, much more
amendable to change and growth

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:30.060
than his immediate followers
assumed, but as ever in the wake

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:34.040
of the charismatic founder you
have to stiffen up the lines.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.360
So there had been a great deal
of worshipful attention directed

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.740 position:56%
to his dance interpretations and it
meant that, as they were understood,

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.880
they were not to be altered
and it meant that one was not

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.570
to question the word of the
founder including not peering

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:55.170
over his shoulder at the original
form of the dances as they appeared

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:58.370
in Playford's collections
and following collections.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:07.660
So in -- then there were
a few rebels early on

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.340
but the principle rebel after Cecil
Sharp was another great charismatic

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.740
leader, Pat Shaw, who thought that
it was more than justified to take,

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.310
as he said, "another
look at Playford."

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.170
So he went back into the Playford
Collections sometimes looking

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:28.170 position:56%
directly over Cecil Sharp's shoulder
at his dance interpretations

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:32.760
and seeing the ways in which Cecil
Sharp had modified those dances

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.980
to suit his taste, his whim,

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:37.630
what he thought the needs
of his dancers might be.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:41.020
And there were many other
collections to look at too.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:45.740
I should mention as a parenthetical
that, in the wake of Playford,

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.580
the Playford family alone did
not publish 30,000 dances,

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.750
so there were many
publishers and many,

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.840
many collections potentially
to look at.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.030 position:56%
So Pat Shaw started to take
another look at Playford collections

00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:02.440
and in his wake, numerous
other interpreters appeared

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:05.990
who got their hands on
small and large collections

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:11.930
by not only the Playford family
but the Rights, the Walshes,

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.500
Johnson collections,
Young collections,

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:19.010
and on and on including
collections from this country.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:27.460
So what it meant in the context of
circa 1990 was a couple of things;

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:31.730
one that there was an
established and, in some ways,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:35.070
unquestioned repertoire and that
there was a birging repertoire

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:38.690
of new interpretations
of historical dances.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:43.290
And much of this material was
fugitive, fugitive in the sense

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:47.880
that Sharp's collections were, I
believe, at that time out of print

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.700
and most of the other
dance interpretations

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:54.720
by newer interpreters were
scattered, hard to get,

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.390
out of print, out of reach.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:43:00.830
And it was Keller and
Shimer's contention

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:06.030
that it would be a good idea to get
their hands around what they viewed

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.520
as the core historical
dance repertoire

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.560
for the English country
dance community

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:16.530
and it was also their contention
that it would serve that community

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:19.790
to know something about the
background of the dances

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.170
and their tunes and their titles
and to have a look at facsimiles

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:28.580
of the first appearances of the
dances in their original form.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:32.790
This was highly controversial
in 1990

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:36.320
and Jenny Shimer unfortunately
died shortly after the publication

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.040
of that book, but Kitty
got a fair amount flack

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.900
about that; how could you?

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:48.580
How dare you in effect prompt us
to question the work of Cecil Sharp

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.650
by allowing to look at the
differences one to the other?

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:58.280 position:56%
But I think that that wave of
controversy subsided fairly quickly.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.510 position:56%
Dancers very rapidly understood what
Cecil Sharp would always have said

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:12.970 position:56%
which is that he was not, was not
recreating 1651 or 1700, he was not.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:18.500 position:56%
He was generating good effective
dances that would serve his dancers,

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.700
his country and his community.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.210
He knew, he knew very
well what he was doing

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.310
and he would not have viewed
it as problematic to look

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.830
at these original sources

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.980
and he himself even
before he died was prepared

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.040
to make certain revisions
to his early suggestions.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:40.690
So he did not view his work
with the kind of fixity

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:43.140
that his immediate followers did.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:48.850
So that collection, The Playford
Ball was, I think it's fair

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:52.620
to say epoch making for the
English country dance community.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:58.500
It did for a longtime define
a repertoire and some number

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:04.260
of dance leaders, at least used
to, refer to it as "the Bible."

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.800
Yes exactly.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:11.460
And have been joking in
perhaps questionable taste

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.170
that now unfortunate we'll
have to refer to that as the

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:18.740
"Old Testament," now we
have the "New Testament"

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.420
which only fulfills the promise
of the old, that's all I'm saying.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.720
We love them both.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:29.990
We love them both --
little theology joke.

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.160
But it was an epoch-making volume

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:36.050
and for quite some time defined
the historical dance repertoire,

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:42.080
but in the 25 years since its
publication 25 and a little,

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.940 position:56%
there have been a number of changes.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.830
The greatest change
is the simple flood

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:53.490
of new historical dance
interpretations largely due

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:58.110
to the work of Kitty Keller
and her husband Bob Keller who,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:02.120
in several years after the
publication of the printed book,

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:09.150
made available scans of every dance
in all of the Playford collections

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:14.800
and that was an extraordinary
gift to the historical community,

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.100
as well as, the dance community.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.620
So that meant not only
that you could peer

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.870
over Cecil Sharp's shoulder
and Pat Shimer's shoulder,

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:24.970
but that you could make your own
finds and find your own dances

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:30.680
to interpret, which has happened
with a vengeance in the last 15

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:36.800
or 20 years, as well as,
intrepid dance scholars

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.530
and dance interpreters finding
dances in other kinds collections,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:44.410
in Walsh collections, in Right
collections and other collections.

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:49.810
And there was an additional little
wave of interest in American dances

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:52.370
of course following
our own bicentennial

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:55.170
which is a little before
the Playford Ball.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:47:01.430
So a huge influence of new-old
repertoire to think about.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:11.010
So those dances just as had been
the case with the dances featured

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:15.170
in the Playford Ball were many
of them in effect fugitive.

00:47:15.170 --> 00:47:19.670
And in many respects this
situation was even worse a couple

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.630
of years ago before I started this
process than it had been in 1990,

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:27.340
because there are so
many interpreters

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.650
and possible places
one could locate dance.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:36.840 position:56%
And many wonderful historical dances
were being passed hand-to-hand

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:43.480
from caller to caller scribbled on
a notecard or Xeroxed desperately

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.760
out of an out of print volume.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:54.020
So it appealed to me several
years ago to approach the English,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.860
the Country Dance and
Song Society and say,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.940
"We should have another collection.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.240
We should have another set."

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:07.860
And for a variety of reasons
that process tailed off,

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.940
but two years ago Pat McPherson
who was the education director

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.760
at Country Dance and Song
Society approached me

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:18.080
to restart the project.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:25.410
And so here we are now, two years
later and with this new collection.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:27.720
And so this new collection,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.830
I'll briefly say before
we begin our dance,

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:37.060
this new collection was
assembled a little bit differently

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.380
from the Playford Ball.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.610
The Playford Ball in effect was
the historical dance repertoire

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.960
of Jenny Shimer, one
of the co-editors,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.900
and as such it reflected the
historical dance repertoire

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:55.060
of her friend and collaborator
May Gadd.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.330
But I wanted a more
democratic process.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:01.730
So I asked, I worked my way

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:07.120
through every new historical
dance interpretation I could find

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:13.540
to glean a few of the best pieces
and I turned to a small committee

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.780
and solicited their opinions
of all of those dances.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.210
I also had a small gallery of
what I called "scouts" who told me

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.470
about favorites of their own

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.430
that I might not know
or might not know well.

00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:36.240
So it was a more democratized
process.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:42.960
And in the creation of this
book I want to do a couple

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:50.430
of new things not only to
assemble 125 dances that we loved

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.240
or we're going to come to love,

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:56.370
but also to continue the great
work of Keller and Shimer.

00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:04.590
So this volume, as its predecessor
does, has background on the tunes,

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.930
the titles, the tracts
and the movements

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.790
which sometimes is a
different question.

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:16.590
And I wanted even more than the
Playford Ball, than Kitty had time

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:20.400
to do in her creation of
Playford Ball, to give a sense

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.210
of the context of the dances.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.480
As I say in the book,
"The past is gone.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.880
I will not return.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:35.200
We cannot recreate 1670 or 1730,
but these dances, their tunes,

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.170
their titles invoked a rich web
of association for the people

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.530 position:56%
who danced them when they were new."

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:45.740
And I'll briefly talk a little
bit about some of the context

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.980 position:56%
for individual dances as we do them.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.990
So those dances and their tunes
carried meaning in a way that is --

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:59.990
I think is worthwhile to
try to recover and for me,

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:05.550
that stands at the heart of part
of the project of the book which is

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:12.860 position:56%
to continue to evoke the dances as
a living tradition and to the degree

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:18.100
that I cannot only offer these
dances to contemporary dancers

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:24.220
and dance historians, but to
reawaken the train of associations

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:32.460
that connects us now not only to
each other but to the interpreters

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:37.080
who have come before as Christine
Helwig or Fried Herman or Pat Shaw

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.160
or Cecil Sharp, but back on through
them, through these rich tunes

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.220
and the world that they evoke all
the way back to the dance floors

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:53.870
of 1612 or 1788 and to me that's
the power of the tradition.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:52:01.000
And for us, for these dances,
we dance them as social dances.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.210
They are, as we say the
Country Dance and Song Society,

00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:09.520
we are after the performative arts.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:14.350
It's one reason that we, you will
not see our dancers in a uniform.

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.040
We're not all wearing
black and white.

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:22.320
We're not all wearing cocked
hats, because we come to this

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.570
as social dancers as
they would have done

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.720
in the 17th and the 18th century.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:31.310
We come not exactly as we are, but
we come as we would like to be.

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:37.120
We come to the dance floor
with best foot forward,

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.020
but we come out of social life

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:42.960
and it's an expression
of social relationship.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:49.200
It's a way to create a transitory
but meaningful art altogether

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.970
and so I think, I'm almost
at the end of my remarks,

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:58.200
and I think I can say that that's
a pretty good case for thinking

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:04.410
of English country dance in
its American cousin format

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:11.050
as an authentic living folk culture
with deep connections to the past.

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:17.700
Alright, I'm going to
conclude where my book begins.

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:24.470
I'll go in reverse order of
the epigraphs, so two epigraphs

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:30.710
to my book; one from Carl
Whitman who has been long dead now

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:38.000
but he was a very smart historian
of the Playford tradition

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.500
and a champion of
gender-role-neutral dancing

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.700
which I will explain out
in the lobby afterward

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.750
if you're interested.

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:46.510
Here's the word from Carl Wittman,

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.650
"The country dance form can be
thought of as an exquisite vessel

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:53.140
in itself beautiful in
shape highly abstract.

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.940
We can choose to feel this vessel
with whatever meaning we like,

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:58.870
if we like we can pursue
a particular friendship.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:01.030
We can rejoice in a
sense of community.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:04.880
We can see in the music and dance
the highest of spiritual values;

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.000
We can see it as good fun.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.840
The dances all of these and greater
than all of them and as teachers

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.200
and dancers we must strive
to perceive the dance

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.550
in its most abstract and
neutral form so as not

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:20.640
to impose our particular
meaning onto others.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.570
The wonderful treasure
which is has been passed

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:25.740
down to us is the spirit,
the infrastructure,

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.880
this has manifested itself in
various ways through the centuries

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.110
and continues today
in this new form."

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:35.240
And here's a word from
Friedrich Schiller,

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.750
the German dramatist and poet.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:40.520 position:56%
"The first law of human relations is

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.200
to respect the freedom
of the other person.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:46.970
The second law is to act
out your own freedom.

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.270
Fulfilling these laws at precisely
the same time is extremely

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:54.840
difficult, but essential for
harmonious social relations.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:58.540 position:56%
I know of no better example for
seeing these laws operating together

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:01.600
in practice than in the
figures of a well-danced,

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.260 position:56%
well-composed English country dance.

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.170
A spectator sees countless
movements crossing

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:12.260
in an infinite variety everything
takes place in such a way

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.870
that one has already
made room for the other.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:18.450
Everything fits so cleverly
and yet artlessly together;

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:22.300
it is the most perfect example
of an individual freedom

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:25.340
and the respected freedom
of the other."

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.510
Thank you.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:40.400
[ Applause ]

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.700
Thank you.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.280
I will invite my dancers and
my musicians to the stage.

00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:07.140
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.790
Go ahead and form up.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:17.820
So the first dance I will
not be in, so I will show it:

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:22.460
the dancers will show you without
my assistance except a few words

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:23.760
from me.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.850
This is "Graise Inne Maske."

00:56:25.850 --> 00:56:28.200
It does come from the first edition

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.920
of Playford's English
Dancing Masters, 1651.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.210
This an interpretation
by Fried de Metz Herman

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:38.000
and the dance is interesting
for a couple of reasons;

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.340 position:56%
one is that it is this fixed format,

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:43.700
so you'll see the dancers
interact substantially

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:49.700
but they'll end exactly where
they begin; it is also old.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.890
It's not only 1651, but the
tune certainly goes back to 1613

00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:59.180
and the dance in some form may
have been danced as early as that.

00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:06.980 position:56%
The tune is by Giovanni Coprario and
it's associated with a song uttered

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:13.140
by Tom O' Bedlam who was a
folkloric madman figure and so

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.060
and the dance is associated
with the wedding festivities

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.240
of James I's daughter Elizabeth

00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.430
and her husband Frederick
Elector Palatine in 1613.

00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:28.870
Graise Inne was one of the
residential Inns for lawyers

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:33.800
in the city of London and this
tune certainly in the song featured

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.610
as part of the entertainment
offered for that wedding couple.

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:40.020
So the dance may be
almost 50 years older

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:43.380
than its first publication
date in some format and I want

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:48.330
to ask the dancers to show a "hey
for three," so along the men's line

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.840
and that middle woman there,
Joanna, she's a guy for right now.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.140
She is a dude.

00:57:54.140 --> 00:58:00.150
So the three men are going
to show you a hey for three

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.040
and it is a weaving figure.

00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.210 position:56%
The dancers make figure eight tracks
on the floor if you think of them

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.170
as being followed by
little chalk marks

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:11.370
on the floor you'll
see loops of eights.

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:13.850
Joanna is starting in
the middle of the eight

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:18.450
and the two Davids are starting at
each end of the eight, so go ahead

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:20.240
and do a hey for three right
shoulder, [wordless singing].

00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.560
You see that loop?

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.220
And they end where they began.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:31.810
So there it is the hey, the
Hey Duggee which is sort

00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.590
of a heart-home figure home
figure for English country dance.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.450
So I will be prompting my
dancers off the microphone,

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:41.400
you'll hear me anyway
given this hall,

00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.610
I'll just say as a historical
note that would not have happened

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.330
in the 17th or 18th century.

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:50.950
My instruction would all have
happened either in their homes

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:53.510
or at my private dancing academy

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:58.250
and I probably wouldn't have ranked
enough to be invited to the dance

00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.790
where they did the dance.

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:04.030
So the idea of prompting
as dancers move

00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:07.270
and that dancing master attending
the event wouldn't have happened,

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:09.330
but here we are 2016.

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:17.710
Alright, so we will start
double back start right here.

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:19.510
We're ready.

00:59:19.510 --> 01:01:04.080
[ Music/Dance ]

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.380
To your own wall!

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.180
[inaudible instructions
for the dancers]

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:34.510
[ Music/Dance ]

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:43.890
[ Applause ]

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.940
So that was "Graise Inne Maske."

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.640
And you note that one of
the characteristics of some

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.330
of the older dances was a strong
duple meter and it changes.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:55.630
The sub-divisions change.

01:01:55.630 --> 01:02:00.070
You get double sub-divisions
dum-pum-pum [wordless singng].

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:05.290
The basic strong meter is duple.

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:10.410
And it takes them a while
to embrace other meters.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:20.050 position:56%
But we'll see that in the very next
dance, which is "News from Tripoli."

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:23.110
[pause]

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:28.970
So this dance is in the
meter or the musical format

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:31.280
that is sometimes called
the hornpipe.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.610
The old English hornpipe,
disticinct from, not the same as,

01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:39.650
the sailor's hornpipe, which is a
duple meter dance and form which is

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:45.030 position:56%
about one hundred or one hundred and
fifty years later than this form.

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.760
But here it is, the triple meter.

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.730
And it was a wonderful
feature of English music

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:56.380
in the late seventeenth century
into the early eighteenth century.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.170
Beautiful tune.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:03.670 position:56%
Let me say a little about the
baffling title, "News from Tripoli."

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:08.310
Very little to do with the
country or the location.

01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.470
And, I said to a friend of mine two
years ago, "When I know what 'News

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:16.670
from Tripoli' means I
will be almost done."

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:18.300
Sure enough I do.

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:22.090
And it was a catch phrase
used in the coffee houses

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:29.850
that were a feature of English
life from the 1660s forward

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:32.860
until tea took over, essentially.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.390
The coffee houses that were
called the "penny universities,"

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:39.070
where anyone could come
in and have a sip and talk

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:42.300
to the likes of Jonathan Swift.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:50.780
"News from Tripoli" is your
warm up for a crummy joke,

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.470
generally of the toast-master
variety.

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:57.980
Such as "The news from Tripoli is
that a shoemaker is the best man

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:02.360
to make a constable because
he can put a man in the stocks

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.710
and ease him at the last."

01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:07.010
[Audience groans] You see?

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.140
You see? It's the kind of joke
you follow with "Wah, wah."

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.060
Yeah, terrible, terrible jokes.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.350
But it was a standard in the coffee
houses, and often the waiter,

01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:19.530
the coffee boy, would come
up and say "What's the news?

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:20.830
What's the news from Tripoli?

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:22.310
What can I get you sir?"

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:25.690
And perhaps he would be
punished by hearing one of these.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:27.480
But the tune is just splendid.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.800 position:56%
So the tune is absolutely rewarding.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.060
We're going to show
you the first figure.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:38.830
So the figure of eight, which is
different kind of a weaving figure,

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:44.220
and we are going to show you this
variant of it, which is a "cast,"

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.360
which means looping out to move

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:50.370
to a neighboring place
and a weaving figure.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:54.180
Again, we are doing eight tracks
on the floor, but it is a figure

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:58.320
for two, so it is in a way a
refinement of the old "hey."

01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.980
So we are going to
show you, these four,

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:02.910
and our neighbors will
accomodate us by moving.

01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:08.940
We cast, and here the figure
eight starts, here is a loop --

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:13.020
one loop of the eight, and we pass,

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:17.090
and here is the other
loop of the eight.

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:20.570 position:56%
But, you know, England is sort of
democratic so they get to do it too.

01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:22.950
So they cast, we move.

01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:30.460
They go around thier partner,
around their neighbors,

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.250
back to their original places.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.700
So that's not the progressive
figure,

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.000
that happens a little later on.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.700
So here it is, the figure of
eight on the diagonal with a cast.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.670
And it opens "News from Tripoli."

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:44.810
[to the performers] So let's do,
I think let's do three times.

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:48.510
Three times the tune.

01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:42.260
Now we move -- that
was a dance from 1701.

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.800
Now we move forward to 1766.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:50.450
This will be "Round About Our Coal
Fire," a very, very popular tune,

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:52.440
sometimes called "Old
Simon, the King."

01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.590
In are many, many variants which
are spelled out in the book,

01:08:56.590 --> 01:09:01.090
which you may have for yourself.

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:05.110
This is a wonderful dance and
a wonderful tune and a tune

01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:08.770
that you may recognize
from other uses.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:12.300 position:56%
It seems suitable for this
occasion because this dance and tune

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.790
and the name were really associated
with this season of the year.

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:20.870
The phrase came back into
circulation in the 1730s

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:23.140
with a book called "Round
About Our Coal Fire"

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.270
by the pseudonomous Tom Merryman.

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:30.440
And he says very specifically, "The
dancing and singing by the Benchers

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:32.770
in the great inns of
court in Christmas is

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:35.060
in some sort founded upon"
-- and so on and so on --

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.590
"for they hold, as I am informed,
some privelige by dancing

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:41.680
about the fire in the middle of
their hall and singing the song

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.000
of "Round About Our Coal Fire."

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.490
Here we are.

01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:48.760
And, he says "Country dancing
is one of the chief exercises.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.930
Moll Peatly and the Black
Joak are never forgot.

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.480
These dances stir the
blood and give the males

01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.960
and females a fellow feeling

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:58.840
of each other's activity,
ability, and agility."

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:03.620
So we're going to show you
one of the figures here.

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.430
So, before I get into the longways,

01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:08.140
I am going to ask the
dancers to show you.

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.080
As you saw the "hey for three,"

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.320
that core English country dance
figure in "Graise Inne Maske."

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:17.000
And now we are going to get a
little variant of it with the ones

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.440
that are closest to you here.

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.270
And we'll just show
you in the top four.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:24.190
They will be will be
doing a "hey for three."

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:25.790
How is this to be done
with with two people?

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:27.090
Well, it isn't.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:29.320
The twos will abet them.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.700
The second woman will come
in and she will do a hey

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:36.090
for three passing her corner
left, go ahead Caroline.

01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:39.440
So there is that weave,
the eights on the floor.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.650
The second man comes
in and takes over.

01:10:41.650 --> 01:10:44.560
He passes his right
corner shoulder to begin.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.660
So there it is, that core figure.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.350
The weave, the hey.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:52.420
So this is "Round About
Our Coal Fire."

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:57.040
As was increasingly popular in
dances from the 1730s forward,

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.850
this is what they called
the "double dance."

01:10:58.850 --> 01:11:02.720
What they meant by that was,
you heard the tune twice quite

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.200
through to do the dance
once through.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:08.850
So you will here the tune start
again before we finish our

01:11:08.850 --> 01:11:10.150
progressive figure.

01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:13.510
So here it goes."

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:30.510
[inaudible instructions
to performers]

01:11:30.510 --> 01:15:50.510
[Music]

01:15:50.510 --> 01:16:01.080
[applause]

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:05.830
So now we move to America,
as I promised.

01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:10.860
The great dance from these
shores is the composition

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:16.280
of a fellow named John Griffiths
who was a dancing master primarily

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:21.060
in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut, and then in New York

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:22.920
where he seems to have settled.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.420
This is "The Young Widow."

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:31.760
The prevailing format of English
country dance was what we now call

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.130
-- they wouldn't have
said so at the time --

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.860
but we now call it triple minor,

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:39.230
meaning that you have a leading
couple and two supporting couples.

01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:41.840
One of the innovations
of Cecil Sharp was

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:45.620
to democratize the form
whereever possible and conveniant

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:49.600
to make every other couple active,
and most of the dance tracts make

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.010
that possible, not all of them.

01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:56.430
But this dance with its
wonderful sprightly tune is,

01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:00.960
I think, a real masterpiece.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:04.950
And it was Griffith's work.

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:10.840
And it as a fabulous progressive
figure and the perfect thing

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.890
for a burgeoning democracy.

01:17:12.890 --> 01:17:17.560 position:56%
The ones lead for a little while and
then, with the greatest ingenouity,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.910
the twos and threes
take over the action

01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:22.420
and control their own destinies.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:26.870
They make their progression
happen around the ones.

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:31.130
So its a great moment and
you will see it in operation.

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:41.510
[inaudible instructions
to performers]

01:17:41.510 --> 01:19:55.510
[Music]

01:19:55.510 --> 01:20:06.680
[applause]

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:09.360
We will do one more dance for
you, we have just enough time.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.070
We will go back, we'll
go back a few decades

01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:16.900
to "Barbarini's Tambourine"
[sounds from audience] Oh,

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.020
it has it's own fan club!

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:24.810
That's fine, I am a
great fan of this.

01:20:24.810 --> 01:20:28.580
I can't think of a dance that has
made more people more happy than

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:29.880
"Barbarini's Tambourine."

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.070
It was named for an absoutely
extrordinary woman of the period,

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:38.020
Barbara Campanini,
whose professional

01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.570
and amorous carrier I
will not even attempt

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:43.630
to summarize here [laughter], but
you will have to go to my book

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:46.780
and take a look and then
you can do your own reading.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.180
There have been three
movies made about her

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.850
and that probably is not the end.

01:20:50.850 --> 01:20:55.380
There's a stamp, a
Barbara Campanini stamp.

01:20:55.380 --> 01:21:00.050
This dance was probably not
her composition but was written

01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:04.350
to honor her triumph in
London in the early 1740s.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:08.620
The tune might, might, just
might possibly be by Rameau,

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:11.350
but it certainly evokes
the tambourin dance form

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:13.340
that he specialized in writing for.

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:17.910
This was one of her
signature dance types.

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:22.440
So that tambourin, by the way,
was a long drum, not the timbrel,

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.980
although she was painted
with a timbrel.

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:27.510
Here is "Barbarini's Tambourine."

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:34.510
[inaudible instructions

01:24:53.510 --> 01:25:18.040
[applause]

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.750
So we are almost out of
time, but I may be able

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:22.710
to accomodate -- oh, maybe not.

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:25.640
Any quick questions?

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:29.160
I can entertain some questions
in the lobby afterward I suppose.

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.510
Right, ok, thank you all very much.

01:25:33.510 --> 01:26:01.400
[applause]

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.720
Thank you all for your kindness.

01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.060
