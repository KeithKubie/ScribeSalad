00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.950
If x plus 1 is greater than or equal to
9, or negative 2x is greater than 10,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.910
how would you go about finding
the solution set for x?

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.790
This is called a compound inequality.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.079
A compound inequality
consists of two inequalities

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.700
connected by either the word or,
or the word and.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.810
If the word or is used, that means that
any value of the variable that makes

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.590
either inequality true
is in the solution set.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.240
So getting back to this problem
x + 1 is greater than or

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.920
equal to 9 simplifies to x is
greater than or equal to 8.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.170
And this simplifies to x is less than 5.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.860
And because this is an or
compound inequality,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.340
any value of the variable that
makes x is greater than or

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.800
equal to 8 or x is less than 5
true is in the solution set.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.500
x is greater than or equal to 8 will
look like this, with a closed circle

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.520
at 8 and the line extending to infinity,
positive infinity on the right.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.690
And with an open circle over the 5 and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.110
the arrow pointing towards
negative infinity.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.920
So both x is less than 5 and
x is greater than or

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.290
equal to 8 are part of the solution set.
