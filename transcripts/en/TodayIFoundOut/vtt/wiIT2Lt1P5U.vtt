00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.110
For anyone unfamiliar with the 2003 hip-hop
hit, Hey Ya! by OutKast, the line “shake

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.610
it like a Polaroid picture” is repeated
over a dozen times.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.539
The accompanying music video released alongside
the single saw the line punctuated by a bunch

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.949
of attractive women shaking recently taken
Polaroid photos, along with their various

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.230
wobbly bits, with dangerous levels of enthusiasm.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.080
Ultimately the song went on to become one
of the most critically acclaimed and commercially

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.280
successful of the entire year, including becoming
the first song ever to pass one million paid

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.180
downloads, all making OutKast a household
name and revitalizing interest in what was,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.860
at the time, a largely forgotten, or at least
antiquated, product in the digital age.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760
Unsurprisingly, executives at Polaroid were
initially quite pleased with the mention,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.820
noting in a press release written by spokesman
Skip Colcord, “We’re very thankful for

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.769
the different brand exposure the song has
given us.”

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.799
Wanting to capitalize on the success of the
song, Polaroid got in contact with OutKast

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:07.370
and quietly bankrolled a number of parties
to be headlined by the group.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.000
Polaroid deliberately avoided overtly advertising
during the events, instead simply hiring people

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.979
to hand out new Polaroid cameras to the celebrity
guests in attendance.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.090
As Polaroid expected, the celebrities took
pictures with the cameras and dutifully shook

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.600
them during the song’s chorus, making the
brand seem just all kinds of cool with the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780
ever impressionable public.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.060
Polaroid also gave the group new instant cameras
that they took on stage during events, notably

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.909
the Grammy’s and an appearance on Saturday
Night Live.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.060
With people once again interested in Polaroid
instant cameras, there was just one more thing

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.249
the company had to do- ask them to not do
the one thing everyone associated with their

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.750
most popular product.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.899
You see, shaking Polaroids is a great way
to increase the odds of the photo you just

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.490
took getting ruined, though most of the time
this fanning will do nothing at all.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.090
As explained on a now defunct version of the
official Polaroid website: “The image develops

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.049
and dries behind a clear plastic window and
never touches the air, so shaking or waving

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.340
has no effect.”

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.969
In a nutshell, the image is sandwiched between
layers of plastic, so shaking the photo after

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.530
it is printed and still developing can actually
damage it, causing small blobs or blotches

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.530
to appear.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.510
For anyone wondering exactly what you’re
supposed to do with a freshly ejected Polaroid

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.320
picture, according to the people that make
them: “The best way to ensure a perfectly

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.420
developed image is to simply lay the picture
on a flat surface immediately after it exits

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.420
the camera.”

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.850
Given this, you might now be wondering why
it has long been a common practice to wave

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.301
Polaroids back and forth in the air directly
after you take a picture- something that no

00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:37.450
doubt ultimately inspired the lyric by OutKast.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.730
This practice has its genesis in the early
models of Polaroid cameras, particularly those

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.421
that used packfilm, otherwise known peel-apart
film, where you had to physically peel apart

00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:49.830
the positive and the negative after the photo
had developed.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.890
Polaroid themselves notes, “Peel-apart versions
of the film needed to dry before it could

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.560
be handled, so waving the photo helped it
to dry more quickly”.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.710
Given the design here, waving with peel-apart
film didn’t risk blotching as with subsequent

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.510
generations of instant film developed by Polaroid.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.060
That said, it should be noted that such waving
wasn’t actually necessary even then.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.680
One could just leave the photo to dry naturally.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.240
However, in the 1970s, Polaroid introduced
their third generation of cameras, such as

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.940
the SX-70, among others, that used a new,
and now iconic, square format integral film

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.730
where shaking, or really doing anything at
all but waiting for the picture to finish

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.530
developing, was entirely unnecessary- everything
was contained in the film, with no need to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.280
peel or dry anything.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.660
Despite this, even after Polaroid improved
their instant development process, people

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.550
continued to shake the Polaroid pictures back
and forth in the air until the picture finished

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.340
developing, seemingly blissfully unaware that
this is entirely unnecessary, and even potentially

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.350
counterproductive to the ultimate successful
development.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.940
Though Polaroid never released any official
figures related to sales after the release

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.550
of the song, it apparently wasn’t enough
to save the company.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.570
They had to declare bankruptcy in 2008 and
were rebranded the Polaroid Corporation later

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.570
that year.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.650
This marked the second time in the same decade
the company did this, having declared bankruptcy

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.600
in 2001 as well.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.720
Despite these setbacks, they still produces
instant cameras, among other product, which

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:48.750
continue to produce photos that some people
shake for no particular reason.
