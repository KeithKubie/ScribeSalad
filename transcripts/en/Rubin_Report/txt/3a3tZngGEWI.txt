Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today is a gorilla journalist, the head of Project Veritas and the author of American Prob de James O'keefe. Welcome to the Rubin report. Great to be here. Long overdue, I think is the way I'm going to start this one because you are sort of right in the center of a lot of the things that I'm constantly talking about. So it's good to have you. Great to be here. Thanks for having me. Okay, so, uh, before we get into all your work that I think most of my audience knows, at least a portion of, I don't think anyone knows that much about you. What do we need to know about James O'keefe, the man? How did he become this, this rogue reporter and guy that was unearthing all of the evil things that are tech overlords are doing to us?

Speaker 1:          00:41          Well, I started in college doing these undercover tapes. Uh, I actually started 15 years ago, started a newspaper in college called the Centurion. And I quickly learned that the way to expose these institutions is to sort of make them live up to their own principles. Like the Alinsky tactic. I'd read rules for radicals by Saul Alinsky in college and I, I decided to expose hypocrisy by making them live up to their own rules. And I realized that those rules were race and sex and sort of abortion, these sort of sacred cow institutions, planned parenthood and acorn. And I decided to use hidden cameras. I went into the dining hall at Rutgers, I on Saint Patrick's Day and I said that lucky charms offends my Irish heritage. They took me seriously and told us they would remove lucky charms. Cereal is the first video that I did. And from there I actually went on to work with uh, uh, Lila rose, who you had on the show recently and some planned parenthood investigations. Acorn with Andrew Breitbart and I have done some 200 undercover investigations in the last 10 years. I assume as you

Speaker 2:          01:46          do more undercover things and now you've got other people that are, that are doing a portion of them, it gets harder and harder to do as people know who you are and know the organization and things

Speaker 1:          01:55          you'd be surprised. I mean at the moment we read the Society of waste, fraud and abuse. I suppose we will win the day, but people are always going to be in power, tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. And money and, and, uh, things that develop. People all are always going to be corrupt. So I don't actually wear the camera these days very often. I sort of go out into the field to, to be a leader to the troops. But for the most part it's, it's, we've got dozens of these people across the United States with wearing these little cameras. You put them in, you can put them in a cup for, you know, you can put them in a book, you can put them in a watch. And as long as you're, I ask you if there's more than four cameras in the studio right now.

Speaker 1:          02:35          Cause I got, there's a war. There's a few over there. Yes. Um, but you know, but as long as there's one party consenting to the conversation, as long as that you're, you're talking to someone, there's no expectation of privacy. We would argue. And we won in federal court in Massachusetts a few months ago. We, we changed the law. So it's, we believe that secretly recording someone is a fundamental human right. It's a constitutional right because I have no duty. Keep confidential what you tell me. So the hidden camera is an extension of the reporter notebook and the cameras capture things that words don't, I mean cameras capture, intonation, inflection. And so we believe that this is a kind of transparency revolution and there's a movement of people doing this in a weird way. It is sort of depressing reality. Like when I've watched some of your videos and you get engineers at these companies and we're going to, we're going to talk about all of them, uh, to admit things that we all are sort of thinking or true related to shadow banning or d boosting where everything else, there's a piece of me, even when they're, they're tipping off the information that I suspect is true.

Speaker 1:          03:35          There's a piece of me that's like, this is, this is, there's something sort of depressing about this that this is what we've been left with. Like we have to go after, you know, mid level and sometimes low level engineers and sometimes the bigger ones. But because there's no transparency when it comes to these companies. So it feels almost depressing to me. Does that mean, does that make sense? I think the way that I would put it, like it's unfortunate, I suppose I, some people call it depressing, some people say it. Could we confirm suspicions? I would say that what we do is summon righteous indignation, uh, at the tragedies in society, including in these organizations because they run so counter to what were spoonfed the narratives that were spoon fed by the media, by the powers that be so Hidden Camera Journal and investigative reporting, whether it's hidden camera or print does that it summons what I to Tarbell termed as righteous indignation at the tragedies.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And it kind of, you know, most people, I would say 80%, there's a sort of consensus around what we do. People say, well that's wrong or they deny it. So Twitter, uh, Twitter lobbyist in Congress under oath said, we do not shadow banned when his engineer clearly said what we do. Do is shadow band and we, I don't know if we do that anymore. That's what the engineer said. Clearly meaning that he had shadow banned people. So, um, it's, it's perjury to lie under oath and, and you know, these hidden camera videos really show people what's going on at angers people. I think the world is more polarized than it was 10 years ago. So maybe that 80% consensus is, is, is going down. Are you worried at all though that will always be videotaping each other and that there will be nothing that's private.

Speaker 1:          05:12          I mean, even now if I go out to dinner, like I'm aware that I'm some level of a public person and sometimes people recognize me and sometimes I was at the airport and it was very obvious to me that the guy, I was sitting with somebody, but that the guy next to me clearly knew who I was and he was on his computer and the whole time I can think of this guy could be recording me, you know? And, and just all like just this endless big brother thing. Even if the intentions of what you're doing. I do believe to be good. Are you just worried about just that general state of we're all going to be recording each other all the time? There will be nothing private. I'm not worried at all. I mean there's an element of risk every time you interact with strangers and you talk to them, as long as there's one party present to the conversation, we would argue that it's ethical.

Speaker 1:          05:48          And again, we think that camera's visuals are merely an extension. I mean I could, I could disseminate what you tell me in private. I could write it down and shout it from the rooftops opt ins and clarity wrote the jungle. He saw everything and then he ran back to his hotel and wrote, wrote it all down. So surely society would would, would rather a situation where I accurately capture what it is that you told me and I have to use cameras. They indemnify me because people call me a liar. They say that didn't happen. So I have to, I have to record the incidents because they would, they would say that it did not happen the way that I reported it. And they also think that I think that there are lines that we can't cross. We don't go into people's bedrooms, we try to stay away from the really personal, intimate, you know, sexual details about, about people.

Speaker 1:          06:33          But this is a revolution that's aimed at the power structure at this establishment, the powers that be not against private citizens. And we don't. And I think there was a duty, there is a responsibility that investigative reporters have not to put people on blast unless it really meets a compelling public interest. So you mentioned you started this in, in college. What was tipping you off to like that there was something wrong with the media? I mean, what made you go, I gotta go in there and say I'm Irish and I'm offended by Leptin charms. Like what really was happening that you were seeing that led to that? Well, I was in at Rutgers University in New Jersey and it was so the political correctness was run a muck like most schools and all these daily, there's something bad happening with the grease trucks please. The grease trucks, trucks, trucks, please tell me that they're okay.

Speaker 1:          07:19          It's for those who don't know, they're these trucks at Rutgers and it's like they're all in the parking lot and uh, and you get real fat real quick, older, your collar, there was something, you know what? There was something wrong with the gross trucks. They had duct, they'd put duct tape. This is in 2005, over these sandwiches. Am I allowed to curse on them? There was one of them called the fat, the fat bitch and the fat, a dyke and other words that were offensive. And um, they had put duct tape over the names because these words were considered offensive. That's what was the, like what compelled me to try to ban lucky charms. So I said, this is ridiculous. I also had professors who were Stalinists. I had professors who were telling me how great communist Communism was. And I was not political, but I read the New York Times every day front to back in college in the dining hall.

Speaker 1:          08:05          I was sort of an introverted guy and I'd read, read the paper and I was just, I said, this doesn't accurately capture the world. This doesn't, this doesn't tell people what's really going on. So I, I felt compelled to do something about it and it wasn't comfortable. It's not comfortable to confront people with cameras and, you know, get into their faces. But I was willed to do it because I believed in the cause and, and the, the kind of Alinsky, uh, methodology, which is to make them accountable to their own principles. You know, you had these Marxist professors driving Bentleys and BMWs and had a little muck raking newspaper and it was like lifestyles of the rich and Marxist. Right, right. You know, track these people down. I just feel that most people that do this, most insiders inside these companies coming to us now have what I call it justice complex.

Speaker 1:          08:52          They think that there are things wrong with the world and they feel compelled to do something about it. It's hard to explain. Uh, but you know, I'm sure you know, people who have this complex and these people are willing to basically jump on a grenade to wear a camera, to film their employer. Some cases violating their own nondisclosure agreement because they believe the public has a right to know what they're seeing. Are you shocked at the amount of people at these big tech companies who now are willing to speak? Because I mean I know insiders that I get some information from, I mean I'm talking about Google, Facebook, Twitter like that really these things have become so huge that now their own people inside them are going, Whoa, what, what did we help create here? I'm not sure. Got a frack, a Frankenstein Monster. I mean I have you been to Menlo Park and you go to San Francisco and I was there, cause I did this Facebook story, this insider inside Facebook and I went to try to locate these engineers and ask them for comment.

Speaker 1:          09:49          And there were just these buses, just hundreds of buses filled with millennials and end, if you go to the campus, people are sort of driving around these bicycles. The best word I can describe it as their minions. It's to sort of this little totalitarian little mini state within a state. And it's just a group think or, well Ian Place and I, and I guess the, the word that it was described to me by the insights that they're all minions. They're very intelligent people but they don't have a lot of common sense and there, and I, and I went there, I was amazed by this Menlo Park campus buses of, of young people being bused in. And I think that it doesn't surprise me that people are willing to blow the whistle because there's more to life than, than making, you know, a quarter million dollars a year and working for these companies.

Speaker 1:          10:33          People want to, people want to do something. One of the things that I get told all the time, what can I do? And, and there aren't a lot of choices for people. You know, you can, you can watch the shows, you can buy the books, but some people want to actually participate in this country. And, and solutions are increasingly, you know, outside the scope of government, the legislative process does not seem to solve things. So there's, there needs to be in a different counterweight. There needs to be a different solution and I would say that 0.001% of people are like put a camera on me. That's a lot of people by the way. Yeah, right, right, right. We're talking about a lot of people at the end of the day. So when did you realize that because you've mostly focused or at least I think the the, the work that has gotten you the most attention has been related to the tech companies, not necessarily going after politicians or academics per se, although you've done some of that.

Speaker 1:          11:24          When did you realize that focusing on the tech companies was, was really the thing that was going to strike the chord with most people because that's what it seems to be. Well, because I think the media has all the power. I think that I've known this for ever since I started this endeavor was that the media has so much more power than people realize. Everyone knows the media is powerful, but I think that people fear the humiliating power of the press. I think the press, including the big tech companies have more power than government. They are more powerful than all three branches of government, executive, judicial, legislative branch. So somehow we need to hold these people accountable. They're not a cat, they're not held accountable by anybody who elects them. And I don't know what the solutions are. People say, well, what should they be regulated?

Speaker 1:          12:07          I think they should be transparent or there will need to be regulated, but they have to at least not deceive the people. So because the media has all the power, I, I wrote this book called American Proverb de and I believe that people don't know that they're being lied to by CNN and the New York Times and they don't know that they're being d boosted in shadow, banned by Twitter and Facebook. And I think these companies need to tell you that they're doing it. It's not so bad if they take your account down and restore it. But the thing that's really scary about the d boosting and the shadow banning is that you don't know that it is happening to you. And I have to see it. You can kind of feel it. There are times when everything I'm doing is on fire or then sometimes where it's just like nothing happens and those usually have a certain political bent to them and then you end up really feeling like you're in a mental institution because if you don't have evidence of anything, I don't want to be the guy that's running around and screaming, everything's a conspiracy and they're coming after me and leaving the rest.

Speaker 1:          13:05          We're doing this on youtube right now. And even when you do have evidence, like we have video tape after tape of people inside Twitter, including the Twitter direct messaging guy saying that they have certain key words and they consider to be a Russian Bot. If you tweet about God guns and the American flag, most of these engineers are not, some of them are not American citizens. Then they don't share American values. And this individual says, if you tweet about fly, he's who talks like that, who talks about God, you must be a Russian Bot. I have the videotape and they still, they still say it's fake. So, you know, I think that what, you know, it's one of those things where people need to see this stuff and the lead and that just want these companies to be honest about what they're doing. They just, I just want them to be honest.

Speaker 1:          13:49          That's why I want to be honest though. I mean, we want them to be honest, right? So I'm with you. I want them to be honest and, and the reason I apply as much pressure on them, on Twitter and youtube particularly is because I want them to be better. Right? Like I, I always say this, it's like I've got a million subscribers. I put out a television quality show on Youtube for free, and I don't even have an email address to someone at Youtube. I have no contact at someone at Youtube. Like that's rigid. Timidly crazy. They're a huge company that offers a product. I'm a user of the product that helps make them money through advertising and all that stuff. I can't even get a human there, but I, but I don't think I can force them to be better. Right. Well, it's the job of investigative reporting to hold people accountable to, to, to test and affirm what is an outrage to people.

Speaker 1:          14:33          And I think that you can't lie under oath. You can't. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg said in, in Congress last spring, some things that may be contradicted by some of the documents we've unearthed, there are laws against perjury and the, and what people have to remember is I don't have a position on whether these companies should be regulated. I honestly don't know what should be done. I do know that people need to know what is happening inside the companies, and I think that because they're so powerful, people have no idea you when you, when you digest content from CNN and the New York Times, all that stuff gets filtered through Facebook. In fact, when I did the Facebook story, I was shocked by some people in media telling me, while I don't know, I love the story, but I don't know if I can cover it. Why not? Because we derive most of our revenue from Facebook.

Speaker 1:          15:18          The same thing happened during the 2016 election. When I, when I did the Hillary Clinton tapes and the Bob Creamer resigned. I mean, people have to remember that these companies are publicly traded companies. They get their broadcast license from the FCC. In some circumstances there sort of entanglements. There's a symbiotic relationship between the corporate press and the government. And for those reasons, again, to go back to the campaign to recruit insiders, it's going to require citizens. It's gonna require outsiders to blow the whistle because no one in the government is going to do it. Indeed, many of them around the take. Okay. So let's just do each platform or one at a time. So you just mentioned Facebook. So let's go to phase. What do, what do we need to know about what's going on with the Facebook algorithm and the way they're banning people in suspending people and the rest of it?

Speaker 1:          16:08          Well, I can tell you what our insider told us, saying I can, I try to only speak about the things that I know. 100% in the insider was working in the content review, uh, the content review tool at Facebook. And she was a contractor for the company and she, uh, leaked us documents inside the company showing I guess what would be called as a de boost of a live stream video. And she said she specifically saw this on Steven Crowder's page. Um, uh, she saw it on a few other pages. She took a screenshot of a Mike Cernovich page and on the page it says I action live distribution. This was apparently some type of algorithm written too from what we could see, two to reduce content that was suicidal or violent, but none of these individuals were talking or, or doing anything that would rise to that level.

Speaker 1:          17:01          And now there's two different parts of Facebook. People need to understand. There is a task system where it seems like Facebook after the election hired hundreds if not thousands of people to monitor. And they do a fairly good job. If your page gets taken down, it can be reinstated, you can file a complaint and they, they have a pretty good process. But then there's another part of Facebook that this insight or told us about or these were, this algorithm was occurring. And it was occurring automatically and they were identifying certain key words. So she leaks us this troll report, it's called a troll report. And after the election, Facebook decided to Chino to get more involved in, in, in things, I guess they didn't like the outcome of the election and maybe that's what this was. It was really about, I mean, independent people having an impact on, on society.

Speaker 1:          17:50          They don't, they don't like that and they're in hitting needs more control. So they had this troll report. There are certain key words, uh, words that we're not racist or, or problematic really, but they were words that were appropriated by, by right wing meme culture, words like lulls and normy. And even the, even the, the, the MSM mainstream media was in this troll report. Since typically right wingers use MSM more than the left. And these are just words or phrases or acronyms that usually are just men in meme. Funny Sharon, silly ways. These are not a threat to democracy. Msm, mainstream media is not an implication of racism. Well, they also blow up, brought up Lauren Chen, they, they, they brought her up. It was, she was in there as an example of someone who is needs to be dealt with. Visa VI, the, the, uh, the product intervention at Facebook.

Speaker 1:          18:41          And I don't, I don't know, I'm not aware of any of any activities or problems with, with her videos. I mean, she's just someone who's sharing her mind on youtube. I'm not sure what order we're putting these up in, but I've got Laura and chat and coming in here. That's so cool. Well that says it's a cosmic coincidence. So, so she likes us these documents, uh, we put the story out instantly. What happens is the press, uh, the verge was the name of the outlet comes out, comes to Facebook's defense. It always happens, by the way, we did the story on Twitter. And instantly buzzfeed comes out of the Twitter says they don't do this because that's not, that's not journalism. I mean, Twitter says the job of investigative reporting is to, is to question what they tell you. But it's always the case when we do these videos that people come out and they said, well, they say they don't do this.

Speaker 1:          19:26          Um, and they came to Facebook's defense. But the truth is these documents were real. And the two engineers that we interviewed, a guy named Sagey Yamamoto and Danny, Ben, David actually confronted these guys on the street in San Francisco with a film crew because no one would give me any answers. But the documents are pretty self explanatory and it's, it's definitely, um, it definitely, I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg knows that these things are happening, but if he does, he was lying under oath. Right. So wouldn't, the sensible thing to do if you are mark Zuckerberg would be make sure that you don't really know what's going on at your company so that when you get put in the position where you're under oath, you can basically say anything. And I think this would stand true for jacket, Twitter and a bunch of these guys if the buck never stops with you.

Speaker 1:          20:12          And I'm sure you saw, um, Jack from Twitter on with Joe Rogan and Tim Pool. And it was like, he just struck me as, oh, I don't really know what's going on with my company, but that seems like it's by design. It's not an accident. That's interesting. Um, uh, there's a book by Blake Harris out in the last couple of weeks about Palmer Luckey and Facebook, and I encourage you to read it. It's unbelievable that this guy, uh, uh, Palmer Luckey who founded the Oculus, the virtual reality software was, uh, was dealt with by Mark Zuckerberg directly inside the company. He was told not to be a Trump supporter, him on the show actually. So, um, I, I don't, I don't know whether that's true or not. I did see a Jack Dorsey, uh, he's never addressed anything we've exposed, they don't want to deal with the actual evidence. There's video tapes of Obenauf of a driver was saying one strategy is to shadow banned.

Speaker 1:          21:06          I mean, there's, they don't want to actually address the evidence. They want to say, well, they don't know what they're talking about. Well, you know, and by the way, there is a difference between, I think anytime you have human beings in a room making content decisions, subjectively you're going to have these problems. These are hard problems to solve. But it goes back to the original point of hiring hundreds if not thousands of people do the content review. I think at the end of the day, if these companies don't like an independent people influencing the minds of other people, that's what this is really about.

Speaker 2:          21:37          And that would actually be okay if they were transparent about it, sort of, because then it would allow competition to fill that void. But this sort of neither here nor there and instead of it seems to be the problem. So, okay, so d boosting seems to be the main problem with Facebook. And that's interesting that it was hitting Crowder videos, Lauren and Shannon and a couple of other people, and this means you're, you're streaming, right? So this means when he's streaming that the, the number, it's just not going to feed, is that

Speaker 1:          22:03          right? It's, it's when you're, when you do a live stream video, there are special tags, there are special qualities in that live stream, and they down rank the video, they take away some of the special qualities that make it automatically show up on other people's timelines according to the insider that we spoke to. The other thing about these videos that are live streamers that they're converted to text automatically and machine learning goes through the video and identifies these keywords. So yes, the video would be down ranked. It would have its special qualities taken away. And, uh, I think that Crowder settled out of court in 2016 with Facebook. It's what he told me. And I think that he's in the process of, of doing some more litigation related to some of the things they're doing to his videos.

Speaker 2:          22:46          Yeah. Is there anything else that you need to know on the Facebook front? You've said they've gotten a little bit better when it comes to, they would ban people in suspend people left and right all the time. I used to have my, my friend Faisal Omar, who's been on the show many times, who's, uh, an ex Muslim from, from Iraq and really working to secularize the Arab world. I mean doing incredible, incredible work. I mean this is a good man. He would get banned all the time. Right. And I would have, I had a contact there so I was able to help him get back on that. Seems to be happening a little bit less now. I logged

Speaker 1:          23:16          in there, the, the insiders showed me how it works. There's it, I guess what you call a task function and um, and you know, someone gets there. There are, there are independent people in the company, low level people who just make arbitrary decisions to remove people and then that's wrong and they shouldn't do that. So what, so they're only, there are adult supervision in the room. There are, there are people, there's like a conversation thread under each task. They convert these things into what they call tasks. And there are adults that say, well that's no good. And there relationships with a lot of the publishers for um, entities like such as your own and, and, and there was a relationship between a sales rep at Facebook and there seemed to be adult supervision. But the problem is with the algorithm side of things as far as I can see.

Speaker 1:          23:59          So He's part of it that the algorithm, in many cases they will, the algorithms were written by people, you know, 10 years ago or 15 years ago, probably aren't at the company anymore. Nobody really like who really understands what's going on with these algorithms. Do the engineers at these companies even have a sense of what's really going on and how can they make sure that they're not manipulated by the low level people in? Well, one of the problems I have is a reporter doing this is trying to, I mean, I'm not a tech person. I'm not a, I don't claim to have any special expertise is trying to, people's eyes glaze over when you start talking about machine learning and uh, and, and SSI livestream distribution. So trying to get the people indignant about something that they have no idea what this means. But yes, I think Danny Ben, David wrote the algorithm at Facebook in 2017 than it was apparently intended to address violence or suicidal content.

Speaker 1:          24:51          And we believe that it was a applied to politics and it was used for ill. That seems to be what happened at Facebook. So you're saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions, right? Is that what you're telling me? Uh, anything else going on in Facebook that we need to know about it? And, and do you sense that Zuckerberg may be because of being hauled in front of Congress will do anything? I can tell you that everyone inside the company knows what we did. And uh, there's one, I don't know how many 60,000 employees, they all know exactly what we did. And I think that when we personalize it by going to the men, went to the engineer's doors, we went to, we went to the train station where the guy gets on the train every morning and I interviewed him and he said, I fear for my safety.

Speaker 1:          25:28          He's like, I'm scared. I'm like, you're scaring. I should be afraid for my safety. I mean, you guys are the ones spying on us and taking our videos down and, and not to that, but I'm going after this trillion dollar company. Um, but we personalized it. And I think that there's a lot in, since I released this tape a month ago, there have been many people inside the company that have approached me and I'm trying to, you know, it's always the question of do you want to wear a camera or do you just want to feed me things anonymously? My medium is video. I think that there has to be video because if we don't take these things, no one will believe it. So then the person has to basically lose their job and I'll hire them. And that's how our, our model tends to work these days. How do you make sure that when someone reaches out to you that they're not just trolling you like a triple agent?

Speaker 1:          26:15          Yeah. Well basically that they would reach out to you knowing that you throw up one, one bad thing and there's been little moments, yes, we can get into yes. Um, that, that's going to blow up all of the other good work that you've done. So there's high incentive for something else. It's a, it's a risk. It's, I mean, listen, what we do is very high risk for many different reasons, which, which we can get into I guess. But what we do is extremely risky and an undercover work, you're going to get burned. You try to use common sense. There are things that we do. Ew. Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew. V Eagle. Very carefully. You, you do your due diligence. Oftentimes they send you something. There is something called tortious interference with, uh, with, you know, violating a nondisclosure agreement. Um, uh, the, the, it's a lot of complex legal analysis, but essentially they have to tell us something first and then we can tell them to film what they have told us. So there, you know, we have to be very careful and, and we have been burned by the way, and you probably knows about some of those things, but for the most part, we're 95 to 98% successful. Not everything that people bring to us, do we publish? Not Every secret conversation that I've recorded, do we publish? I think it's the choosing to publish something at the video that we've obtained is really where the ethical calculation comes in.
