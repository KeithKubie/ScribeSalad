00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:03.846
&gt;&gt;Dawn: Being able to departmentalize
really helps us integrate curriculum,

00:00:03.986 --> 00:00:06.336
and provide opportunities for
students to apply and transfer

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:09.000
so we could really see mastery.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:16.216
&gt;&gt;Anne: Departmentalization
is just the concept

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:20.386
of this teacher teaches this topic,
and this teacher teaches this topic.

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:24.546
The power of that is that a
teacher can really dig deep

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:26.206
into that particular content.

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.606
They could become an expert.

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:32.626
The integration piece of it is the
concept that we've paired Language Arts

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:35.916
and Social Studies and we've
paired Science and Math.

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:40.436
Intentionally we connect and
integrate those concepts together.

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:43.976
It's kind of the marriage between
departmentalization and integration.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:46.186
&gt;&gt;Dawn: In fourth, fifth
and sixth grade,

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:48.556
we have two classrooms
at each grade level.

00:00:48.676 --> 00:00:50.276
One teacher teaches Science and Math,

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:52.936
and one teacher teaches
Language Arts and Social Studies.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:57.806
&gt;&gt;Lindsay: Last year, we moved the
teachers between classrooms and we found

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:01.566
that it was difficult to have all
of your materials on a cart ready

00:01:01.566 --> 00:01:03.046
to go into the next classroom.

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.426
The students get to see now
a math-enriched classroom,

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:09.796
a reading enriched classroom, and
they're not overwhelmed with content

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:13.236
from all different areas, and
then just seeing a different face

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.046
in the day can capture
them in a different way.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:19.506
&gt;&gt;Jon: I see all the
sixth graders every day.

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:22.356
Our block is
two-hours-and-fifteen-minutes,

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.736
and I focus on the Math and the science.

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:26.566
&gt;&gt;Laura: And I teach the
Social Studies and Literacy.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:30.366
We've worked really hard on making
sure we have shared expectations

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:30.976
for the kids.

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:33.776
Some days there's this
defined reading time.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:37.196
Other days, it's more of
a Social Studies concept

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:41.236
and we're using our literacy skills to
get to those understandings and ideas.

00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:44.176
&gt;&gt;Laura: Social organization
is how you run your society.

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.776
&gt;&gt;Lexie: In Social Studies,
we've been playing a game based

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:49.126
on the Mayan culture.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:53.016
&gt;&gt;Laura: It's kind of like, "We're doing
this great interactive thing, okay,

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:54.126
now let's do some research."

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:57.876
So they're doing some close
reading and seeing what corroborates

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:00.276
and what conflicts with
what they already know.

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:01.976
But the topic is the Maya.

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:03.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Folding paper
books are part of the...

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:06.976
&gt;&gt;Laura: Some of the time students
say, "Did we even do reading today?

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.756
&gt;&gt;Dawn: It's one thing to see
it in a guided reading group,

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:13.916
students accomplishing a task or a
skill, but to be able to make decisions

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.626
in Social Studies about how they're
using those skills is a whole other

00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:18.076
level of understanding.

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:20.436
&gt;&gt;Anne: It's really the
power and the integration.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:24.126
It's how we can apply what we're
learning in Math to what we're doing

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:27.706
in Science, and how that helps
us think like an engineer,

00:02:27.966 --> 00:02:29.406
you know, or think like a scientist.

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:32.446
&gt;&gt;Jon: We're just connecting
what's going on in our parking lot,

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:35.946
and it's going to hopefully make us
think about gravity and how things flow.

00:02:36.006 --> 00:02:39.006
&gt;&gt;Jon: What I always shoot
for is an integrated piece

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:41.346
where they're doing something science...

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:42.426
&gt;&gt;Jon: But imagine a laser...

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.356
&gt;&gt;Jon: But the backside is there's a
whole lot of math in what you're doing.

00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:48.946
&gt;&gt;Jon: So that bathroom pass is
the same height off the floor

00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:51.436
as that Apollo insignia,
is that correct?

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:51.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:54.686
&gt;&gt;Jon: And then all of a sudden,
math isn't a bad word anymore.

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:56.926
&gt;&gt;Jon: The same principle
is happening right here.

00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:00.446
So we get to go ahead and
try it to see if it's right.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.796
&gt;&gt;Jon: And let's go to Point A first.

00:03:01.996 --> 00:03:02.156
&gt;&gt;Student: Yep.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:03.116
&gt;&gt;Jon: Get a reading on that.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.726
Remember, we're using tenths.

00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:09.326
&gt;&gt;Jon: Why in the heck are we measuring
concrete that they poured this summer?

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:10.746
Why is that important?

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:16.156
&gt;&gt;Lexie: What happened was it rained
so much and there's a huge puddle all

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:20.836
around here, because the drain was
clogged, and the busses were having

00:03:20.836 --> 00:03:23.536
to drive straight through
all the rainwater.

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:26.666
&gt;&gt;Laura: We are doing
a drainage analysis.

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:28.866
We're trying to see if
they did it correctly.

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:33.986
&gt;&gt;Constantine: We've been using a GPS
to find our longitude and latitude.

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.736
&gt;&gt;Laura: We started off
by finding our spots.

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:41.666
And using the transit to measure
the height of each of those.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:44.006
&gt;&gt;Laura: Stand nice and still.

00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:46.976
&gt;&gt;Student: 7 point 37 point 4.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:49.486
&gt;&gt;Constantine: Then we measured
the distance from each of those

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:52.266
to the drain, which was Point B.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.976
&gt;&gt;Jon: Finding out if the
slope in the drain is correct,

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.336
involves quite a bit of math.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:58.306
A lot of computation, measurement.

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:01.886
We wanted to do something
that would tie into one

00:04:01.886 --> 00:04:04.316
of our three big spheres of Science.

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:08.976
Hydrosphere is a perfect connection for
measuring the slope of the parking lot,

00:04:08.976 --> 00:04:11.366
because it connects to watershed.

00:04:11.826 --> 00:04:15.976
&gt;&gt;Lexie: If it's clogged, our
water's not going to go through to

00:04:15.976 --> 00:04:18.000
where we want it to go, the
watershed is not going to work.

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:18.986
&gt;&gt;Jon: Okay!

00:04:19.136 --> 00:04:19.386
Okay.

00:04:19.586 --> 00:04:20.996
&gt;&gt;Jon: You couldn't ask
for a better laboratory.

00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:24.086
&gt;&gt;Jon: So think about rocks, minerals,
weathering erosion, geosphere.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.586
&gt;&gt;Jon: This is a way to get
them into the Hydrosphere

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:27.906
in a really practical meaningful way.

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.416
&gt;&gt;Lexie: It's a foot different.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.086
&gt;&gt;Jon: It's a foot difference, so
what's cool about from that point

00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:37.386
to this point, is water going to flow?

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:38.113
&gt;&gt;Lexie: Yeah.

00:04:38.313 --> 00:04:38.726
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:39.200
&gt;&gt;Jon: It'd definitely flow.

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:42.296
&gt;&gt;Jon: It gives me a concrete foundation
to connect future learnings to.

00:04:42.696 --> 00:04:45.656
&gt;&gt;Anne: Conceptual understanding is
at the core of what we are doing.

00:04:45.946 --> 00:04:48.126
How do we look at units of study,

00:04:48.356 --> 00:04:51.626
and not just looking at
isolated content areas.

00:04:51.626 --> 00:04:52.996
&gt;&gt;Anne: What's happening in fifth grade?

00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:54.976
&gt;&gt;Anne: I meet with every
team every week.

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:59.186
Grade level teams as well as vertical
teams to see how what we're working

00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:01.026
on is having an impact on students.

00:05:01.146 --> 00:05:02.526
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now all of a sudden,
we're doing decimals.

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:05.626
And then we had to figure out the
difference between two measurements.

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:08.096
&gt;&gt;Laura: I wonder if you
could tie that site analysis

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:12.136
into the fourth grade site analysis and
that grant we got, or we're getting.

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:12.976
&gt;&gt;Jon: Oh, that's perfect.

00:05:12.976 --> 00:05:15.116
&gt;&gt;Jon: Rather than being an
expert at seven different things,

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:18.556
I can work really hard to become
an expert at two subjects.

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:20.226
&gt;&gt;Jon: Copy that, good work!

00:05:20.446 --> 00:05:23.996
&gt;&gt;Jon: It's a wonderful way for me
to become the best teacher possible.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.976
&gt;&gt;Dawn: The benefits with the
students have been phenomenal.

00:05:27.356 --> 00:05:30.686
It's created more purposeful, more
authentic setting for learning,

00:05:31.076 --> 00:05:32.786
and we've seen that every day.
