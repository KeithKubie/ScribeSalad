00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.529
The history of philosophy has been dominated
by competing arguments around the ideas of

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:12.539
Free Will and Determinism. Simply stated,
the issue hangs on whether human beings should

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.670
be thought of as fundamentally free to choose
their actions and mould their lives – or

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.410
whether they should be deemed as being at
heart determined by forces beyond their control,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.510
be they fate, biology, politics or class.
The debate has been long-running and hugely

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.969
vicious. It began in Ancient Greece, was picked
up by the Romans, dominated Christian philosophy

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.280
and rumbles on to this day among philosophers,
psychologists and neuroscientists. Part of

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.602
the reason why the question seems so hard
to find a conclusive answer to is that it

00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:51.769
is almost always framed in objective terms,
as if we might discover whether either Free

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.530
Will or Determinism could be an advisable
interpretation for human beings in general.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.989
But, in truth, the debate becomes more interesting
and more relevant if we change the parameters

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.500
of the question – and ask simply: is an
idea of Free Will or of Determinism more or

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.960
less relevant to me? All of us will have different
needs in this area depending on our contrasting

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.550
levels of two psychological qualities: Defeatism
on the one hand, Aspiration on the other.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.540
There are people whose levels of Defeatism
have grown so high, they too readily declare

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.530
that responsibility for things always lies
outside of themselves: the course of their

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.020
life is, they tell us, entirely determined
by parents, school, the government, the bosses,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.560
the media… anyone but themselves. The result
is radical under-achievement and self-deceit.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.910
But there is another kind of difficulty created
in people whose levels of Aspiration have

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.960
grown so high on the basis of overly exaggerated
notions of Free Will. They will deem that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.930
everything about their lives is capable of
change. They will declare that they can achieve

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.330
all things simply through an exercise of the
will. Their career and income, their relationships

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.470
and prospects are all, apparently, subject
to dramatic change. It’s an inspiring philosophy,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.420
but one that reliably also leads – when
things don’t work out, as they never do

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.860
in all areas – to bitterness and rage. Each
of us needs to decide for ourselves whether

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.120
we should have a greater faith in Determinism
or in Free Will. We should ask how much of

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.700
the suffering in our lives can be traced back
to a defeatist attitude and how much might

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.410
be traced back to reckless aspiration. Some
of us need to dial up a faith in Free Will,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.610
others need more of a mellow acceptance of
Determinism. The oldest debate in philosophy

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
isn’t beyond answering. We just have to
answer it more personally, with more of a

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.849
sense of what we need to believe in to be
calmer and more fulfilled. Perhaps the wisest

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.480
way to navigate the debate between Free Will
and Determinism was worked out by the Ancient

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.959
Roman philosophers of the Stoic school. These
Stoics proposed that we should see ourselves

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.790
as always hovering between a Free and a Determined
state – and they invented a powerful image

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.150
to evoke our condition as creatures able at
times to effect great change – and yet never

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.370
far from being subject to immensely powerful
external necessities. We are, they said, like

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.140
dogs who have been tied to an unpredictable
cart. Our leash is long enough to give us

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.550
a degree of leeway, but is not long enough
ever just to allow us to wander wherever we

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.240
please. A dog will naturally hope to go wherever
it pleases, said the Stoics. But if it cannot,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.160
then it is better for the animal to be trotting
behind the cart rather than dragged and strangled

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:58.150
by it. To reflect that we too are never without
a leash around our neck may help to reduce

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.190
the violence of our protest against events
which veer away from our intentions. It may

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.319
sound like a recipe for passivity, but as
the Stoics insisted, it is no less unreasonable

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:15.230
to accept something as necessary when it isn’t
as to rebel against something when it is.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.540
It’s our reason that must judge the difference
and this is where we have a big advantage

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.370
over a dog. A dog will probably not at first
grasp that he is even tied to a cart, nor

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.320
understand the connection between the swerves
of the cart and the pain in his neck. So he

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.540
won’t be able to predict where the cart
is going and adjust his position accordingly.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.630
But reason enables us to theorise with considerable
accuracy about the path of the cart or destiny,

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.690
which offers us a chance, unique among living
beings, to increase our sense of freedom by

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.370
ensuring a good slack between our desires
and what we cannot change. Reason allows us

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.850
to calculate when our wishes are in irrevocable
conflict with reality, and then bids us to

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.580
submit ourselves willingly, rather than angrily
or bitterly, to necessities. We may be powerless

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.150
to alter certain events, but we remain free
to choose our attitude towards them, and it

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.160
is in an unprotesting acceptance of what is
truly necessary that we can find a distinctive serenity and freedom.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.200
At The School of Life
we believe in developing emotional intelligence.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.470
To that end we've also created a whole range
of products to support that growth. Find out
