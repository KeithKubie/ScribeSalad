 book notebook tablet cell phone through 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.960
 of the cloud hits the google servers 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.939

 shared with you can integrate this 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 in your android application is very simple 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 The first step is for you to go 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 address that is on the copy two screen 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.460
 codes that are there are two files 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.920
 one is out and the other is marty mcfly where 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.750
 will be the code that will select the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 printer you can use 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 after that you will use case 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 still not use the internet in your 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.180
 application this permission so that the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.860
 application accesses the internet 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.479
 if you already use it because it is consuming 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.439
 watch out if there's no problem 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.540
 and finally you will add the action of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.040
 call this print screen 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.920
 you can have a button for example 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.810
 print and not a click list of that button 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.579
 you will put this code that nothing 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.979
 more is than shooting the entente 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.899
 I had that one that you configured from 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.329
 code you got from google site 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.280
 if I have one more information in one 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.710
 detail also visits if this interest 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.869
 that is there in the video and you will see more 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.310
 especially the club, even if you 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.390
 want to use 100 hundred apps 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.979
