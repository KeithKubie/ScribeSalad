FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
Hello from I/O Live.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.239
I'm Florina Muntenescu,
and I'm here with Ankit,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.750
a product manager of Google Pay.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.321
Hi, Ankit.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.528
ANKIT PRASAD: Hi.

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:20.970
Thank you for having me.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.180
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
So what's Google Pay?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.350
So Google Pay is
our payment solution

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.402
for both online and in-store.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.360
Google has hundreds of
millions of credit cards

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.900
on file, from Chrome when
users autofill in Chrome

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.650
through Google Pay, when
users pay on the Google Store,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.330
YouTube, Play.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.820
We're bringing the power
of all of those cards

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.120
that we have to stores,
both in physical stores

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.044
and in online stores.

00:00:46.044 --> 00:00:47.002
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: OK.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.489
So how about merchants
that have an Omni-Channel?

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.280
ANKIT PRASAD: Yeah.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.450
So we do a variety of expenses.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.660
So online, for
example, we allow you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.140
to have a Google Pay button
that enables one-click check out

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.220
with any of these
credit cards on file.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.290
In store, we allow you to
accept payments through NFC.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.390
We have set up loyalty
these solutions so we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.850
can help you enroll users
in your loyalty program,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
make sure loyalty is conveyed
at the point of check out.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.890
And then today we're
also announcing

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.030
like a good mobile wallet.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.100
We're supporting
other items that users

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.490
have in their wallets, so
boarding passes, event tickets,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.560
offers, that sort of thing.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.270
If you are an
Omni-Channel merchant,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.860
we're happy to work with you.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.770
We enable at one of the demos
that we have today showcases

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.120
this very well.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.590
We have an experience
that we built

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.580
with Oak Labs and DotDashPay.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.770
It's a smart mirror.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.170
You walk into the dressing
room with your items.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.730
The mirrors will detect it.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.840
We then enable a one-tap
check out with your phone.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.260
Your loyalty is conveyed, as
is your payment credential.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.050
And then after that, you're
rewarded with an online offer

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.300
that you can then use
on their online stores.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.110
And so this is an example
of how we can bring users

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.669
back to the merchant after
having an in-store experience.

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:59.210
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
OK, sounds great.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.200
But I'm a developer.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.070
So how do I get started with it?

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.400
ANKIT PRASAD: Yeah, we
provide a suite of APIs.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.800
With just a few
lines of code, we

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.720
enable you to add a
Buy With Google Pay

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.160
button or a Google Pay
button for your website.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.140
We also have APIs that allow
you to accept loyalty or allow

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.230
you to help get users enrolled
in your loyalty program.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.270
And you can learn about
those at pay.google.com.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.260
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: OK.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.900
So check out pay.google.com and
get started with Google Pay.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.630
ANKIT PRASAD: Thank you.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.340

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.100
