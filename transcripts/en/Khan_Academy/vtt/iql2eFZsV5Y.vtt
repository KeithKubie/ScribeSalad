00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:03.294
- [Instructor] Now, the notion
of the Holy Roman Emperor

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:05.283
and the Holy Roman Empire does not last

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:07.530
much beyond Charlemagne.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.508
After his death, over the
course of the ninth century,

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:15.091
his empire is broken up,
his successors are not able

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.275
to carry on the title.

00:00:17.275 --> 00:00:20.442
But then we get into the 10th century.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:25.329
As you can see here, the
empire of Charlemagne

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.746
is now broken up.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:30.749
The West, West Francia,
starting to resemble

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.832
modern-day France, not quite exactly.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.179
And the eastern two thirds
are now under the control

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.096
of Otto, a German king.

00:00:41.904 --> 00:00:46.291
And because of his ability
to offer protection,

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.826
and frankly just his power, he is crowned

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.873
Holy Roman Emperor.

00:00:50.873 --> 00:00:52.433
One of the reasons why
this is significant,

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:55.164
once again, it's saying,
hey, the Byzantine Emperor

00:00:55.164 --> 00:00:57.839
isn't really the heir
to the Roman Empires.

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.306
This Holy Roman Emperor,
but Otto is able to create

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:03.980
a line of Holy Roman
Emperors that continues

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.101
all the way until 1806
when they are conquered

00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.444
by Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:11.779
Now, the Holy Roman Empire itself,

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:14.761
and Voltaire famously said,
"It is neither holy nor Roman,

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.167
"nor an Empire."

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.406
Over various days in its
history is fragmented.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:23.050
It's many kingdoms with
different levels of autonomy.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.423
But under Otto, it was quite unified.

00:01:26.423 --> 00:01:29.152
Now as we get into the 11th century,

00:01:29.152 --> 00:01:31.730
the divide between East and West

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.147
becomes even more pronounced.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.497
We've already talked about
this ongoing power struggle

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:42.808
between West and East,
between which bishops

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:45.498
have primacy over Christendom.

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:47.545
We've talked about, hey,
who is the real heir

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:48.951
to the Roman Empire?

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.875
We've talked about Latin versus Greek.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.590
We've talked about the Germanic kings

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.134
having influence now, and
really following the West.

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:02.405
We've talked about the
notion of fo-lo-quay.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.843
And those aren't all of the issues.

00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:08.216
On top of that, you have
this notion of leavened

00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:09.966
and unleavened bread.

00:02:11.668 --> 00:02:14.400
Where in the West, in their
mass, when they are consecrating

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.150
the bread to be viewed
as the body of Christ.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.186
They used unleavened
bread based on the belief

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:25.197
that this is what Christ
used during the Last Supper.

00:02:25.197 --> 00:02:27.752
In the East, they said no, we have agreed

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:30.053
to use leavened bread.

00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:32.630
And so this is one further tension.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.460
Even more than the actual
issues are the sense of,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.880
"Well, why do you think you have the right

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.360
"to tell me what to do?"

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.293
And as we get into 1053,
you have what are known

00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:45.555
as the Latin churches in
Constantinople being shut down

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:48.090
by the patriarch of Constantinople.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.210
Patriarch Cerularius, or Carry-u-larius.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.166
Saying that, "Hey, these
guys are going against

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:56.728
"what is actually
acceptable in Christianity."

00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:59.946
Now in retaliation, you have Pope Leo IX

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:02.521
shutting down what would
be known as Greek churches

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:05.060
and how they practice in
the Italian Peninsula.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.771
Either closing them down or forcing them

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:10.521
to practice the way the Latins practice.

00:03:10.521 --> 00:03:13.441
Now there's a whole
complicated series of events

00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:15.774
as we go into 1053 and 1054.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:18.907
Letters are sent back and forth.

00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:21.103
Eventually, Pope Leo IX sends

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.931
a delegation to Constantinople.

00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:26.759
Part of it is to see
if they can coordinate

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:30.854
against Norman conquerors
on the Italian Peninsula.

00:03:30.854 --> 00:03:33.350
But part of it is also to make clear

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.808
what Pope Leo IX believes,
that, "Hey, you have no right

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:39.734
"to criticize us about
this unleavened bread.

00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:42.319
"You don't have authority over us.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.025
"I am the pope in Rome.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:48.605
"I have the seat of Peter,
first amongst apostles."

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:49.575
And the leader of the delegation

00:03:49.575 --> 00:03:53.574
is a particularly proud
and principled individual.

00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:55.522
When they go to Constantinople,

00:03:55.522 --> 00:03:59.422
Patriarch Cerularius
doesn't even meet them.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:01.819
Essentially he's rebuffing their demands.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.427
And so because of that,
that delegation decides

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:08.352
to excommunicate Cerularius,

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:10.703
the Patriarch of Constantinople.

00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:12.604
The leader of what is now

00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:14.846
the most important church in the East.

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:17.129
Remember, the other significant
centers of Christianity

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:19.917
are now under Muslim rule.

00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:23.133
Well, in retaliation to
that, Patriarch Cerularius

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.571
says, "Hey, you can't excommunicate me.

00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:27.660
"In fact, I'm going to excommunicate you."

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.471
And he excommunicates the delegation.

00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.909
Excommunication says, "I am saying you

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:35.029
"are no longer part of the church."

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.564
Now, when all of these
cross excommunications

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:40.197
are happening, many people
probably viewed this as,

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:41.952
"Hey, this is just a power
struggle between folks,

00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:43.941
"probably not a big deal."

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:47.842
But remember, this is over
centuries of increasing division.

00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:49.166
Not only do you have language division,

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.052
in the West, you have a leaning

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:54.197
towards these Germanic kingdoms.

00:04:54.197 --> 00:04:59.170
In the East, they say, "Hey,
we are the real Roman Empire."

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.401
You have these issues of
fo-lo-quay, and other things.

00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:07.842
And this event in 1054
eventually gets known

00:05:07.842 --> 00:05:12.074
as the Great Schism,
or the East-West Schism

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:15.002
because it only gets further
and further cemented.

00:05:15.002 --> 00:05:17.242
And they get only further
and further apart.

00:05:17.242 --> 00:05:20.226
As you get to the end of the 11th century,

00:05:20.226 --> 00:05:21.494
the Crusades begin.

00:05:21.494 --> 00:05:23.933
And we'll do more videos
detailing the Crusades.

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.321
Where the Western kings
start sending folks at first

00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.959
on the surface to try to help
the Byzantines reconquer land

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.299
from the Muslim empires.

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:37.290
But even when they are successful,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.492
they don't give that land
back to the Byzantines.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:41.774
They actually set up Crusader kingdoms.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:44.658
And as they make their way
through the Byzantine Empire,

00:05:44.658 --> 00:05:47.526
they cause, for the most
part, a bit of a stir.

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:48.796
They're not particularly respectful

00:05:48.796 --> 00:05:51.971
through the lands that they pass.

00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.730
And it really comes to
a point in 1204 where

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.861
at the end of the fourth Crusade,

00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:01.495
the Crusaders actually decide,
even though the purpose

00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:04.517
was arguably to reclaim
land from the Muslims,

00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:06.318
the Crusaders decide to siege

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:10.700
and sack Constantinople
itself and take over.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.027
Now a few decades later,
the Byzantine nobility

00:06:14.027 --> 00:06:15.673
is able to retake it.

00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:17.485
But that kind of cements the difference

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:20.651
between the Latin and the Greek church.

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.283
Known today as the Catholic Church,

00:06:23.283 --> 00:06:25.967
followed by roughly one
and a half billion people

00:06:25.967 --> 00:06:29.040
and the Eastern Orthodox Church, followed

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.540
by roughly 250 million people.
