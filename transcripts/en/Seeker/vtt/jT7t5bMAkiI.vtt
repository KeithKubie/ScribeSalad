00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.650
Five things that people use, I tried to find
them, they mess up our ozone and I have resigned

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.840
them...to the land of Mordor.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.000
Where the shadows lie.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.379
Lord of the Rings.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.480
No?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.670
That’s fine.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.360
Hey everyone, welcome back to DNews, I’m
Matt Lieberman.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.849
By now, everyone knows that our ozone is depleting,
and that things like cars and factories are

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:23.849
to blame.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.720
Now we’ve made many solid advances on that
front, from hybrid and electric cars, to the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.550
increased use of solar energy, but have we
thought of everything?

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.379
I feel like we’re forgetting something,
or, for that matter, several things that contribute

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.400
to the continued depletion of our precious
atmosphere.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.329
Here are five products that need a serious
eco-upgrade.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.370
For example, over 50 million Americans use
gas-powered lawn mowers on a weekly basis,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.970
contributing 5% of the United States’ air
pollution alone according to People Powered

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.109
Machines.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.260
Mowers seem small, but running a lawnmower
for one hour is the equivalent of running

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.859
11 cars for an hour simultaneously.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.180
Not to mention that in re-fueling our lawn-munching
mowers, we spill on average 17 million gallons

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.720
of fuel per year.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.460
This fuel evaporates into the air and has
the potential to form smog.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.700
In closing, turn off the engine and find an
electric alternative!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.610
And while we’re on the subject of lawn care,
can we talk about leaf blowers?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.470
Besides causing noise pollution of the loudest
degree, they also contribute to air pollution

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.470
in a big way.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.490
This is due to the widely used two-stroke
engine system.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.009
In a 2011 study, car experts at Edmunds found
that “a consumer-grade leafblower emitted

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.060
more pollutants than a 6,200 pound 2011 Ford
F-150 SVT Raptor”.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:44.110
In the test, they determined that a two-stroke
leafblower spat out almost 299 times the amount

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.260
of hydrocarbons as a pick-up truck.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.159
Can we crack a window, please?

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.180
Actually, don’t, the air conditioning’s
on.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.830
Actually, you know what?, shut it off and
open that window.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.810
Air conditioners are also a big culprit here,
so much so that the EPA discussed their environmental

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.869
impact in their paper Good Up High, Bad Down
Low.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.560
The chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that they
emit cause a build-up of ozone in our lower

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
atmosphere.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.950
Now we want ozone way up there, but down here,
it translates to smog, smog, smog.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.750
Another household pollutant emitter is personal
generators, which are often used in non-emergency

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.750
conditions.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.770
Generators emit nitrogen oxide, another creator
of lower-atmospheric ozone.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.811
Unless we can regulate their use, we’re
going to have a whole mess of trouble on our

00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:21.560
hands anytime people feel like going off the
grid.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.530
And finally, I want to talk about lighters.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.110
You know, the bics that you flick?

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.860
Whether you smoke or are just a big time candle
fan, you should know that lighters emit about

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.320
237 milligrams of carbon dioxide per minute.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.222
To put that in perspective, if 1000 people
did a minute-long lighter salute at their

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:41.530
favorite concert, they’d release 1.2 kilograms
of carbon dioxide all at once.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.410
Now your average power plant produces 12,200
kg of CO2 in that same time.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.080
So imagine if that 1000 person salute happened
at 100 different concerts at once.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
We’re looking at a power plant’s worth
of pollutants.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.470
Let’s not and say we did, hmm?

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.480
Suggested questions: Anything I missed?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.230
Are you gonna think twice before firing up
these things?

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:12.440
