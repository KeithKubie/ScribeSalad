&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
Good morning.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm Stephanie Merry,
the Book World editor

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.760
at "The Washington Post,"
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.580
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.400
First, a word of thanks to the
Co-Chairman of the Festival,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.020
David Rubenstein, and the
other generous sponsors

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.050
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.340
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.690
please note the information
in your program.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.070
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.980
and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.820
to the microphone, you will be
included in the video recording

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.050
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.300
Our guest this morning, as you
all know, is David Ignatius,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.360
a columnist for "The
Washington Post"

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.100
who keeps plenty busy writing
smart commentary about politics

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.490
and foreign affairs but
somehow manages to also squeeze

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.370
in a career as a novelist.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.590
His most recent espionage
thriller, "The Quantum Spy,"

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.880
is his tenth novel and it's
an artful blend of science

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.640
and subterfuge that follows
the race between China

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.460
and the United States to build
the first quantum computer.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.640
And I learned so much

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.630
about quantum computing
reading your book.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.960
I didn't know anything about
it and I'd love to hear sort

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.500
of your background, your
fascination with the subject

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.480
and when you realized that
it would make a good subject

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.640
for a novel.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.010
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Let me start
by quoting Richard Feynman,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.710
the Nobel Prize winning
physicist who said,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.900
"If you think you
understand quantum mechanics,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.510
you don't understand
quantum mechanics."

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.410
And I fear that that is true

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.020
with my own non-technologist
understanding

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.960
of this fascinating
but complicated area.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.150
I'll talk about it in a
minute but I just have to say

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.530
to this audience, this
is a thrill for me

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.430
because the person interviewing
me, Stephanie Merry,

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.840
my colleague at "The Washington
Post," is the daughter of one

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.230
of my wife's and my closest
friends who I've known

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.090
since I started as a
journalist in the mid 1970s.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.060
We covered labor together at
"The Wall Street Journal."

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.370
His name is Bob Merry.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.350
He's a distinguished biographer,
so to have Bob's daughter Steph,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.100
a great movie critic and now
book editor, interviewing me is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.400
like that's as cool as it gets.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.200
So, thanks.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.330
[ Applause ]

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.410
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: Thank you.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.710
Thanks. Yes.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.010
It's a thrill for me too.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.630
He came to my creating
write class in high school

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.490
and I asked all the questions
and so now here we are.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.200
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: You
didn't ask me in high school

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.630
about quantum computing.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.900
So I'm going to give
the one-minute version.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.050
Every computer that we have
ever used is what we know call a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.970
classical computer and
that it's made up of bits

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.590
that are either zero or one.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.290
They're on or off
and that's the symbol

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.690
with those simple logic gates.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.500
A quantum computer, if it
could be built and you have

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.660
to always add that, would be
made up of qubits, quantum bits,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.230
that would be, strange
as it sounds,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.330
zero and one at the same time.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.460
They'd be in that quantum state.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.490
People often liken it to
coin that you're flipping,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.780
which is both heads and tails as
it spins and it only becomes one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.570
or the other when it lands.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.710
And as we know from
our, you know,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.540
high school physics classes,
it's only when we intervene

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.790
and observe that this
quantum state is resolved

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.090
in one direction or another.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.580
So qubits that could have
this simultaneity that could

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.590
in effect compute in every
direction would be vastly more

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.720
powerful than existing
computer architectures.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.850
The world of intelligence
got interested

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.720
in quantum computers
back in the 1990s,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.290
when an MIT mathematician named
Peter Shor posited what came

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.300
to be called Shor's
algorithm which said

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.310
that if a quantum computer could
be built with these properties,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.520
it would be able to factor very
large numbers very quickly.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.700
Basically, encryption involves,
you know, multiplying numbers

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.430
to get these enormous
strings of numbers

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.310
that to factor them using even
the most powerful classical

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.780
supercomputers would take
hundreds of years, centuries,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.590
you know, basically
impossible time

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.450
to do it through brute force.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.630
But if you had a quantum
computer, it could be done

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.110
in a matter of seconds
or minutes.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.770
That's the power of it.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.140
So, the intelligence world has
been very excited about this

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.070
and as I began to read into
it, I realized that we were

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.140
in a race with China,
which in this area

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.190
of supercomputing is really
working hard to be dominant,

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.490
to have the commanding height.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.490
Xi Jinping and his big
party plenum last year,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.570
where he announced that Xi
Jinping thought was now an

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.120
official, you know, up
there with Mao Tse-tung,

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.280
announced his plan for
China to dominate a series

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.000
of technologies by 2025,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.060
2030 and quantum
computing is one of them.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.240
So it's one of those things

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.730
like the Manhattan Project
that's sort of a race between us

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.410
and other countries that
want to get there first.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.120
The prize for winning that race
is significant and it seemed

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.890
like an interesting
background for this novel.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.330
The fun of the novel
I hope is not so much

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.280
in the complicated
technology that you sort

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.980
of kind of oh yeah, whatever.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.720
If you want to read
more about it, you can.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.330
But in the way in which the
Chinese intelligence officers

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.630
are rendered.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.440
In spy fiction, we know
everything about the Russians,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.070
I mean, spy fiction, just
pick up the newspaper.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.720
You can't escape
Russian malign activity.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.120
We know almost nothing
about the Chinese.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.860
There's never been a
[inaudible] like character,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.300
like Carlos who helps us
to see the operating style.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.570
So that was a lot of the
fun of this book for me.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.140
Characters that I hope you'll
come away from most interested

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.020
in this novel are the
Chinese intelligence officers,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.990
the head of their
Ministry of State Security,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.750
Li Zian is my fictional
character and a young officer

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.890
who works for him who
I call Carlos Wang.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.460
And then also you'll be
interested in the hero

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.940
of this novel who's a
Chinese-American CIA officer.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.010
CIA as we know is a modern
diverse workforce today run

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.310
by a woman.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.910
Gina Haspel is now the first
woman director of the CIA.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.210
But there are a lot of people

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.110
from all the different
ethnic groups in the agency

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.130
who sometimes feel
that they're seen

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.070
through their ethnicity rather
than as simply as officers.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.670
And that's what happens

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:12.350
to Harris Chang is
he's manipulated first

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.000
by his own colleagues and then
by the Chinese who see him first

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.580
of all in terms of his ethnic
identity and it makes him mad

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.980
and so the novel is the story
of how that anger begins

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.980
to play itself out as he's
dealing with this puzzle

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.830
of Chinese attempts to steal
our quantum computing secrets.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.130
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
And Harris Chang is

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.040
such an interesting character.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:40.460
As you were mentioning, he's
American of Chinese descent.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.790
The Chinese kind of
see him as a traitor

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.060
to his people even though
he doesn't see himself,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.920
you know, as Chinese primarily.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.100
But I kept thinking how it was
interesting it added this new

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.820
layer to the novel
that wouldn't be there

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.500
if he looked like say Jack Ryan.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.620
So can you talk a
little bit about coming

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.110
up with this character
and why you felt

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.060
like it was important
to the story?

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.500
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So I've been
interested since the beginning

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.490
of my career as a
spy novelist in 1987

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:12.360
and how the CIA really
works as opposed

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.130
to these fanciful
descriptions that you often read

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.440
in spy fiction and
in particular the way

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.870
in which this more diverse
workforce interacts.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:29.270
The Chinese in their recruitment
efforts historically have played

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.900
heavily on ethnicity
and loyalty.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.600
They've gone to people of
Chinese descent around the world

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:42.360
and said, our poor struggling
country, we're just trying

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.850
to become wealthy enough
to support our people

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.720
and we just need a little help
and this and this and this.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.250
And it often is a very
powerful recruitment pitch

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.780
because you're just helping a
little and they just need help

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.170
with this particular thing.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:01.960
There's a moment in this book

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.570
where the Chinese intelligence
service is really trying

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:13.290
to squeeze and pitch
Harris Chang in which they

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.680
through meticulous research
show him pictures of the village

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.930
in Southern China where
his family came from.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.820
His family came in
the 19th century,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.270
worked on the railroads,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.290
as so many Chinese-Americans
families did

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.610
and they've got the
pay slips and they know

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.350
where the great-grandfather
worked

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.650
and they know what
happened to him

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.590
and they know here's
somebody from your village

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.360
and it looks just like
one of Harris' relatives.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.080
And it's an attempt -- And
they know a lot of other things

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.180
about his family that
are but I won't go

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.990
into because they're
more central to the plot.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:55.040
And it has a powerful effect on
Harris Chang but he rejects it.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.670
He's a CIA officer and his
problem in this book is

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.950
that his insistence
that he is a loyal,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.490
committed CIA officer isn't
believed by his colleagues.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.260
And they begin to
doubt him and think

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.690
that he's been compromised.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.020
And I think that that --
There's some real life stories

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.920
if you follow this literature.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.720
Wen Ho Lee is an example
[inaudible] Los Alamos

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.030
where this issue is played out.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.660
You also will know if you've
been reading the newspapers

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.210
that, you know, in the months
since this book was published,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:32.300
two interesting things happened.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.210
One is the Chinese
commitment to beat us

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.160
in quantum computing is now,
you know, front page news

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.460
on "The Wall Street Journal."

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.940
Believe it or not, it's
terrifying to think of,

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.100
a quantum computing
caucus in the Congress.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.680
If there's one thing that could
really mess us up, that's it.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.600
And there also was the
indictment and arrest

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.320
of a Chinese-American accused
of trying to steal technology,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.700
Chinese-American CIA officer
who like Harris Chang,

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:12.000
served in the Army, who was
accused of trying to steal

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.980
and betray big secrets
and that's just happened.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:19.910
So, you know, this is
fiction imitating life

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.210
imitating fiction.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.510
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And
it's not the first time.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.500
I remember with "The Director,"
you were writing "The Director"

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.780
in a character that was
much like Edward Snowden

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.450
and then Edward Snowden
appeared, right?

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.510
So you've been fairly
prescient with these novels.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.740
Is it important to be
topical with these?

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:40.520
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius:
So, Stephanie,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.980
the joy of writing fiction
for me is playing in the world

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.880
of fact which I explore every
twice a week in my columns

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.690
against the canvas of fiction
where you can let ideas develop,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.470
give them a richness,
obviously go beyond 750 words,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.850
thank goodness.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.900
And to think when I begin
a novel, I think two years

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.910
from now when people are
reading this book, what's going

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.810
to seem interesting to them
because you have to sort

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:14.950
of guess, you know, what down
the road will be of interest.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.870
And I did feel -- I was
starting the book actually,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.300
Edward Snowden, I was finishing
that novel when the Snowden,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.630
you know, appeared with all
of his secrets and I thought,

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.630
oh my gosh, real life is
so much more interesting

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.930
than the book I wrote.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:36.570
Let me, you know, madly
scramble to try to do it

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:40.370
in a way that's more interesting
and that gets the way

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.600
in which the Russians
might've been involved

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:48.070
in this Wikileaks underground
as we read increasingly it seems

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.800
to have been the case.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.610
Madly rewrote the first draft
that I'd written of this novel,

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.250
showed it to my wife, Eve,
who's sitting in the second row,

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.680
you know, just wanting so much
for her to say, oh, David,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.000
you know, it's so much better.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.520
And Eve, thank goodness, said,
I don't think it's there yet.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.370
And I always say, you know,
that is the greatest gift

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.740
that anybody can give
a writer is, you know,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:20.420
the person whose judgment
you trust, you know,

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:25.080
person you most want approval
from withholds it and says,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960
you can do better than this.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.400
So I thought, you know,
you're right, Eve.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.890
Here's the book I
wish I had written.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:34.640
I only have six weeks left.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.270
And she said, well,
write that book.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.570
[inaudible].

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.340
So I did madly and that
ended up being a book

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:45.920
that looks prescient but it was

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:51.270
because of a desperate last
minute attempt to make it fit

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.200
with what we were understanding
in the real world was happening.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.780
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: And
touching on this sort of fact

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:03.050
and fiction blend, there are a
number of moments in the novel

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:05.610
when one character
says, everyone's worried

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.470
about the Russians but we
should really be worrying

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.770
about the Chinese.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.360
And there were a couple
of times where I thought,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.710
is this repartee or is
this David Ignatius trying

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:14.540
to tell me something.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.880
And I wonder if you
are kind of, you know,

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.150
delivering messages here.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.650
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Well, I'm
trying to capture what's real

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:28.230
in my fiction but as you know
if you read the recent columns

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:34.210
of mine, just in early
August was with a group

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.790
of very senior former
government officials listening

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.270
to the top technologists
in our country

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.320
at something called the Aspen
Strategy Group that I'm a member

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.530
of and I describe this as a
sputnik moment for this group,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.870
former secretaries of state,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.440
former national security
advisors, as they listened

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.160
to people say from
the technology sphere,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.170
it's top people who are
speaking off the record,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.730
if you knew what I know, you
would see that in every area

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.050
that matters to my company
and to the United States,

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:12.350
the Chinese are ahead of us.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.860
They are prepared to
capture this space.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.980
They are prepared to
capture this market segment.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.820
They're just -- And it was
a wakeup for everybody.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.120
Artificial intelligence

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.860
in particular is an area
that's going to be so dominant,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.940
you know, I mean I hate
to say it but it's going

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.740
to transform every
aspect of our economy.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.980
It's coming at us and
the Chinese for all sorts

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.600
of reasons appear to have the
lead in some areas of this

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.200
and so, you know, was for
me, it was a wakeup call.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.620
The book is in part about that.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:51.530
I do think just thinking
about, you know,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.530
Chinese economic
growth, Chinese miracle

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.590
which we has been the story of
my, you know, all of our lives,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.710
seeing this country come out
of poverty, become on the way

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.420
to being wealthy, on the
way to being our equal.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.180
You know, it's a great story
in a humanitarian sense.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.480
So many people coming

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.640
out of terrible poverty
into a good life.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.230
But there is a national security
aspect to this that we do have

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.410
to think about and so I'm
trying to do that both

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.970
in my fact and fiction.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.270
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
And you mentioned

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.020
that there's a fair amount of
secrecy we don't know a lot

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.970
of what's happening behind
the scenes but there were

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:34.060
so many scenes in
the novel, you know,

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.200
between the intelligence
officials in China

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.490
and the military officials.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.560
And how much of that was just
kind of you had to invent it

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.780
out of whole cloth and how much
of it were you able to sort

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.580
of research and find out?

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.200
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius:
So I researched --

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.960
I hate making things
up entirely.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.200
I'm not very good at it.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:01.660
So it's a fact that Xi Jinping
has over the last five years,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.770
when he's been president
of China,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.990
replaced an entire generation
of leadership in the military,

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.940
the party, and, most
interestingly,

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.470
the intelligence service
and installed his people.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:20.340
And he's used what he calls the
discipline inspection commission

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:25.120
as the tool of what is
really a political purge.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.300
So, you know, in the
previous generation,

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.260
there wasn't the
Chinese party official,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.850
general intelligence officer
who didn't have something going

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.670
on the side, through his
family, through somebody.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:40.270
The country is just getting
so rich that everybody had

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:47.110
that bank account overseas, that
apartment or home in Vancouver

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.730
or Montreal or Australia.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.300
And Xi, through the
discipline inspection process,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.790
began to just use that and fire
people, bring criminal charges,

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.790
and as I say, wiped out, there
isn't a senior general left

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.330
in the Chinese military who
wasn't hit by this process.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.840
The intelligence service had its
whole leadership team wiped out

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.420
and so this novel opens with
Harris Chang, my CIA officer,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.710
using information he has about
a Chinese intelligence officer

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.180
who is corrupt, who has been
on the take, and saying,

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.200
here it is, here's the file.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.430
Unless you help us do what
we need, this file with end

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.240
up with the discipline
inspection commission in a week.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.740
Okay, make up your mind.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.620
And I'm sure that in real life
there have been many similar

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.400
situations where
vulnerable military officers,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:51.600
intelligence officers, you know,
who were, you know, could get,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.010
could be destroyed if some
information were shared

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.200
that that vulnerability
has been used.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.720
But it's, you know,
China, Stephanie,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.160
is a country we know still so
little about in these military

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.630
and intelligence areas.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.090
The last thing I want to
do is encourage people

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.440
to get all hysterical
and oh my gosh, you know.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.230
We just need to be more
realistic as we think

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:22.010
about them, understand,
you know, their ambitions

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.990
to be a great power, understand
the particular ways in which

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.340
that might be threatening to us,

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.960
to understand the many other
ways in which it isn't.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.650
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: In order to
show sort of an authentic story,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.280
it occurred to me that this
took a fair amount of research.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.130
I mean, you were talking
about quantum computing.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.090
You were using Chinese
slang, things like that.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.930
Do you have people sort of
on speed dial that, you know,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.690
you can run pass, like this
is how I'm describing quantum

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.610
computing, does this sound
right or how does that work?

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:52.910
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So
with each of my books,

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.250
I try to assemble
that speed dial list.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.880
In this case when I was
beginning work on the book,

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.900
I went to Craig Mundie
who was one

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.290
of the most senior
technologists at Microsoft

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.090
and I said, Craig, I need help.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.290
Would you introduce me to
the people at Microsoft

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.590
who are really thinking
creatively

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.890
about quantum computing.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:18.060
And needless to say, they
had some absolutely brilliant

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.570
physicists, a man name Michael
Freedman at the University

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.390
of California at Santa Barbara,

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.320
a woman named Krysta Svore
who's writing a language

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.770
for a quantum computer
that doesn't yet exist.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.630
Their idea of how to
do this is with sort

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.970
of braided nano wires that,
you know, encode the qubits

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.220
that she's writing, if you could
imagine this, a braided language

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.230
that will give instructions,
it's just wow!

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.030
So, you know, I spent
time with them.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.550
I went to see a company
in Vancouver

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.570
that claims its already
build a quantum computer

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.950
that has 200 qubits.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.910
Now I think actually more
than that called D-wave

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.330
and saw how they just to say one
more word about the technology.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.450
The problem with these qubits

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.670
that can do fabulous
computing is

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:16.020
that they only stay
operational for milliseconds.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.040
And so the enemy of the quantum
computer is what's called

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:24.270
decoherence in which these
qubits just stop having,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.300
they lose their quantum state.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.730
And so you want to keep them
coherent for as long as you can.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.240
Even a brief instant, you
can do an enormous amount

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.530
of computing if it's done right.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.150
So these quantum chips are

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:43.150
in cryogenic super-cold
environment,

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:44.490
just above absolute zero.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.740
I went to the lab where D-wave
has its quantum computer.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.990
The guy said -- The founder
of the firm said, David,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.320
I'm going to show you the
coldest place in the universe.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.240
And he meant it.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.290
And he took me to the
refrigeration sort of scheme.

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:07.250
It looks like kind of upside
down ice cream cone on top

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:12.170
of a chip and they bring this
down in stages using chemical

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:15.250
down to literally just
above absolute zero.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.870
I mean, I watched it go
down to like 13 millikelvin,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:22.770
which is in fact the coldest
place in the universe.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.720
Deep space is about twice that.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.120
And it was just extraordinary
to see, you know,

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:34.200
not just the technology but
the pathways to the technology.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.100
It turns out cryogenics sort of
super-cold environment is useful

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.030
in all kinds of computing
applications.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:46.760
So that's a long answer to
yes, I did a lot of research.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.190
The University of Maryland
has what it hopes will be one

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.480
of the world's leading
centers for quantum computing.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.780
I spent a lot of time there.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.980
I spent a lot of
time with [inaudible]

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.410
and his program managers
who were talking me

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.830
through what they're funding,
what they're not funding,

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.810
and when they should decide
to make something classified.

00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:05.270
That's another fascinating
puzzle here,

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.690
what do you keep open so
the whole world can share it

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.930
and work on it together
and what do you bring

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.730
in to our veil of secrecy.

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.260
So that, you know, for me,
Stephanie, the fun of working

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.800
on a book is getting
to do this research.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.900
I love going out and
finding new things.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.690
I, you know, I try to start with
something new with each book

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.060
and in the end I did
send each chapter

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.550
that I had something really
technical to the person

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.050
that helped me and said,
"Am I going to make a fool

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.720
out of myself with this?"

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:42.080
And somebody said in a
review, this book is better

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.690
than it deserves to be
[audience laughter].

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.660
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry:
That's a compliment.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.960
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: It is.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.260
That means it was a close
call [audience laughter].

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.500
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: It
sounds like you do as much

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.620
if not more research
for your novels

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.850
than your journalistic work.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.150
Is that fair to say?

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.540
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: You know, I'm
always doing them both together.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:11.050
I am not a technologist but
I can see the obvious fact

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:14.490
that technology, the businesses
that surround technology,

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.800
the national security
implications

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.460
of technology are the
drivers in our world.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:25.490
And so I need, if I'm going to
pursue the mission that I chose

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.810
when I began writing fiction,
to write realistic spy novels,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.740
I've got to understand this
stuff enough to have it

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.510
in the background of my novels
because it's in the background

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.710
of all the intelligence
work that's done

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:38.010
out there in real life.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:44.870
And I hope other people making
all of us more comfortable

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.480
with the intersection of
traditional espionage and,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.290
you know, the world
of the Internet,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.710
the world of technology,
that's what real life is about

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.070
and I hope novelists
will do that.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.600
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I know
that a lot of people that come

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.800
to the Book Festival have,
you know, a novel idea

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.820
or a novel draft sitting in
a desk drawer or someplace

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.370
and you have managed to make
it work and you're prolific

00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:13.930
and I don't even know how
you're able to produce so much.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:15.230
What's your secret?

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.590
Do you have a certain
number of words or hours

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:21.020
that you force yourself
to work on this a day?

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.690
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So
just to say two things.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.830
I'm sure that what
Stephanie said is right

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:30.710
and that there are many
novelists in the audience.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:36.100
I think the first thing I say
is we should write fiction

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.540
for the pleasure that
we get in writing it

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.840
because you never know.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.400
It's such a crap shoot whether
anybody's going to read it

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.640
or indeed if it'll
even be published

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.380
but I think the pleasure
of inventing this world

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.780
in your mind and then
having somebody, you know,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.050
even if it's just a
family member read it,

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:58.140
you know, that's the payoff.

00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.860
My first novel, "Agents
of Innocence"

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.650
which everybody celebrates,
oh my gosh, you know,

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.660
I couldn't get that
book published.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.280
I had lived through
something in Beirut.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.640
I had lived through the story
that that book describes,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.110
how the CIA recruited
Arafat's chief of intelligence

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:18.820
and ran him as an American asset

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.760
and then how the case
officer [inaudible] was killed

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.060
in the American embassy.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.360
I lived through that.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.660
I lived that whole story.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.960
I had published it
on the front page

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.640
of "The Wall Street Journal" and
I just I knew so much about it

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.540
that I was certain
there was a novel there.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.160
I sent it -- When my
children were young,

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.440
I'd go to their schools and
I'd bring along a big book bag

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.940
and I'd say, you know, well,
so, you know, I really want

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.380
to publish this book and I
sent it to a dozen publishers

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.960
which is true and they all
said no and [inaudible], oh,

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.980
and then, you know,
and I'd read one

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.420
of the rejections
notices, you know.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.180
Dear Mr. Ignatius, you know, how
interesting that you imagined

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.510
that you could write a
novel, but we're sorry.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.500
That was, I mean, literally
every publisher in the country.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:13.420
So kids -- Finally, one
publisher, W. W. Norton,

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.660
still my publisher, said
we're not sure we're going

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:20.320
to publish the novel but
we'll give you an advance

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.230
against a later work
of nonfiction

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.100
and we'll publish
the novel, you know,

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.640
to get you to write the
book we do want, not --

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.220
So I went back and I rewrote it.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.750
And with that vote
of confidence,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.500
I made it something really good.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.040
So I'll say to the kids,
"so, it was published"

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.320
and you know here's the English
and then it got published

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.830
in French and then in German
and then in Serbo-Croatian

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.120
and then pretty soon there's
this stack of books resting

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.910
on the rejection notice and
I think that's the, you know,

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:56.230
if you can finish the book
and stick with it and be lucky

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:01.600
as I was, you'll end
up having a readership.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.930
So long as you just don't count

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:07.340
on that readership being
huge or making much money.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.410
I mean, I'm glad I never
quit my day job because I --

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:13.380
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: So that
aspect of it got easier

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.680
in terms of selling the books.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.980
But do you feel like
you've evolved

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:18.530
in certain ways as a novelist?

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.790
Has it gotten easier?

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.440
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: It
doesn't really get easier.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:27.820
What I have realized is that and
this is the genre fiction room,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:32.530
that it's really important if
you're writing genre fiction,

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:37.710
in my case a spy novel, that you
understand and accept the limits

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:39.600
of that genre, which is to say

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.670
that you understand
the expectations

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:46.370
that readers have reading
their book, that they want

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:51.520
to be surprised, confused,
taken on a journey.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.770
They want to feel that they're
in the hands of an author

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:57.760
who knows where the
plot is going even

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.720
if the reader's confused.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.640
You need to keep in mind
the experience as a reader,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.730
like what is it that makes
you read on more chapter,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.820
what's that thing that this
kind of book is doing for you.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.540
In some of my earlier
books, I forgot that.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:15.090
And I didn't stick
closely enough

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.250
to the demands of the genre.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:22.560
I wrote one book that I'm very
proud of called "The Sun King"

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.580
and I got a note, Eve has
heard me tell this story

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:32.640
but somebody sent me an email
that said, Dear Mr. Ignatius,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.580
I read your spy novel "Body
of Lies" and on the strength

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:40.090
of that, I bought your
novel "The Sun King."

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.390
I want my money back
[audience laughter].

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.660
Because it's a novel.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.960
It's not a spy novel.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.260
It's a novel novel.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.690
It's about people
and love and ambition

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.990
and kind of self destruction.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.290
It's a novel.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:57.910
But that's not what it
turned out most people wanted

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.610
to read from yours truly.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.910
Okay, I got it.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:04.970
And since then I've
stuck to my genre.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.520
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: I want to
make sure that we have some time

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.890
for questions from the audience.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.020
So if you would like to come up,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:16.030
we have microphones
here and here.

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.370
&gt;&gt; The Chinese supposedly
have a quantum satellite,

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.730
do you believe, and
your sources believe it

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.710
and how worried should
we be about it?

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.690
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius:
So they have --

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.110
One of the things the
Chinese are working on very,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.830
very hard is the
ability to, you know,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:39.030
in effect have quantum
effects at some distance.

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.690
And, you know, that
are coordinated.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:43.070
When you say "quantum
satellite,"

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.940
I think that's what
you're referring to.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.360
And I do believe that.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.910
The Chinese also are
said to be experimenting

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.700
with what they call
quantum radar

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.740
which again uses
quantum properties

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:03.450
and if it's successful
could shred our advantage

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:06.500
in stealth technology which is
really important in our ability

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.090
to penetrate and
deliver weapons.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.760
So I take some of that --

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.710
Some of the other claims that
they make about their advances

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:22.320
in quantum computing, I think
are hype and I don't think

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.620
that they're there yet.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.900
And I should just say, everybody
that I talk to who really knows

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.290
about the subject to the point

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:34.010
that they can't tell me
everything they know says the

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:40.540
most sophisticated applications
that will involve decryption,

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.170
Shor's algorithm are
the farthest off.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.950
They're a lot of
things that are closer.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.340
Some real close, pattern
recognition, other, you know,

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.470
kind of optimization
problems can be done very,

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.930
very fast it seems
with quantum computing.

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.480
So the -- I think the
concern that I hear is more

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.680
about Chinese domination
of AI in part

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.900
because the Chinese have access
to so much structured data.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:12.630
You know, data is what AI
machine learning learns on,

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:17.980
that's the fuel for
the AI machine.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.400
The Chinese have the fuel.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.270
We really don't and
that's one reason

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.200
that they have a huge advantage.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.930
Yes?

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.230
&gt;&gt; A related question.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.530
A number of people have written

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.740
about the existential
threat posed by AI,

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.710
including Stephen Hawking.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.840
I have trouble believing this

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.610
but would quantum
computing finally make

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.560
that a real problem?

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.190
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Quantum
computing would allow anything

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:54.950
that involves enormous amounts
of computation fast enough

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:57.280
that it would be feasible
where today it isn't feasible

00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.900
and there's some sublime benign
consequences of that in terms

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.890
of drug design, in
terms of simulation,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.530
in terms of material science,

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:09.150
the ability to create
wonderful new things

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.930
that will have beneficial
effects for humanity.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.180
So there's a very positive side

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.720
that people get enthusiastic
about.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:27.180
I think the AI worry that
vexes people is when you get

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.640
to generalized artificial
intelligence,

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.490
machines that really can think,
do they begin to think in ways

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.480
that we can't control
or aren't aware of.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.400
Will they explain
themselves to us

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.540
as they solve problems
or make decisions?

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.390
I mean, transparency of the
AI solutions so you, you know,

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.370
the AI system figures
out how to cure a disease

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.090
but it doesn't tell
you how it did that.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.250
Is it able to do that?

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:00.730
I think those are
some of the problems

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.180
that people are interested in.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.870
You know, to take one
that's fascinated me

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.940
that I just reference
in "The Quantum Spy,"

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.400
so as you design the
driverless car, how do you deal

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.540
with the problem of whether
the car should swerve

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.950
to avoid hitting the deer
that's crossing the street

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:20.670
if that will bring
it near a pedestrian

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.910
or suppose the driverless car
is approaching an intersection

00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:27.850
where on one side
there's a baby carriage

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:32.990
and on the other side
there's a senior citizen.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:36.530
How is the machine programmed
to deal with that issue?

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:37.880
Well, obviously it's
a nightmare.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.120
You don't want the
programmer to play God

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.290
as between the baby
carriage and grandma.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:49.200
But, you know, those are I
think when people get worried

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:53.770
about an AI world, magnify that
kind of decision, you know,

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:59.460
into national security into
it said that for example

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.480
that although we always talk
about having humans in the loop,

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.430
that's the phrase
that people use

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.050
to reassure themselves
about an AI world.

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:08.350
Well, we'll have
humans in the loop.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.650
Well, that's just not realistic.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:15.170
You know, in the times that
you'll be reacting to cyber

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.650
or other attacks in which
satellites will be disabled,

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.920
you know, whole tiers
of satellites

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.840
in space will be knocked
out, there won't be time

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.890
for a human to make
the decision.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.810
So humans need to be
in the loop right now

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.980
as the systems are designed
thinking about the kind

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:37.140
of issues that Hawking raises,
that thoughtful people raise

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.660
so that the systems are designed

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.330
with the wisest most ethical
guidelines we can have.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.480
But once we're in the world

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.030
in which those systems
will be used,

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.470
the idea that humans
will intervene I think is

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.110
completely unrealistic.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:58.950
&gt;&gt; I've read and loved
all your spy novels.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.650
Every time I've read one, I've
asked myself, have you worked

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.260
in US intelligence for the CIA?

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.220
I'm sure you've been
asked this before.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.520
But I don't know the answer.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.920
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So that's
an easy one to answer.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.420
The answer is no.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.180
I had been fascinated by this
since I grew up in Washington.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.780
The world of the CIA was all

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.190
around in my neighborhood,
you know.

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:25.310
A lot of the parents had
worked for the agency.

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:29.100
So it was like just a
kind of omnipresent thing.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.030
I wanted to be a journalist
from, you know, tenth grade.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.350
I used to sneak into the Howard
Theatre and stayed back stage

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:42.300
and interviewed the
Temptations and Junior Walker.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.740
That's all I was good at.

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:51.550
Happily, it is a violation
of law for the CIA to recruit

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:56.760
or use American journalists
for intelligence purposes

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.750
and I think the bright line that
divides the two is appropriate.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:02.620
I am fascinated by this world

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.120
and over many years I
have internalized a lot

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:14.290
of what people think about but
that's an easy one to answer.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.730
&gt;&gt; Hi. I really enjoy
watching you

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.110
on Morning Joe a
few times a week.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.410
So I enjoy that.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:25.190
In the context of what
you're saying about China

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:29.440
and the challenges that
they pose to the US,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.420
could it possibly be one element

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.500
of current administration's
let's say, I don't know,

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.800
fixation on Russia is perhaps
looking over the horizon

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.150
to trying to use
Russia to contain China?

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.420
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So that's
a fascinating question.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:54.610
Is Donald Trump in some way
trying to do what Kissinger did,

00:37:54.610 --> 00:38:00.600
which was to triangulate these
three powers to, Kissinger

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.850
and Nixon in the opening
to China in part wanted

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.830
to get leverage against
Russia but at

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:12.080
that time was threatening, is
Trump trying to get leverage

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.740
against China that's
potentially threatening

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.000
by being friendlier with Russia?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.350
Well, you know, some evidence
that he may have that in mind.

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:27.110
And, you know, I've written
often enough that I think

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.750
that -- I write often.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.550
I think the idea of
not talking to Russia,

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:33.800
just being totally
obsessed and crazy

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.900
about the subject is a mistake,
that it's important to talk

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.730
to adversaries as harmful I
think Russian actions have been,

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.020
as destabilizing as they
are for our country.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:49.950
You know, there's never time
to stop talking to anybody.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:54.750
So I'm personally
supportive of that.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:58.140
You know, these larger
issues that I'm going to wait

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.640
for Robert Mueller to explain
to me what he could prove

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:08.680
in a legal case as he did in the
indictments, the two indictments

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.620
that involve Russian nationals
before I make up my mind

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.390
about those ultimate questions
but there sure is a lot

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.540
of evidence on its face that the
Russians directly engaged people

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.200
in the Trump campaign,
during the campaign to try

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.550
to do what our intelligence
agency say was shape the

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.410
election in favor of Trump.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:33.830
The evidence is --
There's stacks of it

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:38.110
and that's already out there.

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.410
&gt;&gt; Another quasi-political
question

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.460
that I think you'll have
some familiarity with.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.110
In your research for
your book, can you talk

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.470
about the difference of the
Chinese central planning system

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.730
and their ability to
really direct their assets

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:57.210
versus for example Microsoft or
a private company or something

00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:00.170
like that comparing and
contrasting our two systems

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.340
and do you think that gives
the Chinese an advantage

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.550
or are they going to kind of
fall under their own weight

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:07.640
like Stalin did with
the heavy industry?

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.590
What do you think,
thinking ahead two years?

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.740
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: It's a great
question and it's the kind

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:16.120
of classic dilemma
of central planning.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.580
Obviously, there are
advantages of central planning.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.220
The Chinese Academy of
Sciences, the Chinese government

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.920
and party structure can direct
effort to these technologies

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.220
that thinks they're crucial,

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.880
AI and quantum computing are
the most obvious examples,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.440
and make sure that there is
an enormous flow of resources.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:41.010
The problem is that in doing
that they have to make choices

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:46.530
about which pathways is best
in terms of their funding.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:51.090
And, you know, direct more to
this single ion trap approach

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:55.580
to isolating qubits
than to this, you know,

00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.880
Microsoft's braided, what
are they called, fermions,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.650
and who knows what the
right answer to that is.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:08.110
So a centrally planned system
where somebody's going to try

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:10.830
to pretend they know
the answer may well make

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.990
significant mistakes.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.870
In our system over time, you
know, where people experiment,

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:22.650
fail, try again, fail, finally
get it right and the market,

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.350
you know, pretty reliably
pushes money toward the people

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:30.050
who have the successful
ideas historically has been

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:31.350
most beneficial.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.540
There are certain advantages
that the Chinese have.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:37.380
I mentioned the one that
actually worries me the most.

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.680
It's weird.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:43.370
But the ability to have
structured data so that,

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.150
they have data on every single
thing that human beings do

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:50.530
because they collect it
about their citizens.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.710
That gives them an enormous
advantage in designing systems

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:57.130
that will have generalized
artificial intelligence.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.740
So, our companies are going to
need to have access to some sort

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:04.570
of structured data in
ways that make us nervous

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.530
from a privacy standpoint
but there's got

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:12.590
to be some consortium that helps
them have some raw material

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:13.890
to work with.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.190
I don't know how to do that

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:16.490
but I know people are
thinking hard about it.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.220
I just think it's a
fascinating question,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.000
planning versus un-planning.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.310
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: We have
time for one more question.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.860
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you for
coming and thank you

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.460
for taking my question.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.730
In your book, you
have a character

00:42:29.730 --> 00:42:32.310
who was Chinese-American
whose loyalty

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.390
to the United States
is questioned.

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:37.520
Over the years, there have been
a number of real-life cases

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.150
in which Chinese-Americans
who've worked in the Department

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.680
of Energy and other agencies
have had their loyalty

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.420
questioned and have been
charged with espionage.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.150
I was wondering if
you researched any

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.250
of those real-life cases
and were familiar with them

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.060
in building your character?

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.970
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: So
the case of Wen Ho Lee,

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.900
who I think you're
referring to, the Department

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.660
of Energy employee
who was subjected

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:04.060
to the most intensive
investigation

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:08.320
because people were
convinced, it appears,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:12.170
wrongly that he had done things

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:16.120
at Los Alamos is the
most obvious case.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:23.120
There are other cases and
what deeply vexes my hero,

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.280
Harris Chang, is that
at the end of the day,

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:33.380
his colleagues do not see
his service to his country.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:36.730
You know, he's a veteran of the
Iraq War, among other things

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.210
so much as the color
of his skin.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.980
It's a classic American problem.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:47.930
And it haunts Harris and
I'm sure that for Americans

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:52.390
of Chinese descent who have
faced similar questions,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:54.310
it's a haunting problem.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.740
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.290
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Merry: David will
be signing books at 1 o'clock.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.050
If you have not read "The
Quantum Spy," you must.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:03.350
It is on sale here.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:04.650
David, thank you so much.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.630
&gt;&gt; David Ignatius: Thank
you, Stephanie [applause].

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.930
Thanks.
