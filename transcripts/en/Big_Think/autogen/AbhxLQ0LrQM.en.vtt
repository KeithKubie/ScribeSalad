I think it's more of a problem the

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
I think it's more of a problem the
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.519
I think it's more of a problem the
United States than it is other places

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
United States than it is other places
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.100
United States than it is other places
and there's some places where science is

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
and there's some places where science is
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.390
and there's some places where science is
less of an issue and there's a place

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
less of an issue and there's a place
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.709
less of an issue and there's a place
where face is less of an issue but in

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
where face is less of an issue but in
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.660
where face is less of an issue but in
the United States it's very nicely ducks

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
the United States it's very nicely ducks
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.919
the United States it's very nicely ducks
to pose and I think it's actually a very

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
to pose and I think it's actually a very
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.070
to pose and I think it's actually a very
good dynamic I think if I were what I

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
good dynamic I think if I were what I
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.529
good dynamic I think if I were what I
would I think part of the problem is

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539
would I think part of the problem is
 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.259
would I think part of the problem is
there's a tendency to focus on the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
there's a tendency to focus on the
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.740
there's a tendency to focus on the
extremes it's it makes for good press

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
extremes it's it makes for good press
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.259
extremes it's it makes for good press
and for book sales and so forth and I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
and for book sales and so forth and I
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.310
and for book sales and so forth and I
think there's a lot more need for

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
think there's a lot more need for
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.900
think there's a lot more need for
meeting in the middle which is finding

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
meeting in the middle which is finding

ways that you can if you really don't

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
ways that you can if you really don't
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.970
ways that you can if you really don't
know something just admit you don't know

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
know something just admit you don't know
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.560
know something just admit you don't know
something if you don't know for sure

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
something if you don't know for sure
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840
something if you don't know for sure
that you can't rule out an intelligent

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
that you can't rule out an intelligent
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.350
that you can't rule out an intelligent
designer then teach it in schools what

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360
designer then teach it in schools what
 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.510
designer then teach it in schools what
if you if science is so fragile that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
if you if science is so fragile that
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.950
if you if science is so fragile that
they can't teach exactly how you would

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960
they can't teach exactly how you would
 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.720
they can't teach exactly how you would
question things and discover things and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
question things and discover things and
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.049
question things and discover things and
I think we need to work on that make it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
I think we need to work on that make it
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.880
I think we need to work on that make it
much less fragile so I think it's a it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
much less fragile so I think it's a it
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860
much less fragile so I think it's a it
could become a healthy dialogue right

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
could become a healthy dialogue right
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289
could become a healthy dialogue right
now it's not healthy because of focusing

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299
now it's not healthy because of focusing
 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.359
now it's not healthy because of focusing
on the extremes and not trying really

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
on the extremes and not trying really
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.450
on the extremes and not trying really
hard to get people engaged

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
hard to get people engaged
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.840
hard to get people engaged
I mean people should be engaged in it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
I mean people should be engaged in it
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020
I mean people should be engaged in it
more than just a gut reaction they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
more than just a gut reaction they
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149
more than just a gut reaction they
should actually want to if even if there

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
should actually want to if even if there
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.499
should actually want to if even if there
is an intelligent design agenda that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509
is an intelligent design agenda that
 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590
is an intelligent design agenda that
should be deeply informed about science

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
should be deeply informed about science
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.899
should be deeply informed about science
about technology about how you actually

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
about technology about how you actually
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.420
about technology about how you actually
answer questions I think that that a lot

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
answer questions I think that that a lot
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429
answer questions I think that that a lot
of what we have are a set of accidents

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
of what we have are a set of accidents
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.020
of what we have are a set of accidents
and there is design in the world and

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
and there is design in the world and
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.310
and there is design in the world and
there will be lots of design going

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
there will be lots of design going
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.330
there will be lots of design going
forward and it's an opportunity to to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
forward and it's an opportunity to to
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069
forward and it's an opportunity to to
embrace both the natural and the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079
embrace both the natural and the
 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.160
embrace both the natural and the
synthetic there's a lot of a lot of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
synthetic there's a lot of a lot of
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.760
synthetic there's a lot of a lot of
what's natural is painful and a lot of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
what's natural is painful and a lot of
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219
what's natural is painful and a lot of
what's synthetic is not completely

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
what's synthetic is not completely
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.920
what's synthetic is not completely
thought out but offers an alternative

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
thought out but offers an alternative
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.800
thought out but offers an alternative
and I and I my worldview is that it's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
and I and I my worldview is that it's
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.249
and I and I my worldview is that it's
that dynamic between design and past and

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
that dynamic between design and past and
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.850
that dynamic between design and past and
future and the parts of nature that we

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
future and the parts of nature that we
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.130
future and the parts of nature that we
like in the parts of nature which for

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
like in the parts of nature which for
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.479
like in the parts of nature which for
one reason or other because of say

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489
one reason or other because of say
 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.010
one reason or other because of say
population explosion is still natural

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
population explosion is still natural
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.640
population explosion is still natural
but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
but
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520
but
Barents it's pathological from our human

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
Barents it's pathological from our human
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.360
Barents it's pathological from our human
viewpoint and we need to embrace ecology

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
viewpoint and we need to embrace ecology
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.690
viewpoint and we need to embrace ecology
in a very intelligent way and this

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
in a very intelligent way and this
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.009
in a very intelligent way and this
requires that our politicians and

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019
requires that our politicians and
 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.300
requires that our politicians and
regular folks know great deal more about

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
regular folks know great deal more about
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.800
regular folks know great deal more about
ecology in their world and their in

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
ecology in their world and their in
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.599
ecology in their world and their in
their personal diversity than they

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609
their personal diversity than they
 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.509
their personal diversity than they
currently know I think that for science

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519
currently know I think that for science
 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.089
currently know I think that for science
and religious science has very definite

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099
and religious science has very definite
 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.920
and religious science has very definite
faith components and most religions

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
faith components and most religions
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.589
faith components and most religions
don't stick to faith they venture out

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599
don't stick to faith they venture out
 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.720
don't stick to faith they venture out
into making predictions about our

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
into making predictions about our
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.220
into making predictions about our
physical world they don't just say

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
physical world they don't just say
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.780
physical world they don't just say
there's something that is completely

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
there's something that is completely
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.550
there's something that is completely
unconnected to us they say actually it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560
unconnected to us they say actually it
 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410
unconnected to us they say actually it
affects our lives and when they do that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
affects our lives and when they do that
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.319
affects our lives and when they do that
they merge they they they have there's a

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329
they merge they they they have there's a
 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.970
they merge they they they have there's a
we know that our that the part of that

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
we know that our that the part of that
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.069
we know that our that the part of that
are there is a connection between our

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079
are there is a connection between our
 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.379
are there is a connection between our
feelings and our brain our brain is a

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389
feelings and our brain our brain is a
 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.929
feelings and our brain our brain is a
scientific something that we could study

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:11.939
scientific something that we could study
 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:14.089
scientific something that we could study
scientifically so I think there's they

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099
scientifically so I think there's they
 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.520
scientifically so I think there's they
can and should coexist there's a lot of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
can and should coexist there's a lot of
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.979
can and should coexist there's a lot of
faith that's expressed by scientists

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
faith that's expressed by scientists
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.770
faith that's expressed by scientists
about science it's kind of an act of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
about science it's kind of an act of
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.110
about science it's kind of an act of
faith that science is a good thing we

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120
faith that science is a good thing we
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.400
faith that science is a good thing we
don't know that for sure we won't know

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
don't know that for sure we won't know
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.259
don't know that for sure we won't know
that we may not know that millions of

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269
that we may not know that millions of
 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.920
that we may not know that millions of
years from now I mean so and by good

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930
years from now I mean so and by good
 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.259
years from now I mean so and by good
thing we can even even phrasing goodness

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
thing we can even even phrasing goodness
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.140
thing we can even even phrasing goodness
in a scientific context like survival of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
in a scientific context like survival of
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.250
in a scientific context like survival of
the species would be something that

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
the species would be something that
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920
the species would be something that
probably scientists would agree is a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930
probably scientists would agree is a
 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.610
probably scientists would agree is a
good thing

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
good thing
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.439
good thing
we won't know whether science is a good

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449
we won't know whether science is a good
 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.879
we won't know whether science is a good
thing for the survival of species rather

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889
thing for the survival of species rather
 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.670
thing for the survival of species rather
than having entirely faced base so I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680
than having entirely faced base so I
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.439
than having entirely faced base so I
think these things are there they are

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449
think these things are there they are
 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.050
think these things are there they are
solvable they are addressable we can

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060
solvable they are addressable we can
 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.390
solvable they are addressable we can
bring them together but it requires less

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400
bring them together but it requires less
 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.020
