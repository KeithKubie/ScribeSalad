when you think about what makes a
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.880
when you think about what makes a
university great it's really not a

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
university great it's really not a
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.650
university great it's really not a
homogeneous community it's a diverse

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
homogeneous community it's a diverse
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.299
homogeneous community it's a diverse
community that does care an awful lot

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
community that does care an awful lot
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.430
community that does care an awful lot
about underrepresented populations and

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
about underrepresented populations and
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.690
about underrepresented populations and
particularly in our STEM disciplines

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
particularly in our STEM disciplines
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.169
particularly in our STEM disciplines
women had been underrepresented and even

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179
women had been underrepresented and even
 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.070
women had been underrepresented and even
in the temper school we have seen

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080
in the temper school we have seen
 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.720
in the temper school we have seen
significant growth in terms of the yield

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
significant growth in terms of the yield
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.150
significant growth in terms of the yield
in women we've worked very hard at what

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
in women we've worked very hard at what
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.880
in women we've worked very hard at what
happens on campus when women come on any

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890
happens on campus when women come on any
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.370
happens on campus when women come on any
of our our programs and so one of the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380
of our our programs and so one of the
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.810
of our our programs and so one of the
first things we did which I thought was

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
first things we did which I thought was
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999
first things we did which I thought was
brilliant as we got our women students

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
brilliant as we got our women students
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.459
brilliant as we got our women students
to address our faculty in their regular

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
to address our faculty in their regular
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.889
to address our faculty in their regular
faculty meetings and talk through what

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
faculty meetings and talk through what
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.869
faculty meetings and talk through what
has made them feel inclusive and what

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
has made them feel inclusive and what
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.970
has made them feel inclusive and what
hasn't and using examples from the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
hasn't and using examples from the
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.560
hasn't and using examples from the
professor's who are in their classroom

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
professor's who are in their classroom
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720
professor's who are in their classroom
and so it was in a way really

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
and so it was in a way really
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.119
and so it was in a way really
identifying best practices and it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
identifying best practices and it
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.060
identifying best practices and it
allowed faculty to understand how men

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
allowed faculty to understand how men
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.770
allowed faculty to understand how men
and women can potentially experience a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
and women can potentially experience a
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.689
and women can potentially experience a
very different classroom it's really

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
very different classroom it's really
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580
very different classroom it's really
great to see like so many girls just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
great to see like so many girls just
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410
great to see like so many girls just
like me like getting out wanting for

like me like getting out wanting for
 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360
like me like getting out wanting for
stealing their dreams and I love how

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
stealing their dreams and I love how
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069

it's so equal this time and especially

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
it's so equal this time and especially
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.049
it's so equal this time and especially
means a lot since engineering is like

women in that field and I traditionally

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
women in that field and I traditionally
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.320
women in that field and I traditionally
underrepresented so it's really awesome

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
underrepresented so it's really awesome
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.359

their predecessors I've got to say we
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.890
their predecessors I've got to say we
know we're pretty proud of the advances

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
know we're pretty proud of the advances
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.499
know we're pretty proud of the advances
that we're making and I think that it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
that we're making and I think that it
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.810
that we're making and I think that it
makes a difference in the university

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
makes a difference in the university
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.980
makes a difference in the university
community I can't tell you how many

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990

faculty have reiterated how important it
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.700
faculty have reiterated how important it
is to have women you know represented in

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
is to have women you know represented in

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750
students come out the biggest change we
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.319

introduced this new core education which
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880
introduced this new core education which
really aims to develop students as a you

all I sat down with her for about an
 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.260
all I sat down with her for about an
hour and a half and she is a biology

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270
hour and a half and she is a biology
 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.720
hour and a half and she is a biology
major and an English major and so she is

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
major and an English major and so she is
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.210
major and an English major and so she is
completely crossing the spectrums of

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220
completely crossing the spectrums of
 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.270
completely crossing the spectrums of
disciplines I saw myself in them and I

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280
disciplines I saw myself in them and I
 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.760
disciplines I saw myself in them and I
saw how they worked and I really saw

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770
saw how they worked and I really saw
 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.740
saw how they worked and I really saw
like my process is reflected in theirs

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750
like my process is reflected in theirs
 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.050
like my process is reflected in theirs
and I also saw them doing wildly

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060
and I also saw them doing wildly
 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.540
and I also saw them doing wildly
successful things and that made me

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
successful things and that made me
 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.640
successful things and that made me
really hopeful that I could one day do

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
really hopeful that I could one day do
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.949

undergraduate admission quite frankly
 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.940
undergraduate admission quite frankly
and and I think in no better place than
