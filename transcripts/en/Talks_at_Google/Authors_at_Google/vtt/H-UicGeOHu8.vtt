MARY GROVE: Hello, good
afternoon, how is everybody?

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.860
Excited?

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:10.940
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940
My name is Mary Grove,
and I'm the director

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.020
of Google for Entrepreneurs,
and it is my tremendous honor

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.920
to welcome Diane Von
Furstenberg back to Google.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.450
Our guest today is
a remarkable talent

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.330
who needs no
introduction, but I would

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.119
like to share three
things that I particularly

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.170
admire about Diane.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.840
The first is that she is
the ultimate entrepreneur,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.190
an incredible self starter
whose story really embodies

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.560
the quintessential
American dream.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.960
From Diane's arrival in
New York City in 1970

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.680
with just one suitcase
full of dresses,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.020
DVF products are now sold in
55 countries around the world,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.160
and has evolved far beyond the
iconic wrap dress which we're

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.920
celebrating the 40th
anniversary of this year.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.970
Number two, is Diane's
steadfast commitment

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.730
to empowering women
all over the world.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.670
In 2011 she established, through
the Diller Von Furstenberg

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.630
Family Foundation,
the DVF awards.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.920
And these awards recognize women
who show tremendous courage

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.130
and bravery in the
face of adversity.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.320
I admire everything she
does to support women.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.600
And thirdly, I admire her
generosity and openness

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.320
and sharing so
personally her own story,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.850
her own amazing family history,
her journey in establishing

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
and building a global brand
that is loved around the world,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.500
her personal battle with cancer
which she fought courageously

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.162
and successfully, and her
views on love and life.

00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:44.245
Please join me in welcoming
Diane Von Furstenberg.

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:48.982
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Hi.

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.190
MARY GROVE: Welcome, it's
wonderful to have you back.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.565
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Thank you.

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:57.200
When I came here
to speak in 2005,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.060
I think, they were
practically no women here.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.900
and I'm not sure the
others knew who I was.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.139
And that's definitely changed.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:15.560
And but it was pretty
amazing already,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.960
but it was nothing
compared to what it is now.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.249
So it's fun to be here.

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:20.290
MARY GROVE: Welcome back.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.360
Before we get started, I want
to cue just a quick video, which

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.374
is the journey of
the wrap dress.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:27.350
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:39.206
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:06.870
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.380
So Diane, I wanted
to get started

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.504
by talking about your roots,
and you shared so much

00:03:10.504 --> 00:03:12.890
of your personal journey--
you open your book by talking

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.675
about your mother's courageous
story as a Holocaust survivor,

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:18.710
how she gave birth to
you against all odds.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.780
And she said to you, you
are my torch of freedom,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.110
and taught you that
fear is not an option.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.640
Can you share with us a memory
of how your mother helped

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.440
you become the woman
you wanted to be.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.590
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Well, first of all,

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.710
I think my mother was, what
they call today, a tiger mom.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.000
Which is that, if I
was afraid of the dark

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.130
she would lock me into the
closet, which today you

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.400
could probably be arrested for.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.600
But of course, after 10
minutes, it wasn't dark anymore,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.700
because when you're in the dark
for 10 minutes you can see.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.850
And also you realize that
there's no reason to be afraid.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.400
So my mother didn't
want me to be afraid.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.660
And one of the reasons why she
didn't want me to be afraid

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.410
is because of her own history.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.000
At the age of 22, she
was a prisoner of war

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.820
and she went to the
Nazi concentration

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.130
camp of Auschwitz and
Ravensbruck and a third one.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.150
She came back, she
weighed 49 pounds,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.010
I mean, less than her bones.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.260
She wasn't supposed to
have survived but she did.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.540
She went back home and
her mother fed her.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.060
Six months later her fiancee
came back to Belgium--

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.850
he had been in Switzerland--
and they got married,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.490
and the doctor said you
absolutely cannot have a child.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.720
Because if you have
a child-- your body

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.680
can't handle it, and
besides the child

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.640
will probably be not normal.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.450
Well, sure enough, I was
born nine months later,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:06.435
and I was not normal.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.390
And you know when--
well, you are all young

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.340
so you know that when
your mother is very strong

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.980
you protect yourself
from all that strength.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.420
But then when your
mother passes away,

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.250
you think a little bit more of
the impact that she had on me.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.740
And so I wanted
to tell her story.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.440
And by telling-- by doing
research and telling her story,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.110
I realize that I
am her vengeance.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.430
And I am the way I am because of
that, because of what she was.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.290
So I ended up writing
about my mother

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.580
and then ended up
writing about me.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.190
And so this book, this memoir
has been really difficult.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.190
I've never gone to a therapy
before, and I did that.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.080
But I really opened myself,
and I tell it really

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.370
as it is because I think that
truth and honesty is certainly

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.140
the most useful thing you
could do for yourself,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.790
but it's also good to do
it, to have others do it.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.930
So I am glad that people are
responding well to the book,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.930
because otherwise I
would feel terrible.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.290
I would feel horrible that
I open myself for nothing.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.920
So I hope you enjoy.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.420
MARY GROVE: Thank you for
doing that, absolutely.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.390
So in the business of
fashion the wrap dress

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.270
which launched in 1974, by
1978 had sold millions already

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.850
throughout the nation and it was
revolutionary in its softness,

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.420
its versatility.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.630
What do you think the wrap
dress symbolized then,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.830
and what does it symbolize
now, 40 years later.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.246
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Well,
the first thing it symbolized

00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:04.420
is that I could pay my bills.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.170
Which was, at the
end, my first goal

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.760
was to be independent because
my mother put it in my head,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.470
and I really wanted
to be independent.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.450
So I became independent
through that dress.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.870
But because it was fashion,
what now I realize-- of course I

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.010
didn't realize it then,
but now looking back-- I

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:35.370
realize that as I was becoming
independent and confident

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.010
and the woman I wanted
to be, I was sharing it

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.920
to other women in fitting rooms.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.450
So I was getting confident
and I was selling confidence

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.550
through the dress.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.850
So that dress, to me,
I just made that dress.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.170
It's not like I thought
it was something

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.580
that will live for that long.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.640
But I guess that in
the sense that it

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.850
was my need, my own
personal need for freedom.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.920
The dress was good quality, it
was effortless, it was sexy,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.340
it was not too expensive,
but it just molded you.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.020
It was proper enough
and sexy enough.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:27.890
Somehow I guess that message
that was done through a dress

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.679
really took on, and women
really reacted to it.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:36.150
And everyone in America
wore that dress.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:41.559
I mean, I was 25 and
within no time at all

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.140
we were making 25,000
dresses a week,

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.610
which is 50,000
sleeves, that's a lot.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:54.340
I remember I used to say that
because it looked like more.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.070
So I lived an
American dream, which

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.700
of course, my American dream is
nothing compared to a Google.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.570
I mean, it was very minute.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.160
But it was, nevertheless,
an American dream

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.325
and I was a young woman.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.640
MARY GROVE: So speaking of
Google, and welcome back

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.710
to Silicon Valley, you've
always been so transformative

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.330
and disrupting the fashion
industry if you look back

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.060
across the last four decades.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.650
You started selling your dresses
on QVC and the Home Shopping

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.540
Network before merchandise
clothing was really

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.340
sold on television.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.470
Last year you worked with Sergey
to debut Google glass in a DVF

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:37.427
fashion show, as well as launch
the first shoppable Hangout

00:09:37.427 --> 00:09:40.010
where consumers could purchase
products live through a Google+

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.210
Hangout.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.621
So looking now,
what technologies

00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:45.370
are you most excited
about or do you think

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.710
are most critical to the
success of your business?

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.090
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Well
first of all, I joke always

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:56.060
and I say that I'm so
happy that I am old enough

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.360
to have danced at Studio
54, and young enough

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.764
to be part of the
digital revolution.

00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:03.430
MARY GROVE: I saw you
Instagram outside.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.596
Before we came in.

00:10:04.596 --> 00:10:07.300
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: I do.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.990
And so I love technology.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.080
And I think it's so
incredible what has happened,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.350
and all the grounds
that we've broken,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.820
and all the things that you
can do that there was no way

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.310
that we could dream
that we could do.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.800
So I am very, very
into it and I love it.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.000
And again, it was an accident
that I presented the Google

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.800
Glass first in the world.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.040
I mean, it was-- but
it just shows you

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.710
that when you are
young-- or not young--

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.610
it's important to push the
doors whatever is happening.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.570
And it's just
because I saw Sergey

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.600
hiding behind a tree
trying these things.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.640
And I said, what are you doing?

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.960
And he said, come, I show you.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.430
And they hadn't shown anyone.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.710
This was in Sand
Valley and he showed

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.370
me that and we started to talk.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.000
And it was July and I
said, Sergey have you ever

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.110
been to a fashion show?

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:08.390
He said, no never.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:12.490
I said, you should come
to my show in September.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:13.300
That was it.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.920
And then two or three weeks
later, I get a call from Sergey

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:20.500
and he said, you know,
I was thinking how

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.710
about showing Google
Glass on the runway.

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.890
And I thought, oh.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.030
I didn't even understand
what he was talking about.

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.620
I said sure.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.330
And what it was,
it must have been

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.650
that day with talking
marketing, and saying, how can

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.640
we show it to the world in the
way that is not just dry tech.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.991
And somebody said
the word fashion,

00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:43.990
and he said, oh fashion.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.320
I have a friend in fashion.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.100
She invited me to
a fashion show.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.510
And that is actually how
the whole thing happened.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.270
And when you read the
book, it's at the very end

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.160
of the whole story it's at
the very end of the book.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.090
You'll see that that day I
wasn't particularly loving

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.640
my show, and so anyway,
Google Glass kind of saved

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:11.040
my show because-- anyway,
so it's a long story,

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.740
but it just shows
you that you always

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.189
have to be very wide open and
curious and open to anything.

00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:22.480
MARY GROVE: So on that note,
in following your journey,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.300
I notice that you have a unique
for recognizing an opportunity

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.820
and then seizing the moment.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.750
So one example would
be in your book

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.130
you talk to how you
had trained in Italy,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.650
and you noticed this trend in
Europe where t-shirts, fashion

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.240
t-shirts were just becoming
fashionable in the Jersey

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.070
material, the soft material.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.840
And so you brought
that to America

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.240
and then evolved it
to the wrap dress.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.190
Another example would be
relaunching your business

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.600
when you noticed that
the hip young girls were

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.710
wearing vintage DVF
dresses from the 70s

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.840
and relaunching the wrap dress.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.980
I'm curious if you see any
big new opportunities today,

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.770
if you think fashion startups
can really do anything

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.834
to seize a gap.

00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:03.250
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Oh, my god.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.870
You don't need any-- you don't
need me to tell you that.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.010
I mean, there's so many
intelligent people here

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.130
were looking for opportunities
and pushing the ground.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.630
I mean, if anything, I'm
here to learn from you.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:21.330
But it is, I think it
is important to dare

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:27.680
and push and look and be
curious and also when you fail,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.390
you fail.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.810
Then you get back
up and do it again.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.370
It's-- life is a journey.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.320
It's a big journey.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.130
And people come in, people
go out, you have successes,

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.350
you have failures, and as long
as you're true to yourself,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.851
it's OK.

00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:46.766
MARY GROVE: So I want
to talk about the brand,

00:13:46.766 --> 00:13:49.000
the global brand that
has become a phenomenon.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.900
And you arrived in New York
and launched with the dress,

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.710
but ended up
transforming and growing

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.700
the line into cosmetics, into
fragrances, a home line, and so

00:13:58.700 --> 00:13:59.231
much more.

00:13:59.231 --> 00:14:01.230
Can you talk about the
lessons you learned along

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.940
the way about developing
DVF as a brand?

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.660
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Oh, my
god, I learned so many lessons.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.660
But I am not necessarily a
good example of business.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.070
I am an entrepreneur.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.510
I am a dreamer.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.460
And I'm a person who can
make-- who can have an idea

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.080
and make it happen.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.610
I'm not the best executive.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:25.100
I'm not a CEO.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.120
So the lesson that
I would say is

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:36.290
that it's important to recognize
your strengths and weaknesses.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:41.870
But I mean in the book--
this book is like therapy.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.240
I never went to therapy before,
and this book was therapy.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:51.042
But it shows that it doesn't
matter how old you are.

00:14:51.042 --> 00:14:52.125
I mean, I'm a grandmother.

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:56.520
I'm old, I have-- I came up with
something that's already 40,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.890
that you think that's so old.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:03.800
And yet I still think of
myself like I'm a young girl

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.090
and I'm starting up.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:09.540
And I guess I'll
always be like that.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:16.540
But I think in a sense that's
also my energy and who I am.

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.880
That's why I start
again and again.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.090
MARY GROVE: Love is life
is love, I heard you say.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.640
So in the book you talk
about how you often

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.150
speak with young people and
a favorite piece of advice

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.670
you give them is it's passion
and persistence that matter,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.170
and dreams are
achievable, but there

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.420
are no shortcuts,
and no hard work.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.930
What is the best-- I want to
flip that question and ask you.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.040
What is the best
piece of career advice

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.060
you received along the
way, and how did that

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.850
impact your journey?

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.350
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
I don't know.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.050
I mean, The only real advice
that I got from my mother

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:53.080
which I remember the most
is never be a victim,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.590
and never blame
anyone for anything

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.640
even if they are blameable.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.080
Just deal with it.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.640
And that was great advice
because resentment is toxic

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.770
and blaming people
doesn't help anything.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.380
I mean, the independence--
what my mother gave

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.480
me was the independence and
that is really something

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.080
that I value so much.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.080
Now what I found out by myself,
and really, really early on,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.990
and I am astounded that
I realized that early on,

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.350
and that would be
my advice to anyone,

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.420
is that the most important
relationship in life

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.850
is the one you
have with yourself.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.820
I don't think I can give
bigger advice, advice

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.360
that applies to everyone,
men, women, old, young,

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.980
it doesn't matter.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.280
Because at the end, the
strength is in yourself

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:57.840
and it's not in somebody
else, and it's not

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.760
any guy that's going
to make-- It's not.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.850
It's you.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.550
Then if you have
that relationship

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.109
with yourself figured
out, and it's not like it

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.430
you figure it out and
it's good forever.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.359
It's practice.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.240
It's every day.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.819
You have to be
angry with yourself,

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.819
and then you have to
be nice to yourself,

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.940
and a lot of different things.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.819
It's practice.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.060
It's like pruning a tree,
or cleaning the plumbing.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.680
But once you do have
that, and once you really

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.920
have a relationship
with yourself,

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:33.610
then any other relationship
is a plus and not a must,

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.950
and so you're not needy.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.050
And I think that it's important.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:41.010
So that's my advice.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:42.205
Remember.

00:17:42.205 --> 00:17:44.580
MARY GROVE: Most important
relationship is with yourself.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.245
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
That's right.

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:46.390
MARY GROVE: So
shifting gears a bit,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.310
I want to talk about
the future and what

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.770
you're focused on
in the road ahead.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.660
Can you tell us a little
bit about your new TV show?

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.100
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Oh.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.420
Yeah, so this year
was very, very busy.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.500
In January I celebrated
the 40th anniversary

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.120
of the wrap dress in a
big exhibition at LACMA

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:09.000
in the Los Angeles, which is
now featured in this big coffee

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.050
table book, Rizzoli,
"The Journey of a Dress".

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.720
Then I finished my memoir, which
was very painful and very, very

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.750
tiring.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:25.430
And then I also did something a
little crazy, I did a TV show.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:31.140
And it's called the House
of DVF and in a sense

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.360
it's both to be in
touch with young people

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.000
and also because I see what
garbage that my granddaughters

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.720
watch on television.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.910
And so how can I go to that
genre and apply to that,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.350
and make it fun, and make
it naughty, and make it

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.840
informative, but
at the same time

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:58.860
manage to pass some strong,
empowering messages.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:01.360
So we came up with
this idea of six

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.830
to eight girls who
come into the company

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.660
and they learn everything from
merchandising to retailing

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:13.180
to marketing and design,
and then one of them

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.570
will win and become
a brand ambassador.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.560
So we already have
three episodes

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.410
which you could
probably see online.

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.440
It's on E. And Sunday
night at 10 o'clock

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.420
you can watch episode four.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.840
And it's eight
episodes and it will

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.590
end on December 20th I think.

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.810
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.810
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
And one of the candidates

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.695
is from the Bay Area, but I'm
not going to tell you who wins.

00:19:47.014 --> 00:19:48.680
MARY GROVE: So in
terms of looking ahead

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.130
from a business perspective,
in your book you talk

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.340
about DVF products are
sold in over 55 countries,

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:58.610
one of the more recent
countries you entered was China.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.270
Can you talk about your entry
into the Chinese market,

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.860
how you--

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:06.120
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: OK,
first, first of all I love

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:06.830
China.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.100
I mean I grew up reading
books about China,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.790
Pearl Buck, or Tenten.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:19.010
I was always fascinated by
the mystery and the strength

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.720
in the Wall of
China, everything.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.870
So the first time I went
to China was 1989 or 1990,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:34.350
and there were only bicycles
in Beijing at the time.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:40.500
So I wanted to be known-- I
woke up about maybe by now

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:42.680
it's maybe four years
ago, and I said,

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.430
I want to be known in China.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.200
And so I went to China a lot.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.150
And I became very friendly
with a lot of people, artists

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.270
and writers, and bloggers.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:00.960
And I spent a lot of time
because I wanted to--

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.640
because when I was a young
girl, even though it's funny

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.530
because even though I
didn't think I was going

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.530
to be in fashion, I
remember that I used to say,

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:15.240
if you sell one t-shirt to
every Chinese, you make--

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.620
And so I already
had that in my mind.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.630
So I really wanted
to come to China

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.470
and not sound like an
American colonizer.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:29.350
And so I spent time
knowing the people

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.190
and becoming friends with them.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:35.260
And little by little I got
known in China and I have--

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.310
MARY GROVE: How many stores now?

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.935
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Oh I don't know.

00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:42.260
I have-- I have about
40 stores I think.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.015
Quite a lot in China.

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:48.250
And I have how many?

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.200
One million or two
million followers?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:50.875
I mean a lot.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.390
So I like Chinese people.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:06.870
I think they are smart
and they they're great.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.880
I totally identify and I
wish I spoke the language,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.610
but then again, I'm
not Mark Zuckerberg.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.300
MARY GROVE: So In
terms of community,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:19.660
you've been incredibly
involved through philanthropy,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.020
through your own
family foundation.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.750
More recently supported
efforts like the High Line

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.540
in the West Side of Manhattan
near the Google office

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.910
and a new park and art
space that's called Pier 55.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.510
What is your hope
for where New York

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.125
City might be in 5 to 10 years?

00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:35.750
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Well, let's hope

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.320
that it stays out of
the water for one thing.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.650
And you know, I always
saw New York like Venice.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:44.870
For me it's like Venice.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.340
It's the center of
both commerce and art.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.560
Every artist in the world
wants to show in New York

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.860
and be sold in New York.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:00.980
So for me Venice and New
York were very similar.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.910
So that's why I'm very
involved into the waterways.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.690
And I think that
we had a tendency

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.510
of going inland and building
highways along the coast.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.110
So now we're trying
to the change that.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.870
When I first came to New
York it was very, very cheap.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.620
But it was also
very, very dangerous.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.750
Probably goes together.

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:28.640
But at the same
time, they were a lot

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.310
of-- because it was very cheap,
there were a lot of artists

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.950
there and it was fun.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.990
It was really, really fun.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.070
Now it's different.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.810
It's much more expensive,
and it is different.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:43.040
But it still has
a lot of energy.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.530
And I think that one of the
reasons that New York has

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:50.190
so much energy is because
it's built on granite.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:53.560
So the minute you get to New
York, you have a lot of energy.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.880
And I'm sure Google is
built on granite too.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.450
Whereas Paris is
built on sand, so you

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.350
have a tendency to
kind of fall asleep.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.070
MARY GROVE: Do you spend
much time back in Europe now?

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.829
Or are you between
Europe and here?

00:24:08.829 --> 00:24:10.370
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
I am European,

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.740
so I have a place in Paris.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.630
And so it's important for
me to be-- it's nice for me

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.820
to go to Europe.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:21.600
But my children and
my grandchildren

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.279
now live on the West Coast, so
I have a tendency to go west.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:29.320
MARY GROVE: Are there any
up and coming designers

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.966
you think we should
be on the lookout for?

00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:33.340
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Well, I am

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:36.650
the president of the Council
of Fashion Designers of America

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.200
so I am basically the
mother of all designers so

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:46.716
as the mother of all designers,
I can't have a favorite child.

00:24:46.716 --> 00:24:49.060
MARY GROVE: You
hear it here first.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.510
So on that note, I am curious.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.660
We talked a lot about how
your story personifies

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:56.610
the American dream,
you're an entrepreneur

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.460
with this tremendous
global perspective,

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.940
and the way that businesses
are born and grow

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.364
has changed tremendously
in the last 40 years.

00:25:05.364 --> 00:25:07.280
Even in fashion, you've
seen the consolidation

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.730
of the large department
stores, for example.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.980
Do you think that it would
be easier or more difficult

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.950
now to build a global
business and brand?

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:19.320
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: I don't
think it's harder, actually.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.740
I think maybe it's easier.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.630
Because you have the internet,
so everyone has a voice.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.250
If you have the internet, you
just do a website at the start.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.410
So then you have a voice.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:34.170
So I think that the
internet has given everyone

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.475
more democrat-- democracy?

00:25:36.475 --> 00:25:38.960
Democracy.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.990
Even though sometimes
it's a little dangerous.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:48.670
So I think that overall, and
the world is more global,

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.370
and also you have more
mentoring systems.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:55.960
And as the CFDA, we have an
incredible program with Vogue.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.190
It's called the CFDA
Vogue Fashion fund.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.390
And we mentor young
designers and help them

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.090
and that has really
helped enormously.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.260
So I think that people
are more into mentoring.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.645
But of course,
everything goes fast.

00:26:16.645 --> 00:26:18.020
MARY GROVE: In a
few moments, I'm

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.010
going to switch gears and take
questions from the audience.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.426
So if you have a
question in mind,

00:26:21.426 --> 00:26:24.480
please feel free to
go ahead and line up.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.790
So Diane, I want to
talk about your legacy.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.540
And you've talked about
the various phases

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:30.380
of your life, how
it was independence,

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.760
getting independence, how it
was growing your business,

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.860
now it's sort of what
legacy do you leave behind.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.840
You said that when
you and Joel Horowitz

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.270
were working on transforming
the company in 2012,

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.750
you did an exercise
where everybody defined

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:47.320
three words that
exemplified the brand.

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.972
Those were effortless,
sexy, and on the go.

00:26:50.972 --> 00:26:52.430
So if you could
use three words now

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.580
to describe the legacy you
hoped DVF will leave behind,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.370
what might they be?

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.880
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Well, I think

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.080
that my mission in life
overall, business or not,

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.070
is really to empower women.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:11.180
Since I empowered myself
first, and after I've

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.460
empowered myself,
it's important that I

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.270
feel that everyone can be
the woman they want to be.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.560
And so I do that
through my work,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.820
by making them feel sexy and
attractive with the clothes,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.590
but also through mentoring
and philanthropy.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:32.940
So maybe I hope to be
remembered as a woman who

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.670
did it for herself
and for others.

00:27:36.967 --> 00:27:39.300
MARY GROVE: Let's take some
questions from the audience.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.717
If you could introduce yourself
to start, that'd be great.

00:27:41.717 --> 00:27:42.549
AUDIENCE: Hi, Diane.

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:44.620
My name's Connor I might
be behind the camera--

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:47.350
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
The only man here?

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.350
MARY GROVE: My husband
is also here in the back.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.800
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
All right.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:52.990
Who's is your husband?

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.990
MARY GROVE: Steve Grove.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.073
AUDIENCE: The bearded one.

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:57.870
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Hi.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.370
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you so
much for coming out and talking

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:00.870
to us.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.690
It's been wonderful
to hear from you.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.550
My question is on
your advice that you

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.420
give about having your
relationship with yourself

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.960
is so important
and that you we're

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.070
astounded you found
that out so early.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.190
How did you find that
out, and what do people

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.730
do on a day to day basis to
help build that relationship?

00:28:18.641 --> 00:28:20.390
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
How did I find out?

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:21.600
I don't know.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.280
I was fascinated by mirrors when
I was a tiny, tiny little girl.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.730
None that I liked what I
saw in the mirror, because I

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:32.810
didn't, but I liked that I
had control over that thing.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:34.660
You if I did that,
she would do that.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.290
You did that, they'd do that.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.440
So I think that it
starts from there.

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.280
My relationship, it started
with the mirror, I have to say.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.850
But it's wasn't
narcissism, because I

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:48.210
didn't like what I
look like at all.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.980
But I like that I had control.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.019
And so it made me realize that
I have control over myself.

00:28:54.019 --> 00:28:55.060
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.684
I've always tried to explain my
love of mirrors to other people

00:28:57.684 --> 00:28:59.306
too.

00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:01.311
So I can just point
them right to that clip.

00:29:01.311 --> 00:29:01.935
That's perfect.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.206
Thank you.

00:29:05.206 --> 00:29:07.205
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
That's very brave of you.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.590
Be brave, that's right.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.640
AUDIENCE: I have a question
from when you first

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.400
emerged in the fashion scene.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.370
What has been the
biggest surprise to you

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.706
in terms of what you've
seen in the fashion world?

00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:22.830
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: What
is the biggest surprise

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.439
that I've seen in
the fashion world.

00:29:24.439 --> 00:29:24.980
I don't know.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.160
Oh my god, I don't know.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.800
I guess that there are
not that many things that

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.570
actually surprise me.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.250
AUDIENCE: It can be
a specific trend.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:35.620
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: What?

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.500
AUDIENCE: It can be
a specific trend.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.460
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Oh, the big trend.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.540
I don't know.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.090
But the big trends, they don't
appear like all of a sudden

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.640
it's a big trend.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.200
It kind of crawls on you.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.500
And if you are a designer
which at the end is what I am,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.350
you kind of smell
it before it comes.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.350
And that can't be explained.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.150
That's really just the
mystery of fashion.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.510
AUDIENCE: So you can't be
surprised, you know everything?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.970
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: No, I
don't know everything at all.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.500
And the you know, the more
you know you know nothing.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.640
No, no, no.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:13.960
But I think it's-- maybe what
I would say what surprised me

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.260
the most is that fashion at
the end is a huge industry,

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.500
huge industry.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.490
But it's also a very mysterious,
very mysterious thing.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.510
That expands not just
on clothes, but food,

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:28.580
and the way people do things.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.234
A little bit of a
collective madness.

00:30:35.057 --> 00:30:35.890
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:38.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, Diane,
my name is Maida Felix.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.540
You've talked about success,
and how you sometimes failed

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.220
and sometimes succeeded.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.032
So I was wondering if you can
recall a time where you failed?

00:30:47.032 --> 00:30:48.990
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Oh, I failed many times.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:50.200
You've got to read the book.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:50.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:52.309
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.100
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
I failed many times,

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.630
but what I will say
to you is that I never

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.650
dwelled on my failures.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.980
I just said, OK move on.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.760
This is the reality,
whatever, cut your losses,

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.890
and then move on.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.720
And then as you move
on, things happen good.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.090
And then you don't even
realize that it all

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:15.530
started with a failure.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.270
So that also was a
lesson from my mother.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.320
She said not to dwell
on the darkness.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.720
Always look for the
little bit of light,

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.990
and build around the light.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:28.590
AUDIENCE: And do
you think-- where

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:30.000
do you find that strength?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.460
Because I feel as young
people, sometimes it's

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.890
easy to get comfortable
if you have a job.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:42.282
How can we find that strength
to jump and not be afraid?

00:31:42.282 --> 00:31:43.740
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
The truth is

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.710
that it's not the strength
that you need in order to jump.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:50.770
You got to want it.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:58.050
And wanting it most often
starts from frustration.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:07.150
I don't know-- I don't think
I know any successful person

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:11.597
whose success didn't start
first with a huge frustration.

00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:12.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.726
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
That is the truth.

00:32:14.726 --> 00:32:17.040
AUDIENCE: Diane,
my name's Emily.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.790
I have a question for you.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.420
So at Google--

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.330
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
You have a pretty dress.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.350
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.240
It's designed by you.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.570
So we don't have a lot
of women at Google,

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.280
but I imagine in the
professional world,

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.080
it's full of women
and there's lots

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:34.710
of cattiness and mean people.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:39.129
How do you handle
really catty people?

00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:39.920
Like, in your show?

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.878
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
We aren't catty, are we?

00:32:43.672 --> 00:32:49.710
No, it's-- how do
you, I don't know--

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.940
I wouldn't waste
any time on that.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.860
I really wouldn't.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:59.752
At the end, you know it's just
what matters is what matters.

00:32:59.752 --> 00:33:01.210
AUDIENCE: I really
enjoy your show.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.390
And I love the message you give.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:03.820
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Oh
you mean about the show.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:04.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:06.866
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Well,
that, you have to understand,

00:33:06.866 --> 00:33:09.660
that the producers
pushed them to.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.550
That's the show.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.420
The show they kind of say,
oh come on, are you upset,

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.020
they-- and I get
so mad when they

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.810
do that because I don't
want that to be there.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:21.810
So it's to create
a little drama.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.710
And I remember my
granddaughter telling me,

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.460
Didi, you need drama,
you need drama.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:32.510
MARY GROVE: But you have
zero tolerance for--

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.220
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: No,
I don't no, I don't like it.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.800
AUDIENCE: Hello,
my name is Firese.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.760
I was wondering in
your career, how much

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.710
were you driven by
the business side

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.030
and how much were you
driven by the artistic side?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.540
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: My first
drive was to be independent.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.620
So it was really to be
successful financially,

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:54.705
to buy my finance independence.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.810
And so I didn't even
realize at the time

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:04.260
how much the creative
side mattered.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.580
I mean, I just used
the creative side

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.625
in order to achieve
the next thing.

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:17.750
I would like to be able to spend
more time now on the creative

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.689
because I realize that
I'm much better at that.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.780
But unfortunately,
you need both.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.659
But I personally
prefer the creative.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.429
The creative is not
just designing a dress.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.840
It's thinking how
you could sell it,

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.630
it's also marketing, it's a
lot of that, and that I love.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:44.494
Thank you.

00:34:44.494 --> 00:34:47.446
AUDIENCE: Hi, Diane, I'm Lily.

00:34:47.446 --> 00:34:48.820
So in the last
few years, there's

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.400
been so much of a focus
on, can women have it all,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.860
the feminine and entrepreneurs
and family life and business

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.257
life, and you make it seem easy.

00:34:56.257 --> 00:34:57.590
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: It's not.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.423
AUDIENCE: And I'm just
wondering what advice

00:34:59.423 --> 00:35:01.510
you have for people trying
to strike that balance

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:02.329
and go forward.

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:03.870
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
It's not easy.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.710
I mean it's not easy
to-- people always

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.600
say how did you have a career
and children and a husband,

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.050
and most probably the
husband is the hardest.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.410
And it's so unfair that I
say that, because in my case,

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:20.760
it's not true.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.160
I have a husband who
is absolutely not hard.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:28.840
But to combine it all
is very, very difficult.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.490
But the truth is I think
that women are equipped--

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:37.280
I think women, we multitask
before there was such a word.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:40.070
Because we are used
to handling it all and

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.930
do it all and everything.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:47.530
Since we're mostly
women, I always say,

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.150
we have our period every month,
and nobody knows about it,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:52.340
right?

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.980
Men couldn't handle that.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.720
So I think that we're
just used to-- it's hard.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.950
It's hard to do it all,
it's hard to have it all.

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:04.860
But it's worth it.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.700
Because I think a woman
should have children,

00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:10.180
whether she has them or
adopts them or whatever,

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.830
and I also think
the woman should

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:13.690
have an identity
outside the home.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.620
So there you go.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.120
Good luck.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:21.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, Diane.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.940
My name is Emily and thank
you again for taking time

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.380
to come here and to meet
all of the lovely ladies

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.230
and gentleman here at Google.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.560
I want to share with
you a little bit

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.740
about myself,
because they do want

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.150
to ask you for your advice.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:45.039
I grew up being very
involved in art and design,

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.580
and I thought that
that was something

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.990
that I really
wanted to get into.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.820
When I graduated
college, we were just

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.610
recovering from the
economic recession

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:57.940
so at that point in
time my peers and I,

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.310
we were just happy to get a job.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:01.860
We weren't thinking
about our passion,

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:04.800
we just wanted to make
sure we weren't unemployed.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.380
So I got into tech, and I
found my way here at Google.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.410
And when Google comes
calling, you don't say,

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.500
oh well, I don't know, I
don't want to be in tech,

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.540
you just say hey where is the
dotted line, I'm going to sign.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.670
But now I definitely want
to ask for your advice

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:25.470
and see if I still have a
passion for art and fashion,

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.350
what should I do?

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.700
Should this be
something I can pursue?

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.990
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: I
think that first of all you

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.950
have to make sure
that you have to have

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.520
an idea that make sense.

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.690
And maybe you can combine your
passion for art with tech.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:45.870
And that's really how it goes.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.380
You have to do
something that you like.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.920
Clearly.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.040
But I don't know, maybe
you're just a painter,

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.880
and you'd like to paint, and
you could also be a tech.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:05.110
I think that you have to listen
to heart but also to your brain

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:09.190
and make sure that whatever
you do makes sense.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.510
AUDIENCE: Hi, so I'm a little
bit older most of the crowd

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.010
here.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.710
So when I'm listening to you
talk about all the failures

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.752
you've had in your
life, and for me,

00:38:19.752 --> 00:38:21.710
especially since I'm kind
of stuck in the start

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:24.370
over phase, through
no doing of my own.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.940
How do you go about the start
over after the failures?

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.820
Do you have a ritual?

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.611
Because I mean, it's
going to happen a lot.

00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:31.620
That's part of being alive.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.600
So what's your process for
dealing with it after you

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:38.200
figured out you failed and you
need to go onto the next step?

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.460
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Don't dwell on the negative.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.610
Just don't dwell on the
negative and learn from it.

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.690
And just be excited
about starting again.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.350
I mean just starting,
there's nothing more fun

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:54.010
than starting because
so much is unknown.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:58.650
And the unknown is exciting,
it shouldn't be scary.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:01.740
I think it's exciting,
and you just go for it.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:06.630
I mean, this is a company
where if you don't believe in

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.665
miracles here,
then I don't know.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:12.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:13.780
MARY GROVE: One follow
up question, Diane,

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.446
related to that.

00:39:14.446 --> 00:39:17.590
In your book you talk about
you had this incredible success

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:19.620
starting so early
in your twenties,

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.080
and then you took a brief
hiatus and then decided

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.330
to relaunch and come back.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:25.740
So what was the
thought process where

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.410
you decided to start again?

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.300
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Well, I thought

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.480
I was finished with fashion
and then I came back,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.910
and I realized my
brand had disappeared.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.880
With that, also a side
of my identity and I

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.480
didn't like that.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.940
I mean, I've had
failures, but I mean,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.250
when I hear it like
that, it's like overall,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.250
my life has been
pretty successful.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.885
So what I tried to
explain in the book

00:39:52.885 --> 00:39:55.210
is that not
everything goes right.

00:39:55.210 --> 00:40:00.560
And you just make it work.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.530
But there were a lot of moments
that-- I mean, nobody outside I

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:08.060
was interviewed
recently in London

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.020
by a journalist, a fashion
journalist, who has known me

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.920
all along all
through these things,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.090
and he had no idea that I was
going through a difficult time.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.114
Because you don't say it.

00:40:19.114 --> 00:40:20.530
And he read the
book, and he said,

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.200
oh my god I had no
idea, this and that.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.890
So what I tried
to do in the book

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:28.460
is that it's like an
x-ray of how I felt.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:36.410
And how I felt is how I felt,
so outside nobody knew that.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.670
MARY GROVE: We're glad
you launched again.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.250
Last question.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:47.210
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Erin.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.550
I just had a quick question.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.370
There's a lot of interesting
stuff going on in fashion tech,

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.440
particularly around
democratizing luxury brands.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.156
I think you yourself are on
websites like Rent the Runway,

00:40:57.156 --> 00:40:58.530
I don't know if
that's by choice.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.510
I'm just curious to
see as a designer

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.717
if you think that those sorts of
mechanisms devalue your brand,

00:41:03.717 --> 00:41:05.800
or you're happy that more
people are wearing them?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.780
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
I met those girls.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:10.360
I think I was the first
person that they came to see

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.060
and they were smart.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.080
I almost hired them.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:22.340
And again, I said about them--
I don't know if anyone knows,

00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.120
but it's about renting
clothes-- and I

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.740
think that they're great
girls, but I'm not sure

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.730
that five years from now
that what they're doing now

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:33.300
is exactly what they
will be doing then.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.710
At this point they have the
largest dry cleaning business

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.080
in the country.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.290
So it's-- but it
was their way in.

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.670
And so we'll see
where it all goes,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.250
I think we all welcome that.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:52.420
I think we all welcome
that, I think it's all good.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.710
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.319
MARY GROVE: Thank you.

00:41:55.319 --> 00:41:57.110
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Even fighting fakes,

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:01.736
you know that's
part of the journey.

00:42:01.736 --> 00:42:03.110
MARY GROVE: So
before we wrap up,

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.610
I'd like to close
with something that I

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.170
like to call free
word association.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.070
Where I say one
word, and I'm going

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.190
to ask you to say the first
word that comes to mind.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.690
Starting with fashion.

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:23.410
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Fashion,
fashion I would say beauty.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.180
Beauty,

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.460
MARY GROVE: Travel.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.380
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Travel I would say adventure.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.710
MARY GROVE: Belgium.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.835
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Belgium, I would say boring.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.380
MARY GROVE: Confidence.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.754
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Confidence

00:42:39.754 --> 00:42:50.170
I would say confidence
is indispensable.

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:51.480
MARY GROVE: Google

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:55.060
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Google is Google

00:42:55.060 --> 00:43:00.310
is what it sounds
like it Googles.

00:43:03.137 --> 00:43:03.970
MARY GROVE: Passion.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:04.560
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: Huh?

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:05.393
MARY GROVE: Passion.

00:43:05.393 --> 00:43:08.210
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Passion, passion, life.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.680
MARY GROVE: Role model.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.130
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Role model, my mother.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:16.120
MARY GROVE: And
finally, wrap dress.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.702
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Wrap dress paid my bills.

00:43:20.702 --> 00:43:27.098
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:32.530
Oh that, that's a little
piece of the TV show.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.030
MARY GROVE: Before
we close, we want

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:36.446
to give everyone a sneak preview
of this Sunday's episode.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:40.770
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:42.910
-Amanda come on in.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.964
How are you?

00:43:43.964 --> 00:43:44.755
-Good, how are you?

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:47.470
I'm literally freaking out, like
shaking, my heart's beating,

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.470
I think my vision is
like going blurry.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.950
-Bronson came to see me
and he say, wow you know,

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.630
I'm a little nervous.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.500
How's it going?

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.500
-At times, there's like
a little bit of tension.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.600
-What goes on?

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.120
-Well I got in a little
argument with Britney today.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.120
She's trying to say little
things to put herself

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.330
here and put the others below,
and I don't think that's right.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:14.300
She likes to be the boss and
take charge of the situation.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.970
And I've kind of
just let her, but I'm

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.440
at the point where I--
I'm getting emotional.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.710
I don't usually--

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:23.670
-No, that's OK.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.560
-Thank you.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.560
-You know, when I
was young I didn't

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.700
want to be taken advantage of.

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.830
As I get more confident
and less insecure,

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.131
I realize that you have
to stand for who you are.

00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:35.630
-Yeah.

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.960
-It's important, especially
in the fashion industry,

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:44.030
to actually forget about the
personality of the people

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:45.170
you're working with.

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.190
Just get the job done.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:49.690
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:53.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:56.980
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG:
Sunday at 10 o'clock.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.660
And you can tweet a lot
so my ratings go up.

00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:03.550
MARY GROVE: Before
we close, I wanted

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.290
to share with everyone there
are copies of Diane's two

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.280
new books.

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.250
One is the memoir, "The
Woman I Wanted To Be."

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.740
I can't recommend
it highly enough.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.640
I loved reading every word.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.130
And the second is this
beautiful coffee table book,

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:16.790
called "The Journey of a Dress."

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.250
And Diane will be with us
a bit longer to sign them.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.140
DIANE VON FURSTENBERG: If you
have the book on your laps,

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.785
can you bring it up like that
so I could take a nice picture?

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.320
All right.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.375
Thank you.

00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:40.000
MARY GROVE: Give a
very warm thank you.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.800
[APPLAUSE]
