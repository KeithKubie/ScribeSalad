when you think about what makes a

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340
when you think about what makes a
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.970
when you think about what makes a
university great it's really not a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980
university great it's really not a
 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.710
university great it's really not a
homogeneous community it's a diverse

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
homogeneous community it's a diverse
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.259
homogeneous community it's a diverse
community that makes us so so so

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
community that makes us so so so
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.299
community that makes us so so so
significantly stronger from the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
significantly stronger from the
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.430
significantly stronger from the
standpoint of women we're certainly

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440
standpoint of women we're certainly
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.709
standpoint of women we're certainly
seeing not necessarily a huge increase

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
seeing not necessarily a huge increase
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.900
seeing not necessarily a huge increase
in the number of women applying but

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
in the number of women applying but
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370
in the number of women applying but
where the increase is coming is

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
where the increase is coming is
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.070
where the increase is coming is
ultimately in the high quality women

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
ultimately in the high quality women
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.599
ultimately in the high quality women
that are applying we're seeing greater

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
that are applying we're seeing greater
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.310
that are applying we're seeing greater
numbers of those students and so as a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
numbers of those students and so as a
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.859
numbers of those students and so as a
result we're able to admit more women

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
result we're able to admit more women
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.080
result we're able to admit more women
which is translating it into ultimately

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
which is translating it into ultimately
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720
which is translating it into ultimately
enrolling more women the yield has gone

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
enrolling more women the yield has gone
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.110
enrolling more women the yield has gone
up for women as well and so they're

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
up for women as well and so they're
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.660
up for women as well and so they're
certainly seeing Carnegie Mellon perhaps

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
certainly seeing Carnegie Mellon perhaps
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.490
certainly seeing Carnegie Mellon perhaps
differently than maybe some of their

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
differently than maybe some of their
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.459
differently than maybe some of their
predecessors recognizing that this is a

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
predecessors recognizing that this is a
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.290
predecessors recognizing that this is a
community that does care an awful lot

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
community that does care an awful lot
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.420
community that does care an awful lot
about underrepresented populations and

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
about underrepresented populations and
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.709
about underrepresented populations and
particularly in our STEM disciplines

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
particularly in our STEM disciplines
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.160
particularly in our STEM disciplines
women had been underrepresented and even

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
women had been underrepresented and even
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.270
women had been underrepresented and even
in the Tempur school we have seen

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280
in the Tempur school we have seen
 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920
in the Tempur school we have seen
significant growth in terms of the yield

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
significant growth in terms of the yield
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.979
significant growth in terms of the yield
in women and so it's really you know

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
in women and so it's really you know
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.200
in women and so it's really you know
from my standpoint terrific having been

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
from my standpoint terrific having been
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939
from my standpoint terrific having been
here for so long at Carnegie Mellon

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
here for so long at Carnegie Mellon
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.670
here for so long at Carnegie Mellon
recognizing the huge gains that we've

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
recognizing the huge gains that we've
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170
recognizing the huge gains that we've
been making in this area in such a short

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
been making in this area in such a short
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.820
been making in this area in such a short
amount of time I've got to say we know

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
amount of time I've got to say we know
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.800
amount of time I've got to say we know
we're pretty proud of the advances that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
we're pretty proud of the advances that
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.920
we're pretty proud of the advances that
we're making and I think that it makes a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
we're making and I think that it makes a
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109
we're making and I think that it makes a
difference in the university community I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
difference in the university community I
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.030
difference in the university community I
can't tell you how many faculty have

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040
can't tell you how many faculty have
 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.929
can't tell you how many faculty have
reiterated how important it is to have

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
reiterated how important it is to have
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120
reiterated how important it is to have
women you know represent it in a way

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
women you know represent it in a way
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.880
women you know represent it in a way
where the strengths of those students

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
where the strengths of those students
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.210
where the strengths of those students
come out and so I think the critical

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
come out and so I think the critical
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.660
come out and so I think the critical
mass issue is behind us and we have I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
mass issue is behind us and we have I
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.399
mass issue is behind us and we have I
think a great group of women that are

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
think a great group of women that are
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170
think a great group of women that are
joining the community this year one of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180
joining the community this year one of
 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.609
joining the community this year one of
the things that I love about being an

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
the things that I love about being an
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.980
the things that I love about being an
undergraduate admission is you know

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
undergraduate admission is you know
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289
undergraduate admission is you know
really we're opportunity brokers really

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299
really we're opportunity brokers really
 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.910
really we're opportunity brokers really
we're really you know providing

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
we're really you know providing
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.740
we're really you know providing
opportunities for students that may

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
opportunities for students that may
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.289
opportunities for students that may
never have thought about you know a kind

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
never have thought about you know a kind
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.999
never have thought about you know a kind
of an experience like this and so

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
of an experience like this and so
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.980
of an experience like this and so
there's no better time to be an

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
there's no better time to be an
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569
there's no better time to be an
undergraduate admission quite frankly

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
undergraduate admission quite frankly
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850
undergraduate admission quite frankly
and and I think in no better place than

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
and and I think in no better place than
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.820
and and I think in no better place than
at Carnegie Mellon
