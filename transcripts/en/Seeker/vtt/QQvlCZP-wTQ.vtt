00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.300
Inside of your mouth are usually 32 teeth:
8 incisors, 4 canines, 8 premolars, 8 molars,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.610
and 4 third molars.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.410
One of these things is not like the otherâ€¦

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.879
One of these things, doesn't belong!

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.910
Hey toothers
The third molars -- commonly called wisdom

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.800
teeth -- form as early as age 12 when tissue
sacs called follicles migrate to the soft

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.560
tissues in the back of your jaw to form buds.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.310
If they do, they'll erupt from from the gum
line by age 25.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.480
If you leave wisdom teeth in place, they can
become impacted, form cysts, get infected,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.680
or weaken the bone of the jaw, which is why,
after the advent of anesthesia, dentists began

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.680
removing them.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.640
But not everyone has the same experience!

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.760
Evolution has completely redrawn the boundaries
of the human head, and wisdom teeth got caught

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.890
in the crossfire.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.109
But if there's no room for them, why do we
even have them?

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:59.680
100 million years ago, our ancestors' jaws
were large enough to make room for all 32

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.440
teeth -- and they were all useful, with molars
doing a lot of grinding and chewing of greens

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.440
and raw meats.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.130
As we evolved, we didn't really need the big
strong back teeth anymore.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.880
After the advent of cooking, food became easier
to digest and to chew; so again, having a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.140
third set of molars was pretty useless.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.000
As our ancestral primates took advantage of
these evolutionary wins, we began to walk

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.350
upright, grew larger brains, and developed
longer arms; yet, somehow our third molars

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.420
weren't entirely eliminated.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.530
Thanks, Mr. Darwin.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.540
That being said, 65 percent of people don't
develop wisdom teeth at all; and some will

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.700
only get one, two, or three.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.180
In one study from University of Tennessee-Knoxville,
African-Americans, and Inuits tend to have

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
third molar agenesis, meaning they never develop
wisdom teeth buds.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.110
In fact, Inuits, seem to hardly ever grow
wisdom teeth.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.509
Alan Mann, an anthropologist from Princeton
University, believes this is because the Inuit

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.259
tend to have flatter faces and narrower jaws.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.670
He believes as the brain got larger, there
was no more room in our faces, and the evolutionary

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.049
advantage went to those who didn't have these
superfluous, painful teeth.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.050
Essentially, their own genetics caused natural
selection to weed out the Inuit who did grow

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.550
the teeth, as they'd likely experience the
medical difficulties associated with those

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.130
who grow them today, yet have no way to fix
it.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.940
On top of that, research from the University
of Pennsylvania found a mutation in a gene

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.330
called MYH16, which resulted in the shrinking
of our jaw, further pushing out these stupid

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.330
teeth.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.640
This process actually started hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.980
While doing research in China in 2011, Mann,
the Princeton anthropologist, found the oldest

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.550
known fossils without wisdom teeth, dating
from 300 to 400,000 years ago.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.940
Experts think wisdom teeth are similar to
pinky toes or human tails -- they're vestigial

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.650
-- leftover bits in the ongoing process of
evolution.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.310
So even though wisdom teeth started out as
something useful, today they are more a pain

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.310
than a perk!

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.250
If third molars do appear (and there's not
enough space on your jaw for them to fit)

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.350
the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial
Surgeons, recommend they be removed.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.890
Of course, in the end, the fate of this vestigial
evolutionary tooth it's a matter for you and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.010
your dentist.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.010
Life is weird.
