00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.269
A really fun question is that when astronauts
are in space they're not experiencing gravity,

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.570
so how does digestion work?

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.480
We sort of think of food moving down in our
bodies, it seems that maybe gravity would

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.880
have something to do with that.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.840
The amazing thing is that it really doesn't
and this was one of the first things we discovered

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.710
when we sent animals first and then people
up into space.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.570
Some people wondered if you could swallow,
if you could digest at all without the force

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.570
of gravity.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.130
And it turns out that the act of peristalsis,
the way your throat and your intestines squeeze

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.420
themselves, will actually move food and water
through your digestive system without gravity

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.190
at all and you can even test that with people
lying in hospital beds.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.089
When you think about somebody that's actually
lying down, there's no force of gravity that's

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.329
pulling food in one direction or the other.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.460
The human body is actually pretty good at
moving food through without the force of gravity.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.280
Now other part of this is what happens when
the food comes out the other end, because

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.190
this is a natural thing that all humans do
every day.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.070
Well, you've now reached the wonderful science
of space toilets.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.180
They actually act with suction.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.820
Now if you've ever been to the dentist's office
and the dentist wants you to spit and he holds

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.259
up a little cup with a tube attached to it
and there's suction that takes the water down

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.259
the tube.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.939
A space toilet acts very much that way; there's
suction, there's a current of air that actually

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.960
draws the waste down so it can be disposed
of.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.640
And, honestly, sometimes it doesn't work perfectly.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.729
This is one of the things that astronauts
have to deal with.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.790
When you think about the word 'floater', that
has happened, where something escapes and

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.479
you need to go get it.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.420
Some of the worst parts of human space flight
in the very early days, like in Gemini all

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.280
the way back in the 1960s, was people would
collect their urine in a little plastic bag

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.380
and sometimes they broke.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.250
So there have been some people up there and
some very bad circumstances.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.079
Today, the toilet on the space station works
very well and suction brings everything down

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:04.110
and the best thing I can compare it to is
the dentist's spit cup.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.390
They actually have a little video camera so
you can see if anything is floating around

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.920
in the toilet before you get up.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.929
Yeah.
