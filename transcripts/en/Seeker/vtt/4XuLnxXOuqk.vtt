Today we're taking a look at Cutie and the
Boxer, which is one of this year's Oscar Nominees

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.180
for Best Documentary.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.320
It takes a look at the lives of artists Ushio
and Noriko Shinohara, who met in the 1960s,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.550
when Noriko moved from Japan to New York to
become an art student and Ushio was big in

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.030
the underground art scene.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.449
Ushio was 42 and Noriko was 19.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.670
The movie begins on Ushio's 80th birthday-
and by jumping back and forth through their

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.019
lives, Cutie and the Boxer tells an amazing
story about marriage, family, and the art

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.019
world.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.859
Ushio's art has always been regarded as influential
and flashbacks show him with people like Andy

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.020
Warhol, but he and Noriko live pretty much
in poverty- and while he doesn't seem to care

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.889
and barely thinks about paying the electric
bill, Noriko is tired of living their lives

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:01.889
with too little.

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.310
Her own work has also been pushed aside, because
Ushio considers his work important and he's

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.220
tried their whole life to push her into the
role of loving wife and assistant- even when

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.510
her own art is starting to take off and become
more popular than his.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.510
One of my favorite things about the movie
is just how well it captures the depth of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.150
this decades old relationship.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.540
They love each other, but they have no filter-
they don't censor themselves whether it comes

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.910
to talking about each other's work or what
they feel like their lives would've been like

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.110
if the other hadn't messed it up- but they
also show how clearly they need each other

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.500
and care about one another.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.680
It's also a great depiction of what it means
to really love and become obsessed with your

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.100
work and how creativity has to be its own
reward, because no other reward might be coming.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.880
It's an absolutely beautiful story, and if
you're interested in personal stories or the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.230
creative process, I think you'll really love
it.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.460
Okay, your turn- the movie's available now
on Netflix in the US, not sure about other

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.460
countries.
