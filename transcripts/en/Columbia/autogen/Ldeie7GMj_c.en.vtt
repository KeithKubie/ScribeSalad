information that could help them to
 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.110
information that could help them to
write their own platform and you know I

write their own platform and you know I
 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.409

to be very modest on this issue there's

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700
to be very modest on this issue there's
 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.909
to be very modest on this issue there's
no way we can test perfectly all the

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919
no way we can test perfectly all the
 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.800
no way we can test perfectly all the
ipod edges and of course there's no way

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:38.810
ipod edges and of course there's no way
 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.260

some of the reviews and and you know I

00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479
some of the reviews and and you know I
 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.090
some of the reviews and and you know I
think there are many different possible

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.100
think there are many different possible
 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.060
think there are many different possible
futures depending on particular hundred

so this book relies on two big set of

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
so this book relies on two big set of
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.310
so this book relies on two big set of
data one about income and the other one

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:12.320
data one about income and the other one
 

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.920
data one about income and the other one
that is even more important about wealth

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:14.930
that is even more important about wealth
 

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.100
that is even more important about wealth
so the income part comes from the world

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.110
so the income part comes from the world
 

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.490
so the income part comes from the world
type income database which is a database

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:21.500
type income database which is a database
 

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.379
type income database which is a database
that we've constructed with all these

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:23.389
that we've constructed with all these
 

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.710
that we've constructed with all these
cursors and and so the countries in red

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720
cursors and and so the countries in red
 

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.000
cursors and and so the countries in red
are in the database the countries in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.010
are in the database the countries in
 

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.620
are in the database the countries in
blue are about in the database so being

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:29.630
blue are about in the database so being
 

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.990
blue are about in the database so being
in the database means that we've used

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
in the database means that we've used
 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.459
in the database means that we've used
all the historical income data available

00:08:36.459 --> 00:08:36.469
all the historical income data available
 

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:38.409
all the historical income data available
in particular since the creation of the

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:38.419
in particular since the creation of the
 

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.810
in particular since the creation of the
income tax in each particular country so

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:40.820
income tax in each particular country so
 

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.050
income tax in each particular country so
the income tax was created in 1913 in

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.060
the income tax was created in 1913 in
 

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.190
the income tax was created in 1913 in
the United States in 1914 in France 1909

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200
the United States in 1914 in France 1909
 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.570
the United States in 1914 in France 1909
in return in its modern progressive from

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:51.580
in return in its modern progressive from
 

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.470
in return in its modern progressive from
1922 in India you know in number of X

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480
1922 in India you know in number of X
 

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.890
1922 in India you know in number of X
colonies X colonial power introduced in

00:08:59.890 --> 00:08:59.900

contact with you early so we have

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.310
contact with you early so we have
 

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.630
contact with you early so we have
historical data on income so the typical

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640
historical data on income so the typical
 

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.660
historical data on income so the typical
output of this database is this kind of

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670
output of this database is this kind of
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.860
output of this database is this kind of
graph so

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:08.870
graph so
 

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.460
graph so
for the United States where so we find

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:12.470
for the United States where so we find
 

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.550
for the United States where so we find
you know we have this large reduction in

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560
you know we have this large reduction in
 

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.590
you know we have this large reduction in
the share of national income going to

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600
the share of national income going to
 

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.130
the share of national income going to
the top 10% between the 1920s and the

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:21.140
the top 10% between the 1920s and the
 

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.710
the top 10% between the 1920s and the
1950s so this is actually exactly what

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720
1950s so this is actually exactly what
 

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.950
1950s so this is actually exactly what
Kuznets found in the 1950s and all what

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:26.960
Kuznets found in the 1950s and all what
 

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.680
Kuznets found in the 1950s and all what
we've been doing is to add another Alpha

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:29.690
we've been doing is to add another Alpha
 

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.160
we've been doing is to add another Alpha
century but of course this changes quite

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.170
century but of course this changes quite
 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.890
century but of course this changes quite
substantially and also Kuznets only one

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:35.900
substantially and also Kuznets only one
 

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.690
substantially and also Kuznets only one
country and we have over 30 countries

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:37.700
country and we have over 30 countries
 

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.820
country and we have over 30 countries
but to a large extent what we've been

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:39.830
but to a large extent what we've been
 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.829
but to a large extent what we've been
doing is just to extend the methods and

00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839
doing is just to extend the methods and
 

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:44.500
doing is just to extend the methods and
and work done by Canadian refugees so

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:44.510
and work done by Canadian refugees so
 

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.570
and work done by Canadian refugees so
the conclusions of course are that you

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:46.580
the conclusions of course are that you
 

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:51.100
the conclusions of course are that you
get with that supplementary data the

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.110
get with that supplementary data the
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.660
get with that supplementary data the
conclusions are quite different so in

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:52.670
conclusions are quite different so in
 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.050
conclusions are quite different so in
the 50s 60s Kuznets at this conclusion

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:56.060
the 50s 60s Kuznets at this conclusion
 

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.400
the 50s 60s Kuznets at this conclusion
saying that you know in the advanced

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.410
saying that you know in the advanced
 

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.620
saying that you know in the advanced
stages of economic development you have

00:09:59.620 --> 00:09:59.630
stages of economic development you have
 

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.600
stages of economic development you have
a reduction and then you know

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:01.610
a reduction and then you know
 

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.380
a reduction and then you know
stabilization of inequality you know to

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:05.390
stabilization of inequality you know to
 

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.420
stabilization of inequality you know to
be honest cosmetic himself was not too

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:07.430
be honest cosmetic himself was not too
 

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:09.940
be honest cosmetic himself was not too
convinced by the spontaneity of this

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:09.950
convinced by the spontaneity of this
 

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.880
convinced by the spontaneity of this
mechanism but I guess in the you know

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:12.890
mechanism but I guess in the you know
 

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.730
mechanism but I guess in the you know
Cold War period there was you know many

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:15.740
Cold War period there was you know many
 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.150

strong reason why people wanted to be

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160
strong reason why people wanted to be
 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.010
strong reason why people wanted to be

and about the story of inequality and

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:23.420
and about the story of inequality and
 

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.370
and about the story of inequality and

the most recent decade you know you can
 

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.000
the most recent decade you know you can
see the picture is quite different I

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.010
see the picture is quite different I
 

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.070
see the picture is quite different I
have not put on this graph the latest

continuing where is it going to stop you
know nobody knows you know so some

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:50.570
know nobody knows you know so some

trend I think it's reasonable to to you
 

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.699
trend I think it's reasonable to to you
know ask the question you know is this

00:11:03.699 --> 00:11:03.709
know ask the question you know is this
 

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:06.070
know ask the question you know is this
you know is this really useful for

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.080
you know is this really useful for
 

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.360
you know is this really useful for
growth you know the growth performance

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.370
growth you know the growth performance
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.030
growth you know the growth performance
of the US economy over the recent period

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040
of the US economy over the recent period

since 1980 has not been particularly
good so if you if you have 1.5 percent

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:15.709
good so if you if you have 1.5 percent
 

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:19.720
good so if you if you have 1.5 percent
per capita GDP growth and 2/3 or 3/4 of

it goes to the top 10% and mostly
 

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.340
it goes to the top 10% and mostly
top 1% you know it's not clear that this

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:24.350
top 1% you know it's not clear that this
 

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.829
top 1% you know it's not clear that this
is really a good deal for the rest of

is really a good deal for the rest of
 

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:29.290
is really a good deal for the rest of
the population so you know that's an

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300
the population so you know that's an
 

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.320
the population so you know that's an
issue that I analyzed in the book and I

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.330
issue that I analyzed in the book and I
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.750
issue that I analyzed in the book and I
try to analyze you know the reason for

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760
try to analyze you know the reason for
 

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.780
try to analyze you know the reason for
this you'd rise particularly of top

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:37.790
this you'd rise particularly of top
 

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.180
this you'd rise particularly of top
managerial compensation now although

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:40.190
managerial compensation now although

this is included in the book this is not

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320
this is included in the book this is not
 

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.019
this is included in the book this is not
the main part in the book and the book

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:44.029
the main part in the book and the book
 

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:46.750
the main part in the book and the book
tries to shift the attention from this

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760
tries to shift the attention from this
 

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.519
tries to shift the attention from this
evolution of top incomes to the

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:48.529
evolution of top incomes to the
 

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:51.310
evolution of top incomes to the
evolution of wealth concentration per se

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320
evolution of wealth concentration per se
 

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.920
evolution of wealth concentration per se
because I you know I believe both issues

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:53.930
because I you know I believe both issues
 

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.690
because I you know I believe both issues
are important and to some extent they

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:55.700
are important and to some extent they
 

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.820
are important and to some extent they
you know the rise of top incomes feeds

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:57.830
you know the rise of top incomes feeds
 

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.310
you know the rise of top incomes feeds
into the rise of top wealth but the

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320
into the rise of top wealth but the
 

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.590
into the rise of top wealth but the
dynamics of wealth distribution and

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600
dynamics of wealth distribution and
 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.890
dynamics of wealth distribution and
wealth accumulation follow also you know

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:05.900
wealth accumulation follow also you know
 

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.460
wealth accumulation follow also you know
additional logic and processes and and

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:09.470
additional logic and processes and and
 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.070
additional logic and processes and and
in particular you know there's been a

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:12.080
in particular you know there's been a
 

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.790
in particular you know there's been a
long-run recovery of aggregate wealth to

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800
long-run recovery of aggregate wealth to
 

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.220
long-run recovery of aggregate wealth to
income ratio which you're going to see

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.230
income ratio which you're going to see
 

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.680
income ratio which you're going to see
you know in this picture for European

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.690
you know in this picture for European
 

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.600
you know in this picture for European
countries so you know it looks a little

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:22.610
countries so you know it looks a little
 

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.360
countries so you know it looks a little
bit like the u-shape picture that we

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:25.370
bit like the u-shape picture that we
 

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.280
bit like the u-shape picture that we
have here except that it's a completely

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.290
have here except that it's a completely
 

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.170
have here except that it's a completely
different process and in fact this

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:29.180
different process and in fact this
 

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.860
different process and in fact this
happens mostly in Europe and Japan

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:31.870
happens mostly in Europe and Japan
 

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.840
happens mostly in Europe and Japan
whereas the previous one is mostly in

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:34.850
whereas the previous one is mostly in
 

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.820
whereas the previous one is mostly in
the United States so the previous one

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:36.830
the United States so the previous one
 

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.410
the United States so the previous one
was about the share of total income

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.420
was about the share of total income
 

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.780
was about the share of total income
going to top 10% income although now

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:40.790
going to top 10% income although now
 

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.699
going to top 10% income although now
this curve is not about inequality

00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:42.709
this curve is not about inequality
 

00:12:42.709 --> 00:12:44.320
this curve is not about inequality
strictly speaking this is about the

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:44.330
strictly speaking this is about the
 

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.710
strictly speaking this is about the
aggregate quantity of net private wealth

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720
aggregate quantity of net private wealth
 

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.400
aggregate quantity of net private wealth
to national income you know it could be

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.410
to national income you know it could be
 

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.620
to national income you know it could be
you know you could have a lot of capital

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:53.630
you know you could have a lot of capital
 

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.410
you know you could have a lot of capital
relative to income without inequality

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:56.420
relative to income without inequality
 

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.210
relative to income without inequality
you know if everybody has an equal share

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:58.220
you know if everybody has an equal share
 

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.160
you know if everybody has an equal share
in the capital stock so this does not

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.170
in the capital stock so this does not
 

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.280
in the capital stock so this does not
necessarily imply a rise of inequality

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:03.290
necessarily imply a rise of inequality
 

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.350
necessarily imply a rise of inequality
and and this is certainly not bad in

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360
and and this is certainly not bad in
 

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.760
and and this is certainly not bad in
itself you know to have a lot of capital

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:06.770
itself you know to have a lot of capital
 

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.590
itself you know to have a lot of capital
you know after all it's better to have a

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600
you know after all it's better to have a
 

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.390
you know after all it's better to have a
lot of capital that were just a lot of

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:10.400
lot of capital that were just a lot of
 

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.490
lot of capital that were just a lot of
debt and and you know right now people

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.500
debt and and you know right now people
 

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.220
debt and and you know right now people
are you know worried about public debt

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:15.230
are you know worried about public debt
 

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.990
are you know worried about public debt
and private that you know it's important

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000
and private that you know it's important
 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.090
and private that you know it's important
to be aware of the fact that rich

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.100
to be aware of the fact that rich
 

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.190
to be aware of the fact that rich
countries and in particular European

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200
countries and in particular European
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.829
countries and in particular European
countries are rich you know their

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839
countries are rich you know their
 

00:13:23.839 --> 00:13:25.750
countries are rich you know their
governments are - which is a different

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760
governments are - which is a different
 

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.910
governments are - which is a different
matter but you know the net private

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920
matter but you know the net private
 

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.699
matter but you know the net private
wealth has never been as large you know

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:30.709
wealth has never been as large you know
 

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.590
wealth has never been as large you know
for almost a century

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600
for almost a century
 

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.240
for almost a century
and so you know there has been a big

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.250
and so you know there has been a big
 

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.570
and so you know there has been a big
decline

aggregate net private wealth following
the world wars and you have a strong

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:39.750
the world wars and you have a strong
 

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.180
the world wars and you have a strong
recovery starting in the 1950s and and

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.190
recovery starting in the 1950s and and
 

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.270
recovery starting in the 1950s and and
and now we are know seem to be going

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:47.280
and now we are know seem to be going
 

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.060
and now we are know seem to be going
back to the kind of very I was to income

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.070
back to the kind of very I was to income
 

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.070
back to the kind of very I was to income
ratio that we had in European societies

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:52.080
ratio that we had in European societies
 

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.880
ratio that we had in European societies
prior to World War one so there are

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:55.890
prior to World War one so there are
 

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:57.590
prior to World War one so there are
three main points that you know I would

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600
three main points that you know I would
 

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.210
three main points that you know I would
like to make instrumentation then you

00:13:59.210 --> 00:13:59.220
like to make instrumentation then you
 

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.940
like to make instrumentation then you
know I'm gonna try to go really that so

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:01.950
know I'm gonna try to go really that so
 

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.890
know I'm gonna try to go really that so
first part is what I've just shown you

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:03.900
first part is what I've just shown you
 

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.220
first part is what I've just shown you
you know the return of patrimonial of

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:07.230
you know the return of patrimonial of
 

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.650
you know the return of patrimonial of
your wealth based society in Europe and

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660
your wealth based society in Europe and
 

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.290
your wealth based society in Europe and
Japan where you know wealth income ratio

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300
Japan where you know wealth income ratio
 

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.240
Japan where you know wealth income ratio
seemed to be returning to very high

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.250
seemed to be returning to very high
 

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.030
seemed to be returning to very high
levels in those low growth societies so

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040
levels in those low growth societies so
 

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.430
levels in those low growth societies so
what characterizes Europe and Japan is

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440
what characterizes Europe and Japan is
 

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.020
what characterizes Europe and Japan is
that you know in terms of productivity

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:21.030
that you know in terms of productivity
 

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.970
that you know in terms of productivity
growth is not very different from the US

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980
growth is not very different from the US
 

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.000
growth is not very different from the US
but the population growth is a lot area

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.010
but the population growth is a lot area
 

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.790
but the population growth is a lot area
in the US so in in Japan or in many

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800
in the US so in in Japan or in many
 

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.110
in the US so in in Japan or in many
European countries there's really no

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120
European countries there's really no
 

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.780
European countries there's really no
population growth anymore and you know

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:32.790
population growth anymore and you know
 

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.250
population growth anymore and you know
the intuition is that in a slow growth

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260

unequal access to wealth you know this
 

00:15:58.419 --> 00:16:00.389
unequal access to wealth you know this
is not a program per se now the problem

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399
is not a program per se now the problem
 

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:02.189
is not a program per se now the problem
is that wealth inequality is always a

00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199
is that wealth inequality is always a
 

00:16:02.199 --> 00:16:06.090
is that wealth inequality is always a
lot larger and income inequality you

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:06.100
lot larger and income inequality you
 

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.789
lot larger and income inequality you
know I cannot show you the graph but

00:16:07.789 --> 00:16:07.799
know I cannot show you the graph but
 

00:16:07.799 --> 00:16:10.109
know I cannot show you the graph but

going to the top 10% you know can be you
know ninety percent in three World War

00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759
know ninety percent in three World War
 

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:17.699
know ninety percent in three World War
one European societies and today it's

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:17.709
one European societies and today it's
 

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:19.999
one European societies and today it's
above seventy percent in the u.s.

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:20.009
above seventy percent in the u.s.
 

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:22.559
above seventy percent in the u.s.
whereas for income we've seen that you

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:22.569
whereas for income we've seen that you
 

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:24.779
whereas for income we've seen that you
it has gone from 30 to 50 percent in the

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:24.789
it has gone from 30 to 50 percent in the
 

00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:27.179
it has gone from 30 to 50 percent in the
u.s. so it's forwards it's always more

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:27.189
u.s. so it's forwards it's always more
 

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:29.789
u.s. so it's forwards it's always more
extreme levels of inequalities and for

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:29.799
extreme levels of inequalities and for
 

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:33.469
extreme levels of inequalities and for
income and one of the determinants of

00:16:33.469 --> 00:16:33.479
income and one of the determinants of
 

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:36.509
income and one of the determinants of
long-run wealth concentration is this

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519
long-run wealth concentration is this
 

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:41.639
long-run wealth concentration is this

gap F F minus G where air is the rate of
 

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:44.669
gap F F minus G where air is the rate of

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:44.679
return and G is the growth rate and let
 

00:16:44.679 --> 00:16:47.939
return and G is the growth rate and let
me make clear that you know sometime

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:47.949
me make clear that you know sometime
 

00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:49.889
me make clear that you know sometime
people are surprised when when you know

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:49.899
people are surprised when when you know
 

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:54.029
people are surprised when when you know
I say that and G R can be bigger than G

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:54.039
I say that and G R can be bigger than G
 

00:16:54.039 --> 00:16:56.069
I say that and G R can be bigger than G
forever so you know it's very important

00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079
forever so you know it's very important
 

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.569
forever so you know it's very important
to understand that there is absolutely

00:16:57.569 --> 00:16:57.579
to understand that there is absolutely
 

00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:00.329
to understand that there is absolutely
no paradox yeah and that you know in

00:17:00.329 --> 00:17:00.339
no paradox yeah and that you know in
 

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:02.729
no paradox yeah and that you know in
fact the simplest way to see that is to

00:17:02.729 --> 00:17:02.739
fact the simplest way to see that is to
 

00:17:02.739 --> 00:17:05.340
fact the simplest way to see that is to
go back through time and you know in

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:05.350
go back through time and you know in
 

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.100
go back through time and you know in
traditional agrarian societies it was

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:08.110
traditional agrarian societies it was
 

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:10.169
traditional agrarian societies it was
really obvious to everybody that our was

00:17:10.169 --> 00:17:10.179
really obvious to everybody that our was
 

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:11.970
really obvious to everybody that our was
bigger than G and you know people when

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:11.980
bigger than G and you know people when
 

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.069
bigger than G and you know people when
we are not saying it this way but you

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079
we are not saying it this way but you
 

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.590
we are not saying it this way but you
know the growth rate was zero

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600
know the growth rate was zero
 

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.000
know the growth rate was zero
there was no population growth there was

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.010
there was no population growth there was
 

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.369
there was no population growth there was
no productivity growth or less than 0.1

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:20.379
no productivity growth or less than 0.1
 

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:22.500
no productivity growth or less than 0.1
percent per year and of course the rate

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:22.510
percent per year and of course the rate
 

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.990
percent per year and of course the rate
of return to capital was not zero you

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000
of return to capital was not zero you
 

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.730
of return to capital was not zero you
know the rate of return to land for

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:26.740
know the rate of return to land for
 

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.299
know the rate of return to land for
instant was typically four five percent

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:29.309
instant was typically four five percent
 

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:32.340
instant was typically four five percent
per year you know it's obvious if you

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:32.350
per year you know it's obvious if you
 

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.740
per year you know it's obvious if you
take any novel by genestein or whether

that you if you want 1,000 pounds of
 

00:17:38.139 --> 00:17:40.169
that you if you want 1,000 pounds of
annual income you need a capital of

00:17:40.169 --> 00:17:40.179
annual income you need a capital of
 

00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:43.049
annual income you need a capital of
20,000 pounds and it's obvious that you

00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:43.059
20,000 pounds and it's obvious that you
 

00:17:43.059 --> 00:17:45.299
20,000 pounds and it's obvious that you
know general steam doesn't even need to

00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:45.309
know general steam doesn't even need to
 

00:17:45.309 --> 00:17:46.950
know general steam doesn't even need to
say you know it's a 5% return you know

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960

the Industrial Revolution as changes a
little bit but not as much as what might

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:28.630
little bit but not as much as what might
 

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.480
little bit but not as much as what might
believe because the growth rate was

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:30.490
believe because the growth rate was
 

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:36.149
believe because the growth rate was
increased from 0% to 11.5% you know in

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159
increased from 0% to 11.5% you know in
 

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:39.210
increased from 0% to 11.5% you know in
the 19th century the growth rate of GDP

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:39.220
the 19th century the growth rate of GDP
 

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.970
the 19th century the growth rate of GDP
in European countries and in industrial

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:41.980
in European countries and in industrial
 

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.250
in European countries and in industrial
nations you know is typically 11.5

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.260
nations you know is typically 11.5
 

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.200
nations you know is typically 11.5
percent per year which is a lot more

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.210
percent per year which is a lot more
 

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.210
percent per year which is a lot more
than zero percent you know this means

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.220
than zero percent you know this means
 

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.159
than zero percent you know this means
that in the space of a generation 30

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:50.169
that in the space of a generation 30
 

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:52.680
that in the space of a generation 30
years you have a you know 30 to 50

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:52.690
years you have a you know 30 to 50
 

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:54.779
years you have a you know 30 to 50
percent increase in output which is a

00:18:54.779 --> 00:18:54.789
percent increase in output which is a
 

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:58.110
percent increase in output which is a
huge renewal of society and industrial

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120
huge renewal of society and industrial
 

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.320
huge renewal of society and industrial
activity but this is not enough you know

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:01.330
activity but this is not enough you know
 

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.840
activity but this is not enough you know
11.5 percent to counteract the fact that

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:03.850
11.5 percent to counteract the fact that
 

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.269
11.5 percent to counteract the fact that
the rate of return was typically four

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:06.279
the rate of return was typically four
 

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:08.070
the rate of return was typically four
five percent or in fact the rate of

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080
five percent or in fact the rate of
 

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.139
five percent or in fact the rate of
return even increased with new form of

00:19:10.139 --> 00:19:10.149
return even increased with new form of
 

00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:13.139
return even increased with new form of
industrial capital investment and you

00:19:13.139 --> 00:19:13.149
industrial capital investment and you
 

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:15.000
industrial capital investment and you
know can be six seven percent for

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.010
know can be six seven percent for
 

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.070
know can be six seven percent for
typically on the stock market in the

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.080
typically on the stock market in the
 

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.710
typically on the stock market in the
long run for more risky assets so the

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720
long run for more risky assets so the
 

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.539
long run for more risky assets so the
gap with the growth rate you know was

00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:21.549
gap with the growth rate you know was
 

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:24.600
gap with the growth rate you know was
not really reduced and it isn't me you

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:24.610
not really reduced and it isn't me you
 

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:29.009
not really reduced and it isn't me you
know in the 20th century due to number

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:29.019
know in the 20th century due to number
 

00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:32.310
know in the 20th century due to number
of very unusual events that this

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320
of very unusual events that this
 

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.220
of very unusual events that this
inequality between R and G was reversed

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.230
inequality between R and G was reversed
 

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.409
inequality between R and G was reversed
so what were those unusual events you

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:37.419
so what were those unusual events you
 

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:39.389
so what were those unusual events you
know somewhere dramatic some were less

00:19:39.389 --> 00:19:39.399
know somewhere dramatic some were less
 

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:41.250
know somewhere dramatic some were less

absolutely enormous I mean this is an
 

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.360
absolutely enormous I mean this is an
extreme case but if we look in between

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:13.370
extreme case but if we look in between

what we are gonna have you know right
 

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:18.040
what we are gonna have you know right
now you know in Germany actually in

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:18.050
now you know in Germany actually in
 

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.380
now you know in Germany actually in
China or in Japan or in Italy the size

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:20.390
China or in Japan or in Italy the size
 

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.210

of the generations that are born right

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:22.220
of the generations that are born right
 

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.760
of the generations that are born right
now are 30% smaller and the size of the

now are 30% smaller and the size of the
 

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.620
now are 30% smaller and the size of the
generation of the parents and you know

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:26.630
generation of the parents and you know
 

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.990
generation of the parents and you know
this is really a very unusual event in

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000
this is really a very unusual event in
 

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.330
this is really a very unusual event in
history and this can push you know the

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:31.340
history and this can push you know the
 

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.460
history and this can push you know the
importance of inheritance you know even

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:33.470
importance of inheritance you know even
 

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.250
importance of inheritance you know even
further even more can become even

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:36.260
further even more can become even
 

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.890
further even more can become even
stronger than what we had in the 19th

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:38.900
stronger than what we had in the 19th
 

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.140
stronger than what we had in the 19th
century because you know if you have any

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.150
century because you know if you have any
 

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.060

one children in each family basically

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.070
one children in each family basically
 

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.220
one children in each family basically
you inherit on both sides or on the

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:45.230
you inherit on both sides or on the
 

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:47.170
you inherit on both sides or on the
other side if both parents are cool and

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:47.180
other side if both parents are cool and
 

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.270
other side if both parents are cool and
you know the relative importance of

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280
you know the relative importance of
 

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.310
you know the relative importance of
inherited wealth relative to new output

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.320
inherited wealth relative to new output
 

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.270
inherited wealth relative to new output
and new income and new saving can become

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280
and new income and new saving can become
 

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.140
and new income and new saving can become
really now let me mention you know I

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:02.150
really now let me mention you know I
 

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:06.550
really now let me mention you know I
think when you know some people you know

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:06.560
think when you know some people you know
 

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.130
think when you know some people you know
like to say ok but your future is going

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:09.140
like to say ok but your future is going
 

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.450
like to say ok but your future is going
to be different because we are going to

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:10.460
to be different because we are going to
 

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.720
to be different because we are going to
have a lot of innovation a lot of growth

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:13.730
have a lot of innovation a lot of growth
 

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.120
have a lot of innovation a lot of growth
and you know growth will be ours and

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.130
and you know growth will be ours and
 

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.920
and you know growth will be ours and
then what you believe it you know it

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:17.930
then what you believe it you know it
 

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.990
then what you believe it you know it
could be that growth is going to be a

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000
could be that growth is going to be a
 

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.790
could be that growth is going to be a
year because we always start to have a

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:21.800
year because we always start to have a
 

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.320
year because we always start to have a
lot of children and make a lot of

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:23.330
lot of children and make a lot of
 

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.720
lot of children and make a lot of
invention at the most faster rate and in

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:25.730
invention at the most faster rate and in
 

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.620
invention at the most faster rate and in
the past but you know I think it will be

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:28.630
the past but you know I think it will be
 

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:32.860
the past but you know I think it will be
quite you know risky to wait for this

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:32.870
quite you know risky to wait for this
 

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.780
quite you know risky to wait for this
incredible coincidence to happen you

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:34.790
incredible coincidence to happen you
 

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.430
incredible coincidence to happen you
know it will really take an incredible

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440
know it will really take an incredible
 

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.830
know it will really take an incredible
coincidence for the growth rate to rise

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840
coincidence for the growth rate to rise
 

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.840
coincidence for the growth rate to rise
to the level of the rate of return it's

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:40.850
to the level of the rate of return it's
 

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.580
to the level of the rate of return it's
really important to realize that there's

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:42.590
really important to realize that there's
 

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.220
really important to realize that there's
no natural force that pushes in this

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.230
no natural force that pushes in this
 

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.280
no natural force that pushes in this
direction you know these two notions are

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:47.290
direction you know these two notions are
 

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.060
direction you know these two notions are
determined by completely different

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:49.070
determined by completely different
 

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.760
determined by completely different
forces or largely different forces and

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:51.770
forces or largely different forces and
 

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.050
forces or largely different forces and
they have no reason to coincide

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:53.060
they have no reason to coincide
 

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.560
they have no reason to coincide
naturally no model of any thought you

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:56.570
naturally no model of any thought you
 

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.150
naturally no model of any thought you
have this prediction and certain is as

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.160
have this prediction and certain is as
 

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.280
have this prediction and certain is as
nice to recall evidence going in this

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:00.290
nice to recall evidence going in this
 

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.620
nice to recall evidence going in this
direction and I think the study of

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:02.630
direction and I think the study of
 

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.410
direction and I think the study of
history is important because I think we

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:05.420
history is important because I think we
 

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.030
history is important because I think we
should not be too naive about what you

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.040
should not be too naive about what you
 

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.220
should not be too naive about what you
know suddenly the huge potential for

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.230
know suddenly the huge potential for
 

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:10.330
know suddenly the huge potential for
growth in the future

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:10.340
growth in the future
 

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.730
growth in the future
for instance you know I know some people

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:12.740
for instance you know I know some people
 

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.450
for instance you know I know some people

don't care about three World War one

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:21.460
don't care about three World War one
 

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.830
don't care about three World War one
Europe and you know the experience of

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840
Europe and you know the experience of
 

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.030
Europe and you know the experience of
these countries because these were

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.040
these countries because these were
 

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.250
these countries because these were
agrarian societies with you know little

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:27.260
agrarian societies with you know little
 

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.500
agrarian societies with you know little
so you know I think the study of

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:29.510
so you know I think the study of
 

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.080
so you know I think the study of
actually the Belle époque period and you

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.090
actually the Belle époque period and you
 

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.810
actually the Belle époque period and you
know pre-world War one capitalism is

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:34.820
know pre-world War one capitalism is
 

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.250
know pre-world War one capitalism is
actually quite interesting because it

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:36.260
actually quite interesting because it
 

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.570
actually quite interesting because it
has nothing to do with you know an

this is these are important innovations
and and in spite of all this very

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840
and and in spite of all this very
 

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.840
and and in spite of all this very
important innovation you know the growth

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:55.850
important innovation you know the growth

do that maybe the growth rate is going

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:05.860
do that maybe the growth rate is going
 

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:07.590
do that maybe the growth rate is going
to go to zero percent so this is not

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600
to go to zero percent so this is not
 

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.610
to go to zero percent so this is not
very smart what I am proposing in the

on net wealth so that in fact for you
know most of the populations that are

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:20.890
know most of the populations that are
 

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:22.890
know most of the populations that are
trying to enter into wealth accumulation

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:22.900
trying to enter into wealth accumulation
 

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.860
trying to enter into wealth accumulation
the tax will be zero or very small and

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:25.870
the tax will be zero or very small and
 

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.430
the tax will be zero or very small and
the tax rate will become I only for you

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:29.440
the tax rate will become I only for you
 

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.930
the tax rate will become I only for you
know very large level of wealth

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:30.940
know very large level of wealth
 

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.540
know very large level of wealth
concentration so the objective is to is

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:33.550
concentration so the objective is to is
 

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.730
concentration so the objective is to is
certainly not to reduce the quantity of

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:35.740
certainly not to reduce the quantity of
 

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.670
certainly not to reduce the quantity of
wealth or to reduce the average return

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:38.680
wealth or to reduce the average return
 

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.540
wealth or to reduce the average return
to capital but rather to make to

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:42.550
to capital but rather to make to
 

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.670
to capital but rather to make to
increase wealth mobility and to make the

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:44.680
increase wealth mobility and to make the
 

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.310
increase wealth mobility and to make the
distribution of wealth more democratic

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.320
distribution of wealth more democratic
 

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.150
distribution of wealth more democratic
so you know if you take for instance

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.160
so you know if you take for instance
 

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.340
so you know if you take for instance
right now in the US and in most European

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:53.350
right now in the US and in most European
 

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.170
right now in the US and in most European
countries you do have well-stacked you

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:55.180
countries you do have well-stacked you

have a take the form of the property tax

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:57.790
have a take the form of the property tax
 

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.700
have a take the form of the property tax
you know the tax on real estate property

00:25:59.700 --> 00:25:59.710
you know the tax on real estate property
 

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:01.500
you know the tax on real estate property
the difference is that it is

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:01.510
the difference is that it is
 

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:03.960
the difference is that it is
proportional and not progressive and the

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:03.970
proportional and not progressive and the
 

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.310
proportional and not progressive and the
other important difference is that it

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:05.320
other important difference is that it
 

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.810
other important difference is that it
doesn't take into account financial

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
doesn't take into account financial
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.760
doesn't take into account financial
assets and financial debt so the

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:08.770
assets and financial debt so the
 

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.430
assets and financial debt so the
difference you know if I could rewrite

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440
difference you know if I could rewrite
 

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.070
difference you know if I could rewrite
the US tax code directly in this room

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080
the US tax code directly in this room
 

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.500
the US tax code directly in this room
tonight you know I will take the tax

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:16.510
tonight you know I will take the tax
 

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.990
tonight you know I will take the tax
revenue from the property tax

revenue from the property tax
 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.820
revenue from the property tax
I will not increase these tax revenues

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:20.830
I will not increase these tax revenues
 

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.470
I will not increase these tax revenues
or promise not to increase the capital

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480
or promise not to increase the capital
 

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.470
or promise not to increase the capital
tax per se but I will transform it in

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480
tax per se but I will transform it in
 

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.820
tax per se but I will transform it in
progressive tax on net worth so for

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:28.830
progressive tax on net worth so for
 

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.100
progressive tax on net worth so for
instance you know if you have family

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:31.110

that has an apartment or house of
$500,000 but they have a mod gauge of

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080
$500,000 but they have a mod gauge of
 

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.320
$500,000 but they have a mod gauge of
four hundred ninety thousand dollars you

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:39.330
four hundred ninety thousand dollars you
 

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.870
four hundred ninety thousand dollars you
know their net wealth is only $10,000 so

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880
know their net wealth is only $10,000 so
 

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.460
know their net wealth is only $10,000 so
with the progressive tax on net wealth

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:43.470
with the progressive tax on net wealth
 

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.260
with the progressive tax on net wealth
they will pay no tax so in effect we

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:45.270
they will pay no tax so in effect we
 

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.930
they will pay no tax so in effect we
will reduce the property tax for you

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940
will reduce the property tax for you
 

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.850
will reduce the property tax for you
know the bottom 90% of the population

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:49.860
know the bottom 90% of the population
 

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.830
know the bottom 90% of the population
but Zed for people you know who have

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840
but Zed for people you know who have
 

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.330
but Zed for people you know who have
millions or billions in financial assets

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:56.340
millions or billions in financial assets
 

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.850
millions or billions in financial assets
and you know and we now are paying very

00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860
and you know and we now are paying very
 

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.100
and you know and we now are paying very
small property tax as a fraction of the

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:01.110
small property tax as a fraction of the
 

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.529
small property tax as a fraction of the
assets because so property tax doesn't

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539
assets because so property tax doesn't
 

00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:05.210
assets because so property tax doesn't
take into account financial assets and

inequality in Europe and you know this

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:07.780
inequality in Europe and you know this
 

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:09.450
inequality in Europe and you know this
is an undemocratic distribution of

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:09.460
is an undemocratic distribution of
 

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.030
is an undemocratic distribution of
wealth that threatens our ideal and the

political process in this country did

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:18.940
political process in this country did
 

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.090
political process in this country did
respond at that time and you know it

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.100
respond at that time and you know it
 

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.000
respond at that time and you know it
could respond in the future you know

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:24.010

this is the same with the tax rate and

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.410
this is the same with the tax rate and
 

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.260
this is the same with the tax rate and
inheritance you know with the tax rate

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:28.270
inheritance you know with the tax rate
 

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.600
inheritance you know with the tax rate
top tax rate on top inheritance were

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:30.610
top tax rate on top inheritance were
 

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.600
top tax rate on top inheritance were
also invented you know in the u.s. in

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:33.610
also invented you know in the u.s. in
 

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.270
also invented you know in the u.s. in
the UK it is true that in France and

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:36.280
the UK it is true that in France and
 

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.330

Germany the destructions due to the did

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:39.340
Germany the destructions due to the did
 

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.160
Germany the destructions due to the did
a lot of the redistribution without the

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:41.170
a lot of the redistribution without the
 

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.620
a lot of the redistribution without the
tax system so I guess that's part of the

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:43.630
tax system so I guess that's part of the
 

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.840
tax system so I guess that's part of the
explanation but I think it's deeper than

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:45.850
explanation but I think it's deeper than
 

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.730
explanation but I think it's deeper than
that it's also that there was an

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:47.740
that it's also that there was an
 

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.290
that it's also that there was an
attachment to equality in the US and and

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.300
attachment to equality in the US and and
 

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.050
attachment to equality in the US and and

from the anecdote you know it's

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:03.100
from the anecdote you know it's
 

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:04.980
from the anecdote you know it's
interesting to see that the only time

00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:04.990
interesting to see that the only time
 

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.340
interesting to see that the only time
were Germany has a 90 percent top tax

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.350

force inheritance tax and this is the

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480
force inheritance tax and this is the
 

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.300
force inheritance tax and this is the
same in Japan the only time in Japan

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:24.310
same in Japan the only time in Japan
 

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.130

where you have a 90 percent top tax rate

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:26.140

where you have a 90 percent top tax rate
is in 1946 1948 and you know this was

is in 1946 1948 and you know this was
 

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.170
is in 1946 1948 and you know this was
not to punish Germans or the Japanese

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:31.180
not to punish Germans or the Japanese
 

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.850

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:31.850
of come back and I think I'd be curious
 

00:58:31.850 --> 00:58:33.580
of come back and I think I'd be curious
is because tomorrow I think the tension

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:33.590
is because tomorrow I think the tension
 

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.810
is because tomorrow I think the tension
in the book is that he come

00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:34.820
in the book is that he come

says that the more important and then
comes back and says well but the

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:41.840
comes back and says well but the
 

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.940
comes back and says well but the
marginal product is still what's

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:42.950
marginal product is still what's
 

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.370
marginal product is still what's
determining the the price and I sort of

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:45.380
determining the the price and I sort of
 

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.530

what's going on here and one of the

01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:06.020
really sort of great interpretations in
 

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.650
really sort of great interpretations in
the book is that there's this there's

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:08.660
the book is that there's this there's
 

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.090
the book is that there's this there's
two kinds of ownership right there's the

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:10.100
two kinds of ownership right there's the
 

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.220
two kinds of ownership right there's the
cash flow rights to an asset and then

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:12.230
cash flow rights to an asset and then
 

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:13.900
cash flow rights to an asset and then
there's the control rights to an asset

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:13.910
there's the control rights to an asset
 

01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:15.880
there's the control rights to an asset
and that one of the reasons that in in

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:15.890
and that one of the reasons that in in
 

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:19.480
and that one of the reasons that in in
in Germany you know in Germany you have

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:19.490
in Germany you know in Germany you have
 

01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:22.360
in Germany you know in Germany you have
that the actual market value of stuff is

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:22.370
that the actual market value of stuff is
 

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:24.280
that the actual market value of stuff is
much less than the book value of the

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:24.290
much less than the book value of the
 

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.570
much less than the book value of the
underlying assets and that's because

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:25.580
underlying assets and that's because
 

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.240

over how that firm is run and so you

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:36.410
over how that firm is run and so you
 

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:37.780
over how that firm is run and so you
know one of the things that points is

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:37.790
know one of the things that points is
 

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.280
know one of the things that points is
that that's like a totally different set

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:39.290
that that's like a totally different set
 

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:39.940
that that's like a totally different set
of margins

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:39.950
of margins
 

01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:41.980
of margins
besides the wealth tax that you can

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:41.990
besides the wealth tax that you can
 

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:44.410
besides the wealth tax that you can
think of for altering what capital does

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:44.420
think of for altering what capital does
 

01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:45.670
think of for altering what capital does
it's altering the distribution of

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680
it's altering the distribution of
 

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.680
it's altering the distribution of
control rights it's saying who has a say

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:47.690
control rights it's saying who has a say
 

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:49.960
control rights it's saying who has a say
in the running of a firm who's got a say

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:49.970
in the running of a firm who's got a say
 

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.950
in the running of a firm who's got a say
in the running of an apartment building

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960
in the running of an apartment building
 

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:56.800
in the running of an apartment building
that that then lets us sort of think not

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:56.810
that that then lets us sort of think not
 

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:58.870
that that then lets us sort of think not
just about capital as the thing that's

01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880
just about capital as the thing that's
 

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.250
just about capital as the thing that's
written down in the balance sheets but

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:00.260
written down in the balance sheets but
 

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.080
written down in the balance sheets but
over who's got what rights to do with

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:02.090
over who's got what rights to do with
 

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.020
over who's got what rights to do with
what's written down in the balance sheet

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:04.030
what's written down in the balance sheet
 

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:08.320
what's written down in the balance sheet
and so that's sort of what I like and

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:08.330
and so that's sort of what I like and
 

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:10.120
and so that's sort of what I like and
then it's also when you have that that

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:10.130
then it's also when you have that that
 

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:11.890
then it's also when you have that that
view but this interest rate being set

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:11.900
view but this interest rate being set
 

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.420
view but this interest rate being set
institutionally it makes a bunch of

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:13.430
institutionally it makes a bunch of
 

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.390
institutionally it makes a bunch of
labor market reforms look more feasible

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400
labor market reforms look more feasible
 

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.010
labor market reforms look more feasible
because I think if you're in this world

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:18.020
because I think if you're in this world
 

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.030
because I think if you're in this world
there's just the elasticity of

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:19.040
there's just the elasticity of
 

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.950
there's just the elasticity of
substitution then you basically think

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960
substitution then you basically think
 

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.120
substitution then you basically think
well if you increase the minimum wage

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:22.130
well if you increase the minimum wage
 

01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:23.170
well if you increase the minimum wage
you're just going to substitute it with

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:23.180
you're just going to substitute it with
 

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.700
you're just going to substitute it with
robots and so it's not going to do very

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:24.710
robots and so it's not going to do very
 

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:26.770
robots and so it's not going to do very
much work but if you instead have this

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:26.780
much work but if you instead have this
 

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:28.150
much work but if you instead have this
world that like the rate of return is

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160
world that like the rate of return is
 

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.740
world that like the rate of return is
determined by a much more sticky

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:29.750
determined by a much more sticky
 

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:31.480
determined by a much more sticky
institutional process it gives you a

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:31.490
institutional process it gives you a
 

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.460
institutional process it gives you a
scope for raising wages that isn't just

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:33.470
scope for raising wages that isn't just
 

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:36.940
scope for raising wages that isn't just
going to translate into into lower

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:36.950
going to translate into into lower
 

01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:40.060
going to translate into into lower
employment so that's sort of one set of

01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:40.070
employment so that's sort of one set of
 

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:41.980
employment so that's sort of one set of
things that I would like to take a stand

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:41.990
things that I would like to take a stand
 

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:43.000
things that I would like to take a stand
on these good it's interesting because

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:43.010
on these good it's interesting because
 

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.140
on these good it's interesting because
this is a debate that's been happening

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:44.150
this is a debate that's been happening
 

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:47.200
this is a debate that's been happening
in labor economics for 15 years is like

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:47.210
in labor economics for 15 years is like
 

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.570
in labor economics for 15 years is like
is that institutions or technology

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:49.580
is that institutions or technology
 

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.830
is that institutions or technology
there's been determining whether or not

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:50.840
there's been determining whether or not
 

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.020
there's been determining whether or not
the gap between college-educated workers

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:53.030
the gap between college-educated workers
 

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:54.610
the gap between college-educated workers
and non college-educated workers has

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:54.620
and non college-educated workers has
 

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:56.320
and non college-educated workers has
been growing and so I just like to take

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:56.330
been growing and so I just like to take
 

01:02:56.330 --> 01:03:00.430
been growing and so I just like to take
that into the realm of capital okay so

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440
that into the realm of capital okay so
 

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.990
that into the realm of capital okay so
let me then switch and

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000
let me then switch and
 

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.270
let me then switch and
- like the economic historian part of

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:04.280
- like the economic historian part of
 

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.309
- like the economic historian part of
this very quickly and just say so why do

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319
this very quickly and just say so why do
 

01:03:06.319 --> 01:03:08.589
this very quickly and just say so why do
we care that the data goes before World

01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599
we care that the data goes before World
 

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:10.870
we care that the data goes before World
War two I mean why isn't it enough to

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880
War two I mean why isn't it enough to
 

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.220
War two I mean why isn't it enough to
just document that it's increased over

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:12.230
just document that it's increased over
 

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:16.930
just document that it's increased over
the last 35 years and I think and I

01:03:16.930 --> 01:03:16.940
the last 35 years and I think and I
 

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.339
the last 35 years and I think and I
think the book serve shows this is that

01:03:18.339 --> 01:03:18.349
think the book serve shows this is that
 

01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:19.900
think the book serve shows this is that
one of the things one of the reasons we

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:19.910
one of the things one of the reasons we
 

01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:22.029
one of the things one of the reasons we
do economic history those few precious

01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:22.039
do economic history those few precious
 

01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:25.240
do economic history those few precious
of us that do it is that is that we feel

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:25.250
of us that do it is that is that we feel
 

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:26.410
of us that do it is that is that we feel
like you know when you study these

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:26.420
like you know when you study these
 

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.940
like you know when you study these
things in the past you get a sense of

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:27.950
things in the past you get a sense of
 

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:29.950
things in the past you get a sense of
the library of options that's available

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960
the library of options that's available
 

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.039
the library of options that's available
to you and just how diverse like

01:03:33.039 --> 01:03:33.049
to you and just how diverse like
 

01:03:33.049 --> 01:03:36.430
to you and just how diverse like
capitalism's can look and so the and

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440
capitalism's can look and so the and
 

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.710
capitalism's can look and so the and
then and then it gives you them ideas

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720
then and then it gives you them ideas
 

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.569
then and then it gives you them ideas
for looking at other things so for

01:03:40.569 --> 01:03:40.579
for looking at other things so for
 

01:03:40.579 --> 01:03:41.980
for looking at other things so for
example the analogies about how the

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:41.990
example the analogies about how the
 

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:44.559
example the analogies about how the
marriage market works in in the late

01:03:44.559 --> 01:03:44.569
marriage market works in in the late
 

01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:46.420
marriage market works in in the late
19th century tells something well is

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:46.430
19th century tells something well is
 

01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:47.859
19th century tells something well is
that how the marriage markets gonna work

01:03:47.859 --> 01:03:47.869
that how the marriage markets gonna work
 

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:50.349
that how the marriage markets gonna work
when you know wealth inequality goes it

01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359
when you know wealth inequality goes it
 

01:03:50.359 --> 01:03:54.250
when you know wealth inequality goes it
goes up now so so that's that's I think

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:54.260
goes up now so so that's that's I think
 

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.720
goes up now so so that's that's I think
it's really great that you learn stuff

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:55.730
it's really great that you learn stuff
 

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:58.900
it's really great that you learn stuff
by you know you've when you run the data

01:03:58.900 --> 01:03:58.910
by you know you've when you run the data
 

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.609
by you know you've when you run the data
set back you sort of then can sort of

01:04:00.609 --> 01:04:00.619
set back you sort of then can sort of
 

01:04:00.619 --> 01:04:01.900
set back you sort of then can sort of
see what are other things about that

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:01.910
see what are other things about that
 

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:03.370
see what are other things about that
time period that looked like the time

01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:03.380
time period that looked like the time
 

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.660
time period that looked like the time
period where the data looks like that

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:04.670
period where the data looks like that
 

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:09.430
period where the data looks like that
like looked like that again and and so

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440
like looked like that again and and so
 

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.589
like looked like that again and and so
but but then what that also tells us is

01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599
but but then what that also tells us is
 

01:04:11.599 --> 01:04:12.940
but but then what that also tells us is
that what does the late 19th century

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:12.950
that what does the late 19th century
 

01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:15.609
that what does the late 19th century
look like in terms of its in terms of

01:04:15.609 --> 01:04:15.619
look like in terms of its in terms of
 

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:18.910
look like in terms of its in terms of
instance of its institutions and if it

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920
instance of its institutions and if it
 

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.220
instance of its institutions and if it
looks like in the north and in the south

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:21.230
looks like in the north and in the south
 

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:22.900
looks like in the north and in the south
it looks like an incredible period of

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:22.910
it looks like an incredible period of
 

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:25.930
it looks like an incredible period of
conflict actually that like the the US

01:04:25.930 --> 01:04:25.940
conflict actually that like the the US
 

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:27.609
conflict actually that like the the US
military is deployed more times on

01:04:27.609 --> 01:04:27.619
military is deployed more times on
 

01:04:27.619 --> 01:04:29.620
military is deployed more times on
foreign on US soil in the late 19th

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:29.630
foreign on US soil in the late 19th
 

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:32.769
foreign on US soil in the late 19th
century to brake strikes then until you

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:32.779
century to brake strikes then until you
 

01:04:32.779 --> 01:04:34.990
century to brake strikes then until you
know then ever in the period of time the

01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000
know then ever in the period of time the
 

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.870
know then ever in the period of time the
the south is sort of run by you know

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880
the south is sort of run by you know
 

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.779
the south is sort of run by you know
essentially a it's essentially an

01:04:40.779 --> 01:04:40.789
essentially a it's essentially an
 

01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:45.849
essentially a it's essentially an
apartheid state and so that that that is

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:45.859
apartheid state and so that that that is
 

01:04:45.859 --> 01:04:48.279
apartheid state and so that that that is
sort of what the costs of inequality

01:04:48.279 --> 01:04:48.289
sort of what the costs of inequality
 

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:51.460
sort of what the costs of inequality
look like is just open warfare and one

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:51.470
look like is just open warfare and one
 

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:53.740
look like is just open warfare and one
dimension and if you don't get it if it

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:53.750
dimension and if you don't get it if it
 

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.150
dimension and if you don't get it if it
doesn't go up into open warfare means

01:04:55.150 --> 01:04:55.160
doesn't go up into open warfare means
 

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.130
doesn't go up into open warfare means
that you're spending a lot of resources

01:04:57.130 --> 01:04:57.140
that you're spending a lot of resources
 

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:59.019
that you're spending a lot of resources
trying to prevent that open warfare and

01:04:59.019 --> 01:04:59.029
trying to prevent that open warfare and
 

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:01.569
trying to prevent that open warfare and
so that's just wasteful even if you

01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:01.579
so that's just wasteful even if you
 

01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:03.339
so that's just wasteful even if you
don't see it so the idea that like if

01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:03.349
don't see it so the idea that like if
 

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:05.380
don't see it so the idea that like if
inequality then winds up with a whole

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:05.390
inequality then winds up with a whole
 

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.029
inequality then winds up with a whole
bunch of speed people spending a lot of

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039
bunch of speed people spending a lot of
 

01:05:07.039 --> 01:05:08.980
bunch of speed people spending a lot of
money on gated enclaves and security

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:08.990
money on gated enclaves and security
 

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:11.380
money on gated enclaves and security
guards that that's like a social cost of

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:11.390
guards that that's like a social cost of
 

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:13.269
guards that that's like a social cost of
this that's gonna that we're going to

01:05:13.269 --> 01:05:13.279
this that's gonna that we're going to
 

01:05:13.279 --> 01:05:15.310
this that's gonna that we're going to
going to sort of

01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:15.320
going to sort of
 

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:22.000
going to sort of
um so let me sort of also say one last

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:22.010
um so let me sort of also say one last
 

01:05:22.010 --> 01:05:24.220
um so let me sort of also say one last
thing that that that but I think the

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:24.230
thing that that that but I think the
 

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:26.170
thing that that that but I think the
analogy also breaks down in that just we

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:26.180
analogy also breaks down in that just we
 

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.760
analogy also breaks down in that just we
right now live in a society that's way

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:27.770
right now live in a society that's way
 

01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:29.650
right now live in a society that's way
more marketized than anything in the

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:29.660
more marketized than anything in the
 

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.570
more marketized than anything in the
19th century there's much more stuff

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:31.580
19th century there's much more stuff
 

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.890
19th century there's much more stuff
that just you can buy and sell on

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:32.900
that just you can buy and sell on
 

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.780
that just you can buy and sell on
markets and that actually I think

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:34.790
markets and that actually I think
 

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.550
markets and that actually I think
interacts with inequality in a much more

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:36.560
interacts with inequality in a much more
 

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.830
interacts with inequality in a much more
menacing way in that like when you can

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:38.840
menacing way in that like when you can
 

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.120
menacing way in that like when you can
put more stuff on the market that means

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:40.130
put more stuff on the market that means
 

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:42.070
put more stuff on the market that means
what you can get with a dollar is a lot

01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:42.080
what you can get with a dollar is a lot
 

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.190
what you can get with a dollar is a lot
higher so in a way that the less

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200
higher so in a way that the less
 

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.650
higher so in a way that the less
commodified society has a much like

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:47.660
commodified society has a much like
 

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.810
commodified society has a much like
wealth doesn't get you as much as a

01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:49.820
wealth doesn't get you as much as a
 

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.730
wealth doesn't get you as much as a
society that puts way more on the market

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:51.740
society that puts way more on the market
 

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.620
society that puts way more on the market
and so there's this interaction between

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:53.630
and so there's this interaction between
 

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:55.510
and so there's this interaction between
like commodification and just you know

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520
like commodification and just you know
 

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:56.890
like commodification and just you know
saying that the market is the best

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:56.900
saying that the market is the best
 

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.510
saying that the market is the best
institution for allocating stuff and

01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520
institution for allocating stuff and
 

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.640
institution for allocating stuff and
then which if you then have that

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:00.650
then which if you then have that
 

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.800
then which if you then have that
together with a huge inequality of

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:02.810
together with a huge inequality of
 

01:06:02.810 --> 01:06:04.600
together with a huge inequality of
wealth it just makes it that much that

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:04.610
wealth it just makes it that much that
 

01:06:04.610 --> 01:06:06.100
wealth it just makes it that much that
much worse so I think you can think of

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:06.110
much worse so I think you can think of
 

01:06:06.110 --> 01:06:08.440
much worse so I think you can think of
one of the antidotes to inequality is

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:08.450
one of the antidotes to inequality is
 

01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:10.480
one of the antidotes to inequality is
actually taking stuff off the market and

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:10.490
actually taking stuff off the market and
 

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:12.490
actually taking stuff off the market and
allocating it according it to different

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:12.500
allocating it according it to different
 

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:17.620
allocating it according it to different
principles ok so I was going to say

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:17.630
principles ok so I was going to say
 

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:19.450
principles ok so I was going to say
something about political constituencies

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:19.460
something about political constituencies
 

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.330
something about political constituencies
and actually offer that like immigration

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:22.340
and actually offer that like immigration
 

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.750
and actually offer that like immigration
is partly maybe our one one great hope

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760
is partly maybe our one one great hope
 

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.730
is partly maybe our one one great hope
for both the economic reasons of raising

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:27.740
for both the economic reasons of raising
 

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:31.780
for both the economic reasons of raising
the growth rate that like an for some of

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:31.790
the growth rate that like an for some of
 

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.580
the growth rate that like an for some of
the studies development also that you

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:33.590
the studies development also that you
 

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.230
the studies development also that you
know when you think of the library of

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240
know when you think of the library of
 

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.060
know when you think of the library of
options for getting poor people out of

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:37.070
options for getting poor people out of
 

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:38.860
options for getting poor people out of
their circumstances opening the borders

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:38.870
their circumstances opening the borders
 

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.810
their circumstances opening the borders
sort of one of the best things you can

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:40.820
sort of one of the best things you can
 

01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.720
sort of one of the best things you can
do and and then I think in terms of

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:43.730
do and and then I think in terms of
 

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.430
do and and then I think in terms of
raising the demographic growth rate

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440
raising the demographic growth rate
 

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.470
raising the demographic growth rate
raising the overall growth rate in the

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480
raising the overall growth rate in the
 

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.880
raising the overall growth rate in the
core countries that's certainly

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:48.890
core countries that's certainly
 

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.340
core countries that's certainly
something that's kept the u.s. equal

01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:50.350
something that's kept the u.s. equal
 

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.600
something that's kept the u.s. equal
historically but then I also want to

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:52.610
historically but then I also want to
 

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.430
historically but then I also want to
suggest that politically these are the

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440
suggest that politically these are the
 

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:57.760
suggest that politically these are the
people that might actually be the the

01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:57.770
people that might actually be the the
 

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:00.160
people that might actually be the the
that the young Restless people of the

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:00.170
that the young Restless people of the
 

01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:01.570
that the young Restless people of the
developing world are sort of where the

01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:01.580
developing world are sort of where the
 

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:04.480
developing world are sort of where the
political energy for redistribution at

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:04.490
political energy for redistribution at
 

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:05.770
political energy for redistribution at
the world level is going to come from

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:05.780
the world level is going to come from
 

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:09.070
the world level is going to come from
and that I think this was the case in

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:09.080
and that I think this was the case in
 

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.840
and that I think this was the case in
the 19th century was that basically a

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:10.850
the 19th century was that basically a
 

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:12.160
the 19th century was that basically a
lot of political movements in the u.s.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:12.170
lot of political movements in the u.s.
 

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:16.960
lot of political movements in the u.s.
were born out of immigration and and so

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:16.970
were born out of immigration and and so
 

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:20.410
were born out of immigration and and so
I think that's that that sort of the the

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:20.420
I think that's that that sort of the the
 

01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:23.080
I think that's that that sort of the the
that there's not just an economic sort

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:23.090
that there's not just an economic sort
 

01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:26.110
that there's not just an economic sort
of payout reason to sort of think about

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:26.120
of payout reason to sort of think about
 

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:27.920
of payout reason to sort of think about
expanding immigration

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:27.930
expanding immigration
 

01:07:27.930 --> 01:07:30.170
expanding immigration
as a totally equally politically

01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180
as a totally equally politically
 

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.570
as a totally equally politically
infeasible margin just like a global

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:32.580
infeasible margin just like a global
 

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.600
infeasible margin just like a global
wealth tax but is another sort of way to

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:35.610
wealth tax but is another sort of way to
 

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:37.640
wealth tax but is another sort of way to
to sort of encounter some of these

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:37.650
to sort of encounter some of these
 

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:57.609
to sort of encounter some of these
problems at least in the short run

01:07:57.609 --> 01:07:57.619
 

01:07:57.619 --> 01:08:01.520
okay so maybe tomorrow you could you

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:01.530
okay so maybe tomorrow you could you
 

01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:03.170
okay so maybe tomorrow you could you
know pick some of the questions there

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.180
know pick some of the questions there
 

01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:04.970
know pick some of the questions there
were too many questions by the panelists

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980
were too many questions by the panelists
 

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.500
were too many questions by the panelists
for you to answer but one or two

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:06.510
for you to answer but one or two
 

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:07.970
for you to answer but one or two
questions that you want to answer so

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980
questions that you want to answer so
 

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:12.560
questions that you want to answer so
that we can have time - yeah so you know

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:12.570
that we can have time - yeah so you know
 

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.540
that we can have time - yeah so you know
let me go very quickly you know thanks a

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:14.550
let me go very quickly you know thanks a
 

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:16.640
let me go very quickly you know thanks a
lot to the three of you for all those

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:16.650
lot to the three of you for all those
 

01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:19.059
lot to the three of you for all those
comments you know I really agree with

01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:19.069
comments you know I really agree with
 

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:21.170
comments you know I really agree with
pretty much everything you know I think

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:21.180
pretty much everything you know I think
 

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:23.900
pretty much everything you know I think
it's a you know in particular you know

01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:23.910
it's a you know in particular you know
 

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:27.559
it's a you know in particular you know
all these different policy tools that

01:08:27.559 --> 01:08:27.569
all these different policy tools that
 

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.860
all these different policy tools that
have been that you have been referring

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:30.870
have been that you have been referring
 

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:32.200
have been that you have been referring
to you know I think they are all

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:32.210
to you know I think they are all
 

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:34.249
to you know I think they are all
complimentary you know it's not we don't

01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259
complimentary you know it's not we don't
 

01:08:34.259 --> 01:08:36.079
complimentary you know it's not we don't
have to choose between a minimum wage

01:08:36.079 --> 01:08:36.089
have to choose between a minimum wage
 

01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:40.370
have to choose between a minimum wage
and you know progressive well stacks you

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380
and you know progressive well stacks you
 

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.050
and you know progressive well stacks you
know we don't have to choose between the

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060
know we don't have to choose between the
 

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.570
know we don't have to choose between the
pattern flow and the union and about you

01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580
pattern flow and the union and about you
 

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.880
pattern flow and the union and about you
know so you know I think these are all

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:46.890
know so you know I think these are all
 

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.360

complementary they do different things

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:49.370
complementary they do different things
 

01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:52.490
complementary they do different things
and and you know but you know the reason

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500
and and you know but you know the reason
 

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.519
and and you know but you know the reason
why so maybe let me still say a few

01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:55.529
why so maybe let me still say a few
 

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:57.110
why so maybe let me still say a few

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:09.410
would be the constituency that would be
interested in that you know certainly

u.s. own 2% of national wealth now they
 

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:25.130
u.s. own 2% of national wealth now they
don't vote that much but you know the

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140
don't vote that much but you know the
 

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:28.970
don't vote that much but you know the
next 40 percent they own 22 percent of

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980
next 40 percent they own 22 percent of
 

01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:30.950
next 40 percent they own 22 percent of
national wealth and they've got a lot

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960
national wealth and they've got a lot
 

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:34.309
national wealth and they've got a lot
more and and and for this ninety percent

01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319
more and and and for this ninety percent
 

01:09:34.319 --> 01:09:35.780
more and and and for this ninety percent
of the population you know I think

01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:35.790
of the population you know I think
 

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.930
of the population you know I think
finding a way to reduce their tax burden

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940
finding a way to reduce their tax burden
 

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.479
finding a way to reduce their tax burden
and in particular the property tax and

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:41.489
and in particular the property tax and
 

01:09:41.489 --> 01:09:43.550
and in particular the property tax and
you know I think many people have seen

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560
you know I think many people have seen
 

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.789
you know I think many people have seen
you know in the in the recent crisis

01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799
you know in the in the recent crisis
 

01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:48.349
you know in the in the recent crisis
that you know you have some people whose

01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359
that you know you have some people whose
 

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:50.749
that you know you have some people whose
property value is below the Ahmad range

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759
property value is below the Ahmad range
 

01:09:50.759 --> 01:09:53.240
property value is below the Ahmad range
and still this pays the same property

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:53.250
and still this pays the same property
 

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:56.060
and still this pays the same property
taxes as people who have no mortgage at

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:56.070
taxes as people who have no mortgage at
 

01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.979
taxes as people who have no mortgage at
all and possibly they buy more property

01:09:57.979 --> 01:09:57.989
all and possibly they buy more property
 

01:09:57.989 --> 01:09:59.450
all and possibly they buy more property
tax and someone was lots of financial

01:09:59.450 --> 01:09:59.460
tax and someone was lots of financial
 

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:00.280
tax and someone was lots of financial
assets

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:00.290
assets
 

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:03.200
assets
the smallest part of robots value so you

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:03.210
the smallest part of robots value so you
 

01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:06.230
the smallest part of robots value so you
know it's a the old system of property

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:06.240
know it's a the old system of property
 

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:08.960
know it's a the old system of property
taxation that we have comes from the

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:08.970
taxation that we have comes from the
 

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:11.090
taxation that we have comes from the
19th century at a time where property

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:11.100
19th century at a time where property
 

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.640
19th century at a time where property
was real estate that was very rich in

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:13.650
was real estate that was very rich in
 

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:15.650
was real estate that was very rich in
financial assets and an immediate

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660
financial assets and an immediate
 

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.570
financial assets and an immediate
financial debt and I think it's just not

01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:17.580
financial debt and I think it's just not
 

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:20.870
financial debt and I think it's just not
adequate to the structure of wealth and

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880
adequate to the structure of wealth and
 

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.180
adequate to the structure of wealth and
we have today and if we want to promote

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:23.190
we have today and if we want to promote
 

01:10:23.190 --> 01:10:25.010
we have today and if we want to promote
broader access to wealth you know I

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020
broader access to wealth you know I
 

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:28.130
broader access to wealth you know I
think there's a constituency of you know

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140
think there's a constituency of you know
 

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.930
think there's a constituency of you know
lots of people who would like to become

01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940
lots of people who would like to become
 

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:32.090
lots of people who would like to become
owners and accurate wealth and we've you

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100
owners and accurate wealth and we've you
 

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.430
owners and accurate wealth and we've you
know face difficulties so I think the

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440
know face difficulties so I think the
 

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.910
know face difficulties so I think the
right way to to I think to defend this

01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920
right way to to I think to defend this
 

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.370
right way to to I think to defend this
politically will be to stress you know

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380
politically will be to stress you know
 

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.650
politically will be to stress you know
all the people that will pay less tax

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:42.660
all the people that will pay less tax
 

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:44.750
all the people that will pay less tax
and that will you know be able to access

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760
and that will you know be able to access
 

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.930
and that will you know be able to access
wealth rather than simply those who will

01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:47.940
wealth rather than simply those who will
 

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.570
wealth rather than simply those who will
pay more so of course those who pay more

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:49.580
pay more so of course those who pay more
 

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:52.250
pay more so of course those who pay more
you know scream and say that this is too

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260
you know scream and say that this is too
 

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:55.460
you know scream and say that this is too
much but you know if they are you know

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:55.470
much but you know if they are you know
 

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:57.500
much but you know if they are you know
rising three times as fast as the size

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:57.510
rising three times as fast as the size
 

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:59.650
rising three times as fast as the size
of the economy you know you cannot

01:10:59.650 --> 01:10:59.660
of the economy you know you cannot
 

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:02.200
of the economy you know you cannot
pretend too much that you are about to

01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.210
pretend too much that you are about to
 

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:06.230
pretend too much that you are about to
die or disappear you know so so but now

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:06.240
die or disappear you know so so but now
 

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.880
die or disappear you know so so but now
you know the best Wells grant you know

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:07.890
you know the best Wells grant you know
 

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:10.190
you know the best Wells grant you know
this is these are interesting ideas you

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:10.200
this is these are interesting ideas you
 

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.260
this is these are interesting ideas you
know is that will be like negative well

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:12.270
know is that will be like negative well
 

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:13.940
know is that will be like negative well
stacks for people who have zero wealth

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:13.950
stacks for people who have zero wealth
 

01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:16.340
stacks for people who have zero wealth
so this is making the well stacks even

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:16.350
so this is making the well stacks even
 

01:11:16.350 --> 01:11:18.200
so this is making the well stacks even
more progressive in a way I mean but

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:18.210
more progressive in a way I mean but
 

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.240
more progressive in a way I mean but
it's slightly different approach but

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:20.250
it's slightly different approach but
 

01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:22.760
it's slightly different approach but
again this is complementary and you know

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:22.770
again this is complementary and you know
 

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:26.300
again this is complementary and you know
I am very I am very open about that you

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:26.310
I am very I am very open about that you
 

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:27.920
I am very I am very open about that you
know I'm not it's not that you know as

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:27.930
know I'm not it's not that you know as
 

01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.810
know I'm not it's not that you know as
if I you know I know exactly the kind of

01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:31.820
if I you know I know exactly the kind of
 

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:36.410
if I you know I know exactly the kind of
you know approach to making Wells more

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420
you know approach to making Wells more
 

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.600
you know approach to making Wells more
in Poland and making you know increasing

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:38.610
in Poland and making you know increasing
 

01:11:38.610 --> 01:11:40.910
in Poland and making you know increasing
wealth mobility certainly can be done

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920
wealth mobility certainly can be done
 

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:45.100
wealth mobility certainly can be done
with you know large variety of option

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:45.110
with you know large variety of option
 

01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:51.440
with you know large variety of option
yes let me pick one or two issues you

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:51.450
yes let me pick one or two issues you
 

01:11:51.450 --> 01:11:54.160
yes let me pick one or two issues you
know migration can raise the growth rate

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:54.170
know migration can raise the growth rate
 

01:11:54.170 --> 01:11:56.900
know migration can raise the growth rate
yes now I mean this has been the way for

01:11:56.900 --> 01:11:56.910
yes now I mean this has been the way for
 

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.000
yes now I mean this has been the way for
for America to raise its growth rate and

01:11:59.000 --> 01:11:59.010
for America to raise its growth rate and
 

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:01.250
for America to raise its growth rate and
you know you could have you know the

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260
you know you could have you know the
 

01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:03.530
you know you could have you know the
entire planet could move to America and

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540
entire planet could move to America and
 

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.060
entire planet could move to America and
you know I think this is what US

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:05.070
you know I think this is what US
 

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.370
you know I think this is what US
universities would like to do with

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:07.380
universities would like to do with
 

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:10.070
universities would like to do with
academics you know but now the problem

01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:10.080
academics you know but now the problem
 

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.110
academics you know but now the problem
is that if we all move to America then

01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120
is that if we all move to America then
 

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:12.520
is that if we all move to America then
we will

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:12.530
we will
 

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.650
we will
the same problem of our bigger than G to

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:14.660
the same problem of our bigger than G to
 

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.800
the same problem of our bigger than G to
solve in America so you know this is not

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:16.810
solve in America so you know this is not
 

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:19.600
solve in America so you know this is not
you know or unless we all have more

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:19.610
you know or unless we all have more
 

01:12:19.610 --> 01:12:21.460
you know or unless we all have more
children when we are in America but you

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:21.470
children when we are in America but you
 

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:23.470
children when we are in America but you
know it's at the end of the day

01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480
know it's at the end of the day
 

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.390
know it's at the end of the day
migration you know it's very important

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400
migration you know it's very important
 

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.130
migration you know it's very important
but that's not solving in the long run

01:12:27.130 --> 01:12:27.140
but that's not solving in the long run
 

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.650
but that's not solving in the long run
our energy problem but this is buying

01:12:29.650 --> 01:12:29.660
our energy problem but this is buying
 

01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.620
our energy problem but this is buying
time and you know in America buying tank

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:32.630
time and you know in America buying tank
 

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.660
time and you know in America buying tank

the question the best way would be to

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780
the question the best way would be to
 

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.860
the question the best way would be to
you know go to the mic and ask questions

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:51.870
you know go to the mic and ask questions
 

01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:53.689
you know go to the mic and ask questions
directly to Tama you can maybe either

01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699
directly to Tama you can maybe either
 

01:15:53.699 --> 01:16:17.400
directly to Tama you can maybe either
stand up here and speak in the mic

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:17.410
 

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.370
so actually for the sake of saving a

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:21.380
so actually for the sake of saving a
 

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.020
so actually for the sake of saving a
little time maybe we're going to take

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.030
little time maybe we're going to take
 

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:24.820
little time maybe we're going to take
three questions at a time and then

01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:24.830
three questions at a time and then
 

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:25.900
three questions at a time and then
tomorrow we'll answer three questions

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:25.910
tomorrow we'll answer three questions
 

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:27.760
tomorrow we'll answer three questions
and that would might make things it's

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:27.770
and that would might make things it's
 

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:28.810
and that would might make things it's
all faster

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:28.820
all faster
 

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.740
all faster

that it's going to be depressed and this
 

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.580
that it's going to be depressed and this
is why the recovery has been so slow and

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:06.590
is why the recovery has been so slow and
 

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:07.840
is why the recovery has been so slow and
I was wondering whether you've thought

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:07.850
I was wondering whether you've thought
 

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:10.660
I was wondering whether you've thought
much about how your work on our being

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:10.670
much about how your work on our being
 

01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:11.890
much about how your work on our being
greater than G and our being rather

01:17:11.890 --> 01:17:11.900
greater than G and our being rather
 

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.350
greater than G and our being rather

had made about secular stagnation I'm

curious what you might advise President

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:25.450
curious what you might advise President
 

01:17:25.450 --> 01:17:37.900
curious what you might advise President

you know rising return to capital now
regarding the return to capital and the

know I think it's important to realize
 

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:07.630
know I think it's important to realize
that the rate of return to capital is so

01:18:07.630 --> 01:18:07.640
that the rate of return to capital is so
 

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.370
that the rate of return to capital is so
much broader of concepts and just

01:18:09.370 --> 01:18:09.380
much broader of concepts and just
 

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.800
much broader of concepts and just
interest rate and public debt so you

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:11.810
interest rate and public debt so you
 

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:13.660
interest rate and public debt so you
know when we see the top of the wealth

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:13.670
know when we see the top of the wealth
 

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:16.090

you know presumably they don't have
 

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:24.790
you know presumably they don't have
Treasury bonds in their portfolio so you

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800
Treasury bonds in their portfolio so you
 

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.950
Treasury bonds in their portfolio so you
know looking at the interest rate and

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960
know looking at the interest rate and
 

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:27.740
know looking at the interest rate and

01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:27.750

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:29.540

is very interesting for a number of

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:29.550
is very interesting for a number of
 

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:31.250
is very interesting for a number of
purposes but you know this is not the

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:31.260
purposes but you know this is not the
 

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.530
purposes but you know this is not the
return to capital because public debt is

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:33.540
return to capital because public debt is
 

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.990
return to capital because public debt is
only one part of the assets that people

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000
only one part of the assets that people
 

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.850
only one part of the assets that people
have and in fact it's not such a big

01:18:37.850 --> 01:18:37.860
have and in fact it's not such a big
 

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.800
have and in fact it's not such a big
asset you know as compared to you know

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:39.810
asset you know as compared to you know
 

01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:41.780
asset you know as compared to you know
equity on the stock market or real

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:41.790

01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:43.210

estate and you know sophisticated

01:18:43.210 --> 01:18:43.220
estate and you know sophisticated
 

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:47.810
estate and you know sophisticated
financial assets so I guess the right

01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820
financial assets so I guess the right
 

01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:50.630
financial assets so I guess the right
way to look at the problem is to look at

01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:50.640
way to look at the problem is to look at
 

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.000
way to look at the problem is to look at
the evolution of the capital shares in

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:53.010
the evolution of the capital shares in
 

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:55.880
the evolution of the capital shares in
GDP so the capital share measures all

01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:55.890
GDP so the capital share measures all
 

01:18:55.890 --> 01:18:57.950
GDP so the capital share measures all
the income that goes to capital so this

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960
the income that goes to capital so this
 

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.750
the income that goes to capital so this
includes interest payment but it also

01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760
includes interest payment but it also
 

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.920
includes interest payment but it also
includes dividends corporate profits

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:02.930
includes dividends corporate profits
 

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:06.710
includes dividends corporate profits
rent rental income and and this is

01:19:06.710 --> 01:19:06.720
rent rental income and and this is
 

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.630
rent rental income and and this is
certainly not funny so you know if the

01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640
certainly not funny so you know if the
 

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.790
certainly not funny so you know if the
problem that some of the scribe you know

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800
problem that some of the scribe you know
 

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:12.380
problem that some of the scribe you know
whether the rate of return of capital

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:12.390
whether the rate of return of capital
 

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:14.210
whether the rate of return of capital
goes to zero you know the capital share

01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:14.220
goes to zero you know the capital share
 

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:15.590
goes to zero you know the capital share
should go to zero and you know

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600
should go to zero and you know
 

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.030
should go to zero and you know
apparently the capital share is not

01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040
apparently the capital share is not
 

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.530
apparently the capital share is not
going to zero at all you know it has

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540
going to zero at all you know it has
 

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:23.060
going to zero at all you know it has
been rising in industrialized countries

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:23.070
been rising in industrialized countries
 

01:19:23.070 --> 01:19:25.100
been rising in industrialized countries
you know over the past thirty years and

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:25.110
you know over the past thirty years and
 

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:27.950
you know over the past thirty years and
in fact across the world now what is

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960
in fact across the world now what is
 

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.110
in fact across the world now what is
true though and where some of us is

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120
true though and where some of us is
 

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.570
true though and where some of us is
partly right is that the rise in the

01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580
partly right is that the rise in the
 

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.760
partly right is that the rise in the
capital share has been less stronger

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:34.770
capital share has been less stronger
 

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.370
capital share has been less stronger
than the rise in the capital to income

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:37.380
than the rise in the capital to income
 

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.470
than the rise in the capital to income
ratio which means that the rate of

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480
ratio which means that the rate of
 

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.350
ratio which means that the rate of
return indeed has declined somewhat but

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360
return indeed has declined somewhat but
 

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.810
return indeed has declined somewhat but
it has declined less than the increase

01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820
it has declined less than the increase
 

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:47.270
it has declined less than the increase
in the quantity of capital so that the

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280
in the quantity of capital so that the
 

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.010
in the quantity of capital so that the
capital share which is a product of the

01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020
capital share which is a product of the
 

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:51.860
capital share which is a product of the
two as actually increased but still it

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:51.870
two as actually increased but still it
 

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.660
two as actually increased but still it
is true that when you accumulate more

01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:53.670
is true that when you accumulate more
 

01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:55.160
is true that when you accumulate more
capital you know the rate of return as

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:55.170
capital you know the rate of return as
 

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:56.960
capital you know the rate of return as
to fall somewhat you know the question

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:56.970
to fall somewhat you know the question
 

01:19:56.970 --> 01:19:59.570
to fall somewhat you know the question
is does it for more or less in

01:19:59.570 --> 01:19:59.580
is does it for more or less in
 

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.460
is does it for more or less in
proportions and the rise in the quantity

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:01.470
proportions and the rise in the quantity
 

01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:03.080
proportions and the rise in the quantity
and the evidence at least in the past

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:03.090
and the evidence at least in the past
 

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:04.640
and the evidence at least in the past
circles does it fell less than the

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:04.650
circles does it fell less than the
 

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:07.820
circles does it fell less than the
increase in the quantity now what's

01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:07.830
increase in the quantity now what's
 

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:09.200
increase in the quantity now what's
going to happen in the future you know

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:09.210
going to happen in the future you know
 

01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:12.140
going to happen in the future you know
what I think some of the very large

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:12.150
what I think some of the very large
 

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:14.210
what I think some of the very large
discrepancies that we observe in in

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:14.220
discrepancies that we observe in in
 

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.600
discrepancies that we observe in in
between interest rate and rate of return

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:16.610
between interest rate and rate of return
 

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:19.580
between interest rate and rate of return
have to do of course with our monetary

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:19.590
have to do of course with our monetary
 

01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:21.500
have to do of course with our monetary
policy and what central banks have been

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:21.510
policy and what central banks have been
 

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:22.880
policy and what central banks have been
doing in the past few years is the

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:22.890
doing in the past few years is the
 

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:25.310
doing in the past few years is the
crisis and you know I think generally

01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320
crisis and you know I think generally
 

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:25.930
crisis and you know I think generally

speaking
 

01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:28.180
speaking
probably we

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:28.190
probably we
 

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.370
probably we
you know we have been asking too much to

01:20:30.370 --> 01:20:30.380
you know we have been asking too much to
 

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.470
you know we have been asking too much to

there's this question applies to all of
you which is I don't expect academics or

01:24:14.260 --> 01:24:14.270
you which is I don't expect academics or
 

01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:16.930
you which is I don't expect academics or
any of you to actually be prescriptive

01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:16.940
any of you to actually be prescriptive
 

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.310
any of you to actually be prescriptive
in your in your way of engaging in this

in your in your way of engaging in this
 

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:25.090
in your in your way of engaging in this
dialogue about inequality but what I

01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:25.100
dialogue about inequality but what I
 

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.820
dialogue about inequality but what I
think is I notice throughout all the

01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:27.830
think is I notice throughout all the
 

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:30.370
think is I notice throughout all the
comments and as well as professor

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:30.380
comments and as well as professor

piketty's book two is this reluctance to

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:33.050
piketty's book two is this reluctance to
 

01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:35.230
piketty's book two is this reluctance to
actually just say we know what the

01:24:35.230 --> 01:24:35.240
actually just say we know what the
 

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.030
actually just say we know what the
problem is we've seen what the problem

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:37.040
problem is we've seen what the problem
 

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:39.250
problem is we've seen what the problem
is and this is what we think should

01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:39.260
is and this is what we think should
 

01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.770
is and this is what we think should
happen it said what I keep saying is

01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:41.780
happen it said what I keep saying is
 

01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.700
happen it said what I keep saying is
this well if we do this then those who

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:45.710
this well if we do this then those who
 

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.290
this well if we do this then those who
own the means of wealth might actually

01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:47.300
own the means of wealth might actually
 

01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:50.200
own the means of wealth might actually
turn on us and do that or if we try this

01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:50.210
turn on us and do that or if we try this
 

01:24:50.210 --> 01:24:53.190
turn on us and do that or if we try this
possibility they might do this is there

01:24:53.190 --> 01:24:53.200
possibility they might do this is there
 

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:54.860
possibility they might do this is there
I'm wondering

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:54.870
I'm wondering
 

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:57.470
I'm wondering
if there's a responsibility to actually

01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480
if there's a responsibility to actually
 

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:00.740
if there's a responsibility to actually
just come out and say listen 90% of

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:00.750
just come out and say listen 90% of
 

01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:03.020
just come out and say listen 90% of
people are in this position 10% of

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:03.030
people are in this position 10% of
 

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:05.240
people are in this position 10% of
people own this much and we need to

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:05.250
people own this much and we need to
 

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:07.370
people own this much and we need to
reverse this trend and something needs

01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380
reverse this trend and something needs
 

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:09.650
reverse this trend and something needs
to be done and this is it it may not be

01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:09.660
to be done and this is it it may not be
 

01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:12.080
to be done and this is it it may not be
the one single solution but maybe

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:12.090
the one single solution but maybe
 

01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:13.850
the one single solution but maybe
somebody needs to get up seize the

01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860
somebody needs to get up seize the
 

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.190
somebody needs to get up seize the
capital and do something for those who

01:25:16.190 --> 01:25:16.200
capital and do something for those who
 

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.290
capital and do something for those who
are at the bottom so to many sort of

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300
are at the bottom so to many sort of
 

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.260
are at the bottom so to many sort of
like putting it under the table or

01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:21.270
like putting it under the table or
 

01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:23.570
like putting it under the table or
whether this will work we actually know

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580
whether this will work we actually know
 

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.910
whether this will work we actually know
to some extent watching the history

01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920
to some extent watching the history
 

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.980
to some extent watching the history
looking at the history we know at

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:27.990
looking at the history we know at
 

01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:31.100
looking at the history we know at
moments what the taxes were hide help

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:31.110
moments what the taxes were hide help
 

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:33.290
moments what the taxes were hide help
redistribute wealth how it helps some

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300
redistribute wealth how it helps some
 

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.110
redistribute wealth how it helps some
classes of people and we know at some

01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120
classes of people and we know at some
 

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:38.750
classes of people and we know at some
moments who eventually use their own

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760
moments who eventually use their own
 

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.670
moments who eventually use their own
political power to take back that wealth

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:40.680
political power to take back that wealth
 

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.100
political power to take back that wealth
right I'm thinking of Mellon being the

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:43.110
right I'm thinking of Mellon being the
 

01:25:43.110 --> 01:25:47.450
right I'm thinking of Mellon being the
the secretary or at one point you know

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460
the secretary or at one point you know
 

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:50.150
the secretary or at one point you know
before the Great Depression so my

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:50.160
before the Great Depression so my
 

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.360
before the Great Depression so my
question is can we if you're gonna

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:53.370
question is can we if you're gonna
 

01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:57.260
question is can we if you're gonna
propose an 80% tell solution in terms of

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:57.270
propose an 80% tell solution in terms of
 

01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:59.720
propose an 80% tell solution in terms of
taxing wealth can we just say oh maybe

01:25:59.720 --> 01:25:59.730
taxing wealth can we just say oh maybe
 

01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:02.930
taxing wealth can we just say oh maybe
can we just say actually I think that's

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:02.940
can we just say actually I think that's
 

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:04.720
can we just say actually I think that's
what needs to be done rather than

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:04.730
what needs to be done rather than
 

01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:07.970
what needs to be done rather than
actually I'm kind of pessimistic but I'm

01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980
actually I'm kind of pessimistic but I'm
 

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:09.800
actually I'm kind of pessimistic but I'm
gonna propose it anyway so more

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:09.810
gonna propose it anyway so more
 

01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:11.990
gonna propose it anyway so more
resolution to some extent is what I'm

01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000
resolution to some extent is what I'm
 

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.240
resolution to some extent is what I'm
asking are you willing to provide a

01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:14.250
asking are you willing to provide a
 

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:17.300
asking are you willing to provide a
resolution that does not dance around

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:17.310
resolution that does not dance around
 

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:24.140
resolution that does not dance around
the question my question touches on the

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:24.150
the question my question touches on the
 

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:26.510
the question my question touches on the
first question that was asked and as

01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520
first question that was asked and as
 

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.940
first question that was asked and as
well as something that serration I just

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:28.950
well as something that serration I just
 

01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:30.770
well as something that serration I just
said earlier which was about the the

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780
said earlier which was about the the
 

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:32.540
said earlier which was about the the
relationship of inequality to conflict

01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:32.550
relationship of inequality to conflict
 

01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:35.150
relationship of inequality to conflict
to social instability you know which

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:35.160
to social instability you know which
 

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:37.040
to social instability you know which
which we saw so much of in the 19th

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:37.050
which we saw so much of in the 19th
 

01:26:37.050 --> 01:26:39.020
which we saw so much of in the 19th
century I've been out of school for a

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:39.030
century I've been out of school for a
 

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:40.190
century I've been out of school for a
while so it'll be difficult for me to

01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:40.200
while so it'll be difficult for me to
 

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:43.160
while so it'll be difficult for me to
footnote this this this statement but I

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:43.170
footnote this this this statement but I
 

01:26:43.170 --> 01:26:45.650
footnote this this this statement but I
I remember reading in it of a in a in a

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:45.660
I remember reading in it of a in a in a
 

01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.750
I remember reading in it of a in a in a
development economics class that they

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760
development economics class that they
 

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:50.150
development economics class that they
could that they that the conflict as a

01:26:50.150 --> 01:26:50.160
could that they that the conflict as a
 

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.980
could that they that the conflict as a
result of inequality is much more likely

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:51.990
result of inequality is much more likely
 

01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:55.060
result of inequality is much more likely
when income and wealth inequality are

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:55.070
when income and wealth inequality are
 

01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:59.690
when income and wealth inequality are
correlated or area are correlated with

01:26:59.690 --> 01:26:59.700
correlated or area are correlated with
 

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.490
correlated or area are correlated with
horizontal inequalities between

01:27:01.490 --> 01:27:01.500
horizontal inequalities between
 

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.190
horizontal inequalities between
inequalities and that already exists

01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:04.200
inequalities and that already exists
 

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.470
inequalities and that already exists
among social groups and inequalities

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480
among social groups and inequalities
 

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.240
among social groups and inequalities
that exist between between described

and I was wondering whether you found

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:11.050
and I was wondering whether you found
 

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:14.110
and I was wondering whether you found
that in your work how that bears upon

01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:14.120
that in your work how that bears upon
 

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.960
that in your work how that bears upon
your work and how that bears upon our

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:16.970
your work and how that bears upon our
 

01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:30.220
your work and how that bears upon our
our future

01:27:30.220 --> 01:27:30.230
 

01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:34.790
okay so um I just I'm gonna come the I'm

01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800
okay so um I just I'm gonna come the I'm
 

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.370
okay so um I just I'm gonna come the I'm
the two questions I think I mean I'm not

01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380
the two questions I think I mean I'm not
 

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:38.780
the two questions I think I mean I'm not
saying that there's going to be conflict

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:38.790
saying that there's going to be conflict
 

01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:40.580
saying that there's going to be conflict
and I'm thinking but if we don't have

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:40.590
and I'm thinking but if we don't have
 

01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:42.170
and I'm thinking but if we don't have
conflict that's going to be because

01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:42.180
conflict that's going to be because
 

01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:43.430
conflict that's going to be because
we're spending a ton of resources

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440
we're spending a ton of resources
 

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.860
we're spending a ton of resources
avoiding and those resources are you

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:45.870
avoiding and those resources are you
 

01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:47.090
avoiding and those resources are you
allowed to go it could be hiring a bunch

01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:47.100
allowed to go it could be hiring a bunch
 

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:54.500
allowed to go it could be hiring a bunch
of economists to like say that we'll be

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:54.510
of economists to like say that we'll be
 

01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:56.780
of economists to like say that we'll be
spending a it'll be it'll be a social

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:56.790
spending a it'll be it'll be a social
 

01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:59.330
spending a it'll be it'll be a social
calm and I'm the sort of last point

01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340
calm and I'm the sort of last point
 

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:02.870
calm and I'm the sort of last point
about race and group inequalities I

01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880
about race and group inequalities I
 

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:05.090
about race and group inequalities I
think it's actually I didn't say this

01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100
think it's actually I didn't say this
 

01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.500
think it's actually I didn't say this
but it I actually think there's an

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:06.510
but it I actually think there's an
 

01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:08.480
but it I actually think there's an
interesting case of our reparations sort

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:08.490
interesting case of our reparations sort
 

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:10.010
interesting case of our reparations sort
of dovetailing with the global wealth

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020
of dovetailing with the global wealth
 

01:28:10.020 --> 01:28:12.500
of dovetailing with the global wealth
