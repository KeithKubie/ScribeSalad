in the 19th century they estimated that
 

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.300
in the 19th century they estimated that
there were about twenty thousand slaves

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:31.310
there were about twenty thousand slaves
 

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:36.320
there were about twenty thousand slaves
per year that were trafficked in the

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:45.830
 

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.580
precedes that date to some degree but

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:49.590
precedes that date to some degree but
 

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:55.580
precedes that date to some degree but
does it go back to 1,200 more recent

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:55.590
does it go back to 1,200 more recent
 

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.539
does it go back to 1,200 more recent

has come up with with hard counts for

00:32:11.899 --> 00:32:11.909
has come up with with hard counts for
 

00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:13.460
has come up with with hard counts for
the numbers of slaves at the Dutch East

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:13.470
the numbers of slaves at the Dutch East

as many as 1500 slaves a year and then

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:28.019
as many as 1500 slaves a year and then
 

00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:29.810
as many as 1500 slaves a year and then
the question is were there other slave

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820
the question is were there other slave
 

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.889
the question is were there other slave
traders who were dealing in vastly

00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:39.509
Dutch and it doesn't appear to be the
 

00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:42.739
Dutch and it doesn't appear to be the

figures have also been developed to show
 

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:31.270
figures have also been developed to show
in the early 1600s again this is a

in the early 1600s again this is a
 

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.360
in the early 1600s again this is a
century after the period of this chapter

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:33.370
century after the period of this chapter
 

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.970
century after the period of this chapter
but I think it was relevant

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:35.980
but I think it was relevant
 

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:42.700
but I think it was relevant
to show that the primary locus of slave

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:42.710
to show that the primary locus of slave
 

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:50.380
to show that the primary locus of slave
residence was in coastal cities but they

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:50.390
residence was in coastal cities but they
 

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.520
residence was in coastal cities but they
were not distributed in the countryside

were not distributed in the countryside
 

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:58.840
were not distributed in the countryside
but there are cities that the Dutch

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:58.850
but there are cities that the Dutch
 

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:04.230
but there are cities that the Dutch
dealt with like Batavia their major

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:18.730
populations that are 40 to 50 percent
slave populations so what what you

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:18.740
slave populations so what what you
 

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:25.020
slave populations so what what you
appear to be seeing is a coastal culture

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:25.030
appear to be seeing is a coastal culture
 

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:30.520

in which slaves are a an important

1600 it appears that most of them don't

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:55.850
1600 it appears that most of them don't
 

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:58.060
1600 it appears that most of them don't
go to the Middle East or India but go to

go to the Middle East or India but go to
 

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.390
go to the Middle East or India but go to
islands in the Indian Ocean

so that islands like the Maldives or

appears that the largest number of

sold into slavery

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280

slavery I think is handled rather poorly
 

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.960
slavery I think is handled rather poorly
in this chapter because the way it looks

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:31.970
in this chapter because the way it looks
 

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:36.720
in this chapter because the way it looks
is that the Indian Ocean is sort of a a

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:36.730

for to be slaves in India and the Middle
 

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:56.560
for to be slaves in India and the Middle
East and perhaps in some cases as far as
