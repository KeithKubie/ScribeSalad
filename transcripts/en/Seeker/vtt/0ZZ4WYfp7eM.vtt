00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.899
We are all family.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:07.930
We are all brothers and sisters.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.500
I’m not getting all new-agey on you, I seriously
mean that.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.150
Hello distant relatives, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.920
Have you ever wondered just how related you
are to a random stranger?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.730
Probably not, but today we’re going to answer
that question anyway.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.580
Genetic diversity is increased in organisms
that reproduce sexually because we combine

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.940
half our genes with half of someone else’s
to get a new mix.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.679
DNA also changes a little from parents to
offspring because when they’re forming,

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.710
sperm and eggs randomly swap genetic code
between the pairs of chromosomes two or three

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.059
times, and then take half of the new, unique
chromosomes.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.960
Obviously how genetically similar you are
to the people you pass on the street has a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.609
lot to do with where you are.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.030
If you live in an area that’s has a lot
of people from diverse backgrounds, or if

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.420
you live somewhere far away from where you
grew up, you’re going to have more genetic

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750
drift than if you live somewhere like Iceland.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.710
Iceland has a population of only 320,000 and
two thirds of those people live in or around

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.350
the capital of Reykjavik.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.840
They’re descendants of Norse and Celtic
settlers from 1,200 years ago, and there hasn’t

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.820
been a lot of new blood since then.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.780
The odds that two Icelandic people are distant
cousins is pretty high; high enough that thousands

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.159
of Icelanders use an app to make sure they’re
not Björking someone they’re going to see

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.799
at a family reunion later.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.570
Sometimes you may share more DNA with someone
because you had an ancestor who was… let’s

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.810
just say “prolific” because it sounds
more scientific than “bang-tastic.”

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.280
Famously about 10% of men living today in
lands the Mongol empire once claimed have

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.880
the Y chromosome of none other than Genghis
Khan.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.720
That translates to 16 million men with the
same Y chromosome.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.159
Seriously, the Mongol empire was huge.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.360
But what about total random strangers from
different parts of the world?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.200
Surely you’re much different than them,
right?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.770
Maybe not, because a 2007 study published
in Genetics compared a group of europeans

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.280
to sub saharan africans, and found pairs of
random people from each population were more

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.259
genetically similar than pairs of people within
their population a fifth of the time.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.320
So what’s the total difference between you
and a totally random person on the other side

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
of the world?

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.660
I’ll put it to you like this: If you have
a brother or sister you are 99.95% genetically

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.660
identical.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.340
So how much DNA do you think you have in common
with a stranger?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.860
Nope, you’re wrong.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.069
You are at least 99.9% identical to anyone.

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.280
Anyone at all.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.409
That weird guy on the bus, Kevin Bacon, me.

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.690
Almost all your cells have about 6 billion
base pairs that make up the genetic code that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.280
is expressed as you, meaning 5,994,000,000
[5 billion, 9 hundred and 94 million] of them

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.060
are the same as anyone else.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.060
Mind.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.060
Blown.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.180
Even though we’re all so similar, it’s
still a good idea to mix up the gene pool

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.310
and date outside the family tree.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.629
Laci explains why down here.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.000
So how does this information affect how you
think about other people?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.650
