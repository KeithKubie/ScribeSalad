00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.345
Which function has a local
minimum with a value of 1?

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:11.260
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.040
So they tell us the
x values, and we

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.820
see x increasing from negative
4 all the way to positive 4.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.550
So our x values are increasing.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.100
And they give us
different functions here.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.350
And they essentially say
which of these functions

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.910
have a local minimum value where
the value of the minimum is 1?

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.190
So they hit a
minimum point at 1.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.100
So that means that the
value of the function

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.250
must be 1 at that minimum point.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.540
So we can see candidate
points right over here.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.590
F of x hits 1 right over there.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.760
G of x hits 1 right over there.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.530
And h of x hits 1
right over there.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.790
And let's see, that's the
only time that they hit 1.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.220
Now let's think about which
of these are minimum values.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.800
So on f of x, when we go from
negative 2 to negative 1,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.530
we are increasing from 0 to
1 and then we increase again.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.620
Well, that's not going
to be a minimum value.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.670
We are increasing.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.830
So let me draw a little
axis right over here.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.530
So let me actually draw
the whole thing just

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.990
to make it clear
what we're doing.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.940
So we have negative 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.160
Positive 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.400
And of course this is 0,
negative 4, negative 3,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.120
negative 2, negative 1.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.891
1, 2, 3, 4, and this is going
to be 0 right over here.

00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.390
And we're going to
care about what's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.550
happening when these
functions hit 1.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.710
So f of x, when x is
equal to negative 2, is 0.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.200
When x is equal to
negative 1 is 1,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.340
and then when x is
equal to 0 is 5.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.831
So 2, 3, 4, 5 is that
right over there.

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.330
And if we assume that these are
sampling from the function--

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.880
we actually necessarily can't
make that assumption here--

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.020
but if we assume that
these are sampling, then

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.510
if this was a
continuous function,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.301
then we would assume
that the function does

00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.210
something like this.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.590
And so it's clearly not a
minimum point right here.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.520
We're increasing into 1.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.860
So this is not a minimum point.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.720
Now let's look at g of x.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.075
Let's see, when g of
x is 1, we're at 2.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.600
When g of x is at 2, we're at 1.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.480
And when g of x is 3,
we're at negative 1.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.950
So we are at negative 1.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.320
So this is the opposite.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.930
We do decrease into that value
when the function hits 1,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.114
but then we keep decreasing.

00:02:39.114 --> 00:02:40.780
In order for this to
be a minimum point,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.740
we would have to decrease into
it and then increase out of it.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.590
This right over here is
also not a minimum point.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.990
Now let's look at h of x.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.400
When x is negative
4, we're at 5.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.960
When x is at negative
3, we are at 1.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.390
And when x is at negative
2, we jump back up to 3.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.370
So this looks like
a minimum point.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.360
We decreased going
into it and then

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.810
we increased going out of it.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.919
So this is our
local minimum point.

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:12.460
And if this was a
continuous function

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.740
it maybe might look
something like that.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.001
So we will go with h of x.
