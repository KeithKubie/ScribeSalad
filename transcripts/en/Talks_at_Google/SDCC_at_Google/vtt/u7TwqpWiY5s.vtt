[ Bagpipes ]
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.410
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Thank you.
Thank you.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.989
And, please, stop doing that.
[ Laughter ]

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.520
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What is your name, sir?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stephen.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.949
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Stephen, thank you for playing
music usually reserved for a fireman's funeral.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.420
That's creating a really nice atmosphere for
me right now.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.420
How are you all doing, everybody?
How are you, Google?

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.770
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Who the hell are you?

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.090
Welcome to Google.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Welcome to Google.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.700
It's very nice that you could be here.
It's exciting.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.560
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Thank you, thank you.
People are so thrilled to see you.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.660
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I noticed that.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What a rare honor for them

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.950
to see you in the flesh.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes, on behalf of all the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.740
Googlers, let me --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You call yourselves Googlers.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.270
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We do.
Aren't we Googlers?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.789
Googlers, yeah.
[ Applause ]

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.310
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Let's start there.
We can do better than "Googler," okay?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.250
Something cooler, especially for the guys
when they're walking into a bar, you hear

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.890
what I'm saying.
I'm a Googler.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.750
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You don't want to -- like,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.959
I'm a "G" man or something.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.239
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You've got to get something
else going, because "Googler"!

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.190
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Welcome.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We're pretty much done here,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.860
aren't we?
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We are done.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.110
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You seem stunned.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.569
So --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: But you invited me, and that's

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.220
your problem.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I did.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.040
So you were at Twitter last week.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: No.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.850
It was a couple of weeks ago.
Look it up online.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.660
Ha-ha.
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.080
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: This is harder than it looks.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.000
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes.
I love this format.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.580
What is this format we're doing here?
This is nice.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.580
So --
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It's kind of like a slow dance.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.940
Exactly.
Like a slow dance.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.990
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Circling me.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.780
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It's like a waltz.
Let's see --

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.580
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I'm a Googler.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: "G" man.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.580
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: "G" man, yes.
So what were you asking me?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.340
You asked me about Twitter.
Yes, I went by Twitter.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.930
Does that bother you guys?
Are you guys mad at Twitter or something?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.790
I don't know what the rivalries are here.
You have to explain it to me.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.620
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It wasn't a rivalry.
A lot of us were wondering the intentions,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.400
Intel, Twitter, Googler.
Coco, level with me, are you looking for a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.330
job in the Silicon Valley.
Is that what you're doing?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.960
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I'm looking for free stuff.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Free stuff.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.319
You've come to the right place.
You've come to the right place.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.010
Why don't you have a seat.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes, let's sit in this fake

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.019
airport lounge that we've created.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes.

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.470
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: My flight was supposed to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.110
board 20 minutes ago.
Is this complimentary?

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.630
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It is.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Then this trip was worth

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.100
it.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.740
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So I'm sure you have many
questions for me.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.360
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I do.
But don't mind me.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.319
If you feel like dancing, go right for it.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Whatever you like.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.830
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: So we have a thing inside
Google called a Dory.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.310
It basically allows -- a Dory, an internal
name: You don't need to know what it is.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.480
[ Laughter ]
.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.980
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It allows --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: The most condescending man

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.349
I've ever met.
Hey, don't you worry about it.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.970
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You just relax and let the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.400
search engine do the work.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We have 45 minutes.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.020
We're just getting started.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I've got nowhere else to

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.310
go.
This looks like the club in purple rain.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.470
I like everybody --
[ Laughter ]

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.990
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Are you all -- whoo!
-- dancing?

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.180
When Morris day and the time come out.
You kids are young.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.250
You'll figure it out soon.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: So Googlers, or "G" men --

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.440
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And ladies.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: -- and ladies, submitted a

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.840
bunch of questions.
It's a very Democratic process.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.070
We get to vote on the best questions.
And then I cull them and pick the best one,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.810
so it's quasi Democratic, I guess.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: It's not Democratic at all.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.620
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: That's like Stalin saying,

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.190
"You guys decide amongst yourselves and then
I'll kill all of you."

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.440
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, I guess you're right.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: How is that Democratic?

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.810
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You have a point.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You have the illusion of

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.990
democracy here.
Give them some turquoise girl's bicycles.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:08.990
[ Laughter. ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Give them some free chai

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.310
lattes, and then grind them for all they're
worth.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.800
[ Laughter. ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You're getting nervous, aren't

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.110
you?
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: No.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.020
[ Laughter. ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You're wishing I hadn't come.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.889
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's start with the questions.

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.800
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: The first one is from a Googler

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.240
named "Chirp."
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Named what?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.389
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: It says "chirp."
I'm sorry. It says "Chip."

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.100
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Why are you running this
thing?

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.020
"This first question is from Chirp."
[ Laughter ]

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.320
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Lipslav gibble ja- -- Oh,
I'm sorry. It's upside-down.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.620
You're going to be fine.
Breathe deeply.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.340
We'll get through this.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Here's the question: What

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.540
lessons and wisdom can you offer those seeking
to grow a beard as luxurious as yours?

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.860
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Shots of testosterone helped
me.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.860
I grew this beard pretty much out of -- it
was a -- a feeling of -- for every day for

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:20.030
17 years, I've had to shave.
And I just -- the first day that I didn't

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.570
have "The Tonight Show," I woke up and I thought,
at least I don't have to shave.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.000
And then I went with that.
And it's one of those things where you just

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.580
go with the opportunity.
I just stopped shaving.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.050
And then, really, very quickly, 'cause I'm
all man, --

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.610
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- I had this beard, literally,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.490
within a day, I had this beard.
[ Laughter ]

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.800
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I am very -- I am just all
man is what I am.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.740
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Good answer.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I -- so I say -- but, you

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.370
know, you hipsters and hep cats, you -- What
generation is this?

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.160
You're not "Y" even.
You're past "Y."

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.650
How old are you people?
Are you all in your twenties?

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.860
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So you've, like, never even

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.710
heard of the television show "chips."
I'm just running a test.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.810
You don't even know what that was.
You were all born, like, after "the Cosby

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.310
show" was off the air.
I'm quickly trying to find out who this audience

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.840
is.
All in your twenties.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.600
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: They don't even know what
"The Tonight Show" is.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.009
They watch the YouTube channel, though.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: That's good.

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:21.990
I like that.
Who needs to know what a "tonight show" is

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.530
anymore.
[ Applause ]

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:32.530
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: (Sobbing) it hurts so much.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Where are we?

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.360
It'll get better.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Anyway, yes.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.320
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: This one is from Mike in New
York City.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.880
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Are you sure?
You want to read that carefully?

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.389
It's from Mitchell in --
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I've heard that Mr. Burns

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:54.900
was your favorite "Simpson" character to write
for.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:01.090
What is your favorite Mr. Burns quote of all
time, either written by you or someone else?

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:07.120
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Boy, I don't -- I can't 
-- don't -- there's not one that comes to

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.509
mind.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You want to make one up?

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.289
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Well, I guess one of my favorite
things that was a repeating joke we did all

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:18.270
the time that always made me laugh was that
Mr. Simpson [sic], even though he had had

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:24.520
hundreds and hundreds of death-defying encounters
with Homer Simpson, never remembers who he

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.259
is.
I always love every time Homer is brought

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:33.990
into his office, he's like, "Simpson, eh?"
And could never remember who he was.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.269
My other favorite thing is that we made him
impossibly old.

00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:43.929
We always -- there's an episode, I think that
John Swartzwelder wrote, where Mr. Burns wants

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:48.740
to play -- assemble his old -- a baseball
team, and he wants to assemble a baseball

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.920
team of ringers.
So he's going and saying, "Get Luke Appleby,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.470
Morris Brisby," all these people who died
in 1905.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:04.429
And he can't believe they're not alive anymore.
He was just the most fun person to write for,

00:09:04.429 --> 00:09:10.420
because he's a comedy writer's fantasy.
There's limitless potential for him because

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.429
he has unlimited wealth and he's as old as
time, we can do anything we wanted.

00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:21.220
He could have chambers deep down underneath
his house where he would -- he could be asleep

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.050
in a hyperbaric chamber when Smithers comes
to get him.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.759
Whatever we thought of, we could make happen.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I appreciate your explaining

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:33.589
that to me, because if I had to guess what
a comedy writer's fantasy would be, I would

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:35.209
have gone elsewhere.
But thanks.

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:36.839
Now I understand.
Good character.

00:09:36.839 --> 00:09:40.529
Let's go else -- let's -- I've apparently
left you stunned now.

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:43.019
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Do you interact with this
man on a regular basis?

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:47.529
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Here's -- I won't even tell

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:51.610
who you this is from, except not from me.
This is from the audience.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.920
Are you interested in working at Google?
You can totally have my job exactly five years

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.889
from today.
[ Laughter ]

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:02.379
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I would take that offer at
this point.

00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:04.490
The way things are going, I would take that
offer.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.889
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This seems to be a growth

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:11.019
industry, so, yes, whoever you are, I'm very
interested.

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:13.550
Do I get to choose my -- can I bring my own
bike here?

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.100
Is that possible?
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.089
We would do that.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Or choose from one of the

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:24.040
Willy Wonka bikes?
Out in the factory.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:30.489
No, I think you guys are doing something right
here at Google, and I'm all in!

00:10:30.489 --> 00:10:32.360
About stock, how does it work?
[ Laughter ]

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.449
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We can work that out for you.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I could get something, I

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:40.209
think.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Plus a custom bike.

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:42.509
Somebody taking notes?
Okay, good.

00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:49.170
Okay, can you please do a dance for us, the
worm, the sprinkle head at the very least.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:53.149
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What the hell is this?
What am I, a -- seriously, what is this?

00:10:53.149 --> 00:10:58.040
You guys are so power-mad now at Google.
[ Laughter ]

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.040
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You're such entitled A-holes,
hey, Conan's in the area, make him come by.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:10.209
Conan, get over here!
Get over here before your show, get over here!

00:11:10.209 --> 00:11:13.759
What do you want, you can have one water.
[ Laughter ]

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:18.309
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We've got a stool for you.
Hey, do a dance!

00:11:18.309 --> 00:11:23.110
Dance around a little bit!
Turn around!

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.239
Let's see your ass!
[ Applause ]

00:11:25.239 --> 00:11:30.059
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah, that was pretty good.
All right.

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:34.230
Hey, you want my job in five years?
Maybe I'll give it to you, ha-ha-ha.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.660
Get out of here!
Go do your show!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.119
What's happened you to people?
Okay.

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.470
So about this dance, what do you want?
[ Laughter ]

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:51.470
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What's that, you want some
string dance?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.790
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: String --
[ Applause ]

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:59.779
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: How do I do this?

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:06.779
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Lick your fingers first.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I can do that.

00:12:08.589 --> 00:12:11.529
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Okay.
Okay.

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:13.829
And a little right here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoo!

00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:15.689
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Grab the string, right side
first.

00:12:15.689 --> 00:12:18.049
Loosen this up.
Loosen that up and then you go like that.

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:21.559
Then you have to cut the string.
Then if you're feeling really crazy, you can

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:28.559
pull up on this one and cut it, pull that
one and cut it.

00:12:28.869 --> 00:12:35.019
And just go to town.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I like it.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:37.269
I like it.
[ Applause ]

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:41.610
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Come on, speed it up, Conan.
I'm late for my hacky sack in the courtyard.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:47.470
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: This is from George, also
from New York.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.019
Conan, you have the power to change the game
on YouTube.

00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:54.879
What are you waiting for?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What does he mean, what am

00:12:54.879 --> 00:12:59.980
I waiting for?
Like, clarify, please.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.860
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Unfortunately, George is in
New York.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.089
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Oh, okay.
I'm not waiting for anything.

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:07.910
I'm going with the flow.
That's what I'm doing right now.

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:13.549
I've been through a transformative event in
the last three and a half months, just really

00:13:13.549 --> 00:13:19.309
nice way of saying I got screwed.
[ Laughter ]

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:25.790
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You have no natural reflex.
[ Laughter ]

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:32.459
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, my wife --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: They built you here, didn't

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:36.920
they?
There's some nerd way in the back, "The program's

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.119
faulty."
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I have to admit --

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:45.389
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: It's not reading correctly.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You're pretty impressive to

00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:51.100
pick up on that.
My wife didn't realize that until after we

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.970
were married.
Okay.

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.429
Let's --
[ Laughter ]

00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:57.069
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We've really got to fix this
thing!

00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:03.670
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: So what sketch have you always
wanted to do that wasn't safe for network

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.079
television?
And will you bring it to life on cable?

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:11.199
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I -- wow.
Okay.

00:14:11.199 --> 00:14:16.829
Well, we've had many thoughts over the years
about things that we weren't sure we could

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:19.329
do.
But I have to say, for the most part, I got

00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:24.699
away with murder.
There's this illusion that, oh, you know,

00:14:24.699 --> 00:14:28.549
the -- these men in suits restrained and shackled
Conan.

00:14:28.549 --> 00:14:33.739
They never really let him grow a beard or
do comedy that was weird.

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:40.389
And the truth is, because for a long time,
for the majority of my career, I was on at

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:42.999
12:35 at night, nobody that I worked for watched
my show.

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:45.149
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: They didn't see it.

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:49.660
And so we just ran with it.
We just -- I mean, I think about all the things

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:55.759
we did over the years that are just completely
absurd, obscene, weird.

00:14:55.759 --> 00:15:00.629
They didn't go through any filter whatsoever.
And often, every now and then, they assign

00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:07.629
a lawyer to watch the show and give us notes.
And they were constantly missing the incredibly

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:13.519
obscene thing we were doing and giving us
notes about pronunciation of something completely

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:18.019
unrelated or -- and so there's not a lot that
I couldn't do.

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:22.480
I think it's more about the tone.
I think the tone might change a little bit

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.449
now.
Because, like I say, I've been through this

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:27.790
event.
And the last three and a half months has been

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:34.509
all improvisation.
The groundswell of Internet support from a

00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:39.249
lot of young people that are in this room
completely took my network by surprise.

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:42.559
They don't know what hit them.
They -- I think there's a lot of people in

00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:49.559
broadcast television that are very dismissive
or have been very dismissive about the Internet.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:55.309
And they're also afraid of it.
And they tend to deride what they don't understand.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:16:01.559
So when this explosion happened on the Internet,
when they announced that, well, okay, maybe

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:07.459
we're going to slide Conan over to accommodate
this other gentleman who's having his difficulties

00:16:07.459 --> 00:16:10.470
in another time period, and I won't get into
specifics, you'll have to look it up.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.419
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And I said, you know, what,

00:16:15.419 --> 00:16:18.149
that doesn't really work for me, I think,
in a fairly polite way.

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:25.089
They -- there was suddenly a huge reaction
from people -- you know, some of the people

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:29.139
in this room, a lot of people like you across
the country said, "Wait a minute, we like

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:35.720
this person, and this person kind of, you
know, is -- we're with him."

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:41.540
And they started reacting on the Internet.
And the first thing that happened at my employers,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.999
they saw this huge explosion on the Internet
and thought that I was doing it.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.730
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And they really had this

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.459
attitude of, "Make him stop."
"Why is he doing this?"

00:16:50.459 --> 00:16:55.439
And they didn't understand what was happening.
I think they still don't understand what's

00:16:55.439 --> 00:16:59.470
happening.
And my feeling is, what I've learned is, I

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:05.890
had nowhere else to go, so I started on Twitter
because I literally had no other option.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:12.049
I was -- I was and am legally prohibited from
appearing on television, radio, and doing

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:16.260
performances on the Internet.
So it was just, literally, like a prisoner

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:21.020
in a 14th-century cell writing little things
on a scrap of paper and throwing them out

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.690
the window --
[ Laughter. ]

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.800
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- and hoping a peasant would
go by and, "Hey, what's this?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.750
He's in the tower!"
So I started to do that and send out these

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.350
little things.
And it exploded overnight.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:40.810
And at first, I started to hear a little bit
of stuff from the other side saying, "We're

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.910
not sure you should be able to -- allowed
to -- because of the --" and then they realized

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.150
the absurdity of shutting down my Twitter
account.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:53.640
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So that started with that.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.050
And then I started to think about the tour,
which I'm allowed to do.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:02.670
And so we started this idea for a tour.
And then what was fascinating is, by the time

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:07.260
we launched the tour, or announced the tour,
I did not do one -- I didn't spend one penny

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.260
often advertising.
I sent out one tweet that directed people

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:17.140
to a Web site where you could buy your ticket.
That was it.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.830
And the show sold out in a couple of hours
across the country.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:26.060
And that's got everybody, a lot of people,
rethinking how things are marketed.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.510
And I -- there's not one billboard.
There's not -- I didn't have to go to one

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:34.670
radio station and sit with morning deejays,
like, and hawk my show.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.830
I didn't have to do any of that.
It was one tweet.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.850
And I think people are starting to understand
that the world has completely changed.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.650
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And, you know, it has.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.390
And it is changing.
[ Applause ]

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.860
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And I think we can do better!
Sorry.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.310
I --
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That was great.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.470
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- forgot I wasn't running
for something.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:19:00.720
But -- but I think that's what's -- what 
-- the biggest lesson that I've learned in

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.720
the last three and a half months, is just
a good life lesson.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.990
I'm not trying to sound corny or anything,
but these things happen to you, and you think

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.900
you've been dealt a terrible hand or had bad
luck.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:15.610
And when you go with it and start improvising,
suddenly, you realize that you stumble upon

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.910
some of the best things that have ever happened
to you.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:23.400
And what's interesting about Twitter is that
because you're limited to I think it's 140

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:30.400
characters -- someone is going to correct
me right now -- "Not so!"

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:39.640
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- you're all going to rush

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:41.860
the stage.
[ Laughter ]

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.920
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Beats the crap out of me.
But because you're limited, it's a great economy-writing

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.540
tool.
There's economy of words.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:55.730
I'm constantly writing things and then I run
them past Big Bley (phonetic), who is taking

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.860
the pictures over there, as if he doesn't
have enough photos of me.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.950
But -- He'll say, "Well, that's actually three
words over."

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:10.740
And it forces you to look back at the sentence,
and it's -- it forces you to crystallize your

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.070
comedy idea, which is fascinating.
And the other thing is, I've been -- this

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.840
whole tour wouldn't have happened.
This tour is a dream come true for me.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.840
I've always wanted to -- it's half rock show,
half comedy show, and then it's this fantasy

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.480
to get to do this.
So the last three and a half months have been

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.130
the most interesting time in my entire career,
and I wouldn't have traded this for anything

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.650
in the world.
And so three and a half months ago, what looked

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.420
to everybody like bad luck has become amazingly
good luck.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:47.370
And I think that is a lot of what we're --
 what relates to everybody here, a lot of

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.470
you are in your twenties, and you take for
granted that this is the way the world is

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:57.200
right now.
But from my perspective, it's changed dramatically

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.300
in just seven years.
And I don't even know where we're going to

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.300
be five years from now.
So I don't know what television's going to

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.390
be five years from now.
There's a lot of people who think you're just

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.930
going to experience it all through your server.
And people don't even know how the business

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.390
is going to change.
There might not be, really, network television

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:18.159
as we know it.
Wouldn't that be sweet!

00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:20.950
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So you know what I mean?

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.680
Who knows?
So, you know -- seize the day, carpe diem.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.720
I hate it when people say that.
I just wanted to work it in.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.870
I'm going to keep talking to you.
Ask another question.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:38.050
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I think your point about,
you know, with "The Tonight Show" fiasco,

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.650
ended up one of the best things you could
ever imagine happening to you.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.890
Look, you're here, taking questions from me.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Again, incredible arrogance

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:52.890
from you people.
Incredible arrogance to say that, yes, you're

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.020
right, this is the best thing that ever happened
to you.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.520
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: 'Cause you made it to Google

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.880
with us Googlers.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: "G" men.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.360
Jay Leno has a big chin, you have a giant
head --

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:13.120
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Ha-h -- can't talk about
that other guy.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.350
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Has a big chin.
You have --

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:22.650
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Legal restraints, legal restraints.
"Hey, why can't you"

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:27.680
"I didn't do anything. I did as I was told."
[ Applause ]

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:34.680
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Thank you.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.010
So this other guy --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: That's my impression of Rapper

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.730
Ludicrous.
[ Laughter ]

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.260
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We all on the same page on
this?

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:53.260
That's my ludicrous impression.
Check out my new outfit, May 5th.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:59.770
Rapper Ludicrous.
Later, in court, "Yes, Your Honor, that is

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:02.240
ludicrous."
You okay?

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.900
How are you doing?
I worry about you.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.740
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I'm doing well.
Any of you want to ask questions, there's

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.370
mikes.
So --

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.300
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What's the point of this
then?

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.520
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Once again, I don't understand

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.270
what's happening here.
I have some prepared questions from people

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.340
who have been preselected.
But if anyone wants to shout something out

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.590
at random, go ahead.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's right.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.260
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You've taken the initiative.
Yes.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:28.660
&gt;&gt;&gt; Pleased -- whoa, that's loud.
It's been a lifelong dream of mine to touch

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:28.910
your hair.
So --

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.720
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, about you working here.

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:14.140
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I solved that problem.
[ Laughter ]

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.670
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Guys, no more touching questions,
please.

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.400
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What are you talking about?
Yes!

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.840
Let's touch it up.
You know, I'm sorry, I feel really crass.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.390
I don't even know your name.
[ Laughter ]

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:35.260
Can I just know your name?
Because later on, my wife's going to be, what

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.060
happened?
I don't know.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.510
I don't even know her name.
What did you do?

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:43.720
We rubbed our heads together.
What is your name?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.310
&gt;&gt;&gt; My name's Kelly.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Hi, Kelly.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.850
We should have done this before we rubbed
up against each other.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:55.620
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes, there are more.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.990
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This guy over here.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You chose Reggie Watts for your opener,

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.040
who we actually had the pleasure of hosting
about a week ago.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.320
Probably the strangest comedian I've ever
seen.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.330
Can you talk about your choice of him and
why you thought he would be great for your

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.620
tour.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Someone explained to me 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:16.070
-- I have never done a tour before.
Someone said, "Well, would you want to have

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.770
an opening act?"
And I said, "Yeah, it's probably a good idea

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.670
to have someone go out and entertain the crowd."
But this is going to be kind of an unusual

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:28.740
show, and if anyone's seen it or is going
to see it, it's not -- you know, it's not

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:33.710
just a standup show where I come out and hold
a mike and talk for an hour and 40 minutes.

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.060
It's also not just a music show.
There's a lot of different things, different

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:43.170
components to the show.
And I've got a sort of a distinctive or weird

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:48.120
brand of comedy.
And so we were talking, and someone at the

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:54.210
company that helped set up the tour said,
"You know, your opening act can really help

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.030
kind of brand your tour or help brand your
tour.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:02.930
So if you want to send a certain message about
your tour, your opening act can help.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.800
And you certainly don't want an opening act
that's completely -- if Wayne Newton, no offense

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.720
to Wayne Newton, but if he opened my show
with "Danke Schoen," and that -- it would

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.170
be awesome!
But he was unavailable.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:21.400
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We were talking, and I have

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.130
some really smart, funny writers, and someone
just -- we were chatting about it.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.630
And I said, "If anyone has any ideas."
And someone said, "Reggie Watts."

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:34.510
And then it was like one of those things,
it's like throwing a ping-pong ball into a

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:38.010
room of mouse traps, like people just were
like, "Yes, Reggie Watts," "Reggie Watts,"

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.110
"Reggie Watts," "Reggie Watts."
They kept saying it.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:46.030
And I wasn't familiar with Reggie.
So I went right to the Internet -- you'll

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.730
see. I'll tell you about it -- and started
looking at him.

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:51.970
And he has a really great, creative, unusual
act.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:56.490
He's amazingly talented.
And he just seemed perfect right away.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.610
Our big fear was, is he available, because
he's very much in demand.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.190
He had some other commitments, but he was
really into doing this and moved his schedule

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.560
around.
And it's been a great fit, because I think

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:12.560
people -- the other thing I want to do with
this tour is open up people's minds a little

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:18.200
bit in a way so that there are people who
have preconceived ideas about what I do, and

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.210
then they see some of the things we're doing
in the show and they see some of the things

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:24.720
that are happening, and I think it will --
 I mean, we have some older people that are

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.650
coming to the show that think, well, I'm going
to see a guy come out and talk about his experience

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.010
at "The Tonight Show."
And then they see all the elements we have

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:37.780
in the show and the kind of performance level
there is, and people like Reggie Watts come

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.640
out and I think maybe open them up to new
ideas about what comedy is, because he integrates

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:50.640
music, hip-hop, comedy, and creates this,
I think, amazing performance.

00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:56.240
He really gets the crowd going before I even
set foot on stage.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.940
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Cool.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Okay.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.800
You're fired.
[ Laughter ]

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.500
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You really want to ask this
question now?

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.280
Because he just lost his job.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.950
I actually have two questions.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Nope!

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:13.050
You have to combine them into one question.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.680
I'll try my best.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: No.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.870
You'll do better than that.
[ Laughter ]

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:22.120
&gt;&gt;&gt; So one of my favorite things --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This isn't Yahoo!, you know.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.309
We expect the best.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:28:24.309 --> 00:28:31.309
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: No reflexes, remember?
&gt;&gt;&gt; So one of my favorite things about the

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:33.610
return, or, rather, you taking over "The Tonight
Show" was the return of Andy.

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:38.640
I was wondering if you could talk --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Why don't we have Andy talk

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.800
about Andy.
He's here.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.840
Andy Richter.
[ Applause ]

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:51.840
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy Richter: Hello.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.720
It's about time!
Right there.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.080
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know what, you can have
this water.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.110
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Okay.
No, I don't want any water.

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.420
Kirkland?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What is Kirkland water?

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.000
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: It's Costco water.
[ Laughter ]

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.970
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I'm sorry, Mr. O'Brien.
You're drinking Costco water.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:22.820
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This is ridiculous.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I know.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:25.390
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Did you see they made me
dance?

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.730
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I saw it.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Then a woman made me run

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.090
up against her head.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I know.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:35.370
That's why I was standing by the door.
I was so -- I was humiliated for you.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:39.450
No, I actually was just back, standing outside
the bathroom, because I think your assistant

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.470
is in there front-cleansing.
[ Laughter ]

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:48.470
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Our tour manager, our tour
manager said, "You've got to check out the

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:57.600
Japanese toilets."
So I just was in the bathroom to look, 'cause

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:03.520
I've seen them before, and they -- there's
buttons on the wall, "front cleansing," "rear

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.410
cleansing."
[ Laughter ]

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:07.520
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What is -- I've never heard
of this before.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.240
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: It's like a little bidet.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I understand that part.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.809
I don't understand, why do they have this
at Google?

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:22.430
Why am I asking you?
"Cleansing is necessary.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:29.430
All Googlers must front-cleanse."
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I hope you enjoyed Twitter

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.230
 -- those Twitterers' filthy asses.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I did.

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:39.620
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I want to see it say "filthy
asses."

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.900
Look, it does!
[ Applause ]

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.840
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What a great -- Turn this
up.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.290
Turn -- Put this mike up a little bit.
It's getting low.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:57.600
I just -- I love that that's what we're using
the technology for.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.420
You know.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: So I was in the bathroom,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:05.960
and I hear -- I think it was your Sonne (phonetic),
assistant screaming in the women's room.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.799
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: There she is.
There she is!

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:17.360
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you front-cleansed?
[ Laughter ]

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:24.360
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This is either the best or
worst thing that's ever happened at Google.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.590
It's not anything in between.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wait.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:34.330
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: More questions.
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is perfect for my follow-up question.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.470
Here at Google, we're interested in seeing
what the next big thing is, a little insight

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.740
into the future.
I was curious if you could give us some insights

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:48.570
into the year 2000.
[ Applause ]

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:55.570
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: The future Conan?
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's always cue cards for that, though.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:01.179
You think --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You think we're spontaneously

00:32:01.179 --> 00:32:03.090
funny?
&gt;&gt;&gt; No way.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:07.130
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: "Google merged with Blabble
and form Gibble Gabble."

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:14.130
"In the year 2000."
Yeah, we -- I was once -- I was on an airplane

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.070
once, and the plane was taxiing for the takeoff.
It was a commercial flight, back in the day,

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.880
just kidding -- I fly commercial.
But, anyway, -- not like the rest of you,

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.429
who have your jet packs.
But I was on this commercial flight, and I

00:32:29.429 --> 00:32:32.679
hear the guy, the pilot, is just, like, getting
ready to take off.

00:32:32.679 --> 00:32:36.550
And he went, "We're all ready to take off,
and I understand there's someone here on the

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:40.350
plane, a very special person who can tell
us a little bit about" -- and then he went,

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:45.140
"In the year 2000."
And then started to, like, put the engine

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.870
into overdrive to take off.
And I lost complete confidence in the pilot.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.960
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: At this crucial moment.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.340
He's, like, making his jokes, "In the year
two -- shit, I didn't check the altimeter."

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:02.870
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Then later, they check the

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:09.550
black box, and it's my fault, you know.
But, anyway, to answer your question, Andy

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:16.510
was in Los Angeles, and I called him up when
I had the chance -- and I said, Andy, you

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:20.320
have to come on board, because "The Tonight
Show," it's a franchise, no "The Tonight Show"

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.490
show has ever been sacked.
It's a sure thing.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.550
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Drop what you're doing and

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:30.880
come with me.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: I said, I'm now a tenured

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.179
professor in show business.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes.

00:33:33.179 --> 00:33:35.890
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: No way they can fire me.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah.

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:39.950
And you went out and bought a theme restaurant.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: That's right.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.790
And it was -- it was all the skipper from
"Gilligan's Island."

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.750
It was all -- That was the theme.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:52.100
And now you're impoverished, and here we are.
But the important thing is, we stuck together.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.990
And now what it's really -- that's what it's
about, kids, you have a friend, stick by him,

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.410
and he'll stick by you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Even though I did leave you back in the

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.460
nineties.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: To go hang with Pat Sajak.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:10.460
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: As it was once written, I
was seeking prime-time stardom.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:19.379
That was what was written about me.
And I was, like -- I don't remember ever thinking,

00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:21.859
"Sorry, Conan, I'm going to go seek prime-time
stardom."

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:26.289
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You did say that to me, and
then jumped out the window.

00:34:26.289 --> 00:34:29.319
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Yep.
I was taking a lot of pills in those days.

00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:31.649
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: This gentleman right here,
how can I help you?

00:34:31.649 --> 00:34:38.649
&gt;&gt;&gt; Gentlemen, we miss you.
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: We're right here.

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.059
Like my mom, she cries two days before she
has to leave because she has to leave in two

00:34:44.059 --> 00:34:47.599
days.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's something important I want to

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.499
point out.
It is Cinco de Mayo.

00:34:49.499 --> 00:34:56.499
So where are Noches De Pasion?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I look forward to the return

00:34:58.509 --> 00:35:04.339
of Conando.
I don't know what the deal is, actually.

00:35:04.339 --> 00:35:10.900
I'll be honest with you, it's legally unclear
what can come with us to TBS and what can't

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:17.900
because of certain intellectual property issues
that we address in the -- in the live show.

00:35:18.509 --> 00:35:24.039
But I think there's no holding Conando back.
I've been walking around Los Angeles, and

00:35:24.039 --> 00:35:28.930
I've had many, you know, people come up to
me and just, like, oh, Conando.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:29.400
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: That's how you're known.
[ Laughter ]

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:36.400
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah, and I speak enough
Spanish to be able to say, "Si."

00:35:37.079 --> 00:35:41.079
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: And he always keeps a fake
mustache in his pocket.

00:35:41.079 --> 00:35:45.609
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes, I glue it on, which
looks really funny over the red beard.

00:35:45.609 --> 00:35:49.210
I love Conando.
He's a lot of fun.

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.609
My favorite part is Andy's cameo.
He's always in a humiliating outfit.

00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:58.989
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Yep.
I think I was going to be a -- no, I -- or

00:35:58.989 --> 00:36:04.039
was I an actual taco?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: That's just a dream you had.

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:05.220
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: No.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:09.559
Because it was always, like, are you going
to be like in a Carmen Miranda outfit, are

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:16.559
you going to be dressed as a giant -- I can't
think of the word -- those things you shake,

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.470
maraca.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: There are a lot of things

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:27.669
you shake.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In the Conando world.

00:36:27.669 --> 00:36:33.450
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Thank you for bowing to us.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.950
&gt;&gt;&gt; Little tip for you all, might want to
bow.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.809
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I bow to you as well.
Hello.

00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:39.940
How are you?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm good.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.640
Thanks.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Okay.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.660
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay.
This is going to be really bizarre, and I

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:51.430
acknowledge that I probably won't be able
to look anybody in the eye after asking this.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.650
But I was wondering if you could settle a
long argument with my friends.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.809
So one of my friends from school did dorm
crew, and he was cleaning out what he thought

00:36:55.809 --> 00:37:00.990
used to be one of your rooms, and he found
a big ball of hair that he thinks was yours.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.440
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Wait.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.280
Okay.
Will you --

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.510
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; So --

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.769
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You've got to be a little

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:12.249
more specific.
Let's get really specific here.

00:37:12.249 --> 00:37:17.559
What year was this and what college?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, this was, like, three years ago.

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:21.270
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So -- 'cause I hate to shatter
any illusions --

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:23.630
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- you have about my age,

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.579
but I graduated from college in 1985.
&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I know.

00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.329
This is --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: So this person thinks that

00:37:30.329 --> 00:37:32.430
I made a giant ball of hair --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes!

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.859
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: -- and spun it and then left
it in the Holworthy dorm at Harvard?

00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:38.380
&gt;&gt;&gt; This is what I'm saying.
It doesn't make any sense.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:43.230
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And then put it -- and everyone
was so horrified by it that from 1985 until

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:50.230
three years ago, no one went near it, and
then your friend found it and did a DNA test.

00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:56.799
&gt;&gt;&gt; I know.
His name is Jim.

00:37:56.799 --> 00:38:00.150
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Oh, Jim.
Yes, yes!

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:07.150
That's all I needed.
No, I grew a giant ball of hair for Jim.

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.569
And left it for him to find at the Holworthy
dorm.

00:38:10.569 --> 00:38:14.789
Just next time say Jim.
That's all you had to do.

00:38:14.789 --> 00:38:17.859
I've heard -- one of the things I'll tell
you, you've probably experienced this, too,

00:38:17.859 --> 00:38:24.029
Andy, is what happens when you become a known
person is you start hearing all these things

00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:27.079
back about yourself that are complete madness.
[ Laughter ]

00:38:27.079 --> 00:38:31.960
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I went to my -- one of my
high school reunions, and people were coming

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.920
up to me and saying things that were just
completely untrue.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.569
And this one guy -- about our past.
This one guy came up to me, and just so you

00:38:39.569 --> 00:38:44.190
know, I'll never -- I'll have like a glass
of wine or two or three now, but I'm not a

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:47.239
drinker.
And I never drank at all when I was young

00:38:47.239 --> 00:38:53.539
or in college, ever.
And this guy came up to me, and he said, "Hey,

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:57.999
Conan, remember the time you and I broke into
that liquor store late at night?"

00:38:57.999 --> 00:39:00.420
And I said, "No, no, no."
And he went, "Come on, we broke into the liquor

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.670
store and we grabbed all that booze, and then
the cops showed up, and we ran up that hill,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.420
and you were, like, 'I'm get fucking out of
here,' and you took the booze, and then later,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:14.910
you drank all the booze, and I didn't get
any of it, you asshole, you."

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.440
And I said, "That didn't really happen."
"Okay. I get it. Big star now.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:25.440
I get it. I get it."
Now, in his mind, that really happened.

00:39:25.869 --> 00:39:30.630
And I've never committed a crime in my life.
I am Richie Cunningham to the tenth power.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:37.630
I've never -- And so I have had many things
come back to me where people -- I had a Realtor

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.739
once say, you know, he's showing me, like,
an apartment that I was going to rent.

00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:45.710
And he was, like, just so you know there are
no hard feelings, I married your old girlfriend.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.430
And I said, oh, really?
And I haven't -- it's not like -- I hate to

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:52.640
disillusion people, I haven't had that many
girlfriends in my life, I said, really, was

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.180
it blah, blah, blah?
And he said, no, come on, Stacey.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:00.039
And he told me her full name.
Never heard of this person before in my life.

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:04.519
He said, come on, I know you two went out
for a year and a half.

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:07.730
But he said, it's okay.
I'm cool with it.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:14.730
So what happens is I've --
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's what really drew him to her, too.

00:40:14.859 --> 00:40:17.140
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I know.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is getting your sloppy seconds.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.239
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah, I know.
And then he was like, she had Conan.

00:40:22.239 --> 00:40:24.210
She has the ball of hair.
[ Laughter ]

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:28.779
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Damn!
You got me.

00:40:28.779 --> 00:40:32.539
But the truth is that you've had this, too,
like, people just come up and they say --

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:38.720
 and 95% of what I hear is madness.
Really, just madness, like, hey, a friend

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.109
of mine saw you kick a guy to death in Hong
Kong.

00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:44.880
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: And I've learned to just,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:51.259
instead of fighting them, I just go, yeah,
well, that Dick had it coming, you know, like,

00:40:51.259 --> 00:40:53.559
go with it.
Go with it.

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:58.349
So, yes, say hi to Jim and sell that hair
ball on eBay.

00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:59.559
Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay, thanks.

00:40:59.559 --> 00:41:03.650
&gt;&gt;&gt; Conan, last year, you were at the International
Science and Engineering Fair.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.970
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes, I was.
&gt;&gt;&gt; In Reno.

00:41:06.970 --> 00:41:11.999
And this year, it's next week, it's in San
Jose, and Google is the premier sponsor.

00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:14.160
If we promise you some swag, will you come
again?

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.039
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I would love to come.
I had a blast last year.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:22.039
I -- and she shot a remote for "The Tonight
Show" when I went and talked to all the kids.

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:25.140
And I absolutely loved it.
The tour is going to prohibit us from doing

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:29.349
it just because I am hitting -- I was in Reno
last night.

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:32.999
We're here today.
We're in -- I don't even know -- am I in Sacramento

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:34.410
tomorrow?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sacramento tomorrow.

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:36.349
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Sacramento tomorrow.
It's just, we go, go, go, go.

00:41:36.349 --> 00:41:40.299
We're in a different city all the time.
So I probably won't be able to do it.

00:41:40.299 --> 00:41:45.359
But I absolutely loved it.
And the -- the exhibits ranged from just amazing,

00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:49.700
it gave you hope for our country.
These kids are so smart, and they have these

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.059
incredible projects.
Then there's every now and then you'd find

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:56.170
a project which was just such bullshit.
[ Laughter ]

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.339
I'm not being mean, but every now -- most
of them are amazing.

00:41:59.339 --> 00:42:04.099
Then there would be a guy who had, like, a
potato with tooth picks in it and, like, a

00:42:04.099 --> 00:42:08.859
sprout growing out the bottom.
And he'd say, "It's a potato with water on

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.460
it."
And you know that he just did this to get

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.849
the hell out of his town and get to Reno.
And his exhibit's next to a guy who's, like,

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:22.279
I split the hydrogen atom.
Using a sneaker in my basement.

00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:26.129
And you're, like, "Oh, my God."

00:42:26.129 --> 00:42:28.769
Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Andy, Conan, great to have you guys here.

00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:32.170
I just want to say, Andy, your shoes are awesome,
by the way.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:35.749
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Oh, thank you.
I designed them myself.

00:42:35.749 --> 00:42:42.749
Although some dick at the gym said, "What
are those, Nobi shoes?"

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.279
But, no.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I just meant it as a joke.

00:42:44.279 --> 00:42:47.140
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: They're super awesome shoes
is what they are.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.160
&gt;&gt;&gt; They are.
So, Conan, I was curious, do you have any

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.180
thoughts on working with the comic geniuses
Terrance and Phillip in the "South Park" movie.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.759
What was that like?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: It was so funny, because

00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:03.099
I found out later on that I was in the "South
Park" movie.

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:06.289
I remember exactly -- this is just what my
life is like.

00:43:06.289 --> 00:43:09.460
My girlfriend at the time, Stacey, whatever
 --

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:14.450
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Okay.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:20.670
I hit that, you know.
[ Laughter ]

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:24.390
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: But -- such an ass.
My girlfriend at the time and I --

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.349
Look, there's this big screen that says, "You
have five minutes to go."

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:33.359
Why?
Why can't we stay as long as we want?

00:43:33.359 --> 00:43:36.759
Why?
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You have some --

00:43:36.759 --> 00:43:42.119
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: We'll be taken to the vaporization
chamber and head on to the next level.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.259
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: "That is all that's acceptable."
[ Laughter ]

00:43:44.259 --> 00:43:47.940
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: We --
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: So you didn't know you were

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.640
in the --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: What happened is, I remember

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.829
exactly what happened, which is, I had one
of my rare vacations, which I never get, and

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:58.079
I went to Maine with my girlfriend at the
time.

00:43:58.079 --> 00:44:04.279
And it's this beautiful place that's on a
lake, and you go and get breakfast in the

00:44:04.279 --> 00:44:07.829
morning and coffee, and someone had a -- 
and they, like, put down a "U.S.A. Today"

00:44:07.829 --> 00:44:09.609
next to you.
And I'm sitting there drinking this coffee,

00:44:09.609 --> 00:44:13.019
and I open up the "U.S.A. Today," and it's
a review of the "South Park" movie, and it's

00:44:13.019 --> 00:44:16.839
saying it's really funny.
And it has a box, which is the list of who

00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:20.630
plays who.
And it has all the different names of people,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:25.450
then it says, "Conan O'Brien is played by."
And my jaw just dropped.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:30.390
And I said, "There's this movie opening, and
I'm in it, and they got the" -- fortunately,

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.599
it was really funny.
Actually, we're both in it.

00:44:32.599 --> 00:44:37.099
It's this funny thing where they come on the
show to talk to us, and then I end up committing

00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:38.050
suicide.
But it was really --

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.619
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Happens a lot when I'm animated.

00:44:41.619 --> 00:44:45.489
But it was really funny, and I loved it.
And I got to know those guys later on.

00:44:45.489 --> 00:44:50.009
And they said, "We're really sorry about your
voice in that movie."

00:44:50.009 --> 00:44:53.729
And I said, what.
They said the guy who played Data on that

00:44:53.729 --> 00:45:00.729
"Star Trek," whoever that guys is, he convinced
them, "I do the most amazing Conan O'Brien."

00:45:01.019 --> 00:45:03.710
And they're like, "Cool.
Okay.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.640
Great."
And that's why -- one of the reasons they

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.150
worked me in, is 'cause he convinced them
that he did a drop-dead perfect Conan O'Brien.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:16.099
And then he got into the booth and he was
like, "Your next question!"

00:45:16.099 --> 00:45:19.960
And Matt and Trey are like, "Look at that."
But it was too late.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.339
So --
[ Laughter ]

00:45:20.339 --> 00:45:23.940
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: Well, I liked that they were,
like, "Well, there's nothing that can be done

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.520
about it."
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yeah, I know.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.269
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: But I -- once --

00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:30.559
&gt;&gt;Andy Richter: "It's been recorded."
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Once you know Matt and Trey,

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:36.119
you know they were probably, "Whatever, good
enough."

00:45:36.119 --> 00:45:38.989
But, yeah, I love those guys.
Actually, "Team America" is one of my favorite

00:45:38.989 --> 00:45:45.989
movies of all time.
It makes me relentlessly -- I just cry, I'm

00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:48.759
laughing so hard.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Best fight scenes, best sex scenes.

00:45:48.759 --> 00:45:53.819
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was hoping both of you could tell us

00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:58.599
the weirdest thing that's happened to you
on the live tour.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:02.019
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: There's been a lot of weird
stuff.

00:46:02.019 --> 00:46:08.059
&gt;&gt;&gt; No, I can't -- you know.
I stay in my room a lot.

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:12.710
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I think maybe for me the
weirdest thing is, just before I went out

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:17.549
and did a show in San Francisco, someone leaned
exposure said, "Hey, Neil Young's in the audience."

00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:23.130
And I play guitar in this show.
And so I don't get nervous a lot.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.589
I've been doing this a long time.
But I suddenly realized that I'm going to

00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:33.589
be playing rock guitar in front of Neil Young.
And I was horrified.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.390
And then there's a part of the show where
I take a guitar solo and just before I take

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:44.779
it, I see it was one of those accidents, but
I see, like, a shaft of light hitting Neil

00:46:44.779 --> 00:46:46.819
Young's face.
[ Laughter ]

00:46:46.819 --> 00:46:53.479
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You know, looking up at me.
And I don't know what the equivalent is, writing

00:46:53.479 --> 00:46:56.419
code in front of Bill Gates or something.
[ Laughter ]

00:46:56.419 --> 00:46:59.839
&gt;&gt;&gt; No way.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: See, I know what's going

00:46:59.839 --> 00:47:03.489
on.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Conan, we're going to have

00:47:03.489 --> 00:47:05.319
to cut this short.
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You don't have to do anything.

00:47:05.319 --> 00:47:12.319
These people don't have to work today.
You all have to go home!

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.039
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: You've done more than enough

00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:18.789
for this company!
Are they writing that part?

00:47:18.789 --> 00:47:25.789
In fact, you should all participate in a profit-sharing
plan with Google.

00:47:26.359 --> 00:47:28.029
Yes!
[ Applause ]

00:47:28.029 --> 00:47:35.029
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Guys, we appreciate --
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: I like it says "applause."

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:43.390
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Conan O'Brien: Hey, just a quick note, this

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:52.670
was really fun, and we get asked to do a lot
of things, and we don't really have time to

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:56.009
do a lot of things.
But getting in front of young people who are

00:47:56.009 --> 00:47:59.660
really smart and sort of making the future
happen, that's thrilling for us.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.630
So thanks for having us here.
Thank you very much.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.249
[ Cheers and applause ]
