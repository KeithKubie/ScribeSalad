00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Well good
afternoon and welcome to the African

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.240
and Middle East Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.380
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb
chief of the Division

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.780
and I'm delighted to
see you all here.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.990
To again this presentation
which we are co-sponsoring

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:42.070
with the European Division
and Regina is not here

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.960
at the moment but she'll be coming.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.600
And the presentation is
on the Jews of Posen,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.150
by Mister Edward David Luft.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.490
As most of you already
know our division is made

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.160
up of three sections.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.650
The African, the Near East
and the Hebraic sections.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.180
We're responsible for materials
from 78 different countries

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.280
in the Near East Central
Asia, The Caucuses as well

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.930
as from the entire continent of
Africa and North and Sub-Sahara

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.420
and also for the Hebraic
collections we're responsible

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.510
from collections coming
from all over the world.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.180
We always very active in
acquiring, developing collections,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.800
briefing visitors coming from
all the countries of the region.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.190
And organizing programs, symposium,
workshops, exhibits and so forth.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.030
We also invite scholars and experts
who have done research and work

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.040
in our areas of responsibility.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.910
And we invite them to share with us
their insights and their findings.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.270
So that all of us attending and
participating in the programs leave

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.480
and reach with new information
and a better understanding

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.010
of the countries and societies
with publications we collect.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.300
Today's lecture is a case in point.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.490
Mister Luft has been working on
this book for a number of years.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.910
Here at the Library of Congress and
has used resources in this division

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.310
as well as in many other divisions
including the European division,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.540
including the geography
and map division.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.910
And we have the chief
of the geography

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.470
and map division here,
Ralph Ehrenberg.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.220
The general collections,

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.210
HSS and many other parts
of the library as well.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.780
And Mister Luft will tell you
more about this in a moment.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.520
But now our very own
Sharon Horowitz,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.800
the senior reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.520
Will introduce Mister
Luft and the program.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.000
So thank you.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.860
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Thank
you, thank you Mary-Jane.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.040
Good afternoon, on behalf
of the Hebraic section

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.130
and the European division,
welcome to the African

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.710
and Middle Eastern reading room.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.010
I especially want to thank
the European division

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.450
for co-sponsoring today's
lecture with us.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.330
As you heard my name
is Sharon Horowitz

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360
and I'm reference librarian
in the Hebraic section.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.790
The Hebraic section marks
its beginning in the 1912.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.750
With the receipt of
10,000 Hebrew books

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.310
and pamphlets who's purchase
was made possible by gift

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.510
from New York philanthropist
Jacob Schiff

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.540
from those humble beginnings
our collections have grown

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.960
to around 250,000 items in Hebrew,
Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Persian

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.310
and other Hebraic script languages

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.680
and our holdings also include
an important collection

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.570
of Amharic books.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.200 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.030
and to bring people
into the library.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.890
One way we do that is by
holding lectures such as this.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.030
Today's speaker, Edward David Luft,
is an individual who has lectured

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.520
and published widely on the
topic of Posen Province.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.930 position:56%
Furthermore because of his scholarly
diligence he is a well known

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.640
researcher in the Library of
Congress having done research

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.400
in many of the library's divisions.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.480
Today's presentation is
focused on Mister Luft's book,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.940
the Jews of Posen Province
in the Nineteenth Century,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.340
a project that has kept
him busy for 28 years.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.290 position:56%
Mister Luft graduated with an AB and
JD degree from Syracuse University.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.550
He spent two years in Botswana
in the Peace Corps and worked

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.550
for the New Yorker Magazine
before coming to DC and working

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.830 position:56%
as an attorney for the US
government from which he is retired.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.350
I want to express my appreciation

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.950
to Mister Cliff Fulwood
[assumed spelling] from Binding

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.090 position:56%
and Miss Deborah Healy from
cataloging for their beyond the call

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.730
of duty assistance in getting
Mister Luft's book cataloged

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.020
and bound in expedited manner.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.040
But before I turn the podium
over, I have one item of business.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.160
This event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.590
There will be a formal question and
answer period after the lecture.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.160 position:56%
At which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.730
Please be advised, that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.040
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.980
By participating in the Q and
A period, you are consenting

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.980
to the library's possible
reproduction

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.250
and transmission of your remarks.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.190
And now, please join me
in welcoming our speaker,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.510
Mister Edward David Luft.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.210
[ Applause ]

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: First let me say
thank you to Mary-Jane and to Sharon

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.230
for their kind invitation to speak.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.340
I am quite grateful,
I'm also grateful

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.320 position:56%
to see a relatively large turnout as
some people who's faces I recognize

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.230
and others who are welcome as well.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:51.310
Before I get started what I would
like to do is tell you a story

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.230
that would've been contemporary
with the 19th century.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.700
You probably are aware, or at
least many of you will be aware

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.240
that the Jews probably could
not have survived without humor

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.700
in the circumstances in
which they found themselves.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.630
So this would be a typical story,

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.440
the old man on his deathbed
opens his eyes and sees his son

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:28.200
and asks what is that wonderful
smell coming from the kitchen?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.860
And the son says, mom
is making apple strudel.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.990
Oh says the dying man,
if only I could have some

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.110
of your mother's apple strudel
I could die a happy man.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.780
I'll get it for you poppa,
I'll get it for you poppa

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.530
and he rushes to the kitchen.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.230
A little while later he comes
back very dejected and says,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.510
momma says the strudel is
only for after the funeral.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.160
[ Laughter ]

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160
Well it's good to know
that some people still find

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.790
that sort of thing funny.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:12.980
That would have been typical
and I have other stories

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.390
of a similar nature that
you might find interesting.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.870
But let me get started.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.840
I do not write out
what I speak about,

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.980
I prefer to do it extempore
basically

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.020
and so we'll see how long it lasts.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.290
If it sounds kind of mixed up maybe

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.130
if I forget something I'll
go back and tell you later.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.970
Let me start here, the picture
that you see on the screen,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:58.890
is of the administrative
district of Posen.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.740
And you see it on the top
in German and on the bottom

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.630
in Polish in abbreviation.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:13.850
And this is the intermediate level
of government between the province

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:17.190
of Posen and the city of Posen.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.940
So we have three levels
of government.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.950
Each called Posen.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.880
Very confusing.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:31.530 position:56%
Each had a very clearly defined
role, but you had to thread your way

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.300
through and get to the right
office to get the right thing done.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:42.740
Very very bureaucratic,
very pressuring.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.460
Let me tell you a little about
how I came to write the book.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:09:00.130
I was looking back in
1983, 1984 for a book

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.420 position:56%
that I knew had existed at one time.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:12.960
A compilation of what turned
out to be 5,134 names of Jews

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:24.810
who were naturalized, in the grand
Duchy of Posen in 1834 and 1835.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:32.670
Based upon a law promulgated
by the king in 1833.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:39.720
And on my very last, on
the next to the last day,

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.230
of my time in Berlin I asked

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.960
in what was then West
Berlin, at the state archives.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:54.420 position:56%
Where can I see a copy of that book?

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.550
And they said oh we have it.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.670
I said could you please
make me a copy?

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:01.070
Yes, come back tomorrow.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.550
And while I'm standing
there, they were making it

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.810
and I quick rushed
directly to the airplane.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:16.640
When I got home, I decided I saw a
need for publication of that book

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.770
and all though this is
not the first edition,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.800
this is the revised edition.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.630
Here it is.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:33.250 position:56%
And the library I believe has three
copies actually, plus they have the,

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.510
excuse me the 1987
edition of the book.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:47.220
And we estimate, or at least
I estimate that about 47.8%

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.290
of those naturalized
are represented.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.790
That means, not that
every name is there,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.970 position:56%
but rather essentially every family.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:05.160
Or 47.8% of all of the
families, the Jewish families

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.650
in Posen would be represented.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.590
So notice it's less than half.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:18.480
Not everyone was naturalized
as a Jewish citizen.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.660
It was not the same thing as
full citizenship, it was second

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.270
or third class citizenship.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:31.250
But it did give some rights,
more were given in 1847

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:38.360 position:56%
and the rest basically didn't occur
until after the fall of the kingdom.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.930
In other words until the
Weimar republic was proclaimed.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:51.230
That is not so different
from other places

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.400
in Britain they used
different criteria,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.050
but for example full
professors got six votes.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:03.550
Compared to, ordinary
citizens who got only one.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.050
And this would've been
until I think 1921

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.770
or something like that, in Britain.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:12.000
Has nothing directly to do
but it gives you a comparison.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:22.100
I'm not entirely sure how
much the audience knows

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.470
about the history, so forgive me.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.570
You can ask questions at
the end, if I have lost you.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:36.680
I wanted to show you next, yes.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.200 position:56%
This is Alexander Subkind Bernstein.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:48.020
Isn't it a marvelous portrait,
it's owned by a lady who works

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.680
at the Leo Baeck Institute in
New York City and her brother.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.640
And supposedly there were
originally 13 portraits.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:06.560
Probably one for the
wife and 11 children.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.500
So far as we know this
is the only one

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.790
that has survived it
was brought something

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.090
like in 1934 to the United States.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:19.660
Alexander Subkind Bernstein was
the, I guess we would say, sorry,

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.890
the vice president of the
Jewish Corporation in Schroda.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.430 position:56%
And so he was a man of some standing

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:33.050
but he was also obviously
a wealthy merchant.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:38.790
And it would have been quite common

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.280
to have portraits painted
like that at that time.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.330
To give you some general idea,
the book contains three maps,

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:52.980
this one is of Meseritz which
is in the northeast of Posen.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:14:00.390
This is the county or I'm not
sure if Christ is exactly county

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.440
but it's something similar.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:10.110
This is a rather rare map from
1848, this is the libraries,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.950
reproduction of the libraries copy.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:18.170
The book in which it's found is
not rare but the map itself is.

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:23.090
And because there are many editions
of the book, but without the map.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:27.050
The libraries copy is
with the map and I hope

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:33.460
that they will make a point of
securing it for that reason.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:39.220
And this is a kind of busy
difficult to read map,

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:45.820
but this is Posen Province in
1905, it's a quite common map

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.050
that can easily be found online.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.560
And you could enlarge it etcetera.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:58.590
If you notice, to the right, is
the Russian Empire and to the west

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.970
of course would be Berlin
and Brandenburg and so on.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.720
I wanted to include
those in the book,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.580
oh and by the way this
is the book right here.

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.970
In four bindings but it's one book.

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:19.230
And it has 14 different chapters
plus some additional information.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:24.330
The first chapter is
Landsmanshaftn, those are,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:32.260
for those who don't know what
that is, those are organizations

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:38.240
which looked after the
interests of the Jews locally.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:46.230
They were voluntary
associations and so some of them

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:52.460
for example would make loans,
usually it was a question

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.460
of burial and burial insurance.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.560
But it could have been
almost anything

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.990
that the community
felt in need to have.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:11.640
And it might encompass
visitations of the sick and so

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:17.730
that would be called [foreign word]
and other kinds of associations.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.710
There is a book published by
YIVO in New York which details

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:30.520
at least their holdings in New York
and may include some other places.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:38.020
I compiled the information from
the Jewish Theological Seminary,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:45.790
the Leo Baeck Institute and
various manuscripts listed

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:51.910
in holding of various entities.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:17:00.850 position:56%
I think I should tell you that I
used resources in the United States,

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:06.080
mostly New York and
Washington DC, but elsewhere.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.780
Also Denmark, France,
of course Germany

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.500
and Poland and oh and Brazil.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.640
I cannot say of course
that I caught everything

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.320
but I tried to catch quite a bit.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.910
And you can see it's
nearly 2,000 pages,

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.700
that's why it took me
more than 28 years.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:35.340
What I can say is that it's an
exhaustive list of Lansmanshaftn

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.200
to the best of my ability.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:45.700
The second chapter deals with
Mormon records, website resources

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:54.570
and especially the Amstsblatt of
the royal government of Posen.

00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:00.620
That's an interesting
publication in many ways.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:10.470
Because in the earlier
years, there was no newspaper

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.620
of general circulation
in the Province.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:17.200
And as a result you see ads
in the [foreign language],

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:25.340
the general notices which were
attached to the Amstsblatt,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:35.580
amsts is a location and
blatt is a newspaper.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.520
So it's a local newspaper.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:19:12.000
The, I was surprised when
I first started to look.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:21.730
The Amstsblatt are
for, were published

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.000
in almost all German
speaking locations.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.340
Okay. Thanks.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:37.510
The Amstsblatt were published
in various locations.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:44.780
Usually for every Province, thank
you, for every Province in Posen.

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:49.380
I'm sorry in Prussia, but
also the Austrians, the Swiss,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.710
many others had similar
publications and the Library

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.400
of Congress has many of these.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.390
Also most of them are now online

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.540
and can be searched
even from your own home.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.650
However you do need some
knowledge of German.

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:12.870
The, what really surprised me
was that in [foreign language]

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:18.520
of the attachment to
the Amstsblatt itself,

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:23.030
in the early years one
frequently found out in Hebrew.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:29.060
Because there was no other
place of general availability

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.020
of this kind of information.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:40.010
That did not continue
once there were newspapers

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:44.000
of general circulation
in the Province.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:59.200
Next, there were, I discussed
German archival holdings.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:09.670 position:56%
That's a difficult problem in a way,
because on the 29th of January 1945,

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:19.070
the retreating German army set fire
to the then Pol's and archives.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:24.140
Burning everything that was in it
except for 80 chests of documents

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:29.600
which were taken away and we
don't know what happened to those.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.310
Perhaps they're in some salt
mine or something like that.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.250
We don't know.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.310
You would think that they probably
would have been found by now,

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.810
if they were going to be found.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.610
It's a great loss.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:56.430
But in 1919 a German Jewish
archivist inventoried the entire

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:02.050
collection and published
it and I have reproduced

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:08.920
in my book the listing
of what was destroyed.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.150
So at least we know what
doesn't exist anymore

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.010
or if it does exist,
has not been found.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:23.290
A great shame but the, not
everything was in that archives

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:27.430
and so other things
that did survive are now

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.470
in the current archives in Poznan.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.270
And are available for
legitimate researchers.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:43.720
It's amazing what they did manage
to collect and I had lunch once

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:51.170
with one archival curator
and told me,

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.960
he told me just the
previous week he came

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:02.360
across valuable documents hidden
from the Nazi's in a barn.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:09.610
And only discovered long after the
death of whoever hid those items.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.430
So things are sometimes
still being discovered.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.760
It's getting rarer and
rarer but it is happening

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.100
and the Pol's have
made a determination

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.090
that they will pretty
much put older,

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.870
older archival documents
online eventually,

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.020
but it's such a large collection

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:38.620
that it will take many many
years before they finish.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:51.220
Next I looked at Polish archives
and it's of a similar nature

00:23:51.220 --> 00:24:03.120
and mostly available in the
state archives in Poznan.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:12.360
But, you can't be sure of that
because of the various upsets,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.680
not only in World War Two
but also in World War One

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.720
where there was a lot of fighting

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:22.730
in Poznan Province,
today the Wielkopolska.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.430
Things got displaced and
sometimes they have been shifted

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:33.730
to the supposedly correct
archive and sometimes not.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:41.380
So, you basically have to look very
carefully to see where something is

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.870
that you want to, to find.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.350
It's serendipitous and you
just have to keep looking.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.500
Next I dealt with Israeli
archival sources.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:07.990
Most of the archival resources
are in one place in Jerusalem.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.270
The central archives for the
history of the Jewish people.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.280
But again not everything.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:22.500
Some things are in strange
places, you find archival documents

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:28.210
that are not Landsmanshaftn related
in the Jewish Theological Seminary

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:33.750
in New York or in the Leo Baeck
Institute or in YIVO which is

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:39.460
in the same building and I have
tried to pull it all together

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:45.130
or as much as I can, to help people
understand what they can look

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:47.240
for and where.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.340
Basically trying to make it
easier on researchers who want

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.620
to write books or dissertations,
thesis, whatever.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:05.800
I also have a listing
about onomastics.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.740
And again I tried to be
as thorough as possible,

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:17.930
I'm sure I missed things but
it's a fairly complete list.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:22.270
And then I went on
to city directories.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:27.050
With respect to towns that
were formerly in Posen.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:35.130
Oh, by the way on the
onomastics, the names,

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:42.170
the Prussians had some very
specific rules as to adopting names

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.720
and what names could
be adopted, etcetera.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.090
The big difference was unless
it was prohibited by the rules,

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.500
Jews in Prussia could
adopt any name they wanted,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.080
that is not necessarily true in
some of the other German states.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.710
But it was in Prussia.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:15.400
I did try to make an exhaustive
list of known city directories

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:21.180
so that you can see who is listed.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.600
Usually the head of household only.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.870
Not often anyone else
but remember that widows

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:33.450
and spinsters would have been
considered heads of households.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.730
Generally that's how you find out
about women in city directories.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:42.150
Otherwise generally not, I'm
sure there are some exceptions,

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.450
but generally not.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:50.690
Please excuse me I have a cold.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:59.800
I asked a friend of mine, Professor
Krzysztof Makowski who is head

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:05.990 position:56%
of Judaic studies at Adam Mickiewicz
University in Poznan what he knew

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.450
about money, weights and
measures from the period.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.750
And he said that he
didn't know anything

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:17.430
and you know the person
most likely to know.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:23.310
So as a result I wrote a chapter
on money, weights and measures

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:31.890
and you can look there to see what
would have been the then current,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:38.030
currency or units of
measurement of various kinds.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.410
And so far as I know
it's the only place

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.510
where that information has been
generally collected although you

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:51.000
could probably do the same thing I
did and put it together yourself.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:07.350
Next I worked on all of the Jewish
high school graduates in Posen.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.290
Most people don't know that
the state library in Berlin

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:19.310
in its second cellar has the
largest collection of yearbooks

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.800
from high schools in the world.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.390
I know they have Scotland
for example

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.870
and I don't know specifically but
I have every reason to believe

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.060
that they would have one
of the greatest collections

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.440
of high school yearbooks
even from the United States.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:42.810
I spent many many days
in that second cellar

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:47.580 position:56%
and when I got finished because
many of those books hadn't been used

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:53.330
in ages, my hands we
absolutely black.

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:59.450
I photo copied as much as I
could, everything that they had

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.580
because it lists for boys.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:12.110
Their names, birth
dates, place of birth,

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:16.590
fathers profession whether alive
or dead and fathers location,

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:21.230
interestingly though not
the name of the father.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:28.260
And the last entry would be the
current situation of the boy

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:35.950
when he had left the school
and if there's an asterisk next

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.250
to his name, that's one thing

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.660
about the Prussians
they were consistent in,

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.110
everybody in Prussia had to do
the same thing at the same time.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:51.040
And these yearbooks
were compiled until 1915

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.900
when the war situation
became impossible

00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.590
and so there were none
produced in 1916, 17 or 18.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:07.920 position:56%
In 1919 or 1920 the Pol's began
again to do that sort of collection.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.890 position:56%
But of course with a very
different population in the schools.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.700
And some but very few Jews.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:22.350
I stopped with the
German ones in 1915.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:31.340
The thing that's interesting about
the lucky girls who managed to go

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:37.410
to high school is the fathers name
is provided, unlike for the boys.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:42.640
So it's a great help if you're
doing genealogical research.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.140
Keep in mind that girls going

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:52.730
to high school are a very
privileged group at that time.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:58.010 position:56%
So the chances of finding somebody
unless they were relatively rich was

00:31:58.010 --> 00:32:01.220
small if they were
girls and even the boys.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.950
A lot of the boys didn't go

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.700
or if they did go they may well
not have graduated high school.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:18.640
But I think that I got every
single school and in some cases

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.350
when the state library in Berlin
did not have the information I went

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.840
elsewhere and selected it.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.030
And although I didn't
do the Christians,

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.980
I turned over the original
records or the photocopies

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.920
of the original records
to the Leo Baeck Institute

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.570
where they can be found in
the Edward Luft collection

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.280
and you can check on the
Christians as well as the Jews.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:54.760
Then comes the main
part of my book which is

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:04.650
about 9,000 annotated entries
on, from articles, books,

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:10.630
whatever about the Jews of
Posen during the period.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.770
I included the Library of
Congress call number if I found it

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.070
at the Library of Congress.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:19.680
And by the way obviously
if it's annotated I looked

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.910
at every single item in the book,
that's why it took me so long.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:30.620
If I didn't find it here, but I
found it at the New York Public,

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:35.290
I put in the New York
Public Library call number.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:40.590
If I didn't find it there, I looked

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.840
in the Leo Baeck Institute
or in YIVO.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.670
As I've said both in the same,
excuse me, same location.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:52.280
And put in their call number.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:55.300
If not, in any of those places,

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:59.020
then wherever I did find
it and that call number.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.950
If it was in the United States,

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:05.040
if it was in a foreign country
I indicated not only the name

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.130
of the holding institution
but also the country.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:16.060
Some of the items are
Portuguese, some in Russian.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:23.070
It's amazing how many
different cultures dealt

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:27.270
with scholarly articles
on the Jews of Posen.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.230
I was quite surprised, Maya
Bowebine [assumed spelling]

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:34.860
for example wrote some
articles in Russian.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.780
By the way he also spoke English.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:45.920
And then two chapters on maps.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:54.940
The first chapter being maps,
that is map series, gazetteers,

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.700
aerial photographs and books
containing maps of Posen.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:07.970
The second chapter is
listings of the maps themselves

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:14.410
and the call numbers because
in a large number of cases,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.910
I listed maps in the
British Library.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:23.310
They have been collecting for far
longer than the Library of Congress

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.190
and they have a large number
of maps that the Library

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.250
of Congress does not have.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:35.670
But that doesn't mean that it's
worth going there necessarily

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.660
because the Library of
Congress collections

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:43.840
and the New York Public
Library are so good

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.400
that unless you really need
something of a specific date,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:55.860
you probably can make do with
what the Library of Congress has.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.790
And if not almost certainly
between the Library

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:03.620 position:56%
of Congress and the New York Public.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.960
So unless you want that specific
map you probably don't need

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.830
to go to London.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.150
Although I have.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:21.030
The last chapter, the
last full chapter is,

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:25.050
a chapter on synagogues
and cemeteries.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:28.310
Because a lot of people
have written about those

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:31.340
in what is today Wielkopolska.

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.880
And so for those interested
one can go there.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.100
I'll just add something
that's not in the book.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:49.060
And that is that so many Jews
from Posen migrated to Berlin

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:56.650
that when I went through
the largest Jewish cemetery

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.780
in Berlin, Weibensee.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.660
I was astounded by how few
grave stones were listing people

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.820
who were not from Posen.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:12.370
Just amazing, just amazing what
percentage there were in Berlin,

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:22.800
so many in fact that until the
Nazi's shut the publication down,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:35.120
there was a publication that was
dedicated exclusively to Jews

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:42.280
from Posen living in Berlin.

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:49.070
And the Library of Congress
does have a microfilm

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:52.510
with most of those issues.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:59.180
And I have tried to
list them also there.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:04.010
I want to say something
about something else,

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:10.860
my friend Angelica Elmoncruga and
her husband [inaudible] knowing

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:19.160
that I was working on Posen, did
not dwell very strongly on Posen.

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:25.090
When they produced this CD, this
is the Library of Congress copy.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:32.280
Nearly 32,000 annotated
titles on the Jews of Germany

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:36.910
from early modern times until
the end of World War Two.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:42.780
An incredible amount of work,
published by Harrassowitz,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.440
one of the leading
publishers in Germany.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:54.920
And I would recommend that if you
don't find somebody in my book,

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.250
you might want to look here to see.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:01.570
I had a question earlier about Link

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:05.810
and Blan [assumed spelling]
two different family names.

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:14.310 position:56%
While we didn't find anything in
the list of 5,134 people naturalized

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:21.150
in Posen, this is probably worth
a look under those circumstances

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.660
to see what there might be.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:28.860
And this would be available
through Hebraic section here.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.370
Let me just show you one
more picture in the book,

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:43.430
this is Akiva Eger the last
[inaudible] of Posen walking

00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:45.710
in a street, this is
actually as [foreign language]

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:51.220 position:56%
but supposedly it's Posen, it's not,
in fact it's probably Eisenstadt

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:57.200
which is where Akiva Eger was
born in what is today Austria,

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.050
but at that time was
Hungary in Burgenland.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:05.040
And I don't know which one is which

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:10.170
but the other two are his
two rabbinical assistants.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:22.010
I did include a partial list of
Posen city death records for Jews,

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:25.710
the problem is that in many
cases there's no last names,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.270
so you have to have some
general idea of the person.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.650
I did put in as much as I could

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.000
and when I found somebody
listed in my book.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:48.000
The naturalized Jews
I did note it in,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:56.630
in the relevant chapter
in that book.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:08.820
So, that's essentially, oh by
the way the source of those names

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:14.110 position:56%
from the Posen city death registry
was from a film that the Mormons had

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.890
and they had no idea
what it was about.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.970
None at all, so I told them.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.650
So you do find something strange.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.930
I don't know what else to tell you.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:33.930
The book ends with a little
bit about me and a link

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:38.630
to where you can find
out some of my work.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.000
Perhaps you would like
to copy that down.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.390
Here is what the page looks like.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:42:03.730 position:56%
And there are currently nine entries
there may be some additional entries

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:08.210
in the future, but
that is in my view some

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:16.000
of the most important things to do
this kind of research and again.

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:25.000
I don't know how to get back there.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.000
Sorry can you help me get
back to the previous page?

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:51.100
Good. For those interested, right.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:57.540
For those interested this is a
bibliography of my publications,

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:02.580
it is approximately 200
entries, a little bit more.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.810
So now if anyone has any
questions I'll try to respond.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.110
Anyone?

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:16.370
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you very
much David it was a wonderful

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:21.170
presentation and very focused
on the type of work that we do

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.830
which is collect sources
and bring them together

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:27.170
in work as you have done.

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.310
And I'm just curious, why
did you set up doing this?

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:36.310
What is the motivation and
kept you going for 28 years?

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:40.540
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Well the real
motivation was the first book.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:45.080
Having discovered it after
looking so long and not finding it,

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.420
it was nowhere in the United
States as it turns out.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:53.070
Later I discovered that there were
actually two [inaudible] copies.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:44:01.070
But the more complete copy was at
Adam Mickiewicz Library in Poznan

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:06.450
and I tried to take as
much information from that

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:11.100
as I could I believe that it is
a complete copy whereas the one

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.580
that I found in Berlin
was not quite complete.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:21.260
And then it seemed
obvious and it ended

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:25.760 position:56%
up that the tail was wagging the dog
because you can see how much smaller

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:31.040
that book is, than the
2,000 pages of this one.

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.450
It was like topsy, it
just growed you know.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:41.110
And so, once I got
started, typical person

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:43.900
that I am, I just couldn't stop.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:48.260
Til finally I said okay, that's
it, I drew a line underneath

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.620
and said I'm not doing anymore.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.100
Yes Ma'am?

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.500
&gt;&gt; Did you trace your
family to Poznan?

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.800
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Oh yes.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.280
Interestingly none of
them lived in the city.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.580
I'm sorry?

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.900
&gt;&gt; Main motivation for researching?

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:07.580
And what happened to the
Jews when the Nazi's came?

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: They were rounded up
and sent to death camps generally.

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:17.640 position:56%
But there weren't very many anymore.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:22.030
Most of them who were going
to leave left by 1923.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.460
The overwhelming majority
went to Berlin,

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:30.690
some went to the Ruhr Valley
especially Essen and some migrated

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:33.110 position:56%
to the United States, not very many.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:37.370
Okay. I think Darren first.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.030
&gt;&gt; What percentage of
the information came

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:44.270
from the Library of Congress?

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.490
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: I never
actually calculated it

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:49.390
but I would say the
overwhelming majority.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:55.910
Okay we had some other
people, this gentleman.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:01.360
&gt;&gt; So the title is,
The Naturalization?

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.110
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: No, The
Jews of, which book?

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:06.410
The big one?

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:10.070
&gt;&gt; I saw one over here on the side.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:17.580
To deal with the naturalization.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:19.290
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: This one.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.410 position:56%
This one? Well, can everybody see it

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:26.240
or shall I just say it's the
Naturalized Jews of the Grand Duchy

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:32.140
of Posen in 1834 and
1835, catchy title right.

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.570
&gt;&gt; Why would they hide the book?

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.110
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Well, before

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.720
that time they weren't
considered citizens.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:45.080
Naturalization made them citizens
and gave them certain rights.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:50.770 position:56%
But they had to meet certain
criteria in order to be naturalized.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.740
Basically they had to be what
the Spaniards would have called,

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.710
Hidalgos, sons of somebody.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:01.960
In this case mostly
because they had money.

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:06.710
There were restrictions
on living in Posen,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.320
on marrying etcetera
unless they were citizens.

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:16.030
And the government took a
chance, they had no way of knowing

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:20.540
if the Jews would accept
the idea of this sort

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:22.090
of second class citizenship.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:27.030
And they were very very
relieved when Akiva Eger showed

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:32.700
up to be naturalized under
his German name, Akiva Eger.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:38.450
And he is in the book therefore.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.510
Professor.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:48:20.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.460
I think we're going to have
to just let me answer that one

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:29.270
because otherwise we could
be here several years.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.960
&gt;&gt; Can you repeat the questions?

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.260
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Yes.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:39.770
Professor Dovey wants to
know about the social impact

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:48.050
of three partitions
of Poland on the Jews.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.870
The Pol's and Jews were sort
of in the middle if you will.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:49:00.110
Between German Jews and the
what I'll callmthe Russian Jews.

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:07.430
And so they were not always
observant, not always knowledgeable

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.190
but they didn't want to admit that.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:14.170
Most German Jews were
very proud of the fact

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.160
that they did not speak Yiddish.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:22.610
Most Pol's and Jews did
speak Yiddish but especially

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:27.180
in later times might of have
been reluctant to admit it.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:35.840
And there was always this tension
between reform and orthodox.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:43.010
They were both congregations
in the city of Posen,

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.710
but the orthodox was larger.

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:52.940
Nevertheless there were a
large number of professionals.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:58.680
Many of those professionals,
but not all, were reformed Jews.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:03.720
They were orthodox Jews who were
professionals even if we take

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:09.480
out the rabbi's who of course
would be more heavily represented

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.780
among orthodoxy.

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:16.510
Any other, yes sir.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:20.080
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.970
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: That is
a matter of some debate

00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:26.410
which I discussed in this book.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:30.020
I'm doing this out of my head,

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:36.620
but if I remember I estimated
that it's about 55,000.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.920
&gt;&gt; Oh it's not that large then.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:44.350
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: No and yet
it is a huge percentage

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.370
of the Jews of Germany.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:49.880
Keep in mind that at
its greatest extent,

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:55.440
German Jews were only
600,000 in 60 million.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.820
But if you read the
book, [foreign language]

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:02.210
or in English Germany without Jews.

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:10.800
You can see an examination of
the impact that the Jews had

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.850
on German society, I
would recommend that book

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:17.000
and by the way it's written
by a Christian, not by a Jew.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:30.640
Basically it's very difficult, if
you not only look at which Jews

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:36.210
from Germany obtained
Nobel Laureates,

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:39.290
but also look at those
whose [foreign language],

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:47.250
the faculty adviser of those who
won Nobel Prizes among Germans,

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:51.550
it rises to an astounding 99%.

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:56.700
By the way, you have
to carve out those

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:01.120
who won Nobel Laureates
in literature.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.280
Which makes some sense
because after all we're talking

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.790
about German culture there.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:08.890
But in the sciences and
in the social sciences

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.540
which the Germans don't always
distinguish between those two,

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.240
there's one word in German.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:20.870
It's 99%. Now remember
this is not just Jews,

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:27.910
this is those who are either Jews
or whose faculty adviser was a Jew.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:31.980 position:56%
That's a little bit off my topic
but I thought it's worth mentioning.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.280
Yes sir?

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.840
&gt;&gt; Mister Luft the related
question on population.

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.510
Express as a percentage
for the migration.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:46.360
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.700
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: I don't know
and we know that as early

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.660
as 1800 there was an
out migration of Jews.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.470
Out of Posen.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:53:00.560
So you'd have to know which year
and then look at the census,

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:09.140
there are census records that the
Germans kept to tell exactly that

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:14.530
and you could also look at
the minority census of 1939,

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:23.990
compiled by the Nazi's to see how
many Jews were left at that time.

00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:29.770
In that portion of Posen which
was still part of Germany.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:34.980
Because not all of it was,
the Rump area was put together

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.100
as Posen [inaudible] and made

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:46.150
into an administrative
area basically a Province.

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:50.920
&gt;&gt; I realize that you're the expert
and I'm the generalist I was hoping

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.650
for some general kind of figure.

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:56.920
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Never more than
ten, never more than ten percent.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:02.050
But you'd have to know the
specific year, etcetera but all

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:06.340
of that is knowable,
you could look it up.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.960
Anything else?

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:16.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask another question.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:20.750
But why were the boys
fathers names not mentioned

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.420
on the records of the schools?

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.060
You said the girls
were but not the boys.

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.200
&gt;&gt; Edward Luft: Well the girls
were going to get married

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.980
and not have a profession.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.030
The boys presumably
would have a profession

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:40.060
and that was the German
bureaucracy's way of dealing

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.850
with it, I don't really
know, I can only speculate.

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:48.150
And after all the surname
will be the same.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:51.780
And they're not really
interested in the father.

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.810
Although interestingly
they're very interested

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:57.740
in the fathers profession.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.400
They're interested in
the boy who graduated.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.950
Some of whom by the way
if they have that asterisk

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:11.560
by their name are even excused from
taking the final oral examination.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.510
Because their grades
are so high etcetera.

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:20.450
And therefore I presume that it
would be quite well documented

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:23.010
who they where and where
they came from etcetera.

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.310 position:56%
We know of course the town from
which they came and the fathers town

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:30.670
which is usually but
not always the same.

00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:34.660
And some of those people
usually non-Jews but not only,

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:41.820
would come from Russia or
other places to be educated.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.400
Commonly those high schools
taught a second language

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:49.140
as French and English.

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:56.010 position:56%
And later, there were Jewish
religion teachers just like Catholic

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.930
and Protestant religion teachers.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:02.220
And in some of the larger schools
there was two tracks German

00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:04.930
or Polish.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:10.440
So it, those were pretty
liberal places for the times.

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:17.960
But the rules about what went into
the yearbook was set in Berlin.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:20.120
Not locally.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:24.730
So, they didn't have any choice
about what they reported.

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:26.160
&gt;&gt;Sharon Horowitz: Thank you.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.960
Thank you very much.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:31.190
[ Applause ]

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:35.350
If Mister Luft has energy and
anyone wants to talk to him

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:40.740 position:56%
about the more personal or extensive
questions I think he'll stay

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.300
and talk with you later but
I just want to thank you all

00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.910
for coming and thank Mister Luft.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.710

you, for having me.
