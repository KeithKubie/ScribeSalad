00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:01.531
- [Instructor] In previous videos

00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:02.948
we talk about GDP

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:07.995
as the market value of
final goods and services

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:13.172
produced in a country
in a given time period,

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:15.248
let's say in a given year

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:16.373
and we gave the example

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:19.973
of producing jeans where
maybe the farmer helps produce

00:00:19.973 --> 00:00:22.946
the cotton and then the thread maker

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:24.928
takes that cotton and makes thread

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:28.728
and then the fabric maker takes the thread

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.035
and makes fabric and then the jean maker

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.136
takes the fabric and produces jeans

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:37.610
and then the market value
of those jeans was $50

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.122
and so, assuming all of
this happened in one year,

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:44.032
in the time period that
we're measuring GDP for,

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:46.908
then we would just count the $50,

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.354
if we're looking at the final market value

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:51.931
or the market value of
final goods and services.

00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.261
You would say the GDP for
at least for this component

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.094
of the GDP from these jeans is $50

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.923
but I do wanna clarify

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:03.724
that there are multiple ways

00:01:03.724 --> 00:01:05.314
that you can measure GDP

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:06.411
and you could even think about it

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.661
from a value added approach

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:14.186
but the key idea is no
matter how you measure it

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.756
you should get to the same value,

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:20.048
so let's think about
the various actors here

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:22.653
and what their value add was.

00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:27.222
So, first, let's think about
the framer right over here.

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:29.583
So, this is the farmer,

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.011
my not so elegantly drawn rectangle

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.560
around what he's doing.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.477
So, the farmer's value add is what?

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:42.516
Well, before you just had some dirt

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:44.488
and things and so, maybe you could say

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:45.709
that the market value was zero

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.448
and then he's able to produce something

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:48.893
or she's able to produce something

00:01:48.893 --> 00:01:51.296
that now has a market value of $10,

00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:53.463
so their value add is $10.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.727
Now, from there, the cotton
goes to the thread maker.

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:03.944
The threader maker they
take that $10 cotton,

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:07.718
so this is thread maker,

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:12.181
they take the $10 cotton

00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:15.063
and are able to produce
$20 worth of thread?

00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:17.565
What is their value add?

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:18.815
Value add here?

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.976
Well, they took something worth $10

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.772
and they were able to do something to it

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:26.664
to make it worth $20,

00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:29.747
so their value add is now another $10

00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:33.093
and then, this is the thread maker,

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:37.010
and then from there it
goes to the fabric maker

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:40.898
and I think you see where this is going,

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:42.802
the fabric maker is this part

00:02:42.802 --> 00:02:44.052
of our process,

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:46.462
fabric maker

00:02:50.723 --> 00:02:52.968
and their value add is what?

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:56.107
Pause this video and think about it.

00:02:56.107 --> 00:02:58.188
Well, they take something worth $20

00:02:58.188 --> 00:03:00.562
and they're to turn it into something

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:02.446
that has a market value of $30,

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.111
so their value add is also $10

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.716
and then last but not least,

00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:09.074
you have the jean company,

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:11.409
so the jean manufacturer,

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.928
I'll call them the jean producer,

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:17.095
the jean producer, they take something

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:21.766
that has a market value of $30

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:24.923
and they're able to sell it for $50,

00:03:24.923 --> 00:03:26.923
so their value add here,

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:32.260
if you take something for
30 and you make it worth 50,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.837
then you've added $20 of value

00:03:34.837 --> 00:03:37.858
and so, the value added approach to GDP

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:40.506
will just sum up these value adds,

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:44.332
so this is going to be
this $10 from the farmer

00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:47.147
plus the value add of the thread maker,

00:03:47.147 --> 00:03:49.647
plus $10 from the thread maker

00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:54.237
plus $10 from the fabric maker

00:03:58.408 --> 00:03:59.241
plus $20

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:03.878
from the jean maker

00:04:03.878 --> 00:04:06.585
and what will that all add up to?

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:09.356
Well, that's all going to
add up to 10 plus 10 is 20

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:11.689
plus 10 is 30 plus 20 is $50

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:16.704
and lucky for us that is
added up to the same amount

00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:18.191
as we had before where we just looked

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.994
at the market value of the
final goods and services.

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:25.172
Now, one benefit of the
value added approach

00:04:25.172 --> 00:04:29.165
is that real supply
chains are quite complex

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:31.374
and things might be going from one country

00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:34.032
to another, they might
as we've talked about

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:38.032
in another video, the year
might end right over here

00:04:38.032 --> 00:04:40.972
and so, when something is made in China

00:04:40.972 --> 00:04:42.944
and there's value add in China

00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:44.729
but then it's shipped to the US

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.006
and some value add is placed on it

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.216
and then it's shipped
back to China or Mexico,

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:50.703
you have to be careful

00:04:50.703 --> 00:04:53.626
to only count the value add in the country

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.596
for which you are measuring the GDP.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:59.653
So, that's one useful
way or one useful reason,

00:04:59.653 --> 00:05:02.261
or one way in which the
value added approach

00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.042
might be useful.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:06.566
The key idea though is that you're getting

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:07.824
to the same value.

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:09.025
You should get to the same value

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:12.534
as the market value of the
final goods and services

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:14.812
produced in a given time period.
