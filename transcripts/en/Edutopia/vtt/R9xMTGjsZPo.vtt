00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:04.746
&gt;&gt;Beth: Setting SMART goals is a
great way to practice what it feels

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:08.506
like to have self-control, to
have control over your destiny.

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:12.586
&gt;&gt;Amy: It's so important to allow
children to set their own goals,

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.946
because if we're setting
them for them,

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:18.556
it may not have any relevance
to the student at all.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.636
&gt;&gt;Beth: The "S" in the SMART
goal talks about being specific.

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:26.476
Natalie, how did you set a specific
goal about improving on the flute?

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:30.306
&gt;&gt;Student: I said I would
learn how to play low E

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:31.946
and F sharp on the flute.

00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:34.686
&gt;&gt;Beth: So that's very specific,
rather than just saying,

00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:35.716
"I'm gonna better at this."

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:38.526
The "M" in SMART stands
for measurable.

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:41.426
Aiden, tell us how you planned

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:43.756
to measure whether you
had achieved your goal.

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.746
&gt;&gt;Student: With my goal, I was
trying to reduce my race time

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:50.516
to forty-seven seconds, so
with each race and each time,

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.046
I could see how far I got.

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:54.646
&gt;&gt;Beth: And you were able to say,
you know, "I went from this amount

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:55.746
of time to this amount of time."

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:57.596
So that, you can measure
that really readily.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.116
The "A" stands for attainable.

00:01:00.306 --> 00:01:04.316
Kennedy, you had a goal about soccer,
but if I look outside right now,

00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:08.886
it's not exactly soccer
season, so how did you do that?

00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:11.006
&gt;&gt;Student: I practiced
in my basement,

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:14.446
and whenever I could
at indoor soccer.

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:18.416
&gt;&gt;Beth: So Ellie, you didn't
set out to learn calculus,

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:22.776
you set out to become more fluent and
more accurate in your long division.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:26.406
Gavin, I wanted to ask you about
the "T" part of the SMART goal,

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:28.126
which is that it's time sensitive.

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:32.226
You decided you wanted to read
three of the Warriors books,

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:34.086
and how long did you
give yourself for that?

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:34.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Three weeks.

00:01:35.436 --> 00:01:39.286
&gt;&gt;Beth: So three books in three
weeks, and that is a very helpful way

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:41.026
to stay focused on your goal.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:43.566
Say, "Oh, someday I'm gonna
read these three books."

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:47.916
If you say, "In three weeks, I'm
gonna read these three books,"

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:49.456
then that's a great way
to help you stay focused

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:50.976
and help you have the self-control
you need to reach your goal.
