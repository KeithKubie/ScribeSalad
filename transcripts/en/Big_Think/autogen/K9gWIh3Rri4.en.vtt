guess the best way to get at this is
sort of to give you a little snapshot of

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110
sort of to give you a little snapshot of
 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.460
sort of to give you a little snapshot of
Yemen because i think when talking about

really really easy to become overwhelmed
 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.970
really really easy to become overwhelmed
by just the the totality of the crises

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980
by just the the totality of the crises
 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.699
by just the the totality of the crises
that the country faces and so I tend to

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709
that the country faces and so I tend to
 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.590
that the country faces and so I tend to
view the country as having these three

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
view the country as having these three
 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.140
view the country as having these three
separate layers of crises if you will at

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150
separate layers of crises if you will at
 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.420
separate layers of crises if you will at
the top there's this elite rivalry

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430
the top there's this elite rivalry
 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.610
the top there's this elite rivalry
there's the struggle for power this is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
there's the struggle for power this is
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.980
there's the struggle for power this is
taking place behind closed doors but

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990
taking place behind closed doors but
 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.020
taking place behind closed doors but
it's something that really I think

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030
it's something that really I think
 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.870
it's something that really I think
affects all the other levels of layers

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880
affects all the other levels of layers
 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.110
affects all the other levels of layers

heads of snakes and this is something

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
heads of snakes and this is something
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.430
heads of snakes and this is something
that he's done very very well but it's

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440
that he's done very very well but it's
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.890
that he's done very very well but it's
something that increasingly it seems as

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900
something that increasingly it seems as
 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.480
something that increasingly it seems as
if he's losing a little bit of his grip

if he's losing a little bit of his grip
 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.640
if he's losing a little bit of his grip
now whether this is just because he's

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
now whether this is just because he's
 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.800
now whether this is just because he's
getting older or whether this is because

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
getting older or whether this is because
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.690

then below this we have in this second
 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.070
then below this we have in this second
layer if you will we have a trio of

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080
layer if you will we have a trio of

ruthie rebellion that I referenced
earlier and then the calls for secession

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:17.459
earlier and then the calls for secession
 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:20.509
earlier and then the calls for secession
from the south so these the this trio of

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:20.519
from the south so these the this trio of
 

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:22.909
from the south so these the this trio of
security challenges I think really

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919
security challenges I think really
 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.059
security challenges I think really
grabbed the majority of the headlines in

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:25.069
grabbed the majority of the headlines in
 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:27.439
