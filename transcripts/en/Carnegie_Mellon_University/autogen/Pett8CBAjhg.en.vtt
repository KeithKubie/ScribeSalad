out of this notion of structural

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:41.820
out of this notion of structural
 

01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:46.239
out of this notion of structural
adjustment alright so with the economy

01:16:46.239 --> 01:16:46.249
adjustment alright so with the economy
 

01:16:46.249 --> 01:16:50.870
adjustment alright so with the economy
just kind of bottoming out during the

01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880
just kind of bottoming out during the
 

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.100
just kind of bottoming out during the
late 70s and early 80's all right with

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:55.110
late 70s and early 80's all right with
 

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:58.520
late 70s and early 80's all right with
the depletion of the CD with the

01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:58.530
the depletion of the CD with the
 

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:03.669
the depletion of the CD with the
problems of structural adjustment where

01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679
problems of structural adjustment where
 

01:17:03.679 --> 01:17:08.540
problems of structural adjustment where
the notion of public water that was

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:08.550
the notion of public water that was
 

01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:12.319
the notion of public water that was
connected to kind of accountability with

01:17:12.319 --> 01:17:12.329
connected to kind of accountability with
 

01:17:12.329 --> 01:17:17.180
connected to kind of accountability with
the public water system in Gotham that

01:17:17.180 --> 01:17:17.190
the public water system in Gotham that
 

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:18.379
the public water system in Gotham that
there became movements toward

01:17:18.379 --> 01:17:18.389
there became movements toward
 

01:17:18.389 --> 01:17:24.890
there became movements toward
privatization where the forestry then

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900
privatization where the forestry then
 

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:29.919
privatization where the forestry then
became open to private businesses that

01:17:29.919 --> 01:17:29.929
became open to private businesses that
 

01:17:29.929 --> 01:17:34.430
became open to private businesses that
had a very negative effect on ponds and

01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440
had a very negative effect on ponds and
 

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.399
had a very negative effect on ponds and
streams because many people would get

01:17:37.399 --> 01:17:37.409
streams because many people would get
 

01:17:37.409 --> 01:17:38.150
streams because many people would get
their pond

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:38.160
their pond
 

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:40.700
their pond
would go to the water and get get the

01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:40.710
would go to the water and get get the
 

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:42.230
would go to the water and get get the
water from these certain pounds and

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:42.240
water from these certain pounds and
 

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:47.720
water from these certain pounds and
strange the other thing that would

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:47.730
strange the other thing that would
 

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:52.700
strange the other thing that would
happen is there was this large migration

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:52.710
happen is there was this large migration
 

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:56.650
happen is there was this large migration
from the rural areas into the cities

01:17:56.650 --> 01:17:56.660
from the rural areas into the cities
 

01:17:56.660 --> 01:18:02.630
from the rural areas into the cities
that was not able to service this this

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640
that was not able to service this this
 

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.600
that was not able to service this this
very heightened population of people all

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:05.610
very heightened population of people all
 

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:10.580
very heightened population of people all
right and that also retallick on the

01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:10.590
right and that also retallick on the
 

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:14.360
right and that also retallick on the
water system so it was a combination I

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:14.370
water system so it was a combination I
 

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:16.190
water system so it was a combination I
think of the economy changing from

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.200
think of the economy changing from
 

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.600
think of the economy changing from
structural adjustment it was a

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:17.610
structural adjustment it was a
 

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:23.360
structural adjustment it was a
combination of the CD and the value of

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:23.370
combination of the CD and the value of
 

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:27.080
combination of the CD and the value of
the gun and currency reaching a bottom

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:27.090
the gun and currency reaching a bottom
 

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:34.090
the gun and currency reaching a bottom
it was also the problem of folks not

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:34.100
it was also the problem of folks not
 

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.190
it was also the problem of folks not
having the kind of employment they had

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:37.200
having the kind of employment they had
 

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.080
having the kind of employment they had
before and there was a kind of

01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:39.090
before and there was a kind of
 

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:48.290
before and there was a kind of
middle-class force in Ghana that was

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300
middle-class force in Ghana that was
 

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:51.140
middle-class force in Ghana that was
able to support through taxation and

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:51.150
able to support through taxation and
 

01:18:51.150 --> 01:18:54.410
able to support through taxation and
through a kind of distribution of labor

01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:54.420
through a kind of distribution of labor
 

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:59.900
through a kind of distribution of labor
that was able to then reinvigorate the

01:18:59.900 --> 01:18:59.910
that was able to then reinvigorate the
 

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:05.830
that was able to then reinvigorate the
way the the pipe structure worked and

01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840
way the the pipe structure worked and
 

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.060
way the the pipe structure worked and
but let me just say this one of the most

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:11.070
but let me just say this one of the most
 

01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:15.940
but let me just say this one of the most
difficult problems was this large

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:15.950
difficult problems was this large
 

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:18.890
difficult problems was this large
migration pattern that happened from the

01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900
migration pattern that happened from the
 

01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:21.320
migration pattern that happened from the
villages to the cities where there was

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:21.330
villages to the cities where there was
 

01:19:21.330 --> 01:19:25.340
villages to the cities where there was
one piped water source it began then

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:25.350
one piped water source it began then
 

01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:27.590
one piped water source it began then
when people in the in certain village

01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600
when people in the in certain village
 

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.060
when people in the in certain village
areas would go to the pond the time

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:29.070
areas would go to the pond the time
 

01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:31.010
areas would go to the pond the time

with you today more those scenes that I

with you today more those scenes that I
 

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:43.450
with you today more those scenes that I
wrote ok so the scenes that you saw

based on my field work so I think the

based on my field work so I think the
 

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.690
based on my field work so I think the
question comes out of that as well

01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:49.700
question comes out of that as well
 

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.870
