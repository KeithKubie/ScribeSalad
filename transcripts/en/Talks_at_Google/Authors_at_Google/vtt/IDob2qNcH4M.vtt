00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:07.370
SPEAKER: Alan
Burdick is a writer

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.989
for "The New Yorker,"
"Out of Eden--

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:10.405
an Odyssey of
Ecological Invasion"

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:15.410
was his last book, which was a
National Book Award finalist.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.231
And today he's going
to talk about--

00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:19.730
maybe one thing he
should talk about

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.069
is why people don't
wear watches anymore.

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.110
There's a lot of aspects
of time which most of us

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.210
probably never thought
of, like how do we

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.530
know what the correct time is?

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.870
And Alan actually
went to the source,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.367
which is Paris, where every
month they look at all--

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:33.450
ALAN BURDICK: Don't tell--

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.610
don't give it away.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.410
SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.360
He'll tell you how
it really works out.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.457
He also spent-- how long, a
month, six weeks in the Arctic?

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:42.665
ALAN BURDICK: Just two weeks.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:44.123
SPEAKER: --two
weeks in the Arctic,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:47.030
where it's 24 hours a day.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.906
And in order to give him
more time and me less,

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:53.780
I'm going to turn it
over to Mr. Burdick now.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.981
Let's have a warm welcome.

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.394
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:58.280
ALAN BURDICK: Thank you.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.361
Thank you, Bob.

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:00.860
Thank you.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.443
Thank you, everybody,
for turning out.

00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:06.770
Thank you wherever you
may be for tuning in.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.900
Yes, so I think
before I dive in,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.270
I will give you just
a very quick overview

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.160
of what this book is all about.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.380
It started a few
years ago with what

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.020
I realize now were some pretty
broad and naive questions.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.285
I had read a fair amount
about space time and Einstein

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.740
and Hawking and all of that.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.900
But it always seemed to
me that that never really

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.760
had a whole lot to do
with the kind of time

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.640
that I inhabit from
day to day and minute

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.030
to minute, like why
does that stoplight

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.220
seem to be taking so long?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.630
And how do I know, right?

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.350
And it really does seem
like time speeds up

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.750
when I'm having fun,
but why is that?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.100
And why am I waking up
every day at exactly 4:27

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.800
AM, day after day,
without an alarm clock?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.110
It seemed like there was
some kind of a time--

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.990
some sort of time in
me and in my cells that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.600
is somehow different
from the time

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.000
out there, whatever
out there is.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.620
And what is that?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.990
And where does it come from?

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.280
There's no physics in the book.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.150
There's virtually
no philosophy there.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.700
I mean, there are volumes
on the philosophy of time,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.070
and I just skipped all of that.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.920
And this is really a series
of kind of explorations

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.720
and conversations
with psychologists

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.650
and neuroscientists
and biologists.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.640
And I focus on very
tangible experiments

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.910
and, to a certain extent,
my own experience.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.220
Because when we
talk about time, it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.610
can seem really slippery
and really abstract.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.940
But at the same time, it is this
very intimate, personal thing.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.310
And it seems to kind
of suffuse everything.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.590
And that's what I
wanted to get at,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.740
and I wanted to try to make
the experience, the reading

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.900
experience, as kind of tactile
and as immediate as possible.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.120
So out I go into the
world of scientists

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.030
with my naive question,
which is, so what is time?

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.830
And pretty much to a one they
would reply immediately, well,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.010
what do you mean by time?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.530
And it turns out that
what we call time--

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.810
time is basically
a big umbrella word

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.560
that we use to describe a
lot of discrete experiences

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.630
that we don't
typically parse out.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.540
But very quickly, the
perception of time

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.180
includes things
like your ability

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.970
to know what time it is
right now without a clock;

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.080
your understanding that
there is a past and a present

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.010
and a future, and they kind
of go in different directions;

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.240
your ability to understand
how long an event lasts,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.710
whether that's a stoplight
or your innate ability

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.340
to understand that three seconds
is actually longer than one

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.690
second or even 2 and 1/2
seconds without counting it out,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.720
which is actually something that
rats and pigeons can do also.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.610
And all of this may
seem kind of obvious,

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.820
but to a kid coming into the
world all of these experiences

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.630
are revelations.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.060
A lot of developmental
psychology in the last 50

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.150
years, starting with Piaget,
has shown that these experiences

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.580
come online at different
ages, and they kind of

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.230
build up into layers.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.670
So you could have--

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.370
by three years old,
a kid can pretty well

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.110
speak without error in both
the past and the present tense.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.492
But it's not until they're
about four years old

00:04:40.492 --> 00:04:41.950
that they understand
the difference

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.980
between before and after.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.740
So you can ask four or
five-year-old Jane in January

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.710
which is going to come first--

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.340
July, when your birthday
is, or Christmas?

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.840
And she'll say
Christmas because she

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.270
hasn't made the distinction
between proximity and next--

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.980
what's next in the
forward direction.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.840
And underneath all of
that, all those kind

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.610
of psychological
experiences, there's

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.430
this kind of time
that's really hardwired

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.190
into all of our cells,
and that's circadian time.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.700
We have these circadian
clocks throughout our bodies,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.480
and they quite firmly
run our physiology

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.186
over a pretty strict
24-hour cycle.

00:05:29.186 --> 00:05:30.810
But for our purposes
here, I'm actually

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.050
going to skip all of that.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.810
And I want to focus on
just really one aspect

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:42.930
of what we call time, and
that is our experience of now.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.370
And again, not space time
or anything, but this now

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.152
that maybe you feel
when you wake up

00:05:49.152 --> 00:05:50.610
in the middle of
the night and it's

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.970
kind of coming at you--
now, now, this now that's

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.390
right here in
front of your face.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.770
What is that?

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.609
And it turns out
this is actually

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:03.900
a question that has been
bugging humans for a long time

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.870
and maybe even since
humans started thinking.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.510
Plato, Zeno,
Aristotle, they thought

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.690
about the question of
now in terms of physics,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.260
and they really tied
themselves into knots.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.860
Is the present some kind
of indivisible instant,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.960
a dimensionless sliver between
the past and the future,

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.390
or does now have some
kind of duration?

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.780
And if it has a duration,
can we measure it?

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.190
But wait, if it has a
duration, can we chop it up

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.110
into smaller subdivisions?

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.990
And what's in between
those subdivisions?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.840
And is this always the same
now, or does it keep changing?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.090
And if it changes,
when does it change?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.280
So you could kind of go
around for 3,000 years

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.820
in circles trying to
figure that stuff out.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.560
And it gets existential
really quickly.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.760
So how do I know that I am
the same individual that I

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.080
was a minute ago or
last week or last year?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.870
How do I change and yet kind
of remain continuously me?

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.350
There's actually an
ancient Greek play

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.260
that addresses this
and sort of plays out

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.510
like a Laurel and Hardy skit.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.130
And one guy goes
up to another guy

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.730
that he's lent some
money to and he says,

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.960
yeah, I'd like my money back.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.210
And the second guy says, oh, but
you didn't borrow that from me.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.100
I'm no longer the same
person I was then,

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.580
anymore than a pile of stones
from which we added and removed

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.030
some pebbles is the
same pile of stones.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.635
At which point the first guy
hits that guy in the face.

00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:38.260
And that guy says,
why did you do that?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.330
And the first guy says, who me?

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.330
Then we move forward to
about the fourth century

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.140
and a theologian named
St. Augustine appears.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.210
And Augustine has written
a book of his own.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.580
It's called "The Confessions."

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.270
And it's this kind of
combination of autobiography

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.570
and an extended
meditation on God

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.110
and creation and
especially time.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.680
And what he essentially
does is move the discussion

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.590
of what is now,
what is the present,

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.830
from physics pretty squarely
into the realm of what

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.731
we would call today psychology.

00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:18.980
And he talks a lot about time.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.790
But again, it's important to
note that what he means by time

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.640
is quite specifically
the present--

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.200
now.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.590
And he describes an experience.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.640
He's talking.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.440
He's reading something.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.809
And these syllables are kind
of coming out of him one

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:33.860
after another.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.970
And at some point he realizes,
oh, hey, one of those syllables

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.419
is twice as long as one of the
other syllables that I spoke.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.880
He says, well, but
how do I know that?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.370
How did I measure that?

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.890
Did I measure both
of those syllables

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.077
together in the past tense?

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:52.910
How do you measure
something in a past tense

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.810
that doesn't exist anymore?

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.800
Well, then I must measure
them in the present tense.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.740
But how do I measure a
duration before it's over?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.990
And he kind of stirs
that around for a while.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.100
And he comes up with an insight
that is really still with us

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.880
today.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.730
And he says, OK, past,
present, future--

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.210
well, the past doesn't really
exist except in our mind

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.110
and as memory.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:22.200
And the future doesn't really
exist yet except in our mind

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.530
in terms of expectation.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.970
So all we have is the present.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.550
And he says, so we don't
really have three tenses.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.640
We really only
have one or, if you

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.040
will, three flavors of one,
three flavors of the present,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.620
which he describes like this--

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.400
the present of past
things, which is memory;

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.370
the present of present
things, which is attention;

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.000
and the present of future
things, which is expectation.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.940
And the upshot is that
all of these presents

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.660
exist only in our mind.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.015
That is the temporal experience.

00:09:57.015 --> 00:09:58.770
It's in the mind.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.640
And he's really
into this because he

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.000
is interested in
questions of the soul.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.470
And for him, the present is
the container of the soul.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.820
But he goes back to thinking
about this sentence.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.640
And these syllables are
coming out one after another.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.330
And his mind is reaching
forward into the future

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.520
to kind of figure out
what's going to come next.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.952
And it's sort of stretching
back into the past

00:10:22.952 --> 00:10:24.660
to try to remember
what he's already said

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.000
so he doesn't say it again.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.890
And he says, we're stretched
between memory and expectation.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.830
And he says, the vital
energy of what I am doing

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.330
is in tension between the two.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.582
And that's you.

00:10:39.582 --> 00:10:45.610
That's us-- this tension
spread across the now.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.900
And he says time is
nothing other than tension.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.970
And I would be very surprised
if time is not tension

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.010
of consciousness itself.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.190
And I love the phrase.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:01.100
But what I really love is this
idea that now isn't actually

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.130
the present, isn't
actually some stuff.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.660
It's actually a volume.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.110
He compares it to a volume that
is contained by consciousness.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.490
Which is to say that
now, the present,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.950
is the thing-- this is
the definition of it.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.390
Now is the thing that our
consciousness contains.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:21.440
And that sounds weird.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.431
It comes up centuries later.

00:11:23.431 --> 00:11:25.430
And it comes basically
straight out of the mouth

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.010
of William James--

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.580
1890, William James,
Harvard psychologist,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.040
brother of Henry James.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.040
He's written a big
book, a textbook called

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.080
"Principles of Psychology,"
which is a classic almost as

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.420
soon as it comes out.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.490
And James is thinking
back over some discoveries

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.790
that have been made in
physiology over the past 50

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.290
years.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:53.180
And one of the things that's
happening in the 19th century

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.370
is that clocks are
getting better and better.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.280
And they can access
now not just seconds,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.560
but tenths of seconds
and hundredths of seconds

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.630
and even thousandths of seconds.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.820
And when you start looking
at time scales like that,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.770
you discover a lot of things,
such as the speed of thought

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.810
is not actually finite.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.910
So it was thought that
if I think, OK, I'm

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.050
going to raise my hand now,
that that thought process is

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.340
instantaneous.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.541
But along comes in the
1850s a German physiologist

00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:25.040
who gets some
subjects and he starts

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.000
zapping them on their
bodies very lightly

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.830
with an electric shock.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.600
So he zaps you on your toe.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.630
That's now.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.280
And he says, OK, move your
head when you feel this.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.210
And he does this all
around your body.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.610
And it turns out
there's actually

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.930
a delay between when you
feel it and when you respond.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.080
It's like a tenth of a second.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.880
And he begins to realize,
oh, our nerves are

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.970
a lot like telegraph
cables, which, by the way,

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.250
are kind of popping up
everywhere in the 19th century.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.410
And we know that telegraphic
cables have delays in them.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.510
That's sort of inherent.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:08.700
And, well, so our nerves, our
neurons do the same thing.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:14.430
And the transmission, basically
the perception of when now is,

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.990
takes a little bit
of time to process.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:25.290
And he says the time between
experiencing a stimulus

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.950
and becoming aware of it,
and the time for the brain

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.830
to go about the process
of perceiving and willing

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.470
and responding, takes
about a tenth of a second.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.390
So he suddenly,
like, put a number--

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.380
he's, like, quantified what
you might call consciousness.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.287
And German
physiologists, the world

00:13:44.287 --> 00:13:46.370
of experimental psychology,
is just getting going.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:51.300
And their whole mandate
is to basically come up

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.750
with an exact description
of consciousness.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.545
And this is their way in.

00:13:56.545 --> 00:13:58.920
And they set up all
these great experiments

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.640
to figure out basically
how long now is.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.890
Because if they can figure
out how long now is,

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.610
they can figure out basically
how big our consciousness is.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:11.230
And so the experiments
are things like,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:17.256
OK, I'll give you two
quick sparks in a row--

00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:18.840
flick, flick.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.140
How close together
can I put them

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.950
and have you still perceive
them as distinct events?

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.880
And the answer is like 50
milliseconds, 20th of a second.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.470
It's pretty close.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.865
Or say I tap out of
rhythm, like this.

00:14:34.865 --> 00:14:37.290
[TAPPING]

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:40.770
How long can I stretch that
out, and how fast or how slow

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.460
can I make it, and how many
beats can I throw in there

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.510
and have you still experience
that rhythm as a whole rhythm

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.290
and not kind of lose
sight of the whole thing?

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.680
And they come up with
all sorts of numbers

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.569
for the length of the
present, because pretty much

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.360
every different way
you measure it is going

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.651
to give you a different number.

00:15:04.651 --> 00:15:06.230
It's a tenth of a second.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.100
It's 2/100 of a second.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.470
It's three seconds long
or five seconds long.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.890
Somebody describes it as
the length of a sentence--

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.500
the length of a spoken sentence.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:22.410
And so James comes along and
he's like, forget all of that.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:25.380
You guys, that is like
microscopic psychology.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.350
That's what he calls it.

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:31.740
Let's just get back to
our normal experience,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.910
that feeling that I'm having as
I'm laying awake at night that

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.820
now is kind of coming
at me in waves,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.760
in these kind of
discrete moments.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.650
And he goes back
really to Augustine,

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.190
and he thinks about the past
and the present and the future.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.050
And he says, really none
of those are helpful.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.120
But this fourth
thing, which I'm going

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.330
to call the specious present,
that's where all the action is.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.580
And he says the specious
present is basically

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:00.780
a very short duration.

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.550
Let's not get bogged
down in numbers.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.520
But it has a beginning,
and it has an end.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.310
And there's room in
there to have a thought

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.820
or to notice that, oh, hey,
that's a sparrow flying

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.066
across the yard--

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:16.440
not like big thoughts,
just, like, enough.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.269
And he comes up with
all sorts of metaphors

00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:19.310
for the specious present.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.610
It's like a boat.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:21.900
Or it's a waterfall.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.150
Or it's a length of rope.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.590
And he calls it
the short duration

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:31.570
"of which we are immediately
and incessantly sensible."

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.780
So once again, he is
basically defining now.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.580
He's defining the present as the
container of our consciousness,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.520
the short duration of
which we are immediately

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.702
and incessantly and sensible.

00:16:46.702 --> 00:16:48.910
And there had been some
thinking going on at the time

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.390
that we, as humans, are
actually capable of perceiving

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:53.540
empty moments of time.

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.350
And that time is actually
some kind of stuff out there.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.660
That we might even have
sensors in our ears,

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.600
and we can pick it
up as it comes at us.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.240
And James is like,
no, no, no, look,

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.030
here I am lying awake at
night, and the moments

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.170
are coming at me--
now, now, now.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.190
And even if there's nothing
really going on in there,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.440
if you look close,
if I look close,

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.420
there is stuff going on there.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.710
And what's going on
there is my thoughts.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.480
And even if I'm not
thinking any thoughts,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.839
maybe it's just like the
colored lights behind my eyelids

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.849
that flicker around.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.640
And it's that change,
it's that slight change

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.040
of thought, that
slight change of color

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.470
that we perceive as this
passing moment, right?

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:43.650
And so it's like--

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.990
in his view now is basically
our mind listening to itself,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.480
observing itself work.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.770
And he goes on to say, you know
what that means is basically

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.250
now, the present, this very
short thing called the present,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.590
is undefined without
our mind to fill it.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:05.250
And in fact, it's our mind
that gives rise to it.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.360
It's not like a moment,
a present moment,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.760
is sort of out there
waiting for us to receive.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.000
We're actually conjuring it.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.690
He says we tell
it off in pulses.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.130
We say now, now, now.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.875
Or we count-- more, more,
more as we feel it bud.

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:24.060
And time seems to
flow in discrete units

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.400
not because we perceive
units of empty time,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.810
but because each of our acts
of perception is discrete.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.190
Now arises again and again
just because we say now

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.260
again and again.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:42.330
James calls the present, this
moment, a synthetic datum.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.299
It's not experienced as
much as manufactured.

00:18:46.299 --> 00:18:48.840
And that's what I want to talk
about for the rest of the time

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.340
here, this idea that now isn't
really instantly received.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.170
It's actually
manufactured by us.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.420
And because it's
manufactured by us,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.700
it takes some time to process.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.910
Now is not instantaneous.

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.150
And this is something
that we see playing out

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:11.400
both in all of our devices and
in our bodies and in our minds.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.520
Does somebody have a watch or
a smartphone with a time on it?

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.064
What can you tell me?

00:19:18.064 --> 00:19:18.730
AUDIENCE: 12:25.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:19.590
ALAN BURDICK: 12:25.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.089
OK.

00:19:20.089 --> 00:19:26.300
So that exchange
that we just had

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.450
is probably the most
fundamental transaction

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.100
in the living world.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.710
We are synchronizing, right?

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.550
We're coming to an
agreement about what now is.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.780
You're telling me when
now is, and now I know.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.990
And either it agrees
with me or it doesn't.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.750
But the whole point
of that conversation

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.120
is for us to agree, right?

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.090
And this is probably a good
moment to stop very quickly

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.770
and talk about clocks.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.460
So a clock does at
least two things.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.960
It can be a timer.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.860
It can keep track of how
much time has gone by

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.540
or is still to come.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.560
So it can look
kind of like this.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.620
Or if you want to
be a little bit more

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.290
fancy and a little more
precise, it can look like that.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:18.250
But a clock, if you do this
and add some numbers to it,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.900
you're adding a whole new
layer of meaning, right?

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.010
Because it matters
where you are now.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.010
That where you are at
3:00 is not actually

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:34.580
the same now is where you
are at 9:00, for instance.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.940
And what this is
telling you, what

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.230
this stopwatch, this clock,
is telling you is the time.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.580
That is to say,
when now is, right?

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.950
Heidegger said that the
whole point of a clock

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.160
is to determine the
specific fixing of the now.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.480
And here's the thing--

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.100
a clock for this purpose is
totally useless by itself.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.460
Now, in this sense,
only means something

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.920
if it's in relation to
the now on another clock.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.540
So if I look at the
clock and it says noon,

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.210
well, that means a
couple of things maybe.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.540
It means-- well, it could be the
middle of the solar day, right?

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.190
Noon is the middle
of the solar day.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:16.420
The solar day is a clock.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.700
It's a 24-hour clock
that's beat out

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.980
by the rotation of the Earth.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.060
That's a clock.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.790
Or maybe I'm looking
and it's noon

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.596
and I'm thinking, oh, my gosh,
I'm talking at Google at noon.

00:21:27.596 --> 00:21:29.470
And everybody there is
going to have a watch,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.900
and they're thinking, well,
he should really be here now.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.270
Where is he, right?

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.420
So my now, my clock,
my thinking about now

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.730
is really only useful if
somebody else is, too.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.420
And so what time
is it right now?

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.134
Tell me again.

00:21:48.134 --> 00:21:48.800
AUDIENCE: 12:27.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.160
ALAN BURDICK: Does anybody here
have a watch or clock that does

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.050
not have that same time on it?

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.195
What does yours say?

00:21:58.195 --> 00:21:59.620
AUDIENCE: 12:29.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.700
ALAN BURDICK: OK, you, sir,
are totally odd, right?

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.160
Everybody else here,
like, we're all

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.700
totally on the same
page about when now is.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.500
Our clocks are
talking to each other.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.550
They're getting along.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:16.570
They're chatting really nicely.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.310
And we're all agreeing
about when now is.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.200
And that's one thing
to take away here

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.640
is that the fixing of the now,
as Heidegger described it,

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.980
is actually a process.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.920
It's a conversation among clocks
agreeing about when now is.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.835
It's a convention, in a sense.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:44.830
So now you might begin to wonder
well, how is it that all of us,

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.910
all the rest of us,
actually have the same time

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.245
on our watches
and on our clocks?

00:22:51.245 --> 00:22:52.870
And for that matter,
how do we actually

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.450
know that that is
the right time?

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:57.550
Well, it's because
all of our devices

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:01.210
are referencing some
other clock further

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.760
up the stream that is
more accurate than ours

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.010
and that we are
synchronizing to.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.830
And of course that one,
because you can't just

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:11.200
have one clock by
itself, is referencing

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.080
some even more accurate
clock further up the chain.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.620
It's like it's clocks
all the way up.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:20.840
But what is at the top?

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.340
Let's find out.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.120
So once upon a time, the
best clock in the world,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.170
or the best clock in
your neighborhood,

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.590
you found at the
local observatory.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.810
There was an
astronomer in there.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.360
He looked at the
motion of the stars,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.180
and he figured out
when solar noon was--

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.944
I mean, exactly,
like, solar noon.

00:23:40.944 --> 00:23:42.110
And that's really important.

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.460
And he would then distribute
that information locally.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.530
And at the beginning,
for a while

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.700
the Greenwich Royal Observatory
was the most accurate--

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.086
had the most accurate
clock in the world.

00:23:55.086 --> 00:23:56.960
And people from town
literally would show up,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.120
and they would
knock on his door.

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.655
And they would be
like, what time is it?

00:24:02.655 --> 00:24:05.750
Can I just like to check
my watch with your watch?

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.850
And this started to happen
so often that he really

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:08.350
got annoyed.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.080
And so the town hired
somebody, hired a guy

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.039
to do this once a day.

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:15.080
And he would go over there
and he'd get the time.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.450
And then he would
wander through town.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:19.160
And if you wanted
to check your watch,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.170
you would pay him a
little bit of money

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.520
and you would synchronize
to him and indirectly

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.760
to the observatory.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.070
And so time actually starts
to become a commodity, right?

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:34.400
And you start to
see time services.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.245
And this all takes a
little bit of time.

00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:39.050
It takes time for that guy to
go there and then come around

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:39.950
to you.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:41.820
Maybe you want your
time a little faster.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.090
Well, telegraphs
come along, and they

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.720
make it possible
for observatories

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:53.660
to start kind of piping the time
out much more quickly and much

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.170
more often during the day.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.230
And then this is really
happening all across Europe.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.600
So all of these
observatories are

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.140
spreading their
interpretations of when

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.070
now is, when solar noon is.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:17.370
And what you get is a
landscape that looks like this.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.870
I don't know if you
can see it here.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.410
I'll zoom in.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.470
So it's noon in Washington.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:29.590
It's 16 minutes after
1:00 in Georgetown.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:34.990
It's 26 minutes after
12:00 in Santiago.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.110
What you notice is
nobody's on the hour.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:42.820
And there's all these tiny
little times everywhere.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.470
Here's a similar clock.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.980
This was made-- this
drawing was made in 1851.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:53.920
And it represents the various
local times in Europe.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:26:00.250
That other one is from 1862.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.370
So this is kind of a problem,
especially if you're a railroad

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.730
and you want your passengers,
your human beings,

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.880
to be able to understand
your train schedule

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.310
and to make their
train connections.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.130
If you're going to Vienna
where there's one local time,

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.859
and you're going to Paris where
there's another local time,

00:26:17.859 --> 00:26:19.900
and there are, like, eight
local times in between

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.840
and you have to make
a train connection,

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840
it's a serious headache.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.930
And even worse, if
you're a switch engineer

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:31.330
and you need to know
exactly when to switch

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.970
the switch on the tracks so
that those two trains don't

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.400
come crashing into
each other, you really

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.890
better know when now is.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.840
And you better be right.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.420
So that's kind of
the moment when

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.710
the world gets
together and says,

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:48.770
let's just have 24 time zones.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.160
And that's a whole
other discussion

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.630
that I won't get into.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:57.400
But the point of it is--

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.580
so we are now getting our--

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:04.030
we're getting our time
not from an observatory.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.760
We are getting our
time from a clock

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.920
either in Maryland
or in Colorado.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.550
And these are not observatories.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.060
What they do there is-- and this
is their term-- they "realize"

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.305
seconds.

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:21.805
Now, there are two
kinds of seconds.

00:27:21.805 --> 00:27:25.240
There's the old kind of second,
where if you take the solar day

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.820
and you divide it up into 86,400
parts, you have one second.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.270
But in the '50s and
'60s, physicists

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.170
realize, oh, we can get
seconds another way.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:38.110
We could get an
isotope of cesium

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.460
and watch it vibrate
9 billion-plus times.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.590
And it's basically
exactly the same as that.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.930
And the great thing about
doing it that way is we

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.650
get the same exact second,
second after second.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.309
It's always the same.

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:54.100
Which isn't actually
true of the other one,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.891
because the Earth is
actually slowing down.

00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:59.640
So that second is
really not so reliable.

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.010
So there are these atomic
clocks that we have

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.330
in Maryland and in Colorado.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.005
And they are realizing seconds.

00:28:07.005 --> 00:28:08.380
And then they take
their seconds.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.380
And they take 86,400 of
them and they stack them up.

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.850
And then they have
the 24-hour day.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:17.830
And at any point in that
day, your clock or your phone

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:21.400
can actually tap in and find
out what time it is right now.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.260
And they actually get pinged
like 13 billion times a day

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.940
from clocks and devices wanting
to know what time it is.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.430
But of course, I said there's
one atomic clock there.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.080
But there's not really
one atomic clock

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.079
in each of those places.

00:28:36.079 --> 00:28:38.262
They actually have
ensembles of clocks,

00:28:38.262 --> 00:28:39.970
because you can't rely
on just one clock.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.910
So they sort of have
a bunch, and they

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.670
take an average
of all the seconds

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.252
to get you a very
good average second.

00:28:49.252 --> 00:28:50.710
And then they
actually compare that

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.040
to an even more accurate
clock that involves

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.422
transitions of rubidium.

00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:56.755
It's called a rubidium fountain.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.160
And so that gives
them some modicum

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.710
of reliability and accuracy.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.700
And meanwhile, we're doing
this in the United States.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.530
France is doing the same thing.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.260
England, they've got their
own national clocks--

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.820
national time labs
around the world,

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.160
all realizing their own seconds.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.950
And needless to
say, none of them

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.530
agree exactly with another.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.910
So we have over us
an even bigger time

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:29.650
that we all synchronize to.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:34.300
And this time is called
Universal Coordinated Time,

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.640
or UTC.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.390
And when this concept
was thought up,

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:47.080
the French actually wanted
to call it TUC, [FRENCH].

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.600
And the English wanted to call
it UCT, Universal Coordinated

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.100
Time.

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.300
And they couldn't agree.

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.090
So they came up with this
other acronym, UTC, which

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:58.360
doesn't actually mean anything.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.140
But we know
basically what it is.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.970
And here's the gist of it--

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:08.759
so UTC is managed by the time
division of the International

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:10.300
Bureau of Weights
and Measures, which

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.460
is a building outside of Paris.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.920
And the time division
basically is a bunch of people.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.660
And what they do
once a month, they

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.120
get all of the national
clocks around the world

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.130
at an appointed time,
at the same time,

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:29.000
to realize one second.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.570
And all that data they collect,
and they put it through what

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.766
they call "the algorithm."

00:30:33.766 --> 00:30:36.140
This is what the director of
the time division called it,

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.730
the algorithm.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.910
And they sort of average
it out to create what

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.760
you call a "fancy" average.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.860
And they take into
account, like, oh,

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.020
maybe that clock hasn't been
performing too well lately.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.390
We'll weight it a little
differently this time.

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.140
There's a lot of human
thought that goes

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:58.430
into creating this average.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.210
And so creating
this time, creating

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:07.090
this kind of perfect second,
this now, actually takes time.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.460
Figuring out the ideal
length of a second

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:13.520
that they gathered last
month takes about six days.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.540
And what they have
at the end of it

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.700
is actually really
kind of the best clock.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.330
It's the best possible
average of all

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.530
the best possible realizations
of seconds in the world.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:29.900
And they take that,
and they relay it

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:35.242
back to the national labs around
the world to synchronize to.

00:31:35.242 --> 00:31:37.700
And so if you're wondering what
the best clock in the world

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.060
looks like, it looks like this.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:45.895
The best clock in the
world is a newsletter.

00:31:45.895 --> 00:31:47.270
It used to be a
paper newsletter.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.530
It is now an email.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.930
It's called "Circular T."

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.340
It's a document that the Time
Bureau sends out once a month,

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.990
where they basically assess all
those seconds from last month.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:04.800
And they tell you how fast
or how slow your second seems

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.070
to be compared to this fancy
average that they've created

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.290
and how you might
maybe slow down

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.840
a little bit for next month
or speed it up a little bit.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.820
So in a sense, now
doesn't really exist.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.720
It's like it used to exist,
and it's going to exist,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.725
but it's always in the
process of becoming.

00:32:26.725 --> 00:32:28.560
And the director
of the Time Service

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.800
described this universal
coordinated time to me

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.050
as a post-real time
process, right?

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.390
It's always kind of
cooked up after the fact.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:40.470
It's manufactured.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:47.170
And the same kind of thing is
actually going on in our brain.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.350
We are bombarded by
different kinds of data

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:52.530
all the time coming at
us at different speeds,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.350
both externally and internally.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.200
And your brain is
trying to kind of judge

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.830
from all this input
arriving at different paces,

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:07.260
like, when it all began, where
it kind of originated from.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.530
What was the now that gave
rise to these different kinds

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.490
of data?

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:15.990
So if I flash two flashes
to you at the same time

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.580
and one is bright
and one is dim,

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.780
the bright one is going to
reach your visual cortex

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.370
about 80 milliseconds
before the dim one is.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:30.250
And yet you still perceive
those as simultaneous.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.920
You don't perceive any
kind 80 millisecond delay.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.510
So somehow your brain
knows that those two--

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.110
even though it's getting
two delayed signals,

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.590
somehow it knows that those
two things belong together

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.190
originally.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:46.177
And it's going to call that now.

00:33:46.177 --> 00:33:47.760
And this kind of
happens all the time.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.800
If I see somebody
talking across the room

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.770
and I see their lips moving
and I hear their voice,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:56.529
it's all synced up, right?

00:33:56.529 --> 00:33:58.320
And that's actually
true as long as they're

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.610
within about 100 feet.

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.250
Because beyond 100
feet, the delay

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.440
between the sight
of their lips moving

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.070
and the sound is more than
about 80 milliseconds.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.370
And after that, then
I notice the delay.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.770
It's easier actually to see
with a car door slamming

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:14.760
across the street.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.920
And it's like this
80 milliseconds is--

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.199
it's like our maximum tolerance
for things being out of sync.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.590
If you're watching
TV and the signals

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.757
go out of sync beyond much
more than a 10th of a second,

00:34:32.757 --> 00:34:34.590
you will notice it, and
you will be annoyed.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.120
But what's interesting is
that babies, it turns out,

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.389
have a very
different experience.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:45.239
You can show them a
set of moving lips

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:47.550
and have the voice
that matches it,

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:51.060
and you can move those
apart by 2/3 of a second.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.219
The lips can open and
close before they even

00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:54.310
hear the sound.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:58.410
And as far as the baby is
concerned, it's all one event.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:00.900
They live in this very long now.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.912
It's very forgiving-- what
belongs together out there

00:35:04.912 --> 00:35:05.620
and what doesn't.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.910
So I want to just
take a break here.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:14.130
Not a break, but there's a--

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.950
oh, yeah, so the
brain is actually

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.530
working really hard to
create this sense of a now,

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:23.780
and it's trying really
hard to hide the work

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.460
that it's doing from you.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.890
But it's not perfect.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:32.300
So there is this illusion
called the flash lag illusion.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.020
And the way it works
is there's this--

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.090
imagine there's a ring
moving across the page.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:42.230
And at some point--

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.400
or across the screen.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.290
And at some point
there's a flash

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:46.910
that fills the interior of it.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.980
And the flash keeps going.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.080
But that's not
actually what you see.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.870
You see this.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.417
You see the ring as if it has
somehow moved past the flash.

00:35:59.417 --> 00:36:00.500
And I'm going to show you.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.260
There's a really short video
that will show this to you.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.215
This works in sort
of different forms.

00:36:08.889 --> 00:36:10.430
So you've got a
moving cube, and it's

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.850
going past a stationary cube.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.800
And they are
theoretically aligned.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.390
But I don't need to talk.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:21.070
It's explaining
everything for you.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.560
But you never see them
as aligned, right?

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:26.140
The moving one always
seems to be a little bit

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.880
past the stationary one.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:40.000
And the reason this happens is
because your brain actually has

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.200
two ways of looking at objects.

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.850
It has a separate
system, basically,

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.340
for tracking stationary
and moving ones.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.790
And actually-- so if
you're going and running

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:57.980
for a pop fly, you're running
and going after that ball

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.170
and observing it basically
using motion vectors.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:02.270
Really at no point
are you stopping

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:03.930
to think, where's
that ball right now?

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.096
Where's that ball right now?

00:37:05.096 --> 00:37:06.440
Where's that ball right now?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.880
That's a question that your
mind really doesn't often ask.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:16.700
Imagine a frog that had to ask,
where's that fly right now?

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.950
Where's that fly right now?

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.330
It wouldn't get very far.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:34.050
So what's happening here is
as the ring moves across,

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:38.499
the flash is suddenly
asking a question

00:37:38.499 --> 00:37:40.290
that your brain had
not been asking before.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.320
You're watching the ring
with motion vectors--

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:43.820
yeah?

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:44.684
Wrap it up?

00:37:44.684 --> 00:37:45.600
SPEAKER: Five minutes.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.480
ALAN BURDICK: OK.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:48.720
You're watching it
with motion vectors,

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:51.000
and suddenly it flashes.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.610
And your brain has to ask,
where's that ring right now?

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.280
And the only way it can do
that is in the past tense.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.260
It waits a little
bit, and then it

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.750
tries to gather
all the information

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.840
that it can within about
an 80-millisecond window.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.010
And it decides
where that ring was.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.540
And the reason it
gets it wrong is

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.090
because it knows
where the flash was,

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.280
but it's still
gathering data even

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.600
as that ring continues to move.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.670
And that additional
data basically

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.377
biases your
perception of the ring

00:38:24.377 --> 00:38:25.710
and the direction of its motion.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.410
Well, I want to leave you
with one more thought.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:36.210
And because our sense
of now is manufactured,

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.530
it's also very fungible.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.110
And psychologists really
love to do experiments

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.670
that sort of tease this out.

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:49.800
So if I show you a sad face
for a second on the screen,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.035
and then I show you a happy
face for a second on the screen,

00:38:54.035 --> 00:38:55.410
the happy face
will actually seem

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.810
to last a little bit longer.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.060
If I show you an
angry face, that one

00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.270
will seem to last a
little longer, too.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.490
And that's because,
for various reasons,

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.410
our emotions seem to alter our
sense of duration of how long

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.010
things last.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.509
But it's more
complicated than that.

00:39:12.509 --> 00:39:15.630
Because if I do that experiment,
if I observe that experiment

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.930
and I put a pencil
between my teeth,

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.500
the effect totally goes away.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:27.150
And the reason is because,
now, all the time as we

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.530
interact in real life, we are
mimicking each other's gestures

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.790
and facial movements.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.550
If you watch two people
eating lunch together,

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:38.130
if they're good friends, pretty
soon they'll fall into sync.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.560
And they'll smile
at the same time.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.670
And they'll raise their
cup at the same time.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:52.350
And this seems to be a pretty
basic expression of empathy.

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:56.730
And even if I show you a
series of faces on a screen

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:59.780
so quickly that you
don't notice them,

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:03.260
if a smiling face comes
up, you will smile too.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.210
And what seems to be
going on, as we interact

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.310
and as we have
that experience, is

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:12.270
that we are stepping into
basically the other person's

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:16.560
skin and trying to adopt
their rhythm, too, right?

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.080
So the reason that
the effect goes away

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.060
when I put the pencil
in between my teeth

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:26.510
is because I can no longer mimic
the smiling or the angry face

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:27.170
that I see.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.640
And because I can't mimic it,
I don't experience their kind

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.390
of distorted duration of time.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.110
And this is, again, kind
of an essential aspect

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:40.430
of our sociality.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:44.660
We are stepping in and
out of each other's skins

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.510
all the time.

00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:48.050
And it has been
asked, well, what good

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.410
is it to have such a
fallible clock, a clock

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.640
that you can kind
of bend so easily?

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.660
And the better question really
is to ask, what it does for us?

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:02.630
And that is that our
slightest social exchanges

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.970
and our glances and
our smiles really

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:06.860
gain their strength
from our ability

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.590
to synchronize them
amongst ourselves

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:13.790
and to kind of know gesturally
when the other person is,

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.830
when now is, right?

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.990
We bend time to make
time with each other.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.760
So just to circle back
to what I said earlier,

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.680
you can have clock.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.500
But you can't have just one.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.070
And now all of us, really
each of us, is a clock.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:35.000
We are the sum of our cells, the
sum of our circadian rhythms.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.580
We are a consciousness going
around saying, now, now, now,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.470
your now.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:44.040
We're trying to
figure it all out.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:49.610
And what I want you to think
about is as you look around

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:52.880
and you think about the clock
that's sitting to your left

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.430
or to your right
is really what you

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.620
are sharing in the most
literal sense is now.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.320
And in that sharing you are
creating a bigger clock.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.230
You are creating something
even bigger than yourselves.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:08.230
Heidegger said, "this
time now as I look

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.480
at my watch, what is this now?

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.460
Am I the now?

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.190
Is every other person the now?"

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:18.080
Yes, but really that's half
the story, because we together

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.620
are the now, too.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.740
My now is over.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.834
Now it's your turn.

00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:26.642
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:29.134 --> 00:42:30.800
AUDIENCE: In the study
about the babies,

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.730
how do they tell that their
perceptions are delayed?

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.000
ALAN BURDICK: They
use eye trackers.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.830
And they basically--
they can have

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:51.270
a baby watch a pair of monitors,
one with a set of moving lips.

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:55.400
And first they
watch it silently.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.670
And then they watch
it with sound on.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.470
And they are
simultaneously watching

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:01.244
another set of
lips that is saying

00:43:01.244 --> 00:43:02.410
something totally different.

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:04.390
And then suddenly
the sound comes on,

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:09.790
and they look to
see which screen

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:10.870
the infant is looking at.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.420
The infant is basically trying
to match the sound that it's

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.150
suddenly hearing with one
of the two sets of lips

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:17.590
that it's seeing.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.959
And they can pretty quickly
tell using eye trackers

00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:22.000
which one the baby picks.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.469
And the baby typically
always picks the right one.

00:43:26.469 --> 00:43:27.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.160
I'm interested in
the process you

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.790
took to portray in the book.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.390
And since this was kind
of more of your definition

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.950
and exploring your
exploration of the now,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:42.280
how did you decide who to seek
out and what sources to use?

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.920
And it says you went to--

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.416
going to the Arctic
and going to Paris.

00:43:47.416 --> 00:43:52.294
How did you take all of that and
put it together into the book?

00:43:52.294 --> 00:43:53.710
ALAN BURDICK: It
took a long time.

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.140
It took about 10 years.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.290
There was a lot that I left out.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:01.784
And one of the
things that happened

00:44:01.784 --> 00:44:02.950
in the course of this book--

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.350
I actually started this
book about six weeks

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:07.680
before my kids were born.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.750
And I have twin boys, and
they're now 10 years old.

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.600
And in the process,
in that 10 years,

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.810
I started watching
them as they got

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:24.520
older kind of grow into these
different aspects of time.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.599
And simultaneously,
I'm kind of coming

00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:28.390
to grips with the
concept of being a parent

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.060
and what that means in
terms of responsibility

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.100
and my own relationship to time.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.450
And so that arc is really
the sort of container

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:40.364
that everything else
is contained within.

00:44:40.364 --> 00:44:41.530
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.260
So for me, and
probably for everybody,

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.529
the now is like it continues.

00:44:46.529 --> 00:44:48.070
And what I understand
from your talk,

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.920
you say is that time's
actually-- we perceive time

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:55.930
as snapshots, which are
about 10ths of a second.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.656
So does this mean that we think
in the snapshots, like a CPU,

00:44:59.656 --> 00:45:04.150
like, every cycle
has some operations?

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.010
So does the brain
work in this way?

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.649
Does it work in a snapshot
way, like a discrete way?

00:45:08.649 --> 00:45:10.690
ALAN BURDICK: I mean,
there's a school of thought

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:12.310
that thinks that.

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:14.830
And the kind of
question is, like,

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:17.500
is time sort of going
by us, and we're

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.100
looking out a train window,
and it's just passing by?

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:26.920
Or are we sort of planting
our window on the world

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.190
and making it kind
of chunk that way?

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.590
And that seems to be
more of what's going on.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:36.940
But it's not necessarily
a strict 80-millisecond

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:41.200
or 10th-of-a-second unit.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.690
And there's certainly
no regular beat to it.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:48.200
It's definitely not like
film going through a camera.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.944
These kind of still frames that
you add up and then speed up,

00:45:50.944 --> 00:45:52.360
and it suddenly
seems like motion.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.980
SPEAKER: Most of us here have
had some mathematical training.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.260
And I think it would be
easy to be kind of facile

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.650
and say, well, a time is
of zero, infinitely small.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:05.200
Points don't have any dimension.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.320
And I think what you've shown is
that that's not really the way

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.090
it is with human beings, right?

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:11.890
ALAN BURDICK: Yeah.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.060
It's almost circular.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.010
We can't perceive an
indivisible moment.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:22.630
So what we call now
must have some duration,

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.610
however you want to measure it.

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.130
And really, almost
by definition,

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.420
that duration is the
length of the thought

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.291
that we spend thinking
about it, right?

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:36.790
SPEAKER: Let's thank Mr. Burdick
for coming here and talking

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:37.960
to us on this rainy day.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.390
ALAN BURDICK: Great.

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:39.223
Thank you very much.

00:46:39.223 --> 00:46:42.940
[APPLAUSE]
