00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.275
We have a hairy looking expression here

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:05.800
and your goal is to try to simplify it

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.890
as much as you can. I'll give you a little

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.025
bit of time to do it

00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:14.406
Let's just think about it step by step

00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:16.006
It might help if you were actually to

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.402
reorder the terms

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:18.936
in this expression

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:20.201
So let me put all the "x" terms first

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:23.272
so I have"5x" that's that term

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:26.069
minus 2x

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:31.750
plus 7y

00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.274
plus 3y

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:39.673
then I have "+ 8z"

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:43.409
And then I have minus Z

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:46.007
and the last term that I haven't included yet

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:49.867
is "+5". Right over here

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:51.670
Now let's just think it through.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.606
If I have 5 x and I were to take away 2 x

00:00:56.606 --> 00:00:58.669
how many x would I be left with?

00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:00.943
Well I would be left with 3 x. That's true

00:01:00.943 --> 00:01:02.329
of anything. There's not same fancy

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.003
algebraic magic going on.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.465
5 of anything minus two of that same thing

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.323
You're going to be left of 3 of that same thing

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.413
In this case that "thing" is x

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:17.326
So this is going to simplify to 3x

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:19.337
Now in a lot of algebra classes you will hear

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:21.961
people say, "Oh, well the coefficient on 5x

00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:29.942
is 5 and the coefficient here is negative two

00:01:29.942 --> 00:01:32.987
and we have to add the coefficient

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:37.738
(let me write that word down)

00:01:37.738 --> 00:01:39.161
these right over here are the coefficient

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:40.872
they're the number that your mutiplying

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.003
the variable by

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:45.803
So the 5 or the negative 2 in this case

00:01:45.803 --> 00:01:47.244
you could just so

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.071
Oh I can just add the coefficient

00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:51.005
and that's ok. There's nothing wrong with that

00:01:51.005 --> 00:01:52.668
but I really want to emphasize

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:54.709
there's a very common sense intuition here

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.872
You have 5 of something

00:01:55.872 --> 00:01:57.909
you take away two of that something

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.669
you are left with three of that something

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.826
you have to make sure that your adding

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:05.823
and subtracting the same thing

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:08.086
here we're dealing with x's

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:10.743
so we can take 5x and take away 2x

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:13.866
we can't think about merging the x and the y

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.200
at least, not in any simple way right now

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.609
because frankly that would make any intuitive sense

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:20.908
now let's think about the y

00:02:20.954 --> 00:02:22.204
if I have 7 of something

00:02:22.204 --> 00:02:24.243
and I were to add 3 more of that something

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:25.913
then I would have 10 of that something

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.004
so this part right over here

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:30.167
is going to simplify to

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.819
10 y

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.162
once again you could say the coefficient

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:35.210
on 7y is 7

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.078
the coefficient on 3y is 3

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:39.340
we added the coefficients (7+

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.201
3) to get to 10y

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:43.497
but I really want to emphasize the intuition here

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:45.671
If you have 7 of something you add another

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:48.413
3 of something, you have 10 of something

00:02:48.413 --> 00:02:50.336
now let's look at the Z

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.336
if I've got 8 of something

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:53.831
and I take away one of them

00:02:53.831 --> 00:02:55.489
I'm going to have 7 of that something

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.939
that is 7z and you might say hey

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.603
what was the coefficient here on the -Z

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:01.267
I don't see any number out front

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:03.403
of the z. Well implicitly I could have put

00:03:03.403 --> 00:03:04.755
a one here.

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:06.276
It's exactly the same thing.

00:03:06.276 --> 00:03:07.603
Subtract a Z is the same thing as

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:09.339
subtracting 1z

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.410
the word 1z strikes a part of my brain

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.155
because I have very young children

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:14.911
but that's a different type of 1z

00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:16.470
and then you can see yeah you definetly

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.609
did add the two coefficients

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.496
The 8 and the -1

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.603
but once again common sense tells you

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.163
that if you have eight of something

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:25.269
and you take away one of them

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.273
you have 7 of that something

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:32.006
and then finally you have a plus 5

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:33.007
so we're done

00:03:33.007 --> 00:03:39.496
this simplified to 3x plus 10 y plus 7z

00:03:39.496 --> 00:03:43.000
plus 5
