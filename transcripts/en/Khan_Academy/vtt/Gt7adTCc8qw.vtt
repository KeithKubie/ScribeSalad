00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.460
Which of the following triangles
are similar to triangle ABC?

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.260
So this is triangle ABC.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.280
Before we even look
at these options,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.560
let's remind ourselves of what
it means for two triangles

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.280
to be similar.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.215
There's multiple ways
of thinking about it.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.600
The classical definition
of similar triangles

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.710
is that all the corresponding
angles are equivalent.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.890
So for example, if these
two are similar triangles,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.360
then if this angle
corresponds to that one,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.450
then these two angles
are going to be the same.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.060
If this angle
corresponds to this one,

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.400
then these two angles
are going to be the same.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.032
And if this angle
corresponds to this one,

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:40.990
then these two angles
are going to be the same,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.450
and these are similar.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.991
And the reason why similarity
is useful is because that tells

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:46.820
you the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.570
are going to be the same.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.820
So for example, if this side
has length 2 and this side

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.660
has length 1, then the ratio
of this side to this side

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.850
is 2 to 1.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.730
The corresponding sides here
are this side and this side.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.580
So they would also have
to have a 2 to 1 ratio.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.786
So for example, this could
be 4, and this could be 2-- 2

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:05.660
to 1 ratio.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.050
4/2 is the same thing as 2/1.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.670
Or it could be 7 to 3 and 1/2.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.030
Or it could be 10 to 5.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.230
It would always have a 2 to
1 ratio if this had a 2 to 1

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.740
ratio and if these
are similar triangles.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.512
Now, in the context
of a line and slope,

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:25.220
I'll think about
another one, another way

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.000
of thinking about similarity.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.580
If you have two
right triangles--

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.620
so let's say this is one right
triangle right over here--

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.090
so if you have one right
triangle right over there

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.200
and you have another right
triangle just like that,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.740
if you have two right triangles
and the ratio of the two

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.954
sides on either side
of the right angle

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:53.370
correspond to each other-- so
if the ratio of this magenta

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.460
side to this green side is
the same in this triangle

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.400
as it is in this triangle--
then we are similar.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.110
So for example, if these
are two right triangles

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.240
and if this is a, let's
say, this side is length 6

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.430
and this side is length 9
and this side is length 2

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.810
and this side is
length 3, these are

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.500
going to be similar triangles.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860
You have an angle
right over here.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.390
And the ratio of 6/2 is
the same thing as 3/1.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.890
The ratio of 9/3 is the
same thing as 3 to 1.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.905
These are similar.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780
Now, why am I telling
you that in the context

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.400
of this right over here?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.570
Well, we have a line and
you connect any two points

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.750
on the line, let's say
point c to point a,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.470
the ratio of your change
in y over your change

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.600
in x is always going
to be constant.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.080
And when you have a trying to
constructed this way, where you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.700
have your change in x is
going perfectly horizontal

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.460
and your change in y is
going perfectly vertical,

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.840
it's going to be
a right triangle.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.300
And so any right
triangle you construct

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.020
between two points
on the line this way,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.560
they're going to be
similar, because your ratio

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.260
between your change in y--
notice if you go from point c

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.022
to point a, you can point
c is at 3, point a is at 9.

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:21.480
This is literally
your change in y.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.160
Going from 3 to 9,
you increased by 6.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.040
Your change in y is equal
to 6 right over here.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.880
And in the horizontal direction,
this base of this triangle

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.550
right over here, this
is your change in x.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.920
c is that point at
your x value is at 1.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.260
a, your x value is 3.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.940
So you went, your change
in x is equal to 2.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.710
And any right
triangle you construct

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.550
this way between any two
points on a line, this ratio,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.310
your change in y over your
change in x, which in this case

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.340
is 6/2, is going to be constant.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.215
And since that ratio is
going to be constant,

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:59.010
it's a right triangle, any
two triangles constructed

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.690
in this way with the line
between two points on the line,

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.970
they are going to be similar.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.440
Now, let's look at our options.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:16.490
So triangle ADG-- well,
once again, the hypotenuse,

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.420
just like triangle ABC, the
hypotenuse is still our line.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.290
We are essentially
thinking about the base

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.000
of the triangle is the
change in x between going

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
from between our x value
for d and our x value for a.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.470
And this height right over here
or this side right over here,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.310
this is our change in y going
from y equals negative 3 to y

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.300
equals 9.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.060
So this is our change in y.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.810
We know that your change
in y over your change in x

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.870
is going to be
constant for a line.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.340
This is a right triangle.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.742
So these two triangles are
definitely going to be similar.

00:04:53.742 --> 00:04:56.200
And if you want to break out
a little bit of your geometry,

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.920
it's not hard to prove that
the corresponding angles are

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.160
equivalent, using a little
bit of your parallel lines

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.180
and transversals of
parallel lines knowledge.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.002
Now, let's look at triangle BEF.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.060
Well, this is a right
triangle, but its hypotenuse

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.135
does not sit on--
so triangle BBEBEF.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.110
So this triangle is
a right triangle.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.980
But its hypotenuse does
not sit on the line.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.813
Now, it could be similar,
but you could even

00:05:32.813 --> 00:05:35.260
see that this line right here
has a different inclination.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.400
It has a different slope.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.830
So that's a pretty good
sign that these are not

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.537
going to be similar triangles.

00:05:40.537 --> 00:05:42.120
And if you really
wanted to verify it,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.484
you could look at the
ratio of your change in y

00:05:44.484 --> 00:05:45.400
over your change in x.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.066
And in fact, let's
just do that for fun,

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:50.430
just to prove to ourselves
that it's not similar.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.140
To go from F to B, you're
going from negative 6

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.460
to 3-- 3 minus negative 6.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.467
I'll just say this length right
over here, BF, is equal to 9.

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.300
I'm not going to say
change in y over change

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.947
in x, because we're not going
between two points on the line.

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:08.030
I'm just going to look at
the length of this line.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.420
The length of this line is 9.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.450
The length of this line
right over here-- let's see,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.950
we're going from
negative 1 to 3-- is 4.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.930
So the ratio of 9
to 4 is definitely

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.320
not the same as the ratio
of 6 to 2 or 3 to 1.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.340
So we can rule BEF out.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.450
Now, let's look at EFG.

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:33.160
Well, once again, this
isn't sitting on the line.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.118
That doesn't necessarily
mean it's not similar.

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:37.940
But you can even see the
inclination of its hypotenuse

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.560
is very different than
the line right over here.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.540
And you see the
ratio of these sides.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.410
You have a side length
3, side length 4.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.860
The ratio of 3 to 4 is
definitely not 6 to 2.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.900
If this was somehow oriented
different, the ratio of 4 to 3

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.970
is also not the
ratio of 6 to 2--

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.620
I guess this is the 6 to 200
the 6 to 2 or the 3 to 1.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.020
So we can rule this
one out as well.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:09.780
And then finally, triangle
BDG-- well, once again-- you're

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.500
tired of me saying
this-- triangle BDG,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.310
its hypotenuse does
not sit on the line.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.610
Its hypotenuse has a very
different inclination

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.170
or a very different slope
than the line itself.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.740
So this is not going to
be a similar triangle.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.800
You can often eyeball it.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.890
The similar triangle
will look the same.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.250
It'll have the same proportions.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.520
They don't necessarily have
to have different sides,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.730
different sizes.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.220
But they can have
different sizes.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.015
One is a scaled up
version of the other.

00:07:38.015 --> 00:07:40.140
And you can see here, this
triangle right over here

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.580
looks very different
than triangle ABC.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.000
And you can even verify
that the ratio of this side

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.730
right over here to this side
is very different than 3 to 1.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.780
So we can rule this
one out as well.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.810
So let's actually input
that and make sure

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.500
that we actually got
the right answer.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.430
So let me input it right there.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.990
And we got the right answer.
