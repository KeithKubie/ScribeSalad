00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.910
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.562
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.270
VISHAVJIT SINGH: Thank
you, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.860
Thank you, everyone,
for being here.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.610
And so I am going
to be talking today

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.100
about labels, stereotypes,
and creating stories.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.690
Let me get started, actually.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.640
So from the day we're born
labels are placed upon us.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.501
So I was born in a
Washington DC hospital,

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:34.000
and one of the first
things that get

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.362
placed upon you, at least in the
United States, is a race label.

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:39.070
So if you look at your
birth certificate,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.930
there's actually a race column.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.350
And interestingly, in my case,
most people cannot get what

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.550
my race actually says.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.758
Anybody want to take a guess
what my race column says

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:49.322
on my birth certificate?

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:49.989
AUDIENCE: Asian?

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:50.947
VISHAVJIT SINGH: Asian.

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:51.804
That's a good guess.

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:52.720
AUDIENCE: South Asian?

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.928
VISHAVJIT SINGH: South Asian.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.090
Another good guess.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.910
Incorrect guesses.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.780
Anybody else?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.640
Think a bigger
demographic group.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.240
Very big.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.447
AUDIENCE: Chinese?

00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:04.280
VISHAVJIT SINGH: No.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.904
So let me answer that
question for you.

00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:09.590
And I'll show you my birth
certificate for that, actually.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.010
Bottom left corner.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.524
I'm white.

00:01:12.524 --> 00:01:14.690
And I know you probably are
thinking, wait a minute,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.920
that doesn't make sense.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.180
So let me put it this way.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.720
The label "white" itself
doesn't make sense.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.860
There are no white people.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.180
Technically, there
are no white people.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.960
If you look at a
white piece of paper,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.330
I don't think you know
any other human being

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.650
on this planet who looks white.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.930
Neither are there
people who look black.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.130
But there's a long history
behind why we have terms

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.450
like "black" and "white."

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.320
A long history of
demeaning people,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.259
defining them, confining
them, justifying slavery.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.050
But that's not where
I'm going to go today.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.210
But I just want you to
sort of, for a moment,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.970
realize I had this label placed
upon me because technically,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.210
in the pseudoscience of
racism, all South Asians

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.010
are considered Caucasian.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.430
And we, as Americans, confuse
Caucasians for white people.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.170
Not all Caucasians
are white people.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.910
So technically--
just remember this,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.255
for all of you who
hail from South Asia--

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:07.560
you're white people.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.600
This is me in elementary school.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.540
And so I spent the
first four years

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.730
of my life in Washington
DC, Maryland area,

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.880
moved with my parents to India--

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.950
who were from India.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.637
And among many other labels,
one of the things that happens

00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:25.220
is you follow your
parents' lifestyle.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.095
So whatever their faith
or belief system is,

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.220
you don't get to choose it.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.210
You get to kind of follow it.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.543
At least in the first few years.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:33.870
I did that.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.390
So you see that bun
on top of my head.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.620
My faith at the time
happened to be a Sikh faith,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.940
a young religion from India.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940
And as part of that faith
we don't cut our hair.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.920
Both men and women,
we keep long hair.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.350
Boys keep their hair in
a bun, including men,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.620
but as young boys we wear
these little, small turbin

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.506
called "patkas."

00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:52.380
The reason I'm showing
this photograph to you

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.090
is for another reason though.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.870
You notice I started wearing
glasses really early on.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.100
Now, glasses are considered
pretty cool these days.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.766
You have a lot of
different brand names.

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:02.940
Everybody is sporting
new glasses all the time.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.630
Well, when I was a young
boy, putting glasses on

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.620
was not a cool thing.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.077
It unfortunately made me very
open to targeting by bullies.

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:14.160
And not only bullies,
actually, out on the streets

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.060
or in school.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.020
It was actually loved ones at
home, parents, uncles, aunts,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.700
cousins who just
thought, you know what?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.020
You don't look good, man.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.474
Somehow physically there
is something not acceptable

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:27.390
about your appearance.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.660
And so what happened is,
after a few months and years

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.820
people started using
the word ugly to refer

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.530
to me in comparison
to my brother,

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.430
who happened to be handsome.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.930
I knew that.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.010
My brother knew that.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.930
But we didn't have to
say that to each other.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.370
But unfortunately society has
to project its insecurities,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.940
their own fears and anxieties.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.460
So that's how a lot
of my loved ones

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.227
kept telling me as
I was growing up.

00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:50.810
Something's wrong
with you, Vishavjit.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.630
You don't look good.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.421
You're an ugly kid.

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.820
So by the time I was a
high-schooler I got convinced.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.040
I bought into that label.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.040
So my struggle was, OK, how
do I overcompensate now?

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.120
So how do I prove my worth?

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.460
So the way I proved my--

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.000
the way I choose
to prove my worth

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.010
was, well, let me see if
I can study really hard

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.590
and go to one of the best
universities on the planet.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.490
And that's how I'm
going to prove my worth.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.420
So that was-- as a young
boy I have these labels

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.670
placed upon me, and
now those labels

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.670
are driving my
life-changing decisions.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.960
What do I need to do?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.959
Where do I need to go to school?

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:29.250
So that became a vulnerability.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.666
And that's something
we all carry.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:35.100
So this was a man-made,
humankind-made vulnerability

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.020
that I had to carry with me.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.750
And then something
drastic happens

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.460
by the time I go to University
of California, Santa Barbara.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.637
This is sophomore year.

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:45.720
But before I actually give
you a little back story

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.490
on this I want to
sort of talk very

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.220
briefly about another
impact labels can have.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.860
So I mentioned I
happened to be Sikh.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.660
That's one of the
labels people put on me.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.220
I happened to be of Sikh faith.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.800
As a young boy,
in the year 1984,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.300
I happened to be in New Delhi
when the Indian prime minister

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.480
was killed.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.710
And for a few days in the
first week in November anybody

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.650
who had that label on them,
Sikhs, mostly men, turban

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.310
beards, were targeted and
thousands were killed.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.840
They were burned alive,
purely because they

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.400
had that label upon them.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.710
And unfortunately those
things happen today as well.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.870
You can look at many
different parts of the world

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.440
where powers to be
decide, here's a group.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.710
That belongs to this label,
and we'll target them.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.269
So moving fast-forward,
this is me.

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:32.560
And obviously you see that
I don't have my turban here.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.590
So when I came back to the
US-- the land of my birth,

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.060
my homeland, however
you want to put it--

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.660
I came to Los Angeles first.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.580
And most people out
on the streets of LA

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.920
greeted me by
calling me "genie,"

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.010
"raghead," "go back home."

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.710
Some people just
laughed in my face.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.820
So I am a teenager about
to go to college, insecure,

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.630
not having a great sense of
who I am, low self-esteem.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.520
And I'm like, well,
how do I fit in?

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.009
How do I change myself?

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:08.050
So the only thing I had
in my control at the time

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.490
is, well, I'll
take my turban off,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.420
which meant a lot to
me and my parents.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.270
But I didn't tell my parents.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.870
And then a few weeks
later I cut my hair off.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.640
So I told my mother
first, who was

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.130
across on the other
side of the globe,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.150
and I had her tell
the rest of my family.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.380
And it kind of worked.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.490
So people now stopped
staring at me.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.305
They confused me
for being Hispanic.

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:33.430
People started coming up
to me speaking in Spanish.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.800
So that's sort of another
sort of impact of--

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.619
now new labels come in, coming
in and sort of defining me.

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:39.910
And I didn't mind those labels.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.800
And I think what would help me
for a certain amount of time

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.780
was, now people are not seeing
me as "the extreme other."

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.780
So it felt good.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.600
It felt good to be invisible.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.630
That was a desirable thing
for me to be at that time.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.920
I don't want to stand out.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.140
I don't want people to see me.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.810
So that process actually
went on for a long time.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.680
And there was something
that I call a time

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.510
machine that came to my rescue.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.600
And I'm not talking about a
physical electronic mechanical

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.130
time machine.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.372
I like to call books
my time machine.

00:07:11.372 --> 00:07:12.580
So I fell in love with books.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.560
And believe it or not,
when I was a young kid

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.540
and until I went to the
University of California Santa

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.289
Barbara and then
Berkeley for grad school,

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.604
I had not read a single
book cover-to-cover.

00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:23.020
I just didn't grow up in a
family where books were valued.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.340
So when I went to college
I started reading books.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.090
It just opened up my horizons.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.270
I mean, I was reading
history and science fiction.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.190
And it just kind of
opened up my world

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.590
to incredible possibilities.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.580
Right?

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.410
So I started experimenting with
Buddhism, Taoist meditations.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.940
And eventually on way,
with a shaved head,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.249
mohawk for a few hours,
almost 10 years later

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:51.290
I decided, you know what?

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.280
I'm going to embrace my
faith that I was born into.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.819
On my own for the
first time, nobody

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:56.860
is telling me what to do.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.460
This is what I'm going to try.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.430
So as part of that
faith I embraced--

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.217
I started growing my hair long.

00:08:03.217 --> 00:08:05.050
And unless you've cut
your hair really short

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.910
and really grown it
to the full length,

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.070
it takes a long time
to grow your hair.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.580
It took me two years.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.260
So for the first time in
10 years, August 2001--

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.080
by this time I'm living
in Westchester County

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.520
just north of New York City.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.560
And so I don this
turban, and we all

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.180
know what happened
a month later.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.470
9/11 happened.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:28.820
So I saw the towers come down
on the big screen in a cafeteria

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.659
at work, and within
hours I had coworkers

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.490
who were giving
me strange looks,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.240
bloodshot eyes, staring me down.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.909
And as the news
was trickling in,

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.440
I knew I'm not going to be safe.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.460
So I suddenly became
that "ultimate other."

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.310
And within hours I had a friend
who was pulled out of a train

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.051
just because he had
a turban and a beard

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:52.550
somewhere in the
American Northeast.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.780
He actually made CNN.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.665
He was on news, having
been arrested because--

00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:58.040
just he had a
turban and a beard.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.890
So that label-- being brown,
but especially with a turban

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:01.640
and beard--

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.650
became the "ultimate
other" label in America.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.010
And in some ways it still is.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.880
So what came to my rescue
is, I saw a cartoon--

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.660
an editorial cartoon.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.130
A few weeks after 9/11 hate
crimes had risen, skyrocketing.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.040
Anybody who was perceived to
be the other, Hispanic men,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.940
Muslim men, South Asians,
Hindus, Christians.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.620
As long as you were
brown and fitted

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.170
that "other" label, fair game.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.560
Let's arrest you, punch
you, call you names.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.720
So I saw a cartoonist
who's based out

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.400
of San Francisco, Mark Fiore.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.370
He created a cartoon called
"Find the Terrorist."

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:48.180
And he had this fast-rotating
image of different characters.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:50.540
And the whole point there
was-- you get to click.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.710
There's a Sikh guy,
there's a Hispanic man,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.780
there's a Muslim man,
there's a white man.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.090
And you were getting
introduced to these men.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.650
And the point was--

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:02.670
these are all Americans.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.128
And it turns out
the white man, who

00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:05.880
happened to be a guy
whose name was John

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.254
and he had committed
a hate crime

00:10:07.254 --> 00:10:08.870
against a fellow
American, and he

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.620
happened to be a
terrorist at that moment,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.970
because he was
committing hate crimes.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.470
Right?

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.430
But we don't use
that terminology

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.560
for people who
commit hate crimes.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.340
So for me there were, like,
bells that went off in my head

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.230
that, hey, Mark's
actually portraying

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.537
Sikhs and others in cartoons.

00:10:25.537 --> 00:10:27.120
And I had never seen
people who looked

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.740
like me in editorial cartoons.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.040
And I said, you know what?

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.140
Maybe I should start
creating cartoons.

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.300
So I taught myself.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:37.260
I started going on the internet
and I started teaching myself

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.190
how to do cartooning.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.800
And really not physically
drawing-- that's

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.270
not really the
art of cartooning.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.144
It's catching
contradictions in society.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.310
So this is one of the first
cartoons that I created.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.800
It's an eye chart.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.822
And the principal
message here is,

00:10:52.822 --> 00:10:54.030
we judge people all the time.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.238
We place labels all the time.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:55.780
Right?

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.640
But you don't know these people.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.140
Right?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.410
And so the whole point here is,
look, unless you ask me what

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.200
my story is, don't judge me.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.740
Right?

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.580
But unfortunately
we all do this.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.490
So I do cartoons based
on my experiences,

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.830
based on news stories.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.120
So this is really one of
the coolest men who I've

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.461
created many cartoons about.

00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:17.460
His name is Fanja Singh.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.186
He is of Indian descent.

00:11:19.186 --> 00:11:20.310
He's a British citizen now.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.170
He moved to the UK
in his late 80s.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.720
Lost his wife, so he spent
some time with his sons there.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.300
And he fell in
love with running.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.630
He became a competitive
marathon runner.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.800
He started breaking
world records.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.610
He did that until the
age of 100 years old.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.960
He went all over the world.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.640
He still runs.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.670
He's 105-years-old.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.680
He's still alive.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.060
He raises money for poor
people in Africa and Asia.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.810
When he came to New
York, by the way, when

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.670
he was running the
marathon there,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.050
he was called Osama bin
Laden by some people.

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.970
We all know "The Scream."

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.810
I am, as I mentioned, a
shy guy who will not--

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.340
if you abuse me, if you call
me names, chances are I won't--

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.920
I'll try to maybe engage you,
but if you are not interested

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.010
I won't say anything in
return, but I'll go home

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.391
and I'll start
creating cartoons.

00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.890
And that's how I
feel like at times.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.520
I really feel like
screaming at people,

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.390
but I try to pour my
frustrations through cartoons.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.940
So that's how I
feel like at times.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:24.432
Anybody here ever seen a hot
air balloon with a bun on top?

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:25.390
I bet you you have not.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.230
Right?

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.150
But now you have.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.770
And I would say this.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.147
This is possible, physically.

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:34.230
From an engineering
perspective, this is possible.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.980
And the whole concept
here is, look,

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.330
have hot air balloons with buns.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.440
And I'm sure people
are going to wonder,

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.398
why do we have a bun on
top of hot air balloon?

00:12:40.398 --> 00:12:41.770
Well, then you get to explain.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.420
It's a Sikh hot air balloon.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.620
So, anybody who wants
to copy this idea,

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.572
it's not copyrighted.

00:12:46.572 --> 00:12:48.280
You can go ahead and
make a lot of money.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.687
Just give little
reference to, hey,

00:12:50.687 --> 00:12:52.520
this was an idea that
Vishavjit came up with

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.340
and I bought it from there.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.030
So Googlers, take
a note of that.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.920
So talking about labels--

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.570
so bringing it
back to real life.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.330
This man was a superintendent
in New York City schools

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.896
in the mid-2000s.

00:13:07.896 --> 00:13:10.520
New York City is one of the most
diverse places on this planet.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.540
And believe it or not, even
there today more than half

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.380
of Sikh kids who go to school
report getting bullied.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.640
That's a staggering number.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.190
Half of Sikh boys
and girls are bullied

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.690
in schools in New York City.

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.270
I can't even imagine what
happens in certain other places

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.440
in America.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.120
It took almost a
year to convince

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.620
this man, who was
running our school

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.020
districts at the
time, that let's

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.890
have a web portal so parents
and kids can anonymously

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.260
put complaints in so somebody
can do something about it.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.510
He was not convinced.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.590
It took civil action
threats of lawsuits

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:46.820
before he was convinced.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.460
Those are challenges-- and
I'm not saying he's a bad man.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.560
But those are challenges
we face in society,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.930
where even today good men
and women-- educated--

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.320
take a lot of convincing with
data and persuasion, in person

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.380
at times, to say, look,
we need to have resources

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:07.900
so we can share data about
things that are not good for us

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.029
as a society.

00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:12.070
This is another true story
out of Quebec, Canada,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.280
a French and
English-speaking province.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.220
Unfortunately, like many
other places on this planet,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.100
diversity is something
that many societies don't

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.680
want to embrace, or they want to
embrace it on their own terms.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.620
So Quebec, a few years ago there
was a Quebec Soccer Federation

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.200
for young kids,
middle-schoolers.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.290
And that federation decided
they were going to pass a rule.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.670
If you are a kid who has
a turban on his head,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.020
you cannot play soccer.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.650
The reason was, you are a danger
to yourself and other kids.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.660
In reality they wanted
to pass a policy

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.220
saying Muslim kids
are not allowed

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.430
because Quebec is having
"issues," quote unquote,

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:52.816
with Muslims.

00:14:52.816 --> 00:14:54.940
But they wanted to be
democratic about their racism

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.590
because if they said
Muslim kids are not allowed

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.360
they're opening themselves
up to lawsuits, so they

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.020
wanted to be--

00:14:59.020 --> 00:14:59.770
they were clever.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:00.730
They were crafty.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.820
Let's just make a rule for
all religious artifacts

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:04.870
and symbols.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.250
So Jewish kids, Sikh kids,
Christian kids, not allowed.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.100
And this policy probably
is still in place.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.335
But those are challenges.

00:15:13.335 --> 00:15:13.834
You know?

00:15:13.834 --> 00:15:17.890
People use data and intelligence
to actually figure out

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.480
ways of using racism
to their benefit.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.229
Another story out of a city that
has been in the news last year

00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:26.770
quite a bit-- what
comes to mind when

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.830
you think of Charlottesville?

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.635
Anybody?

00:15:31.992 --> 00:15:33.200
AUDIENCE: Probably the march.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.460
VISHAVJIT SINGH: The march.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.930
A lot of people will say
"KKK," "white supremacy."

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.640
It might be true for
that period of time,

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.390
but Charlottesville actually
has a really unique distinction

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:45.360
in America.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.090
It's the first
city ever anywhere

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.452
in America that had a Sikh
mayor with a turban and beard.

00:15:50.452 --> 00:15:52.160
And most people would--
if I were to say,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.974
take a guess, what city would
have done that, you would

00:15:54.974 --> 00:15:56.140
imagine cities in the North.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.270
You would not think
of a city in the South

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.400
that would have done this.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.150
And those are stereotypes we
have of places in America,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.745
saying, everybody
in the South is not

00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:05.870
as progressive as everybody
who lives in the North.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.580
Well, you know what?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.160
It's not true.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.159
Life's more complicated.

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:11.300
Charlottesville has
this unique sort of fact

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:12.897
about itself that
it had a Sikh mayor.

00:16:12.897 --> 00:16:14.730
First turbaned and
bearded mayor in America.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:17.150
So I thought that
was really cool.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.550
So here's another story
that did not make the news.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.660
I saw it on a blog by NAACP,
which is the first civil rights

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.230
organization that was
representing African-Americans.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.920
A Sikh man drove
through Mississippi--

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.750
he's a commercial truck driver.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.031
Flat tire, waited
for cops to come.

00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:37.280
And usually what do cops do
when you have a flat tire?

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.330
They come and help you.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.410
Well, cops saw him.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.480
They judged him, stereotyped
him, labeled him.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.090
Freaked out, physically
searched him--

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:48.110
they should not have done that--
found a religious artifact

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.770
on him, a kirpan, which
is a religious dagger,

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:54.350
call him a terrorist a bunch
of times, arrested him.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.060
He was presented in
front of a judge,

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.310
and the judge said to
him, excuse me sir,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.230
you cannot enter this courtroom.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.765
Why?

00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:02.390
Because you have that
rag on your head.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.140
And if you're going
to enter my courtroom,

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.254
you're going to have
to leave that rag off.

00:17:06.254 --> 00:17:07.670
And, ladies and
gentlemen, this is

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:09.628
somebody who has gone
through law school, who's

00:17:09.628 --> 00:17:12.710
taken an oath to defend
our constitution and laws.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.900
And this is happening--

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.720
these cases have happened
in Michigan, in Ohio.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.819
And they still happen.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.869
They just don't make the news.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.240
Now, does it make
these people racist?

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.650
That's not what's important.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.910
They engaged in racist moments,
and that's what's important.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.660
And we need to deal
with those situations.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.660
These men need training.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:31.719
They need education.

00:17:31.719 --> 00:17:34.010
And unfortunately, in this
case, none of that happened.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.710
The Sikh man hired
some lawyers, NAACP

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.540
and a few other
organizations, and he

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.520
got those cases written off.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.020
So we have a challenge
where we have

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.832
a lot of intelligent
people, good people--

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:45.290
I would call them
good people, even

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.480
these people who
need education, who

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.730
need to hear stories of people
who look different but share

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.970
a lot in common with them.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:57.535
Talking about race and policing.

00:17:57.535 --> 00:17:59.660
We've had a lot of stories
about black men and boys

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.243
getting killed at
the hands of police.

00:18:01.243 --> 00:18:02.390
Right?

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.150
And amazingly, if you
look at a lot of surveys,

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.725
even today, majority
of white people

00:18:06.725 --> 00:18:09.350
have a very different perception
than majority of black people.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.930
They just cannot come to an
agreement that we have a race

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.760
problem in America today.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.700
They'll agree we have
some, but not to the extent

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.531
that it's leading to police
officers shooting black men

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:20.030
and boys.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.738
So I'll share this
next cartoon with you.

00:18:21.738 --> 00:18:23.990
This is in response
to an NPR story,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:27.410
where the city of Los Angeles
is doing community policing.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.650
And as part of that community
policing a lawyer got access--

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.870
private access to cops.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.484
Not recorded, no names, nothing.

00:18:35.484 --> 00:18:37.400
Let's just have a
heart-to-heart conversation.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.012
Right?

00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:40.220
Nobody is going to talk
about, hey, who this guy was,

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.630
what your name is.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.290
And just about every police
officer, white or black,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.620
said this in the
privacy of these spaces,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.410
that "I fear black people.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.920
I fear black men, and
I fear black boys."

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.410
That's an incredible admission.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.390
And I'm not stunned.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.140
I'm not surprised.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.212
So imagine a police officer.

00:19:01.212 --> 00:19:02.670
One of the hardest
jobs in America.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:04.520
You're putting your
life on the line.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.120
You go out.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.290
You're trained.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:10.440
You're heavily armed, and
you're also armed with fear.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.080
Of course you're
going to sometimes,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.700
in difficult
situations-- you're going

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.916
to imagine a black man
who's going into his pocket

00:19:17.916 --> 00:19:19.290
for getting out
his ID and you're

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:21.780
going to think he
is taking out a gun.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.240
Because that's what fear does.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.380
And it is not a surprise-- it's
not an accident that people who

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.340
look like me don't get shot.

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.420
White men, brown meant, Sikh
men don't get shot by cops.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:34.590
Black men do.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.080
Because in many cases,
including myself,

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.930
we're raised with a certain
fear of black people.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.375
And unless we have these
conversations out in public,

00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:46.000
we will have more black men and
boys who are going to get shot,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.489
until we start having these
conversations in public.

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:50.780
So here's an interesting story.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.130
Joe Budden is a hip-hop
artist who, a couple of years

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.690
ago, found himself
in an airport.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.700
He was at a carousel
waiting for his luggage.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.190
He spotted a Sikh man
who looks like my father.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.400
White beard, dapperly-dressed.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.506
And Joe Budden thought,
hey, you know what?

00:20:04.506 --> 00:20:05.880
I'm going to
stereotype this guy.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.780
He's not American.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:07.500
I'm an American.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.490
So he took a photo, tweeted
it with a caption saying,

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.810
"not on my watch, homeboy."

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:19.260
He labeled him as a "suspicious"
terrorist character,

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:19.760
tweeted it.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.427
People loved it.

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:21.176
They retweeted it.

00:20:21.176 --> 00:20:22.670
Thousand of times
it was retweeted.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.310
Until somebody caught onto
it, brought to his notice.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.727
And this was big news
for a couple of days.

00:20:27.727 --> 00:20:29.060
And so eventually he apologized.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.860
And I think he apologized
after two days.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.240
I don't feel it was
a genuine apology.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.750
He apologized because he
wanted to save his brand.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.041
That's what a lot of people do.

00:20:37.544 --> 00:20:38.960
And one of the
reasons I show this

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.900
is, stereotyping and racism
is not a one-way street.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.310
It happens all over the place.

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.200
I stereotype people as well.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.700
And just because
you get stereotyped

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:53.520
doesn't mean you don't
stereotype other people.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.490
This is a very
self-explanatory cartoon.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.197
I get asked by people all
the time, where are you from?

00:20:58.197 --> 00:21:00.530
And I'm like, well, I'm kind
of from all over the place.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.190
Born in DC, lived
all over the place.

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.310
I am from New York now.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:05.190
And they're like, no, no, no.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.290
But where are you really from?

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.310
I'm like, well, I
know what you're

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.560
trying to get to so let
me just cut it short.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.210
My parents are from India.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.650
And they're like, great.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:14.730
You're not from here.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.724
And, I mean, it's just absurd.

00:21:17.724 --> 00:21:19.140
There are Sikhs
who have been here

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.400
for three or four generations.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.109
Americans are not
defined by their looks.

00:21:23.109 --> 00:21:25.774
How do you know when you look at
somebody that they're American?

00:21:25.774 --> 00:21:26.490
You can't.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.110
But we do it all
the time anyways.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.610
All right.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.990
So Captain America in
a turban and a beard.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.230
A few years ago I went to
a New York City Comic Con

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.590
as an exhibitor selling my art.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.490
The first Captain America
movie had come out,

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.680
and I drew him in
turban and beard,

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.140
in case you have not
figured that out already.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.830
And I envisioned
a Captain America

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:49.080
who's going to find hidden
bias in a turban and beard.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:49.550
People loved it.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.300
They were like, wow,
this is really great.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.090
A photographer in
passing said, Vishavjit,

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.230
why don't you come next year
dressed up as Captain America?

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.040
And you know what
my response was?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.920
I don't think so.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.570
Because I had body image issues.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.570
I had been bullied all
my life for being skinny.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.650
So I'm like, I'm not doing this.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.660
And there was a second reason.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.630
I was getting called "Osama
bin Laden," "Taliban,"

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.300
"you're not from here," "go
back home" all the time.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.940
Even now most
people stare at me.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.280
And I'm just like-- and
I've gotten used to it.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.460
But I'm like, why would I wear
a leotard, skintight uniform

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.910
and walk out and have every
eye that is not on me on me?

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:26.890
So it took a year
for this photographer

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.750
to convince me that
I should do this.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.110
So I had to prepare at home
in front of the mirror.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.640
She got me a uniform
from Hong Kong,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.350
a teenager size she
could not find in the US.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.340
I went to Sports
Authority goods store,

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:42.700
and I bought myself
baseball and football pads,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.250
shoved them in my uniform
to make myself look big.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.400
My wife had to tell me, you look
like a cartoon-- actual cartoon

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.060
now.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.080
So if you're going
to walk out you're

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.670
going to have to either
be you, Vishavjit Singh,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.300
or you're not going to do this.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.996
So I did step out, June
2013, as Captain America.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:23:00.620
Incredibly nervous, not knowing
what people are going to think.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:01.730
Are they going to
really be offended?

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.220
Are they going to call me names?

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.910
And something really weird and
magical and strange happened.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.292
People embraced me as if I was
a real superhero character.

00:23:12.292 --> 00:23:13.000
People hugged me.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.874
Strangers hugged me.

00:23:13.874 --> 00:23:15.790
I got pulled into weddings,
believe it or not,

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.840
stranger weddings.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.730
Cops came up to me and
took photos with me.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.938
That never happens to me,
certainly in New York City.

00:23:20.938 --> 00:23:22.330
Cops don't do that to anybody.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.030
Not in civilian clothes.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.430
I got access to a
fire department truck

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.230
that was managing a parade.

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:32.410
They gave me this truck
for 20 minutes on my own.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.212
I had this truck.

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:34.420
I pretended I was driving it.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.740
I was jumping in and out.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.740
That was my privilege
for those 20 minutes,

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.027
in that fictional uniform
where I could ask these things

00:23:43.027 --> 00:23:44.110
and they were given to me.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:45.760
That's the power of images.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.680
That's the power of stories.

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.860
Fictional stories that we
take sometimes very seriously.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.934
Because Captain America
is our super hero.

00:23:52.934 --> 00:23:54.100
It's an American super hero.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.850
But guess what?

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.480
Captain America does not exist.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:56.980
Right?

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.734
But you can trick our perceptual
apparatus into thinking,

00:23:59.734 --> 00:24:01.900
oh, Vishavjit Singh is the
coolest guy in the world.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.870
He's the coolest American.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.370
I want to share a quick story
with you about this young boy.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.404
He saw me for about
10 minutes posing

00:24:09.404 --> 00:24:10.820
and he's like,
what are you doing?

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.219
I said, I am Captain
America for the day.

00:24:13.219 --> 00:24:14.260
He's like, no you're not.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.140
I said, why not?

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.390
And he goes, you're not white.

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.920
I said, I know I'm not white.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.610
But Captain America is
a fictional character.

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.260
He could be-- he
could be a woman.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.850
He could be black, Hispanic.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.600
So he thought about it
and he goes, black, yes.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.370
Hispanic, maybe.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.110
Turban and beard, no.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:33.000
And he was not being
malicious, by the way.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.250
He was just being honest.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:38.970
He couldn't fathom, as a
middle-schooler in America--

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:40.470
he had never seen
anybody who looked

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.180
like me in a superior uniform.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.400
So I said, I'm not offended.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.350
Don't worry about it.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.142
But keep in mind for
the rest of your life,

00:24:48.142 --> 00:24:49.641
in the computer of
your head there's

00:24:49.641 --> 00:24:51.150
an image of me as
Captain America,

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.441
and you'll never be able to
take that out of your head.

00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:55.700
So maybe next time you see
somebody who looks like me,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.510
you'll think of
Captain America first.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.210
So that's the power of images.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.720
So here are some labels.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.480
What you see on the
left here is labels

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.291
that the world has placed upon
me in many shapes and forms.

00:25:09.291 --> 00:25:10.290
Some of them are benign.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.049
Some are pretty offensive.

00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:13.590
Then you see that
circle on the right

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.060
and you would think like,
well, you know, that's

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.935
more Vishavjit Singh.

00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:18.540
That's labels I've
placed upon myself.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.050
And one would think that's
more of Vishavjit Singh,

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.660
but I would actually make the
argument that actually I'm

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.640
none of these labels.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.700
I'm informed by how I've
responded to these labels.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.819
How I've maneuvered,
how I've managed them.

00:25:31.819 --> 00:25:33.360
We all do this every
day, by the way.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.280
I'm not the only
one who's doing it.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.400
I am who I am, I'm standing
here today in large part

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.140
because these labels on the
left were placed by other people

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.540
upon me, and I had to
figure out a way of,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.870
how do I respond to them.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.420
Right?

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.850
And they expose
my vulnerability.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:58.230
And what came to my rescue,
strangers, art, and sometimes

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:59.560
tragedies.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:05.100
9/11, surviving a
genocide, feeling

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.720
like I am the most unwanted man
in America by fellow Americans.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.280
Those things actually became
moments where I could say,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.170
you know what?

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.160
Maybe I can do something new.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.860
So let me actually
ask you a question.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.650
Let me move back here.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.200
Show of hands, how many
of you would say you

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.650
engage in stereotyping
other people and cultures?

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.420
Show of hands?

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.700
Most hands have gone up.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.760
When I pose this
question in most crowds,

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.630
most hands do not go up.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.280
Right?

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.835
People-- they don't
want to acknowledge

00:26:39.835 --> 00:26:40.960
that they have stereotypes.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.710
It's a vulnerability.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.770
So let me share
with you a workshop

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.180
that I ran a few weeks ago.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.395
This is a private school near
Boston, very diverse group.

00:26:50.395 --> 00:26:51.770
And I hosted his
workshop, and we

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.100
talked about our stereotypes.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.770
So these are some
positive responses

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.360
from young, diverse
group of high-schoolers.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.980
These are positive
stereotypes, that

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.180
can be very damaging as well.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.930
And then we moved on to
negative stereotypes.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.530
This was a very long list.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:11.120
And this was a repetitive
list, meaning that many of them

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.010
had these responses.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.630
Just read this list.

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.317
I mean, what was amazing
about these kids is not

00:27:17.317 --> 00:27:19.400
that they stand out from
you, that they are racist

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.140
or they have a
stereotyping problem.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:23.671
What they did is they opened
their hearts in that moment,

00:27:23.671 --> 00:27:25.170
their vulnerability,
and said, look,

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.586
I'll honestly share
this with you.

00:27:26.586 --> 00:27:27.977
This was an anonymous exercise.

00:27:27.977 --> 00:27:29.810
Each one of them responded
to this question,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.550
and we read this out loud.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.370
And all of us in America,
around the globe,

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.570
we all have stereotypes.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.000
It's just that some of us
are going to acknowledge it,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.220
some of us are not
willing to acknowledge.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.080
And until we do that we're
going to have challenges.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.200
Right?

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.810
I'm presuming most of you have
gone through the unconscious

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.297
bias at work here at Google?

00:27:49.297 --> 00:27:49.880
Show of hands.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.380
Yeah?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.690
So let me sort of say,
sort of in conclusion here,

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.150
it's quite obvious
labels are data points.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.260
And I know Google is really
big on collecting data.

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.530
But my focus is on storytelling.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.780
And one other things that I
think we lack in our approaches

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.270
to diversity at times is--

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.010
certainly data has
it's importance.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.300
It's critical.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.880
We have to talk about data.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.640
Right?

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.400
But I think there's another
very powerful factor,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.680
and that's story-telling,
our stories.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.180
And what I mean by
stories is, we're

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.388
all walking, talking stories.

00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:28.610
Each one of you is stories.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.740
You're not really defined
by labels and, you know,

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.650
the "race" labels and "where
you're from" necessarily.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.730
You guys are stories.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.640
And those stories
have ups and downs.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.360
They have sad moments,
happy moments.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.894
They have strengths, they
have vulnerabilities.

00:28:40.894 --> 00:28:42.560
And those vulnerabilities--
typically we

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.760
see them as negative things.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.370
We see them as
negative data points.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.240
And I would contend those
vulnerabilities are actually

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.786
what define you, what
make you who you are.

00:28:52.786 --> 00:28:54.410
They actually define
a lot of decisions

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:55.940
you make in your lives.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.550
This is where you're
going to live,

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.425
what you're going to do
in life, where you're

00:28:59.425 --> 00:29:02.390
going to buy a house, who you're
going to give your business to.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.810
Even at work
implicitly those biases

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.710
come into shape and form.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.286
And many of them are implicit.

00:29:08.286 --> 00:29:09.910
You're not even aware
yourself that you

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:12.310
have these biases, right?

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.370
So I would contend that,
if we were to really engage

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:19.674
our vulnerabilities, there's a
lot of connections you'll find.

00:29:19.674 --> 00:29:21.340
Almost everybody who's
here in this room

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.670
and who's hearing this video of
this talk, I can assure you--

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.860
you sit down honestly
with yourself

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:29.765
and you can make a very
long list of stereotypes

00:29:29.765 --> 00:29:32.140
that are placed upon you and
you place upon other people.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.040
And we all have them.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.250
And that's what we
need to start sharing.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:42.270
For me, I would
contend, stories are

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:45.210
creative personal
entrepreneurship.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.930
They have a profound
potential to change

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:53.390
our lives, and
the workplace, out

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:57.770
on the streets, our social,
cultural, political future.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.216
And we all need to--

00:29:59.216 --> 00:30:00.590
I mean, we need
to really embrace

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.840
our stories and their honesty.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.000
Not just as, hey, this is what
I do, this is where I'm from.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.130
Really open up to our
strengths and weaknesses

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.432
and our vulnerabilities, and it
will open up to possibilities.

00:30:11.432 --> 00:30:12.890
And it's personal
entrepreneurship.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.431
And I'm using that
word intentionally

00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:19.640
because "entrepreneur" literally
means, "bearer of risk."

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.430
And until we take those risks
of being honest with ourself,

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.200
first and foremost,
and then honest

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.372
with our fellow
coworkers, we're not

00:30:26.372 --> 00:30:27.830
going to bring
about earnest change

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.830
where things like black
man getting shot by cops

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.590
is not going to stop.

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.920
So to you, as a company,
and especially to you as

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.620
individuals, as members
of broader society,

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.720
I wish you an incredible
amount of success

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.730
in being those creative
personal entrepreneurs.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:45.411
Thank you.

00:30:45.411 --> 00:30:47.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.240
So what I'm going to do is--

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.430
I fortunately also,
as part of my work,

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.200
have been featured in
a few documentaries.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.366
One of them is known as the
"Red, White, and Beard,"

00:30:56.366 --> 00:30:58.430
which you can
actually go on Google.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.584
I should say, YouTube,
which is Google property.

00:31:02.584 --> 00:31:04.250
Just search for "Red,
White, and Beard,"

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:06.864
and you will see a
short 10-minute video

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:08.780
where I actually dressed
up as Captain America

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:10.040
and walked out on
streets of New York City

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.070
and I started engaging people,
started asking them questions.

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.290
And there's another
documentary that

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:19.160
is now doing the rounds
at film festivals, "Drawn

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.230
Together: Comics,
Diversity, and Stereotypes."

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:23.960
That features me along with
a couple of other artists

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.440
who are tackling issues of
diversity and stereotypes.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.334
And we are fortunate to have the
director of that film, Harleen

00:31:30.334 --> 00:31:32.000
[INAUDIBLE] here, so
she's going to take

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.700
a few minutes to
introduce that project

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.345
and show you a quick trailer.

00:31:36.345 --> 00:31:37.470
HARLEEN SINGH: Hi everyone.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.120
My name is Harleen,
and I'm a storyteller.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.270
So taking off from
what Vishavjit was just

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:48.950
talking about, I think
stories are really important.

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:50.170
Just take a moment.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.500
Maybe just close your eyes
for a second and think of--

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.420
you are in Trader Joe's
and picking up bananas,

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.200
and somebody is actually
making monkey noises just

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.050
because you're holding bananas.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.210
Or think of another
situation where you're just

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:10.970
taking a walk down the beach.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:13.130
You are just
dressed up casually,

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.960
but somebody is actually calling
you a terrorist or a towel head

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.220
or a rag head for that matter.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.140
Or for that matter,
let's picture

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.870
this, that you just had a baby.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:31.120
It's a small, loving child, and
you're giving all the attention

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.410
to that child.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.830
But yet you want to do something
different with your life.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.120
But just because you're a
mom, your life is finished.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.400
Yes, these are labels.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.180
These are stereotypes.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:49.860
These are stereotypes that we,
as a society, place on others.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:54.710
And one of the things that, as
a storyteller, I want to do--

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.430
and I wish everybody, each
one of us, can do in this room

00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:59.660
as well--

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.510
is to shun stereotypes.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:05.390
It's a strange thing that
when somebody actually

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:09.350
stereotypes us we are
like, hm-mm, don't do that.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.950
You know what?

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:12.010
I was in a bad mood that day.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.070
Or you know what?

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.665
That's not who I am.

00:33:14.665 --> 00:33:16.520
You misjudged me.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.620
But when it comes to others,
we really want to place labels.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.700
Oh, pregnant women
probably can do it.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:28.070
Oh, this person is driving
a car really badly.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.990
Definitely a lady.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.420
There's no question about it.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:37.040
Or there is a child who is
actually just working around

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.650
and you're like, my god these
parents must be terrible

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:43.160
because of the way the
child is being treated.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.960
Or if there's a black
man just walking around

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.650
you're like, oh,
definitely a drugist.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.700
He just can't have the
money to pay for what

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.540
he's just shopping around.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.650
This is something that we,
as a society, need to change.

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.620
And as storytellers we
want to show examples

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.474
of people who have done it.

00:34:02.474 --> 00:34:03.890
And the story that
you'll probably

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.050
just watch a glimpse of--

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.170
the film, which is called "Drawn
Together; Comics, Diversity,

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:10.639
and Stereotypes"--

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.850
the film shows that there
are three people who

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.139
are using comics as
a medium to challenge

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:20.090
this notion of stereotypes.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.179
And sometimes we feel
that if they can do it

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:26.600
with just a pen in
hand, a lot of us

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.550
can do it with so
many other means.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.460
So the goal is
that, when you watch

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:35.420
the trailer you go back home,
read about these things,

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.699
and then try and
make a difference

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:41.630
about this particular
subject of people around you.

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.219
Make a difference
in your society.

00:34:43.219 --> 00:34:45.290
Make a difference in yourself.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:50.904
Change is what happens when
you take that first step.

00:34:50.904 --> 00:34:51.570
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:54.889
- Comics are a great
way to comment on stuff

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:57.144
that's happening in the world.

00:34:57.144 --> 00:34:59.629

[SWAT]

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.130
- Creating cartoons allowed me
to channel my anger with how

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.240
I was being perceived, have
been perceived all my life.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.190
You're not American.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.570
- As a woman creator, the idea
that maybe my stories would

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:28.370
naturally be romance stories
or soap-opera-type stories.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:31.640
In reality, I like
big adventure stories

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.780
with action and explosions and
super-big, fun, crazy stuff.

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:44.580
- What I wanted to do was
make a commentary on race

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:47.284
without making a
commentary on race.

00:35:47.284 --> 00:35:49.200
There's a lot of people
who have had hardships

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.610
before Sikhs came here.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:52.410
Get out of your
comfort zone, which

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:55.590
means do things that haven't
been done by a community

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.942
before.

00:35:56.942 --> 00:35:59.347
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.920
- Collectively, if we are
all allowed to do what I do,

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:15.600
which is make stories
from my perspective,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.210
showing that I am more than
what is depicted in mainstream

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.860
media, then we can really
have a decent discussion

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:30.840
about solving the problems and
issues of race and stereotypes.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.340
