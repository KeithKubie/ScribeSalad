Hi. My name's Mike Wales and

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.500
I'm the Web Development Curriculum Manager here at Udacity.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.910
I usually create a new branch whenever I'm moving on to

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.790
a different piece of work.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.500
Anytime I'm doing something different, I will create a new branch.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.350
I like to think of it as context switching.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.900
Whenever I'm switching to work on a new feature or

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.710
whether I'm going to correct a bug, I'll create a new branch at that time.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.140
Git branches help you keep a project organized, particularly,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.240
when you're sharing that project publicly.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.580
You'll have your master branch, and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.230
that would be your production quality branch that never breaks, always works.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.030
And then you could have a development branch where active work is

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.050
taking place on your project.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.340
Then a lot of times you'll have things like an experimental branch or

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.490
maybe some unique feature branches.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.100
Those are things that you're working on, and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.620
you fully expect them to break, and you want to share those with the public, but

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.710
with the understanding that this isn't production quality work just yet.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
Branches are also good when not only collaborating publicly, but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.670
their really good to collaborate with yourself.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.019
So a lot of times, if I'm working on a feature, and then I come across a bug.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.920
Branches allow me that ability to context switch and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.880
get away from the work I'm doing on my feature.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.880
Go back to where I need to be to fix the bug and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.540
then compartmentalize that work.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.850
Branches are really good.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.630
Even if I get bored on working on a feature.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.260
It gives you the ability to, okay, I want to switch and

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.740
start working on something else right now.
