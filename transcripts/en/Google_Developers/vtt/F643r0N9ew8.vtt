STEVEN BAZYL: Thanks for
coming today, everyone.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.850
My name is Steven Bazyl.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.210
I'm a Developer Advocate here
at Google, where I work with

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.060
web developers like yourselves
to help them integrate their

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.260
web apps with Google Apps and
Google Apps Marketplace.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.450
Before we get started, I just
want to get a quick sense of

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.670
who's in the audience today.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.315
So if you already have an app
in the Marketplace, can you

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.710
just raise your hands?

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.260
All right.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.650
Pretty good.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.640
Great.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.710
And who here is just learning
about the Marketplace for the

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.520
first time today?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.660
Maybe you went to Scott's
earlier talk this morning?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.090
Anyone?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.590
All right.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.210
Good.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.110
And does anyone actually
use Google Apps.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.500
All right.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.980
That's pretty good.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.100
So today we're going to talk
about some of the best

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.120
practices that we've seen emerge
in the Marketplace over

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.410
the past year, specifically in
the area of integration.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.630
Because integration is such a
wide topic, this is not a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.070
deeply technical talk.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.280
However, I hope that by the
end you're going to have a

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.715
better sense for the value
integration brings to both

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:01.890
your customers and
to your business.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.560
And along the way, I'll try to
provide some technical tips

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.460
and tricks to help you
get started in

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.680
integrating your app.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.600
For those who are new to the
Marketplace, it is a business

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.530
to business web application
store for the more than three

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.930
million businesses and three
million users on Google Apps

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.560
to discover, try, and purchase
new web applications to help

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.330
run their business
in the cloud.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.100
It is not a consumer
web store.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.280
You will not find games.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240
You will not find media,
music, or books,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.740
anything of that sort.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.030
Instead, what you'll find are
business productivity tools.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.850
Things like project management,
customer

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.430
relationship management,
accounting, financing, expense

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.580
reporting, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.730
need to help run their business
in the cloud.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.000
We [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.850
Marketplace a little
over a year ago,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.700
back on March 9, 2010.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.150
And started with 50 apps
in the Marketplace.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.200
Shortly after, at last year's
Google I/O actually, we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810
unveiled some new integration
points--

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.835
contextual gadgets for Gmail.

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:08.449
And I'm going to go into more
detail on this later on.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.730
More recently, this past
January, we expanded the scope

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.630
of the Marketplace by
introducing a category for

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.420
Google Apps for Education and
added over 20 applications for

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.100
K-12 and universities.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.350
And more recently celebrated
our first

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.990
birthday this past March.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.000
And hit a milestone of 300
business applications now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.630
available in the Marketplace.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.350
Today, we're getting
close to about 350.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.190
And we continue to add
more each week.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.040
So why the history lesson?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.890
Well, over the past year we've
got to work with a lot of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.650
different application developers
in integrating

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.380
their apps.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.010
And we've observed
a lot of customer

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.730
behavior over that year.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.180
What we learned--

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080
well, let me say we still have
a lot to learn in terms of

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.270
what makes for a great
Marketplace app and successful

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.360
experience.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.580
But over that year, we have seen
certain trends and best

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.716
practices emerge.

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:03.100
And what I want to focus on
today is integration.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.165
So let's talk about
integration.

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:09.410
Just give you a couple
examples of

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.360
what it mean by this.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.050
For starters, it includes
things like providing

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.200
universal navigation-- a quick
way and a consistent way for

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.180
users to access their
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.790
and sign in and without
having to have another

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.335
user name and password.

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:21.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.700
thought this was such an
important [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.980
of having a consistent user
experience that we made this a

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.256
core requirement for joining
the Marketplace.

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:32.530
You could also do things like
import and export contacts,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.660
access and update calendars,
documents.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.410
Applications can also publish
content and gadgets to sites.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.850
Gadgets turn out to be pretty
useful in other contexts.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.380
You can actually use
gadgets in Gmail

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.460
as I mentioned earlier.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.390
They also can be used
on a calendar and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.940
in the Gmail sidebar.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.530
And another one which is often
overlooked but we've seen some

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.640
pretty clever uses of
is Google Talk as

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.580
an integration point.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.750
And we'll see some examples
of that later on.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.640
Of course, this is just a quick
example of the things

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.610
that you can do.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.960
Throughout the talk, I'm going
to go into some of these

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.780
integration points
in more detail.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.860
And show you how some apps in
the Marketplace are using

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.430
these today to drive additional
value for customers

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.680
and for their business.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.589
For you as an application
developer, the reason this is

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.029
so important is simple.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.470
Integration gets you
more customers.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.470
A few weeks ago, I wanted to see
if there was a correlation

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.060
between how well integration in
an application was and how

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.850
well it performed in
the Marketplace.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.860
So I decided to take a look at
the top 100 applications in

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.630
the Marketplace.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.140
And this is measured by their
weekly installs for the

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.970
previous week.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.160
What I found is that the top
10 applications in the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.430
Marketplace--

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.940
all 10 of these went well
beyond the minimum

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.960
requirements for going
in the Marketplace.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.440
That is it addition to Single
Sign-On, they all found ways

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.410
to integrate Google Contacts,
Calendar, Docs, and so on.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.440
When you look at the next 50,
the rate's still pretty good

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.350
about three out of the four
apps, but we're starting to

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.440
see some apps that are really
just getting by

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.790
with the bare minimum.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.450
And when you go out to the
top 100, that rate

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.690
drop down to 66%.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.070
Of course, there are some
variables that go into how

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.850
well an application performs.
The pricing model, the

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.520
category of the app, how well
they do marketing and

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.790
support-- all of these are
things that we would have to

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.520
control for in order to find out
if there's really a strong

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.970
correlation or a strong
causation even.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.000
I'm still really interested in
getting to that the heart of

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.910
that question.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.410
But fortunately other people
have been looking at this

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.110
question and they came to the
very same conclusion.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.270
Sunir Shah is founder of one
of the applications in the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.740
Marketplace--

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.750
FreshBooks.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.080
And FreshBooks spends a lot of
time integrating their app

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.620
with others.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.670
Not just Google Apps, but a
whole host of web applications

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.331
that their customers use.

00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:53.980
When he blogs, he summed it up
pretty simple for why this is

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:54.890
so important.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.696
People want end-to-end
solutions.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.070
It translates to the
bottom line.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.250
And the kicker--

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.110
if a customer uses any of their
integrations, they're

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.170
three times more likely to
become a paying customer.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.990
That's a huge difference
in conversion rate.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.660
For those of you who went to
Scott McMullan's earlier talk,

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.710
you may have heard Cameron
from GQueues echoing

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:15.035
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:15.035 --> 00:06:17.580
and he's seeing phenomenal
differences in conversion

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.060
rates when people use their
integration with Google Apps.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.245
Why do they convert?

00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:26.020
Because customers love
integrations.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.360
Not only do they want those
end-to-end and solutions, but

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.420
it saves them time and it makes
them passionate about

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.640
the products.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.490
Jeff Harmons, a small business
owner and entrepreneur, was

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.045
profiled in a case study with
Outright and Google Apps.

00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:39.315
And he summed it up.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.360
This is icing on the cake.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.450
He can stay focused.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.920
And move on to helping the next
customer or spending time

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.680
with my family.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.640
In other words, by saving
time, making them more

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.450
efficient, we're letting our
customers focus on the things

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.640
which are important to them.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.330
It's a little paradoxical, but
this is exactly what we want.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.440
We want people spending less
time in our applications and

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.910
more time doing what's
important.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.385
So when we talk about
integrations, we don't want to

00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:05.210
just add features to our

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.110
applications for any old reason.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.050
We don't want to add
integrations just to say that

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.760
we did them.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.180
So when you think about what
you can do with your

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.110
application, your really want to
focus on those things which

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.090
provide immediate value to your
customers and save them

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.790
time and save them effort.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.030
For today, I'm going to focus
on three areas where I think

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.980
integration can help
us do that.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.380
The first in on the out
of the box experience.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.640
How do we use integration and
the data available to help

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.960
make users--

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.140
help them get up to speed more
quickly on our application and

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.876
become productive?

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:38.940
The second is collaboration.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.930
How do we use integration points
available and the data

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.980
to help people connect to their
co-workers and their

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.310
customers and suppliers
and work

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.760
more effectively together?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.920
And the third is improving
access to information.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.740
Saving them time by making
information available to them

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.120
when they need and where
they need it.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.030
So let's start with the out
of the box experience.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.070
Something really important to
note about the Marketplace is

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.980
that this is not a traditional
enterprise sales channel.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.420
There are no sales people.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.080
There are no sales engineers,
consultants or anything to

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.420
help customers set
up, configure,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.680
deploy, and train users.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.120
So it puts a burden on you as
an application developer to

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.210
make sure that your applications
are designed for

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.670
a self-service model.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.800
Things like the configuration
and deployment need to be very

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.380
easy and streamlined.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:30.540
Training for users needs to be
built into the application so

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:34.530
people can get started
with minimal effort.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.630
When it comes to integration,
there's one area where I think

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.735
we actually can provide a
lot of values to users.

00:08:38.735 --> 00:08:42.270
And that's in the user account
provisioning process.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.890
Those who have been enterprise
space know this has been a

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.330
pain point for a long time.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.810
And fortunately over the past
decade or so, we'd actually

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.900
seen a convergence on LDAP
directories in the enterprise

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.730
as a way to manage user accounts
and authenticate

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.640
users and ensure people have
the right permissions.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.490
Unfortunately when we all made
the move to the cloud, a lot

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.910
of those lessons been lost.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.640
So today in the marketplace
what we're seeing for

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.490
provisioning is really
two models emerging.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.620
One is what I would describe
as an invite model.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.340
And this is where an
administrator has to

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.340
explicitly create an account for
their users before those

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.110
users can log in and use
the application.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.815
The second is an ad hoc model.

00:09:22.815 --> 00:09:25.830
And this is where accounts and
organizations are just

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.453
dynamically created and
associated every time a new

00:09:28.453 --> 00:09:32.440
user logs in for
the first time.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.860
On either case, remember that
we're always authenticating

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.990
the user with their Google
account through our Single

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.000
Sign-On mechanism, which
is based on OpenID.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But in addition to being a way
to do Single Sign-On and

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.280
authentication, OpenID is also
an opportunity to streamline

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.000
the set-up process for users.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.190
You can do this by taking
advantage of an extension

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.720
called Attribute Exchange
which allows us to fetch

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.550
profile information such as a
user's first name, their last

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.810
name, and language,
and email address.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.290
So let's actually take a look at
this in practice and how it

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.880
can improve the apps.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.840
This is actually a screen shot
from another app in the

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.390
Marketplace--

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.080
BatchBook.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.990
It's a CRM application.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.100
And this is their sign-up form
that users who come directly

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.120
to their site would see
when they sign up.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.600
It looks just like any other
sign-up form on any other web

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.840
application.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.130
The problem though is that the
longer and more complicated

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.700
these forms become, the more
opportunity and the more

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.330
reason there is for users to
abandon your sign-up funnel.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.425
So it's really important that
you make the sign-up process

00:10:32.425 --> 00:10:34.620
as streamlined as possible.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:36.590
When it came to integrating
with the Marketplace, they

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.800
were able to take advantage of
Attribute Exchange and OpenID

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.150
to simplify this greatly.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.390
The result is a form which is
basically one field asking for

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.840
their time zone.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.260
And if they really wanted to,
they probably could've skipped

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.310
us too by using geo-location
data to figure out where the

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.060
user is or using some JavaScript
to test the

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.640
browser's time zone.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.210
But you can see that by using
the information they got when

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.490
the user authenicated, they
were able to eliminate the

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.430
need to ask for their
name and email.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:05.770
They were able to eliminate
the need

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:06.710
to ask for a password.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:12.210
And the whole process became
much, much simpler for users.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.900
When you talk about the invite
model, the savings can

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.770
actually be even
more dramatic.

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.660
So in this case we're looking
at a screen shot from

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.300
Expensify, which is an expense
reporting application in the

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.560
Marketplace.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.460
This is a screen in the form
that administrators would see

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.500
when they need to bring
additional users into the

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.650
application to get started.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.150
For a small company, three to
five people, this isn't really

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.330
that big a deal.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:36.190
You probably know everyone.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.470
You know their email
addresses.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.440
You could probably set them
up in under a minute.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.410
But what happens when you
get to 20 users or

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.500
50 or 100 or 500.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.280
This process breaks down.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.620
When they joined the
Marketplace, they were able to

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.350
simplify this by taking
advantage of some information

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.725
available to applications
from our user feed.

00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:57.510
This basically gives you access
to the list of users in

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.470
the domain, including their
name, email, and so on.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.250
The result for administrators
is that now they just get a

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.740
form with all of their users
pre-populated and, to complete

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.350
the work, they just simply
need to say what are the

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.560
reporting relationships and
who has access to approve

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.540
expense reports.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.320
Much simpler.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.090
Much faster.

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.800
And if the company sizes to
scale up, the savings become

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.050
more and more dramatic.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.610
The user feed has another
purpose which is really,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.960
really useful for speeding
adoption of your application,

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.950
which is helping administrators
improve the

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.720
awareness of your application
and provide them

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.955
some training material.

00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:36.020
This is a screen shot.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.890
The text might be a little
bit hard to read.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:40.900
But it's from another expense
reporting asking app--

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.950
Concur Breeze.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.140
And at the end of their
deployment wizard, they

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.950
present administrators the
option of sending an email to

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.970
all their users or at least all
the ones that they invited

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.455
into using the application.

00:12:50.455 --> 00:12:53.390
And that email provide them with
some quick instructions

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.210
about how to actually get
started with the application

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.040
and beginning submitting
expense reports.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:04.860
As I mentioned earlier in terms
of the importance of

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.660
building training into your
application, leveraging the

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.460
user feed, leveraging the list
of users, and proactively

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.950
reaching out to them is a great
way to provide some of

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.650
that training material.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.750
And we'll go into some more
of it later as well.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.570
Of course if you do have
access to this user fee

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.285
information, you have to be
careful not to abuse it.

00:13:24.285 --> 00:13:25.610
It's a lot of information.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.210
You have the email addresses
for an entire company.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.180
Don't spam users.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.420
Don't abuse the information.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.330
Try to be a good Net citizen.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.440
Give them the ability
to opt out.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.490
And likewise if you start
subscribing people, give them

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.690
an opt out as well.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.810
Please comply with all
the spam regulations.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.810
So what we just saw are two
different ways of basically

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:47.760
getting the same information.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.620
We saw the user feed and OpenID

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.430
with Attribute Exchanges.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.600
And if you compare them side by
side, you actually see you

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.180
get pretty much the same
information from both.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:01.060
You get email, first name
and last on both APIs.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.180
OpenID does give you the
language, whereas the user

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.690
feed gives you a little bit more
detail about the user's

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.550
role in the organization and
their account status, whether

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.320
it's enabled or disabled.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.780
The main difference is when this
information is available

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.470
and about which users.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.960
With OpenID we're always getting
information about the

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.210
current user at the time
that they log in.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.210
With the user feed, the
application can get

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.800
information about any or all
users on the domain at the

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.790
request of the application.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.230
One important note with OpenID
is that the attribute

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.480
information does require that
you do additional verification

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.750
if you want to use it for
anything other than

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.130
pre-filling in a registration
form.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.880
You can do things like verify
that the OpenID request is

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.360
from a trusted identity provider
like Google where you

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.480
know that we do some
verification of information.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.710
You could also just do
traditional verification

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.730
techniques such as sending
somebody a verification email

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:01.410
to make sure that they actually
have access to the

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.660
email address.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:07.660
So before we move on to
collaboration, I just want to

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.780
quickly wrap up here.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.000
Remember that you do
want to streamline

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.200
adoption as much as possible.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.960
The longer and more complicated
you make your

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.640
set-up process, especially in
the self-service model, the

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.960
greater the chances customers
are going to abandon that

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.515
funnel or delay or just never
come back at all.

00:15:23.515 --> 00:15:25.627
The simpler you make it, the
better and the higher your

00:15:25.627 --> 00:15:28.230
conversions will be.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.385
You can do this by taking
advantage of existing data.

00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:32.570
We talked about two strategies
for doing this.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.580
One is OpenID.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.735
The other is the user feed.

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:37.300
And it's actually pretty common
for application to use

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.440
a combination of both
these APIs.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.460
One, to prefetch the list of
users to the domain, but still

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.220
using OpenID and Attribute
to make sure that they're

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.910
actually authenticating
the correct users.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:52.730
You could also use this
information for training

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.900
purposes and to increase
awareness.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.410
Again, you do want to make sure
that you don't sacrifice

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.810
security or become
a bad citizen.

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:03.730
Verify your attributes when
you're using OpenID.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.140
Don't abuse the email lists.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.395
Don't spam users.

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.660
So let's talk next about
collaboration.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.320
When we talk about
collaboration, there's two

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.790
aspects that we like
to talk about.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.010
One is collaboration
among people.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.230
These are my customers, my
co-workers, my suppliers--

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.540
people that I need
to connect to.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.680
The other aspect is the
actual data that we're

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.985
collaborating on.

00:16:26.985 --> 00:16:30.420
So how do we use integration to
make this more effective.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.480
We'll start with a really simple
example in Goggle Apps

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.030
which is auto-completion
of contacts.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.480
One of the things I love as a
user of Google Apps is whether

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.420
or not I am sending an email,
inviting somebody to a

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.360
meeting, or sharing a document,
I rarely have to

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.500
remember somebody's
email address.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.140
I simply type in the first few
characters of somebody's name

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.720
and it's going to display me
a list of matching people.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.560
And I can quickly select.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.340
Because I rely this so much, I
actually don't remember all

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.606
that many email addresses of
people that I talk to them on

00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:00.570
almost a daily basis.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.650
And it's one of these things
where the time saving seems

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.460
really small, but based on the
frequency that we communicate

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.089
with each other, it actually
builds up to be very quickly.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.880
So as a user, I've come to
expect this behavior in other

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.760
applications.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.829
Now it turns out that data is
available for third-party

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.040
party applications like your
own to actually do this.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.470
Here we see a screen shot from
Mavenlink, a project

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.510
management application that
actually syncs with Google

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.740
Contacts in order to provide
that same user experience of

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:32.180
auto-completion to users
in that application.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.920
It's actually really
simple to do.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.760
Probably the most confusing part
of it though is the fact

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.770
we have so many different APIs
for accessing information

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.900
about people.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.340
For starters we do have the
Contacts API which gives you

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:48.200
personal contacts for
an individual user.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.790
But we also have some additional
APIs such as a

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.360
Shared Contacts API which is
a global address list for a

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.080
domain of users who
are external.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.230
There's a related API called
the Profiles API which is a

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.090
global address list
of internal users.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.930
And to make it even a little bit
more complicated, there is

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.580
the previously mentioned user
feed which gives you a subset

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.645
of all this information
for domain users.

00:18:12.645 --> 00:18:15.290
So the question is like which
ones do you use if you want to

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:20.680
get information about people
that I collaborate with?

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.160
Well, both of the shared
Contacts APIs are restricted

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.240
to Google Apps for Business
and Education customers.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.560
And so from a developer's
perspective, you do need to be

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.430
aware of that co-defensively,
and make sure that you're not

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.800
relying on those APIs
being available.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.010
I encourage you to actually look
at both the Contacts API

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.910
and the user feed first. And
the contacts are useful in

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.130
cases when you want to get
usually external contacts that

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.940
a person might know and the user
feed is a great way just

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.220
to get a list of somebody's
co-workers or all the people

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.860
in the domain as another source
of information for

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.050
autocompletion.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.540
Of course, you can still
use these other APIs.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.970
And it's actually a great way
to add additional value for

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.120
those larger customers that are
actually on Google Apps

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.980
for Business--

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.840
and drive additional
value for them.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.480
Another way that
document-centric apps at least

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.320
can add some basic collaboration
features is by

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.320
taking advantage of Google Docs
as a storage mechanism.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.040
Here we actually see a screen
shot from Gantter, which is

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.670
another project management app
that does Gantt charting.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.740
And they've seamlessly
integrated Google Docs as a

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.610
cloud file system.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.200
One of the things missing
though from Gantter's

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.840
implementation is a notion
of who we're

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.770
actually sharing with.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.680
So as a user if I wanted to
share this project plan with

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.800
the team that I'm working on,
I'd have to go back into

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.470
Google Docs, find that document,
and then set the

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.600
sharing permissions so that
everyone has access.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.720
And that way when they opened up
Gantter, they would be able

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.051
to see that document as well.

00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:51.470
So how do we make this better?

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:53.060
How do we make this
more seamless.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.480
Let's take a look at another
example, another project

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.780
management app called
Manymoon.

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.210
And Manymoon allows users
to attach Google Docs to

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.280
projects and tasks.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.145
And you can actually search for
a doc or create a new one.

00:20:06.145 --> 00:20:09.770
But they do something else
which is pretty clever.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.600
They actually take a look at
what the user's intent is when

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:13.260
they do this.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:16.020
And they realized when
I attach a doc, I'm

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.500
not sharing a link.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.550
That's not what I want to do.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.090
What I really want to do is
share the content of the

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:22.930
document itself.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.920
And since Manymoon knows both
the set of users who are

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.080
working on that project and the
set of documents that have

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.250
been shared with the team, it
can proactively manage the ACL

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.310
through the document.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.260
and they do that by taking
advantage of the ACL feed in

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.930
the document's API.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.800
Any time a user or a document is
either added to or removed

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.670
from a project, the ACLs are
automatically updated.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.590
To understand how important this
is and how much of a time

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.310
saver it is, you have to realize
what would happen if

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:53.000
they didn't do this.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.670
If I were to share a document
with the team and send it out

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.370
review but I didn't set the
permissions, anyone who came

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.895
along would try to open up the
document and get an error.

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.480
And they'd have to send off an
email to me asking for me to

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.992
approve access.

00:21:06.992 --> 00:21:08.820
If I happened to be in
email at the time,

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.570
that's not so bad.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.680
It might take me a minute or two
to see that email and make

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.220
sure that they have the
right permissions.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.410
But if I'm stuck in a meeting or
if I have to go out of the

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.530
office for a day or two, that
minute can stretch into a few

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.270
hours or it can stretch
into a few days.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.430
So all that time those users are
blocked, waiting for me to

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.580
take action.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.290
So it's really great to see
applications like Manymoon,

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.820
Mavenlink, Box.net and a few
others improve upon our

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.860
sharing model to make
collaboration really

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.110
effortless.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.080
So before we move on to the next
section, we just want to

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.130
quickly wrap up again here.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.480
Remember you can import the
contacts and the user feeds to

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.875
make sharing with
people easier.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:50.280
This is something that Google
Apps users have come to just

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.280
rely on in Google Apps.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.460
They will come to rely on it in
your applications as well.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.410
This is also great for apps
that spread virally.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.060
If you have an invite model
where you rely on people

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:05.130
socializing your app for you,
kick starting that process

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.330
with their contacts
is a great way to

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.440
get additional customers.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.310
Remember that sharing
it not just linking.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.840
We really want to focus on the
content that we're sharing and

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.750
making sure that people
have access to it.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:18.250
And of course none of
this is limited

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.645
to contacts or documents.

00:22:19.645 --> 00:22:23.375
This all applies to any piece
of data that you can have in

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:23.790
your application.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.735
It may be calendars
and team projects.

00:22:26.735 --> 00:22:29.500
It could be your customer
records in your CRN.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.140
Anything that people collaborate
on you want to

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.780
find ways to make collaboration

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.030
as simple as possible.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.270
So the third area I want to
focus on is improving access

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.520
to information.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.430
So we've seen how we
can streamline the

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.710
set-up for our users.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.000
We can make it easier for them
to connect to each other.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.880
But we still have some
inefficiencies in how people

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.810
work that we can make better.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.050
Let's start with an
example of this.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.750
So suppose I'm a salesperson
and I get this

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.890
email from a customer.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.190
And the customer really
wants to do a pilot.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.610
And potentially there's going
to be this huge company-wide

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.950
roll-out that could be worth
tens of thousands or hundreds

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.180
of thousands of dollars
in business for us.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.760
So what do I do?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.195
Well assuming that we actually
have a CRM that we use to

00:23:18.195 --> 00:23:19.140
track these opportunities--

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.970
let's say in this case,
Solve360, which is another

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.980
application in the
Marketplace.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.760
I'd have to go and switch over
to that application, look up

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.770
that customer record, and search
for the right entry,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.850
then update it.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:34.020
I might have to switch back and
forth between Gmail and

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.810
the CRM in order to copy and
paste some information back

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:40.390
and forth to make sure the
CRM is up to date.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:41.710
It works.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:43.440
But I'm losing time
in doing that.

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.090
So how do you make it better?

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.880
The answer is you bring
the application

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.050
into the mail itself.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.350
And so is what contextual
gadgets allows developers to

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:54.740
do-- to actually embed their
application in Gmail, in the

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.920
context where it's
actually needed.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.250
And you can actually match on
things like who sent the

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.450
message, the subject, the
content of the message itself,

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.760
and use that to determine what
your gadget shows or if it

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.955
should show at all.

00:24:05.955 --> 00:24:11.920
So the advantage is now as a
user I don't have to go and

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.745
look at that customer record.

00:24:12.745 --> 00:24:14.780
It already knows who the
customer is based

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.120
on who sen the email.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.590
Now I can just open that up,
update the opportunity, and do

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.960
this without ever leaving the
message and without ever

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.370
leaving Gmail.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.360
Really, really powerful.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.300
It turns out on to be one of the
most popular features that

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.490
applications developers
are using today.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.480
And rave reviews from users
using these integrations.

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.100
So a quick tutorial
on how these work.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.070
They actually turn out
to be really simple.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.040
It is all based on OpenSocial,
which as open standard for

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.330
embedding third-party content
into an application.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.180
If you could write HTML
in JavaScript,

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.560
you can write a gadget.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.640
That's basically what it is.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.350
It's just HTML in JavaScript
and a small bit of

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:56.350
XML to wrap it up.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.745
For gadgets, the way it works
is you start with an email.

00:24:58.745 --> 00:25:01.960
The customer opens it up.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.380
In the background what happens
is we extract some information

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.320
from that message and run
it through a filter.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.070
And these rules for the fields
that we extract and the

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.320
patterns that we match are
defined in the manifest for

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.842
your application.

00:25:14.842 --> 00:25:17.420
If there's a match, we
render the gadget.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:21.130
Again that just is HTML and
JavaScript, which then gets

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:23.160
rendered into the
email itself.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.115
It's a really simple process.

00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:26.430
It does take a little bit of
work just to get started.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:28.640
But once you are, you're just
using the same development

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.680
tools that you use for writing
your own web application.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.940
There are a couple of catches
with contextual gadgets.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.140
First is you have very,
very limited real

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.180
estate on the screen.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.790
You notice in the screen shot
of the Solve360 gadget that

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.770
their default view basically
just showed two buttons.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.440
And they don't expand into the
full view unless the user

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.650
explicitly clicks and
takes action.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.840
Part of the reason
for this is--

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.590
one, it's a very small area in
Gmail underneath the message

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.860
have to do this.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.550
And then the other thing
is some users may

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.670
have multiple gadgets.

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.950
And so if one of them is taking
up a lot of screen real

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.740
estate, other gadgets that the
user might be interested in

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.260
for that particular message
could end up getting buried

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.140
beneath the fold and they'd have
to scroll down to get it.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.040
It's not a very good
user experience.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.570
In addition to that, we
encourage people to match very

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:18.870
conservatively.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.920
For some gadgets, that's
pretty easy to do.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.140
If your a gadget for approving
an expense report or

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.630
somebody's time sheet, it's
pretty easy to recognize if

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.690
it's as an email from your
application that you want to

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.430
embed a gadget for.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.300
For CRM apps, project
management-- it might be a

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.630
little harder to come up with
a set of very narrow rules

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.770
that you're probably going to
trigger on just about every

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:41.895
message that a user receives.

00:26:41.895 --> 00:26:44.060
And that's where it become even
more important to make

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.200
sure that your UI is kept small
until the user wants to

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.520
actually engage with
your gadgets.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.400
Another limitation that you need
to be aware of is gadgets

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.860
only have access to about
1K worth of data

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.410
in the email itself.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.470
This is just a technical
limitation in how it's built.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.970
There are some work-arounds
though.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.010
So one way to do this is to use
some extensions that we

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.550
have IMAP so that you can fetch
the content of the email

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.300
and the attachments
in the background.

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.340
To make this easier, we do have
OAuth authentication for

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.945
IMAP clients.

00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:19.060
So you don't need to ask for
the user's user name and

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.670
password in order to
access their email.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:22.880
They can delegate this in
a secure way to your

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.270
application.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.080
And there are also some protocol
extensions to make it

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.920
easy to access emails based on
the Gmail message and thread

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.730
IDs, as well as manipulate
labels.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.880
So open social technology
actually has

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.250
uses in other contexts.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.930
Within Gmail itself, you
can actually use

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.730
gadgets in the sidebar.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.270
Here we actually see
a screen shot from

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:48.520
Atlassian's JIRA Studio.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:52.562
It's a hosted development
environment that includes bug

00:27:52.562 --> 00:27:55.220
tracking, issue tracking,
Continuous Build

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.080
Server, and so on.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.480
So for developer, instead of
having to go and switch over

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.830
to JIRA to go and check to see
what my open issues are, it's

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.330
really nice to have that list
of all my hot issues and my

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.720
top priorities in my Gmail
sidebar so it's always

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.890
available at a quick glance.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.710
So using OpenSocial and
OpenSocial gadgets, they

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.640
actually provide a Gmail gadget
that you can embed and

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.270
keep that list readily
available.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.860
You could do the same
thing in Calendar.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.140
Here we see a gadget from
TripIt, which is a trip

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.590
planning tool.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:29.880
And here I can see in my
Calendar sidebar my upcoming

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.090
trips, as well the trips of
people that I'm connected to

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.340
inside TripIt.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.370
Talk is another really useful
integration point.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:42.900
Again, going back to Atlassian,
they've integrated

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.460
Talk into their Build Server--
the Continuous Build Servers--

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.220
as a lightweight mechanism
to push out build status.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.460
So I'm a developer, it's the
end of the day, I've just

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.360
checked into Change, and I'm
waiting for the next build to

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.900
go green so that I can go home
and know that I didn't break

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.110
the build and cause
a whole bunch of

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.320
developers a bunch of heartache.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.850
So rather than sending me an
email, which is pretty

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.520
heavyweight and clutters up my
inbox, I can just open up a

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.180
Chat window with the Build
Server and get those status

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.920
update pushed to me in near
real time in a really

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.010
lightweight way.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.470
Beyond pushing information
though, you can actually use

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.330
Talk as an input mechanism.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.590
What you see here is actually
an application.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:27.910
This is GQueues, which is a To
Do list project planning tool.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.750
And they allow people to enter
in items into the To Do list

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.620
by basically just chatting
with the application.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.730
And they just used a little bit
of language processing to

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.950
convert that text into an item
that would appear on your To

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:42.540
Do list, in your Calendar, and
on your phone, and elsewhere.

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.260
Even if you don't have a mobile
application, pretty

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.280
much everyone can do SMS
or IM on their phone.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.000
A really nice lightweight
way to do data input

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.720
but for some apps.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.055
For Talk, just remember
Talk is just XMPP.

00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:01.225
This is an open protocol.

00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:02.430
It's widely used.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.370
Lots of libraries out there
to make it easy.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.260
And if you are interested in
using Talk as an integration

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.920
point, I really encourage you to
take a look at App Engine.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.100
App Engine has both built in
client libraries for both

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.910
Python and Java and of
course now today, Go.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.260
But it has some built-in
classes to make writing

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:21.600
chatbox real easy.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.350
And even if you don't use App
Engine yourself for hosting

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.330
your main application, it
actually turns out to be

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:27.700
really useful as a bridge.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.100
You can actually just use it
as a Chat front-end and

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.250
forward all those calls
to your application

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.900
using your own APIs.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.950
But a great way that you can get
started with Talk, without

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.360
really investing a lot into
infrastructure or tools.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.230
And I think Cameron mentioned
his Talk integration--

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.770
something he did on App in about
two days' worth of work.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.720
So pretty easy to get started.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.658
It turns out to be pretty useful
for a lot of apps.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.540
In a lot of these use cases,
we've really been talking

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:01.540
about consuming information
from Google Apps.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.730
In addition to consuming, if
you publish information and

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.205
make it available, lots of
really good things can happen.

00:31:07.205 --> 00:31:08.970
Let's take a look
at an example.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.640
Suppose I'm starting up a
new marketing campaign.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.790
I'm going to go into my project
management tool.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.030
And I'm going to create a new
project-- let's say, let's

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.880
work on our new marketing
text for our

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.655
email marketing campaign.

00:31:20.655 --> 00:31:23.375
I've got to create some
deadlines around that project.

00:31:23.375 --> 00:31:25.650
I've got to create a document
that we can use to

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.770
draft up the text.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:30.100
Well, if you publicize that into
Google Docs and use Docs

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:34.450
for storage and we update our
Calendars, that information is

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:36.360
now available in a whole bunch
of different places.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.810
It shows up on my desktop and my
laptop, through my Calendar

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.350
and my Docs, and my Gmail.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.705
It also shows up on my phone.

00:31:42.705 --> 00:31:45.860
In fact, I probably have used my
mobile phone for reading my

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:51.140
Calendar and my email more
than I use my desktop.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.680
That information though can
then be consumed by other

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.780
applications that also integrate
with Google Apps.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.630
So in this case, our email
marketing tool can then import

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:02.540
that document that we've drafted
up in our project and

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:06.658
then use that to send out
our marketing campaign.

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.485
Our marketing campaign
goes really well.

00:32:08.485 --> 00:32:10.390
We get some customers.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.850
Now I add somebody to my CRM.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.270
Well, if that customer record
is then published back into

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.990
Google Contacts, again it's now
available on my desktop,

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.720
in my Gmail, in my Contacts,
in Google

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.080
Docs, in Google Calendar--

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.070
everywhere that Google
Apps uses Contacts.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.790
It's also available
on my phone.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.700
And it could also show up in
our support system so that

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.040
when we have a ticket with that
customer, you can trace

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:39.380
that back to our CRM, it could
show up in our list of

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.770
customers for our next marketing
campaign that we

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.710
send out, and our
marketing tool.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:45.550
So by publishing information
and sharing it, you can

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.020
actually use Google Apps as
a hub to get additional

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.450
integrations with other
applications.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.400
Really, really powerful.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.190
And we're trying to see this
happen in the Marketplace as

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.992
users start to use more and more
applications together.

00:32:58.992 --> 00:33:01.770
Now of course, there are cases
where it doesn't make sense to

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.560
use Google Apps as a hub.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.590
And I actually encourage
you to go do some

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.260
integrations directly.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.880
Earlier, I mentioned FreshBooks
and how they invest

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.530
a lot in integrating with
other applications.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.440
Well, I took a look at their
list of integrations and those

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.710
apps in the Marketplace.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.830
And the intersection
of those two lists

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:21.570
actually looks like that.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.730
So these are all the apps
in the Marketplace that

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:25.850
FreshBooks already works
with directly.

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.880
There's actually a whole list of
other apps that aren't yet

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.120
in the Marketplace that I could
have added to this list.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.550
If you go out to next level
and find out who they

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.600
integrate with, you get more.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.522
And these aren't just one-way
integrations.

00:33:37.522 --> 00:33:39.780
They actually all integrate
with each other.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.420
And so you actually get this
nice network of applications

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.460
that integrate, not just with
Google Apps, but with each

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.710
other as well.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.360
Everything I said here about
integration hold true whether

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.470
or not you're integrating with
Google Apps or any other web

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.700
application out there.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.900
And I sincerely encourage you
to go out, talk to your

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.920
customers, find out what they're
using and if there's a

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.515
way that your application and
those applications that you

00:34:04.515 --> 00:34:07.250
use today can work better
together through some sort of

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.840
integration, go ahead
and do it.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.719
Your customers will love it.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:12.540
Beyond just helping your
customers and giving them more

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.060
value, it opens up some
additional value to you as

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.090
your business because it
gives you co-marketing

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.730
opportunities, it gives
you referral traffic.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.100
Basically, it's a way that
applications can help each

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.539
other grow and thrive.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.389
So wrapping up the access area,
keep in mind that this

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.199
context switching that we talked
about at the beginning

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.530
is a big productivity killer.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.812
You want to find ways
to do that.

00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:39.510
A couple different
strategies--

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.550
one is to bring applications to
the users where they need

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:45.980
it: contextual gadgets for Gmail
or any of the gadgets--

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.005
whether they're Sidebar--

00:34:47.005 --> 00:34:49.820
in Gmail Calendar
sites, wherever.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:52.300
Just a great way to bring
functionality to users where

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.679
they need it.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:55.179
The other way is to
publish data.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.930
Make it available so that people
in other Google Apps or

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.540
other third-party apps that
integrate, can also access

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.256
that data in a simple way.

00:35:04.256 --> 00:35:07.910
And again, remember this is
not just for Google Apps.

00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:10.410
Really, I want to reinforce this
again, find out what your

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.810
customers use, integrate.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.750
I don't care if it's
Google Apps or not.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:15.920
They will appreciate it.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.910
You will find a return
on that investment.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.730
So there are a few more things
that I want to talk about.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.150
So I mentioned earlier how
the Marketplace is not a

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.700
traditional enterprise
sales channel.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.380
You really have to focus on ease
of use, deployment, and

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.380
really make sure that you have
a nice, clean, intuitive UI.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.010
This is one of my
favorite apps--

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:40.950
Mavenlink.

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:44.810
We actually just named them
yesterday as our first staff

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:46.490
pick in the Marketplace.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.070
I think they do a great job at
making it really easy for

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.070
users to get started.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:54.170
Not only is the interface itself
clearly labeled and

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.570
intuitive, but they have this
nice built-in tutorial that

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.250
when users jump into the app,
they actually are trained how

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.500
to use the app, using the
application itself.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:05.270
Really easy for users
to get started.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.810
They get tons of great reviews
because they focus so much on

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:11.290
making sure that their app is
designed for self-service and

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.520
for small companies to
get started quickly.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.920
Even if you look at their help
system, their help system is

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.990
just a layer on top
of the UI itself.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.040
There's no switching back and
forth, reading long documents

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.050
on how to use it.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:24.970
You can just say, hey
what's this,?

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.750
Click on a link, click on a
video to learn how to use it.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.370
Great app.

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:31.690
Really good one to study in
terms of how to build

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:33.140
something that users
can get up to speed

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:36.190
with very, very quickly.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.070
Of course with all this, you can
build all the integrations

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.650
in the world, you can add all
sorts of cool features, but if

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.790
customers don't understand them,
if they don't know that

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.350
they exist, it's not going to do
much for your application.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:48.520
So don't forget marketing.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.620
You do want to make sure that
you have a very high quality

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:55.080
listing page that clearly
explains both the value of

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.330
your application, plus the
value of the integrations

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.140
themselves.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.210
You can also do this on your
site itself by having a very

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.110
high quality landing page that
can go into more detail.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.540
Blogging, tweeting,
PR outreach--

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.620
all of these are important to
make sure that you have a

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.810
really successful launch
on the Marketplace.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.070
Another resource that we
sometimes talk about is

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.810
leveraging your existing
customers.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.200
And they turn out to be a great
way to really bootstrap

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.880
your growth on the
Marketplace.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.860
So if you are joining the
Marketplace and you happen to

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.220
have a set of customers who are
already on Google Apps, I

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.700
encourage you to go out to them,
encourage them to try

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.870
your application from
the Marketplace.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.130
And if they like it, if they
like your integrations, go out

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.150
and provide ratings and reviews
on the Marketplace.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.360
This will help your application
move up in the

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:49.245
search results, get
higher placement.

00:37:49.245 --> 00:37:51.750
And additional customers
will follow it.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:56.090
Also if you start to see some
growth in your traffic, it's

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:59.060
more likely that it will appear
on our radar so that we

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.170
can get you into the featured or
a notable section or if you

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:05.940
build something really, really
cool and amazing, maybe we'll

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.310
pick you out at the
next staff pick.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.960
So that's really the challenge
for you guys as developers

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.080
just to go out there and just
build something that's really

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:17.510
amazing, that really saves
customers time and effort and

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:19.450
takes advantage of the
various integration

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:23.065
points in that process.

00:38:23.065 --> 00:38:26.410
Of course, this is just a small,
small sampling of the

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.040
things that are possible.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.280
I did mention earlier than we
just started our staff pick

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.875
program yesterday.

00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:34.520
We will be naming apps
probably two to

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.100
three times a month.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.340
So we are looking for
really the best--

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.820
not only the best integrated,
but the easiest to use and the

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.670
most value they you can
provide to customers.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.820
Again, impress us.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.720
That's the challenge that
we're putting out there.

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.020
And we will try to help you get
more customers if you if

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:54.220
you build it--

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.560
those really great
quality apps.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.500
Of course while the focus of
today was integration, it's

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.110
not the only factor.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:03.870
Don't forget your marketing.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.030
Pricing is important.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.500
Marketing is important.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.960
There was actually a really
great talk last year at I/O

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.820
from Don Dodge.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.600
She did a panel on premium
pricing models.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.960
And so for those of you that
have a premium model or are

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:19.870
thinking about it, I encourage
you to go back to last year's

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:21.900
I/O site, look for
the session.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.550
It was really, really
interesting.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.690
Lots of great advice in there
for how the different

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:29.870
businesses should structure
their pricing in today's

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:31.440
business world.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.530
And again, for the third
time, this is not

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.270
just for Google Apps.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.330
Anything you learn today you
can apply it any app that

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.770
customers use.

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:43.650
Again, go out, find it, build
those integrations, your

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.900
customers will appreciate it.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:49.740
There are a few resources
that I want to share.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.160
One is the Marketplace itself
which is google.com/enter

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.410
prise/marketplace.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.850
Documents and forums for
developing these integrations

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.970
are at
code.google.com/googleapps.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:04.220
Our blog googleappsdevelo
per.blogspot.com.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.920
There's a few Twitter handles
that you might want to follow.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.480
There's the official Google
Apps Developer handle at

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.810
GoogleAppsDev.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.270
There's also a few more handles
of some members of the

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.270
team that we do post frequently:
Don Dodge, Ryan

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.550
Boyd, Scott McMullan,
and myself.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.220
I certainly encourage
you to follow.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.530
We're always looking for
interesting people

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.075
to follow as well.

00:40:27.075 --> 00:40:30.380
So if you have one and you
follow us, I'll probably call

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.730
you back as well.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:34.580
And certainly session feedback
is appreciated.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.300
Then there's the short length
for those who are interested

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.410
in providing it.

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:41.060
So that's all I have
for today.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.580
I do want to turn it
over for questions.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.405
If you do have a question,
please use the microphones.

00:40:45.405 --> 00:40:46.770
The question is being
recorded.

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.280
And it will just help to make
sure that everyone can hear

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.750
the question.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.660
And other than that, I'll be
happy to talk to anyone after

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.040
the presentation as well.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.406
Thanks.

00:40:57.406 --> 00:40:58.656
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.750
Any questions--

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:12.670
or not.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:13.390
All right.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.640
Thanks.
