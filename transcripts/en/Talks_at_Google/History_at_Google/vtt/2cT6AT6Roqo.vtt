SPEAKER 1: We are honored today
to have Irene Weisberg Zisblatt

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.700
with us to tell her story.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.650
She is the author of a book
called "The Fifth Diamond."

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.630
Normally, you'd give a bio.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.320
In this particular case,
she is going to talk.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.680
And her book is just a
really great narrative

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.100
of her story, which is just
an amazing, amazing story

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.860
of her survival in the
Holocaust and her life.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.815
So please join me
in welcoming Irene.

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:35.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.030
IRENE WEISBERG
ZISBLATT: Thank you.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.900
Thank you very much.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.675
I got to take my Bible out.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.600
This is my Bible.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.520
Thank you so much for
having me here today.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.230
First, I want to thank
Gilly and her husband

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.530
for making this
day happen for me.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.570
Her husband Adam and Gilly are
my friends for a long time.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.520
I also would like to extend my
very special thanks to Google

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.580
for helping me reach the
present and future readers

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.590
of "The Fifth Diamond."

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.440
The pages of my book tell
my personal experience.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.390
You will learn about the darkest
part in history and humanity

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.070
at its worst.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.740
While many people
want to forget,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.730
it would certainly be
wiser to understand.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.250
Through my account as a
witness to these crimes,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.850
it is my hope to
demonstrate the strength

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.050
of my hope in human spirit, the
meaning of having faith in God,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.430
and the memory of a
loving friendship.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.300
I am a Holocaust
survivor of man's hatred.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.150
I am the only
survivor of my family.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.590
That places on me a double
duty to bear witness.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.590
I remember when Hitler gave the
order that all Jewish people

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.450
must be exterminated.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.100
We had no place to hide.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.150
We were thrown out
of every country,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.280
and our suffering did not end.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.720
My mother was so
sad when she did not

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.945
see us children play
or smile anymore.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.500
She tried to give us away, not
because she didn't love us,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.000
but because she
tried to save us,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.850
but there was no one
there to help her.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.000
The SS took her, my father,
and all my siblings,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.450
but they wouldn't
let me go with them.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.860
I saw my family go into
the chamber of death.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.970
My mother gave me her diamonds,
and that is the only connection

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.220
to her that I have.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.390
I couldn't pray on that
day, but for some reason

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.820
they let me live.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.180
It is now 71 years
after the Holocaust,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.760
and still things like a
railroad track or a train

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.690
brings my yesterdays into today.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.910
I like to share some
of my yesterdays

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.150
with you, not to
make you hate them,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.300
but to tell you
what hatred does.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.250
I am a Hungarian Jew.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.470
The devastation
of Hungarian Jews

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.190
were the worst murdered of
men, women, and children

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.130
in the last days of the war.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.480
When Hitler was facing defeat,
he brought the Holocaust

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.590
to Hungary.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.600
I was living there in a
beautiful little resort

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.630
town in the mountains.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.840
We were only 263 families,
and a third was only Jewish.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.830
As far back as I can remember,
I had a great relationship

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.530
with my non-Jewish friends.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.900
We didn't have any telephones
or iPods or computers,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.250
but we had each other.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.390
We children were always
together-- in the parks,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.840
in the homes, and in schools.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.380
The mountains we lived in had
the most natural resources

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.880
in all of Europe.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.410
Mineral water was one of
them and still is today.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.180
My father had a spa, and he
used this water for people

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.130
with muscular problems.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.890
He devoted his life
to help everyone.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.010
My siblings, my
friends, and I loved

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.760
living in these beautiful
mountains, but not far from us

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.720
in Germany, Hitler
was ending democracy

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.570
and was lining up his henchmen.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.260
The SS, which were
the Stormtroopers--

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.580
the SS, the security
police and the Gestapo,

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.010
the special state police.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.680
Our government was
an ally to Germany

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.670
and chose not to report
the Jewish people yet,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:20.790
but ordered strict restrictions.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.100
From 1939 until
1944, Hungarian Jews

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.460
were stripped of their
rights and entitlements

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.130
as they had never existed.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.170
In addition, the men were
forced into labor units

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.300
where they were poorly
clothed, ill-fed,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.820
and ultimately murdered.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.880
At the age of nine, I was
thrown out of the one thing

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.620
that I loved most, my
school, because I was a Jew.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.390
And from that day on, my life
changed, and so did the world.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.570
My non-Jewish
friends ignored me.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.450
My education and freedom
was taken away from me.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.590
And my hopes were
destroyed by Nazi hatred.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.650
We didn't see any
SS in our towns yet,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.980
but the evil was
carried out by the Arrow

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.050
Cross, the Hungarian SS.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.110
They were feared by all people.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.690
Our food was running
out, and they wouldn't

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.390
let us buy in any store.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.190
A curfew was enforced, and we
had to wear the yellow star.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.910
I will never forget the
sadness in my parents' faces

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.860
when we children were hungry
and they had no food to give us.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.880
Once, a cow wandered
into our backyard,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.190
and my mother risked
her life during curfew,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.450
climbed out the back
window, and milked the cow.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.930
And that was the only
time that we had milk.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.650
I was the oldest
of six children.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.910
I had four brothers
and one sister.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.290
Every day, the Nazis ordered
new restrictions for us.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.200
After they stripped
us from our dignity,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.170
they demanded our valuables.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.720
I heard my mother
say to my father,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.360
first they made our star
to a badge of shame,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.200
and now they want to
rob us of our feelings

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.210
of being worthy enough of
owning something of value.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.080
I think that my mother sewed
her diamonds into my skirt

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.400
to save our pride, and
then she gave them to me

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.690
with a purpose--

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.090
to buy bread if I am hungry.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.760
In 1939, when
Poland was invaded,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.660
a few men were able to escape
to us over the mountains.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.250
My father with his friends
helped them to safety.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.280
Their destination, Palestine.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.580
I don't know if they ever
made it to Palestine,

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.420
but one night a man had to
spend the night in my home

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.270
because it wasn't safe to go on.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.450
And I heard him beg my
father to take his family

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.230
and go with him because,
when the SS come to us,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.820
they will kill our children
just like they do in Poland.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.280
I couldn't sleep the
rest of the night.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.160
In the morning,
the man was gone.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.620
And I asked my father,
who are these SS,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.110
and why are they
killing the children?

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.650
What have those children done?

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:34.210
And my father said,
the man wasn't himself.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.360
He didn't know
what he was saying.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.150
People don't do such things.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:43.020
See, the most civilized country
in all of Europe, nobody

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.830
believed that they
did such things.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.010
So we didn't go with the man.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.200
We also didn't
believe that the Nazis

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.890
were going to come to us
because the war was almost over.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.380
And besides, we were
in this little town

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.979
surrounded by mountains.

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:03.270
We didn't think that they
were going to come and bother

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.450
to look for so few of us.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.350
And just then, my country was
trying to extricate itself

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.930
from the alliance with Germany.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.310
And Hitler got so enraged
he ordered the army

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:24.030
to invade Hungary and deal
with the Jewish problem.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.960
The next day, each person had
to pack a suitcase not exceeding

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.290
25 kilo and go to a ghetto.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.780
I didn't even know
what a ghetto was,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.600
but they made me feel that I had
to be punished for something.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.410
They made me leave my
home for no reason at all.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.690
The ghetto was a
brickyard, but there were

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.060
no bricks being manufactured.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.450
There were just people
everywhere suffering.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.150
When we got there, there
was no shelter left,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:59.070
so my parents built a hut from
the tablecloths and sheets

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.500
that my mother packed
in her suitcase.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.210
And they built a tent,
and that was our new home.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.940
Once a day, they
allowed us to go

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.050
to the river that
surrounded the ghetto just

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.980
to drink a little water.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.510
They wouldn't let us
wash our face or clothes.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.500
We couldn't even take back
water to the little children

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.570
or the sick people.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.760
We children were
always afraid to be

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.760
taken away from our
parents or being

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.640
beaten for no reason at all.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.850
Every day, they took
men and boys to work.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.240
Many of them never came back.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:45.680
And then the cattle trains
came, and they told us

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.050
that we need to be relocated to
the vineyard in our own country

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.300
until after the war.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.600
Well, everybody was so happy
to leave this hellish place

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.770
and go to the vineyard,
so everybody, my mother

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.020
[? still, ?] packed
up our suitcases.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.330
And she reminded
me that if we work

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.180
in the vineyard
in separate places

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.590
and I get hungry to use
the diamonds to buy bread.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.560
When I saw the cattle
trains, I asked my father,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.730
why are we going to
work in cattle trains?

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.220
And my father said, the
vineyard isn't that far away.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.260
It wouldn't be so bad.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.490
But when they forced 100
people in each boxcar

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.600
with a small pail
with no water in it,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.580
I knew that something
was very wrong.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.880
When they locked the
doors from the outside,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.210
we were in complete darkness.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:48.750
A crack in the wall was
the only light we had.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.790
My father was
standing by the crack

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.690
to see how far away we
are from the vineyard.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.730
And the boxcar was so bad.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.320
There was no room to
sit or stand or move.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.130
We children, all
the children, were

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.310
sitting on the floor
against the wall

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.010
and holding our little
siblings in our laps

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.440
so the adults should
have a little more room

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.660
to move around.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.730
And then my father
saw through the crack

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.240
that we are not going
to the vineyard,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.590
and he said they lied to us.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:35.050
We just left our country and we
crossed the border to Poland.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.720
I was holding my two-year-old
little brother in my arms,

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.810
and he never stopped crying.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.280
When my father said we
are going to Poland,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:54.070
I remember the man that was
spending a night in our home,

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.940
and he told us to go with him
because when they come to us

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.760
they'll kill our
little children.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.150
My little brother was crying
in my arms all the time--

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.670
not for food, not for water.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.320
He just wanted to go home.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.430
And I promised him that
we will be home soon.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.790
But when my father said
we are going to Poland,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.690
and I remembered what the man
said about the little children,

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.980
I held my little
brother so tight,

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.200
and I promised myself
that I will never

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.530
let the SS take him from me.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:33.820
My little brother never
saw his home again.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.640
We were in the boxcar
for about five days,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.460
and the entire
time I was wishing

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.680
that the train
would stop so we can

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.560
go to a real bathroom
like normal people.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.830
But most, I was
wishing that they

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.490
would give the children
some food and some water

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.570
and maybe they will stop crying.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.920
And the boxcar was
so bad that when

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.780
the train stopped I thought
that we have survived the worst,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.730
but I was wrong.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.375
When the doors opened, the
SS with their vicious dogs

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:10.060
and clubs in their
hands, yelling at us,

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.400
get out you dirty Jews,
and make it quick.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.710
They immediately separated
the men from the women.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.670
They made us leave our
belongings at the train,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.850
and they told us that the men
will bring it to us later.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:35.390
We never saw our men or
our belongings ever again.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.360
As we were passing
the cattle train,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.050
I saw chimneys in the distance,
and I pointed them out

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.230
to my mother.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.010
And I said, the factories
we are going to work in.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.190
But my mother paid
no mind to me.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:54.340
In this chaos, she was
trying to hold us together.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.800
She took my little
brother from my arms,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.920
and she told me to hold my
four-year-old little sister's

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.870
hand really tight so
she doesn't get lost.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.210
A man in a striped
jacket came over,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:10.360
and he offered to carry
my little brother,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.700
but my mother didn't let him.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340
But she asked him, where are we?

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.680
And he said, Auschwitz.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.320
But we didn't know
what Auschwitz was

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.690
or why we were there.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.480
There were three long
cattle trains packed

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.840
with people waiting to get off.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.670
And I again looked
at the chimneys,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:34.870
and I couldn't believe that the
Nazis had so many factories,

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.740
that they needed so many of
us to come to work for them.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.280
Little did I know that we were
the daily ration for the gas

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.930
chamber.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.070
When Hitler declared the
assault on Hungarian Jews,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.860
it was during the
Final Solution.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.650
The Final Solution
then, that not one Jew

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.560
will survive to bear witness.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.800
In 54 days, on
147 cattle trains,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:09.670
437,402 Hungarian Jews
were in Auschwitz.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.130
And that was only
from the little towns.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.040
The big cities were long gone.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.927
When we passed the cattle
trains, a handsome SS

00:16:17.927 --> 00:16:23.530
man wearing white gloves and a
baton-like stick in his hand,

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.940
he appeared in front
of us, and he pointed

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.240
that stick at my mother.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:34.390
And he yelled at her, put the
child down and go to the right.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.030
But my mother being so
desperate to keep us

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.640
together, she
yelled back at him,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.000
my children will go with me.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.630
He got so angry at her
that she did not obey him,

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.200
he took that baton-like
stick and he hit my hand

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.620
between my little sister.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.540
He separated us.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.680
We were bleeding.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.030
We were crying and begging him
to let me go with my mother.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.599
But he just took my little
sister away and kicked me away

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.130
from them.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.410
And then I heard my mother
call out to me, don't cry.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.140
I will come for you later.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.809
That was the last time I
heard my mother's voice.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.700
A few minutes later, I was
in a huge hall with thousands

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.119
of people, but I was alone.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:30.980
The SS men and women
with their vicious dogs

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.480
again yelling at us, take
your clothes and shoes off

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.610
and hold them in one hand.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.790
And take your valuables
and put them in the bin.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.650
And I remembered my
mother's diamonds

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.730
that she sewed them in
the hem of my skirt.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.960
So I quickly took them out.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.660
I don't know how many they
were, but I found four of them.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.500
And they took our
belongings right away.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.970
I didn't know, so I was holding
them in my hand really tight.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:03.010
And when they moved us
to the next section,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:08.020
I saw that they shaved their
hair, they took our name away,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.470
tattooed a number in my arm.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.770
And then I saw that they
were pulling gold teeth

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.540
from people's mouth.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.180
I put my mother's
diamonds in my mouth

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.620
when they were shaving my
head so I can hide them.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.230
But when I saw they were
looking in people's mouths

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.420
I knew that they will
find the diamonds.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.400
They will take them away.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.250
And they will shoot me for
not putting them in the bin.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:38.420
So for fear, I
swallowed the diamonds.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.210
So then I was safe.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.120
I didn't have to worry about
going to the gas chamber

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.635
because I owned diamonds.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.220
They after pushed us
into another room,

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.020
and there was a pile of clothes.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.990
They ordered us
to take one piece.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.940
I got a pajama top that
barely covered my body.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.490
And at the door
was a huge mirror,

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.400
and they ordered us
to look at ourselves.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.050
I didn't recognize
myself when I saw myself.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:15.240
I was reduced to a number
that represented a nothing.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.620
I was stripped of my
identity and my dignity.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.770
But you see, that was
their first process

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.410
of dehumanizing us.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.230
And then they lined
us up in rows of five

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.360
and marched us
into a place called

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:34.020
Birkenau, a planet of evil.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:40.350
The SS locked the electric
barbed-wire fences behind us,

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:42.300
never to let us out.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:47.160
It was spring, but flowers
and grass didn't grow there.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.330
The sky was as gray as
the mud under my feet.

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.760
The wooden barracks
with three-story bunks

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.470
were our luxury housing.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.440
1,000 of us in each barrack
and 10 of us in each bunk

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.790
didn't give us much
hope ever to get out.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.710
Our food for the day was a cup
of brown liquid called soup.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.830
It was seasoned with a
chemical that was destroying

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.840
our reproductive organs.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.610
The twice-a-day roll call
wasn't just to take count,

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:24.900
but Doctor Josef Mengele's
haven for human guinea pigs

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:28.000
for his brutal experiments.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.560
We were completely cut off
from the outside world.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.290
At the end of the day, when
my mother didn't come for me,

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:39.960
I decided to go look for her
because with my hair shave,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.330
with this piece
of rag on my body,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.340
she will not be able to find me.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.080
But when I got to the door,
the kapo slapped my face

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.140
and yelled at me,
where are you going?

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:56.350
And when I told her, she
pointed to the chimney,

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.670
and she said your mother is
just about now coming out

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.770
of one of those chimneys.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:06.420
And if you don't go back to the
bunk, all of you will go there.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.820
I was so scared.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.310
I didn't understand why she was
saying that about my mother.

00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:18.360
My mother was only 32 years
old, and she was beautiful.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.570
Why would anyone do
this to my mother?

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.840
But I had no answers
to my questions.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.710
So I climbed up to my bunk,
and I tried to go to sleep,

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.730
hoping that when I wake up
this madness will be gone.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.310
But I couldn't fall
asleep because the cries

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.370
of little children were so sad.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.980
We didn't have any
windows in our barracks,

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:43.830
but we had a three-inch
opening between the ceiling

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.570
and the wall.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.510
So I was on the top
bunk, and I looked

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.970
at the three-inch
ceiling between the wall

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.270
and the ceiling.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:57.420
And I looked out, and I saw
trucks coming down the road.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.520
And two little children--

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.770
they were this little--

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.560
they fell out of the truck.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.270
The SS men picked them
up by their little feet,

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.530
and then he just threw
them against a truck.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.530
The blood was everywhere.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.490
He threw them back on the truck
like they were no children,

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:21.300
like they were two
pieces of firewood.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.210
Those little children
that committed no sin

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.650
will never, never cry again.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.060
I was so hopeless I
didn't know what to do,

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.500
so I started to scream,
but the girl next to me

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.540
put her hand over
my mouth and she

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.070
begged me not to scream or even
talk because the punishment was

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.540
death.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.850
So in my silence, I called
to God, but God wasn't there.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.550
I was thinking,
where is he, and why

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.850
isn't he taking care of
those little children?

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.860
I was so angry with him.

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:57.950
I had the biggest
fight with him.

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.210
But then, I said to myself,
why am I fighting with God?

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.550
God didn't create the Holocaust.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.710
Men did.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:11.030
So in my silence, I figured it
out, that he must be in a place

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.760
where he is taking
care of other children.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.160
And when he is
done, he will surely

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.340
come and take care of us.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.850
The next day, I was selected
by Dr. Josef Mengele

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:25.070
for his brutal experiments.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.550
I was no longer a
13-year-old child.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:32.030
My childhood couldn't
continue in the death camps.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:35.930
But in a desperate effort, I
had to try and save my mother's

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.220
diamonds that carried her love.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.640
Once a day, we were allowed
to go to the latrine.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.350
If you saw
"Schindler's List," you

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.010
know what the
latrine looked like.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.010
I never had the pleasure of
sitting on one of those holes

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.490
because I had to
find a safe place

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.210
to save my mother's diamonds.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.870
It would have been safer to
throw the diamonds away when I

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.670
realized that I cannot buy
bread, not even for diamonds.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.830
But the love and the
pride that they carried

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.080
was stronger than Nazi hatred.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.790
I saw hatred so strong that
when Mengele was experimenting

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:25.250
on us without anesthetics and
the pain was so unbearable,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.090
I saw joys in his eyes
watching us suffer.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.900
That kind of a hatred
existed in the 20th century

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.240
in Nazi Germany.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.210
When the SS packed the
gas chambers with mothers

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.350
and fathers and sisters and
brothers and grandparents,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.210
I was there.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:49.340
I saw them, and I heard them
cry out for their last time.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.850
Do not forget us,
[INAUDIBLE] Israel.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.440
At that moment, my
will to live became

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.900
stronger and more important.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.640
I promised to be their voice
if I survived this evil.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.130
Those children's
voices were silenced

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:12.020
in the most unspeakable terror
of the Shoah, of the Holocaust,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.720
just because their eyes
were not blue enough

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.250
or their skin was not white
enough or they were Jewish.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.140
Those million and
a half children

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:26.000
are depending on us to carry
their message, never again.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.450
When Nazi doctors
were torturing us

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.300
and the pain was
so unbearable, I

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:36.320
knew that we must endure
and live as long as we can

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.600
for those children.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.030
During the experiments,
I had a silent friend.

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.330
Her name was Sabka.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.590
Even in our pain, we could
not cry because the punishment

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.070
was death.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:54.500
And then they took Sabka away.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.260
And when she didn't come
back at the end of the day,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.410
I just thought that they
took her to the gas chamber.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.120
I was so lost without her.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.160
And then they called
the selection,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:12.420
and they selected 1,500
women, including myself,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.350
to go to the gas chamber.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.190
When we got there and
we started to go inside,

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:22.730
we realized that the gas
chamber wasn't big enough

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.320
to hold 1,500 people.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.400
So everybody started
to push outside,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.670
and I was pushed
back to the door.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:34.580
So when I got to the
door, I dug my nails

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.270
into the side of the
door and I just hung on--

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.300
didn't want to be
pushed back inside.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.640
Not that I was looking
for a miracle--

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.700
because nobody ever
came out of there--

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.640
but for that moment,
I just wanted

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.140
to look at the sky
for as long as I can.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.620
And then the Zyklon B arrived,
and the SS ordered the guard

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.370
to close the door so they
can throw the Zyklon B.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.560
But he was so nervous
because I was in the doorway

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:10.130
and he could not close the door,
and he must obey at any cost.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:14.210
So he threw me out,
and he closed the door.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.060
I ran up the ramp
that I just came down

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:22.910
looking for a place to hide,
but there was no place to hide.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:26.000
But then, I saw that the gas
chamber had a little space

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.890
between the roof--

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.830
see, the gas chamber
was underground,

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.310
but the roof was on
top of the ground.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.480
And between the
roof and the ground,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.510
there was about this much space.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:46.280
And I only weighed about
50 pounds at that time,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.585
so I was able to crawl in
that little spot and hide.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.979
While I was underneath,
I said to myself,

00:27:58.979 --> 00:28:01.020
what's [? this ?] [? end? ?]
In about 20 minutes,

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.200
another transport will come in.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.330
And they will find me.

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.260
They will put me back
in the gas chamber

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.800
with the people
that are coming in.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.550
But for that moment, I had hope.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:19.980
And then a Sonderkommando
boy came to do his job,

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.180
and he saw me first.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.600
Do you know what a
Sonderkommando is?

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.310
Anybody?

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.220
OK.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.850
A Sonderkommando is
a group of people

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.170
that Mengele and doctors
selected when the trains came

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.570
in from all parts of Europe.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.550
From every part of Europe,
they would select the strongest

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.600
between the age of 18 and 35.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.820
And their job was--

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.130
they were called
the Sonderkommando.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:54.300
Their job was to appease the
people when they were leading

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.040
them into the gas chamber.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.880
And when they were dead, their
job was to put them in the oven

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.890
and cremate them.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.260
The only problem was
that they were only given

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.300
three to four months to live.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.360
And after that, they would
take the Sonderkommando

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.580
and kill them and select
new ones that came in.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.250
The reason they selected a
group from every country,

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.950
so they can speak the
language that the people

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:21.210
that they were appeasing.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.360
Can you imagine?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.990
There were over 8,000
people in the Sonderkommando

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.850
at all times.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.410
And every three,
four months, they

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:39.560
would kill these strong,
beautiful, young people just

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.910
because they did their job.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.160
And this one Sonderkommando
boy found me first.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.640
He took his jacket off and
covered my naked body and said,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.740
I'll be right back.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.110
And I thought I was
hallucinating because I never

00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:00.580
thought that these
things were happening.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.080
It didn't take a few minutes.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.160
He came back.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.110
He took my hand, and he walked
me around the gas chamber.

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.440
And he says, there is a
train going to a labor camp.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.610
I will try and put
you on that train.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.170
I says, who are you?

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.750
I mean, what is your name
and where are you from?

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:21.970
He spoke my language.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.500
He says, that doesn't matter.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.030
I only have three
more days to live.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:31.840
So if you make it, live
a little for me, too.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.830
That is the time when I realized
how much I want to stay alive

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.945
for him and for all the others.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.680
So he says, my name
is not important.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:46.190
I'm not going to be here.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.320
Can you imagine?

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.980
Killing all these people for
doing their dirty [? world. ?]

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.190
So he did put me on a train.

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.940
The train was moving
only at night.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:02.350
I didn't know which way we were
going, where we were going.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.250
But when the train stopped,
we were in a labor camp.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.470
We were put in
barracks and in bunks

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.590
just like in Auschwitz
and Birkenau.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.530
In the morning, when I
looked down at my lower bunk,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.660
another miracle happened.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:23.840
My silent friend Sabka was
looking straight at me.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.350
You cannot imagine
what this was like.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.980
We both thought that we were
taken to the gas chamber

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:37.280
and we were both dead, and here
we are in the same camp alive.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.740
We didn't know whether we
were able to talk there

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:45.260
because how the punishment was
there, but we didn't have to.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.120
We just looked at each
other, and we just

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.940
knew that from here on we
were going to be together

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.700
no matter where it takes us.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.290
We worked in this factory.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.100
It was a munition factory.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.520
We were 5,000 women there.

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.980
And we worked in
separate places,

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:03.890
but we were together
every night.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.930
We worked there until
January of 1945.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:14.170
And in January of 1945,
they took all 5,000 women.

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:18.320
They gave us a pair of
wooden shoes that didn't fit

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.760
and a blanket, and they put
us out on the death march.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.110
It was so cold.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:28.120
The snow was up to our knees.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:34.970
But the SS pushed us off
the road and left us there.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.720
Whenever they wanted
to stop for themselves,

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.270
they would push us off the
road and let the dogs guard us.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.730
And I don't know
what they were doing,

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.190
but I guess they needed a rest.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:53.000
They were shooting
people every few miles

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.950
that they couldn't keep up
and left them on the wayside.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.595
Sabka and I were so helpless.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.270
We couldn't help them live,
and we couldn't help them die.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:15.020
And then we were marching
from January until April.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:21.860
By April, we were only 200 of
us left alive from the 5,000.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.276
And we decided that we
were going to give up.

00:33:24.276 --> 00:33:25.650
We were going to
sit on the road.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.970
And if they tell us to
march and we don't march,

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.250
they are going to
have to shoot us.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:35.690
But just then, planes appeared
from behind the mountains,

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:39.380
and they were bombing
everything that was moving.

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.640
But we were on this very
narrow farm road with forests

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.560
all around us,
and the only thing

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.010
that was moving on this
road was the trucks

00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:52.970
that were carrying the
supplies for the guards.

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:59.600
So needless to say, they bombed
those trucks to smithereens.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.830
And when they came back, they
ordered us to march again.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.590
And I said to Sabka, I
don't want to march anymore,

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.600
so I'm going to sit
down on the road.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:15.120
And I was going to wait
for somebody to shoot me.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.960
But Sabka pulled
me into the lineup,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.030
and she whispered
to me, look away

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.030
from what you see and
think about the world

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.010
that they took away from us.

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.530
So you can, you've got to go.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.239
So I went.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.300
And a few miles later,
I sat on the road again.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.690
I just didn't want to go.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.420
And I said, Sabka, I don't
know where we're going.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.580
And when we get there, they're
going to shoot us anyway.

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.810
So why waste all this time?

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.250
And she says, I know
where we're going.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:51.270
We're going to the library,
and we're going to read a book.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.270
And then we're going to
go home, and we're going

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:56.840
to have dinner with our family.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.090
And then we're going to
sleep in our own bed,

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.560
and we won't have to
share it with 10 people.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.100
So you can't die today.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.380
So these were words
that's Sabka and I

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.400
would tell each other
when one of us gave up,

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.600
and it kept us going.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.830
And then finally, she
realized that, yes,

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:23.580
we are going to get killed, so
let's do something about it.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:29.190
We were at such a dark night,
we couldn't even see each other.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:31.970
I don't know how she found
out that the guards had

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:34.610
no flashlights and
they had no ammunition

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:38.390
because it was all
bombed on the truck.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.690
She pushed me off the road,
and she jumped after me,

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:49.070
and she held my mouth.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:53.330
And she says, wait
until everybody passes.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:36:00.870
And so when everybody
passed, she says,

00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:03.900
God created this dark
night so we can escape.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.570
So I says, but I
don't want to escape.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.010
I don't want to go anywhere.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.150
They're going to catch us.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.191
They're going to kill us.

00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:15.580
She says, we must go.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.740
We must find some real food
before we go to heaven.

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.480
I says, OK.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.820
See, these were words
that kept us going.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.240
So I kept going.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.710
And so all night, we
were running and walking

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:30.630
as fast as we can.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.390
At daybreak, I noticed
an abandoned farm.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.860
So I ran and I started
digging in the ground.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.840
And she says, what
are you doing?

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.180
I says, I'm looking
for the food that's

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.040
going to take us to heaven.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.700
She says, in this mud?

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.340
I says, this is no mud.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:49.950
This is an abandoned farm.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.650
And my grandfather
had a farm, and I

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:55.590
know that during harvest
they left a lot of food

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:58.080
in the ground, so I'm
going to look for it.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.900
And I found a little potato.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.350
And I shared this
little potato with her.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.860
I says, see, this
is the food that's

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:07.540
going to take us to heaven.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:11.880
And then we heard water running,
so we found this little brook

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.700
with the cleanest water that
we have seen in a long time.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.720
So needless to say, we
drank a lot of water.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.100
We were so rich.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.430
We had this little potato
and this clean water.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:28.490
So we decided to stay
by the brook and rest.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.900
We covered ourselves
with this half a blanket

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.180
that we had left because
the other half we

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.210
had to cut pieces
and wrap up our feet

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.960
when we lost the wooden
shoes in the snow.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.900
But that's OK.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.700
We only weighed about
50 pounds each or less,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.880
so we wrapped ourselves
up in this little blanket

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.920
and we fell asleep.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.000
I don't know how long we slept,
but someone was poking me

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.040
with the back of a rifle.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.640
And Sabka says, I am not
coming out of the blanket.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.520
I don't want to see who
is going to shoot us.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.720
And I said Sabka--

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.720
see, Sabka was a
little older than me,

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.890
so she was a little wiser.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.430
But I had more dare, and
I didn't care anymore.

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:14.040
So I said, Sabka, let
go of the blanket,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.520
and I'm going to see
who's going to shoot us.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:21.000
When I put my head
out, I saw two soldiers

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.780
in strange uniforms
and strange boots,

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.870
and they spoke a
strange language.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.370
I spoke seven
languages at that time

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:32.970
and I didn't understand them.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.770
And when I spoke to them, they
didn't understand me either.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.370
They were looking at me
with such a disbelief.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.160
God knows, I didn't look human.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.890
My eyes were bulging
out of my head.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.840
My bones were sticking
out of my skin.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.710
I was covered with
lice and dirt.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:55.290
I weighed about 50 pounds.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:39:00.330
And one of the soldiers
was bending to--

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.920
I don't know whether he
wanted to help me up,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.390
but his dog tags fell
out of his shirt.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:11.490
And on the dog tags, he had a
little tiny 10 Commandments.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:14.610
And I said, Sabka, come
out of the blanket.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.470
There is another Jew here.

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:19.020
And she said, who is he?

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.940
I says, I don't know.

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:23.760
She goes, I'm not coming
out of the blanket.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.860
So you see, at that
point, Sabka and I

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.360
thought we were the only two
Jewish people in all of Europe

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.670
that is alive.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.920
So the soldier helped me up.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:44.370
He put his 10 Commandments
in my hand, and I kissed it

00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:50.190
So he, at that point,
kind of guessed who I was,

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.400
but he didn't know
exactly who I was.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.780
And he motioned for me to stay,
and he took off with his buddy.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.960
A few minutes
later, a whole army

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.050
was coming down that
mountain towards me,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.110
and they had a
German-speaking soldier,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.750
so I was able to communicate.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:15.390
And he looked at me, and he
said, who are you hiding from,

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.540
and why do you look like this?

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.060
God knows I didn't look human.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.580
And I tried to explain
to him about the death

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:28.690
camps and the death march and
that the Nazis are doing this.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.770
He says, what kind of
people do this to children?

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:34.440
And I again tried to explain.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.440
He didn't know what
I was talking about,

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.724
knew nothing about that.

00:40:40.724 --> 00:40:44.440
And I was angry.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.920
I didn't know who they were,
and Sabka wouldn't come out

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.760
of the blanket.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.780
And I was afraid that maybe they
are not who I think they are.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.130
And I got angry with him.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.560
And I says, who are you?

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.050
And he goes, don't be afraid.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.270
We are Americans.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.320
And I didn't believe him.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:04.330
I says, Americans?

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.990
What are you doing here?

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:08.920
Don't you know
what's going on here?

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.820
He says, yeah, we do, and that's
why we're here-- to stop it.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.430
And he tried to convince me
to believe him who he is.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:22.660
He says, Germany is burning,
and we're going to go to Berlin

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.980
and kill Hitler.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.950
And this will never
going to happen again.

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:30.340
You will never have
to be afraid of.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:30.940
I said, OK.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.590
So I started to believe him.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.620
So at that point, I
looked up to heaven,

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:40.100
and I said, thank you,
God, for watching over us.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:43.780
I cannot find the words
high enough to describe

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.000
my liberators, but they helped
us to believe that there are

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.750
still people in this
world that care.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:56.680
I saw so much love
in their eyes.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.730
I wanted to hug them and
thank them for finding us,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:04.180
but I was so dirty and
covered with lice I didn't

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:07.180
want them to be like that.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.510
And then he said, would you
like to have something to eat?

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.150
God knows we looked hungry.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:16.270
And that's when Sabka
came out of the blanket--

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:20.530
not because he wanted to eat
first, but she asked them,

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:24.880
can we have just a
little scrambled eggs

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.930
and a small loaf of bread?

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.740
So our wish becomes a reality.

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:32.590
Because that's what we were
talking about on the death

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.990
march and in the death camp--

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:38.710
of our favorite foods and the
world they took away from us.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.700
And that's what kept
us going all this time.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:46.990
Within minutes, there was little
fires all over the mountains

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:52.040
because we couldn't build a big
fire because we were in danger.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.460
You know, the war was still on.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.290
But they built
these little fires,

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.980
and they were scrambling
eggs in their helmets.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.470
They didn't have any
bread, so they gave me

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.030
these brown little boxes.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.040
And they opened
them up, and there

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:09.190
were lots of crackers in
there and these brown chunks

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.850
of things.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.430
I didn't know what they were.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.100
They turned out to be
chocolate, but I never

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.510
saw chocolate before.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.150
So I didn't care about
that, but I was very happy

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.370
with the crackers.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:25.120
And Sabka was very happy
with her scrambled eggs.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.220
And then they gave
us clean shirts,

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.250
and we went back to the
brook and washed ourselves

00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.260
and put on those clean shirts.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.780
And they put us in
a Red Cross van.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.570
And again, they made our
wish become a reality.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:48.070
There were two beds with pillows
and blankets and white sheets.

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:52.180
We weren't sure that that was
for us, so we sat on the floor.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.340
But then, after a
while, no one came in,

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:59.080
so we just realized that
they must be for us.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.510
You cannot imagine it.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.010
It was the greatest
feeling to know

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.815
that we will not have to
share this bed with 10 people.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:15.730
We started to think
about our families,

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.490
and we knew that we will
never see them again.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.420
So the feeling was different.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.510
We weren't so happy anymore.

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:27.660
We just sat and we
cried and cried,

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.130
and we just cried
ourselves to sleep.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:35.380
In the morning, when I woke
up, Sabka was still sleeping.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:38.900
I was calling her name,
and I yelled at her, Sabka,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.470
get up because today is the
day we will start our new life

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.330
in the free world, together.

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.630
But she didn't wake up.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.610
A soldier came in
to tell us to get

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.670
ready to leave because the enemy
was closing in on that area,

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.240
and we were in their way.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.400
So I asked him, please
help her wake up.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.510
Because she is so tired, she
can't wake up by herself.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.350
And when he saw her, he opened
the door and he yelled, medic.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.450
And the medic came in.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.590
And I saw that he
gave her an injection,

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.610
but she didn't wake up.

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.160
So I yelled at him, wake her up.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.760
Don't let her sleep so long.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.460
And he says, I
can't wake her up.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.590
She is sleeping in a
very beautiful place,

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.760
and she is no longer
sick or hungry.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.210
And she knows that you are free.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.560
I said, what are you saying?

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.540
She was never sick.

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.880
And he said, she was very sick.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.620
She died in her sleep of
typhus, and I can't help her.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:46.230
Please, tell me, where
do you want her body

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:49.530
to be buried because
we really must go.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.690
But my heart was so full of
grief, I questioned myself--

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:59.190
if I could have done something
to help her stay alive.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.200
The loss was so unbearable.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.730
Again I was losing
my loved ones.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.960
She was going to be the
friend and my family forever,

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.590
and now I am again alone.

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.420
I couldn't even spend
time at her graveside

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.980
because we were in harm's
way and we had to go.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:27.480
We buried her in the blanket
that we were liberated in,

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:33.090
and we buried her also in the
spot where we were liberated.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.120
And the soldiers told me that
they will make arrangements

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.910
for the soldiers that
are coming after that

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:41.580
to come back after
the war and take

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.920
her body to a real cemetery.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.190
And we did that, but we
couldn't find her body

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.390
because the mountain was
so destroyed from fighting.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:53.350
She is in my heart all the time.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.130
And they took me with
them, and they left me

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:09.730
in a field hospital somewhere
in the mountains near

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:14.580
[? Pilsen, ?] and they
went on to fight the war.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:19.660
And when I got stronger, they
put me in a displaced person

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.990
camp where I joined
40 children to go

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:26.080
to Sweden to an orphanage.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.570
And while I was waiting
to go to Sweden,

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:33.190
my name appeared on a list
of survivors in New York.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:39.610
And my father had a brother in
the Bronx that I never knew.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:44.440
And he saw the name on the
survival list, my name,

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:49.960
and he wrote a letter and
asked the camp to find me

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.350
and asked me if I want
to come to a free country

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.090
and a new family.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.820
And I screamed so loud
they must have heard

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.400
me all the way to New York.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:04.960
So I gave up my spot to
another child to go to Sweden,

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.080
and I waited two years
to go to America.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.870
I couldn't believe
that I was going

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.300
to the greatest free
country in the whole world.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.150
And finally, in 1947,
I saw about what

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:23.080
a free country looks like for
the first time in my life.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.600
After many encounters
with death,

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.330
I survived Hitler's atrocity.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:31.210
And now, I must rebuild my life.

00:48:31.210 --> 00:48:35.530
But first, I must find a way
to be the voice that I promised

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.740
to be for those children.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.680
But I couldn't, because
who was going to believe

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.920
such a nightmare, a child?

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.940
So that was one of the reasons
that I did not share my past

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.620
in the Holocaust for 50 years.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.940
I couldn't tell of my torturers
that destroyed my temples,

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.570
my Torahs, and humanity itself.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:05.860
But then in 1994 when
"Schindler's List" came out,

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.970
and I knew that it is
my duty to bear witness,

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:14.410
it was difficult to describe
so much sorrow and pain.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:19.630
Even in my free world, my
nightmares were the same,

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:25.330
except the ashes were grayer,
the cries were louder,

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:32.470
and the children's
pain was clearer.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:36.430
When I woke up, I had to force
myself to think where I was.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:40.150
So how can I be the voice
that I promised to be?

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:42.550
I tried to think
about my tomorrows

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:47.050
because my yesterdays were all
about Auschwitz and Birkenau.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.200
And then I thought of the camps.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.420
With my experience, maybe they
could be lessons for humanity.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.150
So I must learn
from my yesterdays

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.260
and share them with the
present and future generation.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.820
Since I was only 13 years old
when I endured so much pain,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.670
and I witnessed so much
injustice against humanity,

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:13.360
I knew that the
children of tomorrow

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.880
could learn from my pain.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.620
So, in 1994 after
"Schindler's List" came out,

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.490
I realized that it is
my duty to bear witness.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:29.590
So I went back to the death
camps with 5,000 teenagers

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:34.900
from 49 countries on
the March of the Living.

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:41.020
50 years after the Holocaust, I
was back in Auschwitz-Birkenau

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:45.460
on the planet of evil where
I lost my entire family,

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.870
and I was a human guinea
pig for Dr. Josef Mengele.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:53.380
When I saw how much
evidence the SS destroyed,

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:57.390
I was so angry I
wanted to kill someone.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:51:00.940
But most of all, I
wanted to yell at Mengele

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.090
because he always yelled at us.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:05.800
I looked around
because I didn't want

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.790
to yell in front
of the children,

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.510
and what used to be the
gypsy camp were still

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:13.490
a couple of barracks
that were not destroyed.

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:15.790
So I went inside
one of them, and I

00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:21.500
yelled as loud as I could
at Mengele, look at me.

00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:23.050
I am alive.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.210
In spite of your
experiments, you

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:29.530
tortured Sabka and I
and millions of people

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:31.390
you sent to the flames.

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:35.320
I am back with 5,000
healthy children,

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:38.080
and you can't touch us.

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.260
Since there is no room
for hatred in my life,

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.420
that was my revenge.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.840
And from there, I went to the
number 2 gas chamber where

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.630
my entire family was murdered.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:51.810
And again, I was angry.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:56.590
What used to be the gas chamber
is now a pile of rubble.

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:03.760
I found an opening in that
rubble, and I crawled inside.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.330
50 years on the anniversary
of the Holocaust,

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:10.210
I was again in the gas chamber.

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.940
The walls were
still green and blue

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:18.350
from the Zyklon B. The
smell is still very strong,

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.770
and the fear of death
still embraced me.

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:25.340
I sat down on the ground
and lit all my candles

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:29.060
that I had in my backpack,
and I prayed for the victims

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.970
that died such a cruel death.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:37.400
As I was leaving
the gas chamber,

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.450
I turned around one
more time to look back,

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.440
and I saw a table
set for dinner.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:51.140
Actually, it was set for our
first Seder, for our holiday.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:54.630
And my whole family was
sitting around the table,

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:58.040
and next to my little
sister was an empty chair.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.260
And that was my chair.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:04.580
So I turned around, and I was
going to go sit in my chair,

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:07.520
but my mother put her hand
in front of me and she says,

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:10.250
you can't sit in your chair yet.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:13.220
Promise me that you
will stop crying

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.310
and you will do what you must.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:20.570
When I reached out to hug
her, she wasn't there.

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:24.230
So I sat down by my candles
and I wrote her a letter,

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.380
and I'd like to share
the letter with you.

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.140
I will not cry anymore,
and I will never

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:34.310
forget the children who died a
cruel death because their eyes

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:37.640
were not blue enough, or
their skin not light enough,

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.530
or they were Jewish.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.560
I will never forget the
painful look in their eyes

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.140
when they marched
to their death.

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:50.100
Dear mother, this letter I am
writing to you is very special.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.480
I want to tell you
how much I miss you.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.780
I missed you on my wedding
day, and you did not

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:59.000
share my happiness.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.010
But most, I missed
you when I gave birth

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:05.120
to your grandchildren and
you could not hold them.

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.250
It is difficult to
live with the fact

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:10.250
that you were cheated
of enjoying them.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:14.870
As for me, being a mother
today, I can feel the pain

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:19.250
you felt when your children
died in your arms from the gas.

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:23.570
For me, there is no medicine
I can take to heal my pain.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:26.630
I am still learning
to live with it.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:30.890
But I promise you to tell
the world all that happened,

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:34.400
and I hope that God will
help me to stay strong.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.640
And I pray that he watches
over our children of tomorrow

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:42.830
so they can remember the past
and never be silent when they

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.590
see injustice against people.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:49.550
What happened to us
should never happen again.

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:53.300
And on this day, I am
making a commitment

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:56.770
to help heal the
sickness of hatred.

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:01.760
And when I can't help heal any
more, I hope to sit in my chair

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:05.690
and tell them that they
are being learned from.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.870
When I came up from
the gas chamber,

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:16.950
I shared my past with
all these teenagers

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:21.780
from 49 countries for the
first time in 50 years.

00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:26.430
I was grateful for the courage
and also the liberation

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:31.860
of this road of murder where SS
trained me to step over death

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:33.930
and not to cry for them.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:39.180
Today, I want to tell them,
I survived your atrocities

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:42.780
and I cry for the death,
and I walk among people

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:45.550
that value human lives.

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:48.970
And I have not
stopped ever since.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:52.980
After that day, I have
spoken to many, many people

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:58.380
from almost all the free world,
including our government.

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.440
I still can't believe
that I am alive today

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.740
and I shared my painful
past with the most powerful

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:07.280
government in the world.

00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.430
But sharing my past with
you is most important

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:15.430
because you are going to be
that government in the future,

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.540
and it's going to be
up to you to make sure

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:22.300
that everyone is free to
practice their beliefs.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.720
So if you remember
the Holocaust,

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.480
you will not let
it happen again.

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.720
The Holocaust is not
just a part in history,

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.480
but it lingers in the present--

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:40.110
in Rwanda, in Bosnia, in Africa,
in our own country, 9/11.

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:44.640
Perhaps when we were forgetting
how powerful hatred can be,

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:50.220
9/11 reminded us, and we
tasted violence and mass death.

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:54.000
So we must absolutely
be aware of hatred

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.480
and change people's
minds of hating others.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.740
Otherwise, it will cause
another unexplainable event

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:03.480
like the Holocaust.

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.910
We must learn the
lessons of the Holocaust

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:10.470
to bring awareness of this
unfairness to humanity

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:13.950
and never forget
what hatred leads to.

00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:17.790
If we stand up against
prejudice and promote tolerance,

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:21.240
it will change
lives and behaviors.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:25.290
We must work together to protect
the future of human existence

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:29.070
for generations to
come, and it has

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:31.650
to start with our
future generation.

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:38.850
They are the first
generation at a distance

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.790
of the Holocaust and
the last generations

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:44.580
to know survivors firsthand.

00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:48.460
None of their children will
be able to meet a survivor,

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.840
so they have a very
important mission.

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.580
To teach their children what
they learn from a survivor.

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.700
I need them to help me to
bring a good understanding

00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.830
about this painful event.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:06.390
When I am no longer here, I hope
that they will carry my message

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:12.760
to the future so those fires
of hell become a light of hope.

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.190
All the technological
devices my generation

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:20.790
had created in our
lifetime, we failed

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:24.930
to create a tool to stop hatred.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:30.900
But we will help you to find
that tool as long as we're

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.350
here, and you will change that.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:37.150
You will change the world.

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:40.170
So my mission is to
help you find that.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:44.430
It was very easy for
Hitler to take our lives,

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:48.690
but it is difficult for us to
get Hitler out of our lives.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:54.120
So please, join my children and
grandchildren, who will tell

00:58:54.120 --> 00:59:00.570
and retell of our losses and
grief in hope to stop genocide.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.950
I will not be silent, and I
will not forget the victims.

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.550
As long as I am able,
I will speak worldwide

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:11.250
to improve human conditions.

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.210
My goal is to make a difference
in one person every time

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:17.250
I share my past.

00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:21.690
I cannot explain that
dark time in my childhood,

00:59:21.690 --> 00:59:24.030
but we must remember it.

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:26.700
It is important
to recall the past

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:32.160
so our lives and generations
to come have more meaning.

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:35.220
The memory and the
lessons of the Holocaust

00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:40.140
are not negotiable and not
a subject to be forgotten.

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:43.560
I relive my pain again
and again so present

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:48.190
and future generations
can learn from it.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:59.590
I hope that they will learn
and remember and never

00:59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.480
let it happen again.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.350
I came forward to share my
degrading experience in hopes

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:09.880
that my personal story
will influence generations

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:15.250
to come to work together
and work for tolerance

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.990
and understanding.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.380
I don't want the world to forget
what happened to us because I

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.660
don't want it to happen again.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.650
For too long, hatred,
fear, and intolerance

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:30.760
have torn apart families,
communities, and nations

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.500
around the world.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.500
If our world is to
achieve lasting peace,

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.110
all people must
learn that even if we

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:42.530
come from different
backgrounds, races, and culture,

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:46.480
we all have the same
dreams for our children.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.080
The world has not learned
yet from past histories--

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.430
not just the Holocaust, but
histories before the Holocaust.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:03.040
I cannot explain the Auschwitz
and Birkenau and the genocide

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:08.410
of Jews and others, but this
painful event teaches us what

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:10.660
is important in life.

01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:15.250
So no matter how small
you think you are,

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.530
you can make the
biggest difference.

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:23.800
So embrace the past
and learn from it.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:28.390
In spite of the chemicals in my
soup and Mengele's experiments,

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.990
I have a 6-foot-tall
gorgeous son

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:34.690
and a beautiful,
beautiful daughter

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.120
and five grandchildren
that light up

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.700
my life every single day.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:44.230
My mother's diamonds and I
survived Hitler's atrocities,

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:47.860
and they are to be handed
down to each firstborn girl

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.360
in every generation to
preserve my mother's memory.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.840
They are not to
be sold or traded.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.850
Except, god forbid, if they're
hungry, they can buy bread.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.660
So thank you so, so much
for having me here today.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:12.710
Before I end, I want to thank
two very special people again.

01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.720
Gilly and Adam and
Google, the company,

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:24.850
whoever you are and
as many as you are.

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:32.480
And if you have
any questions, I'll

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.930
be happy to answer if I can.

01:02:34.930 --> 01:02:38.160
So where is my helper?

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:46.660
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.970
Before I let him go and
before he goes anywhere,

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:54.640
I'd like to pin him with a pin.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.990
We have to earn it.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:58.540
We get it on the
March of the Living.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.890
And it's a pin.

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:04.300
It's a Hebrew word,
and it says Zakar.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:07.000
Zakar means remember.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.220
So I want to pin
him with this pin

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:15.860
because he remembered to get me
all these things to say today.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.461
So thank you so much.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:18.336
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.480
IRENE WEISBERG
ZISBLATT: Oh, maybe I

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.410
have it on the wrong side.

01:03:25.410 --> 01:03:26.201
SPEAKER 1: Perfect.

01:03:26.201 --> 01:03:27.270
It's perfect.

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.779
Thank you again.

01:03:28.779 --> 01:03:30.570
I think that we are--
if you have to leave,

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.570
we understand that time is over.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.390
However, I would love
the opportunity for folks

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.450
to ask questions, and
we have a few minutes.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:39.950
Go ahead.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.533
AUDIENCE: I just
want to say thank you

01:03:41.533 --> 01:03:42.940
so much for sharing your story.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.110
I can't imagine the strength
and the courage it takes,

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:50.050
and it's so selfless of you
to share it with everyone.

01:03:50.050 --> 01:03:52.830
So thank you so much.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.200
And Shanah Tovah.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.382
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT:
Shanah Tovah to you.

01:03:56.382 --> 01:03:57.840
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering, you

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.750
were 13 years old when you
went through this experience.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:04.350
And throughout the talk,
you were describing

01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.910
your relationship with God.

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.510
How did you rationalize
all of the hatred

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:13.290
that you went
through, and how are

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:16.890
you able to hold on to
your relationship with God

01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:19.070
and have hope?

01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:22.040
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT:
I held on to words,

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.050
very important words.

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:25.860
Don't give up.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:27.120
Fight.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.410
Stay alive as long as you can.

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:34.160
And Sabka and I, we were
each other's strength.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.560
If I gave up, she would
find words for say to me.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:42.950
Like, for an example,
one day I said

01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:46.370
I want to go through
the electric wires.

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:47.540
I want to die.

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.880
And she says, no, no,
no, you can't do that.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.170
Just imagine, she says.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:54.660
This hell cannot last forever.

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:58.490
And when it's over, the
world will be so beautiful.

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:01.880
Don't you want to stay
alive for just one minute

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.180
to see that beautiful world?

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.830
So those are the
things, those are

01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:09.230
the kind of things
that helped us

01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:12.570
push each hour to stay alive.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.580
I could never imagine
being alive tomorrow,

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:19.400
but I was hoping and
pushing for today.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:26.960
And there was no man
or woman anywhere

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:32.660
that can help me to be
here today except God,

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:36.527
and I never lost faith in God.

01:05:36.527 --> 01:05:37.360
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.150
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:39.820
Yeah.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:42.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for speaking with us today.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.370
I had a question.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:46.660
Just sort of, I've
noticed over many years

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:48.670
of discussing politics
and current events

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:51.220
with people, a sort
of constant refrain

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.870
that people immediately
jump to when

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:56.200
they tend to dislike a
politician or a government

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.070
or are upset.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:06:00.370
They frequently, immediately
compare them to the Nazis

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:02.140
because they know
everyone agrees

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:05.920
that they're the personification
of evil in many ways.

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.130
But I always wondered,
from your perspective,

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.810
does that upset you?

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:13.060
Do you think that sort
of does a disservice

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:17.167
to sort of discussion?

01:06:17.167 --> 01:06:19.250
I mean, do you think it's
disrespectful for people

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.535
to sort of paint
with brush strokes

01:06:21.535 --> 01:06:23.660
when they don't like
something, immediately to jump

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.870
to that as a characterization?

01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:27.620
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT:
Does it upset me?

01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.270
It makes me sick and
afraid, and it takes me back

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:37.300
to my childhood where I wasn't
allowed or I wasn't giving

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:40.370
or I wasn't able to do anything.

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:46.778
Of course it does, and I wish
I can do something about it.

01:06:50.305 --> 01:06:51.180
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.580
All right, last question
in the back there.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:56.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
this gift and for being here.

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.010
I have two questions.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:06.260
How did you, after
experiencing these atrocities,

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.795
find joy in your life?

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:14.870
You mentioned prayer.

01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:16.040
Do you pray?

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.010
Do you have a prayer practice?

01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:20.570
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT: Yes.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:24.980
I pray all the time, and
I talk to God every Friday

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.410
night when I light candles.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.450
I tell him my problems.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:33.260
I ask him to fix
it, and he does.

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:35.750
I really believe that he does.

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:40.140
As far as my joy, I did not
have joy for a long time.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:43.760
The first time I had joy is
when I gave birth to my family--

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.050
my son, my daughter, and
then my grandchildren.

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:50.270
Those are my joys.

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:53.720
That is the most
important thing in my life

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.750
because I lost my
family at a young age--

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:59.940
of 49 people in five minutes.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:02.900
And I was alone ever since then.

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:09.030
And so this family is the most
important thing in my life.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.022
And I have a lot
of joy from them.

01:08:13.405 --> 01:08:14.280
SPEAKER 1: All right.

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:17.130
Well, again, on behalf of
Google, thank you so much,

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.550
Irene, for coming and
sharing your story today.

01:08:19.550 --> 01:08:20.180
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT:
Thank you for having me.

01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.660
SPEAKER 1: I'd
recommend to anyone,

01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:24.830
she goes into more detail
in "The Fifth Diamond."

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:25.460
It's a book.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:25.800
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT: Yeah.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.939
I have books back there.

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:29.130
Whoever wants a
book, you're welcome.

01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:32.040
SPEAKER 1: But thank you
for sharing your experience.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:32.279
IRENE WEISBERG ZISBLATT:
Thank you, sir.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.140
SPEAKER 1: You're doing a
great job on your mission.

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.598
IRENE WEISBERG
ZISBLATT: I hope so.

01:08:35.598 --> 01:08:36.720
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.220
Thank you so much.

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:40.070
I love you.
