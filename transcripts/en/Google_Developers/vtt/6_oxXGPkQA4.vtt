VAN RIPER: Thanks
for tuning in today

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.000
to this special edition
of Google Developers Live.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.910
Today, we have Joshua and
Courtney Woodward joining us

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.030
as the GDG Fresno
High organizers.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.430
And later, we'll have some
of the student numbers

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.670
of GDG Fresno High joining us in
celebration of computer science

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.840
education week.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.096
I am Van Riper.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:25.720
I work with our Google
Developer Groups

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.430
around the world as
a community advocate.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.890
And I've worked with
Josh for a long time

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.630
as one of our GDG
Fresno organizers.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.390
And today, Josh and
Courtney are going

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.797
to tell us about how they got
started with GDG Fresno High.

00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:38.130
JOSHUA WOODWARD: That's correct.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.140
Being a part of
GDG Fresno, we were

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.470
involved with adults and
already established programmers.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.950
And we wanted to get
high schoolers involved.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.050
And my wife is a teacher at a
local High School, Fresno High.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.740
And so I approached her and
asked, how do we start a club

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.130
and get kids involved?

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.925
And how can I come on campus
and teach kids how to code?

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:02.300
VAN RIPER: And
Courtney, you were

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.640
saying how at the
beginning the challenges

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.740
you had to start with?

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.240
COURTNEY WOODWARD:
Well, absolutely.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.150
Because to be a club sponsor,
that's above and beyond

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.230
your teaching responsibilities,
your classroom

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.150
responsibilities.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.550
So a lot is on your
own time coordinating

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.120
with other adults
on campus to get

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.400
the club started, to
get a meeting place.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.980
And in this case, one of
our greatest obstacles

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.640
was getting computers
in front of the kids

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.345
so they can actually code.

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:29.220
VAN RIPER: And then you
told me how this year

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.370
how it's really taken off.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.830
You did the club expo at
the beginning of the year.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.871
COURTNEY WOODWARD: Right.

00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:36.550
So since it was
new, and there was

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.890
no sort of tech club on campus,
we didn't know where to start.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.910
And at the middle
of last year, we

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.660
said, well, we're just
going to go for it.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.050
So we got the paperwork in
and recruited a few kids.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.412
But it was really hard
to get the word out.

00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:55.620
And we didn't have computers.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.940
This year however, at
the beginning of the year

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.510
we did the club expo.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.690
I had Josh's Google Glass on.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.950
That really caught
kids' attention.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.950
And we had over 60
students sign up

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.720
that were interested in some
sort of aspect of technology

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.580
or computer science
are just learning more

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.360
about Google products.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.750
VAN RIPER: And how often
do the students meet?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.060
JOSHUA WOODWARD: Now we meet
once a week, on average,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.760
about once a week during lunch
or after school in a computer

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.210
lab where we have
access to computers.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.360
We started off just by showing
them the video on code.org.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.500
And they get really inspired
when they hear like free food

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.910
and they get to
play pool all day.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.130
So that got them
hooked into the club.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.140
But now we do actual
hands-on stuff.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.920
So like, we built a
tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.990
And walked them
through that, step

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.830
by step, on what
everything that's going on.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.830
VAN RIPER: That's great.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.320
And you also told me that you
did something kind of unique.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.195
I think you might be
one of the first-- well,

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:03.622
you are the first high school
group that we've ever had.

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.080
We've had many
university chapters,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.060
but GDG Fresno High is our first
chapter within a high school.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.244
But you were able to get
Google Apps for Education?

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:13.160
JOSHUA WOODWARD: Yeah.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.176
So we have a domain,
fresnohighwarriors.com.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:21.160
And it has a Google Apps for
Education account tied to it.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.930
So somewhere in
the requirements,

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.090
it just say you had to
be a school organization.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.640
And so that's what we were.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.740
So now the students get their
name at fresnohighwarriors.com.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.720
And they have access to Google
Drive accounts and Google Docs.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.690
And we can actually
open up a doc

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.177
and plan a meeting and share.

00:03:41.177 --> 00:03:42.760
VAN RIPER: And how
much did that cost?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.420
JOSHUA WOODWARD: That's free.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.878
VAN RIPER: That's
right, it's free.

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:47.349
So the schools out there, if
you want to start a chapter

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.890
like at your high
school, if you work

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.120
with an organizer like
Josh in your area,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.760
because we don't allow under
18 people to organize groups.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.989
But if you get an adult
organizer in your high school,

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.780
you could potentially
get these Google Apps

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.060
for Education for your students
as well, which is great.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.740
I think that's a great
thing you guys did.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.840
JOSHUA WOODWARD: Yeah.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.590
That's one of the
things is why it worked,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.120
I think because my wife
was a teacher on campus.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.580
So it was easy to get
in that way on campus.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.079
So it's just a matter of getting
somebody that's on campus.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.089
So if you're a teacher on campus
and you want to start a club,

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.971
go to the Google
Developers group directory.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:24.720
And see if there's a
chapter in your area,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.470
and contact that organizer.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.650
And work with them probably.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.920
VAN RIPER: Yeah, great.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.750
So maybe now we
should actually talk

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.910
to some of the students
about their experience

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.410
with the groups.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.030
Sound good?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.870
JOSHUA WOODWARD: Yep.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.460
VAN RIPER: And we're back with,
Fresno high school students

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.780
Chris, Muarshawn, and Riley.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.550
So Chris, tell us about
how you got started coding.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.310
CHRIS: Oh, well.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.720
I was really bored for
about a month during summer.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.640
And my grandma was
reading the newspaper.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.230
And she saw this thing
called 59 Days of Code.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.240
And it was downtown in my city.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.370
And she took me down
there, and there

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.095
was a man named
Jake [? Soberall ?].

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:00.360
And he is starting a new
course and he teaches kids

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.320
how to code, because he
says that there's not

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.855
enough people that are coding.

00:05:03.855 --> 00:05:06.510
Well, There needs
to be much more.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.044
Back to you, Van.

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:09.614
VAN RIPER: Thank you, Chris.

00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:10.780
So how about you, Muarshawn?

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.956
How did you get started?

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.950
MUARSHAWN: I got started coding
by like, when I was little,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.760
I used to always mess
around with technology.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.365
You know how little kids are.

00:05:19.365 --> 00:05:21.130
You like to do
different things, you

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.338
don't know which one to pick.

00:05:22.338 --> 00:05:25.260
So you know like, when
I got to Fresno High,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.080
I used to go to the library
like every day during lunch,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.230
after school sometimes,
sometimes before school.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.827
And I never heard
of the GDG program

00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:35.160
that Miss Woodward had going on.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.270
She found me.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.790
So I was like, yeah, I'll join.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.100
So the first day,
it was on Thursday.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.300
I went, there was like a
variety of different kids.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.020
So I was like, I
probably can fit in,

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.490
because it ain't just
for like one kind of kid.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.730
You know, geeks, football
players, basketball players,

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.230
anybody.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.622
So I joined.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.080
VAN RIPER: That's
great, Muarshawn.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.080
So how about you, Riley?

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.320
How'd you get started?

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.740
RILEY: Well, my stepdad, Josh,
started me on Code Academy

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.280
online.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.280
And I played around with
that for a little while

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.010
and then lost interest in it.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.050
It seemed a little
bit out of my league,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.779
like it seemed I
had so far to go

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.570
and it kind of discouraged
me a little bit.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.000
But when the club
started, it actually

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.730
helped me realize how
like I could find my place

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.920
and like do things at my level.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.950
I didn't have to be
a master at anything.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.062
I could just work
with what I had.

00:06:33.062 --> 00:06:34.020
And it would be enough.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.362
So it really encouraged
me to do more.

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:38.070
VAN RIPER: Great.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.200
So what keeps you coming
back to GDG Fresno High?

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.630
CHRIS: I just
really like coding.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.350
And I like my teacher
that teaches that.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.740
And I don't know.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.210
I think the kids
are really nice.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.170
And it's really good in there.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.315
Everybody can fit in.

00:06:55.315 --> 00:06:57.830
VAN RIPER: Great How
about you, Riley?

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.740
RILEY: Well, it's like
the next big thing.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.740
It is the big thing.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.940
And it will be for
some time, I think.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.880
It's computers and
Google and developing.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.240
And it's not going to be
out of style or something

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.920
like next year.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.052
It'll be around.

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:17.010
And it'll keep growing
and keep getting better.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.426
And I'd like to
be a part of that.

00:07:18.426 --> 00:07:20.910
VAN RIPER: Great.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.110
How about you, Muarshawn?

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.360
MUARSHAWN: I agree with Riley.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.781
Computers are going to
be around for a while.

00:07:25.781 --> 00:07:27.030
It's like it is the new thing.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.489
You're going to
see, soon or later,

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.405
you're going to see
everybody with a computer.

00:07:30.405 --> 00:07:32.390
You're going to see
everybody doing the coding.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.620
It's like I like the atmosphere.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.270
Everybody around me is like
smart, intelligent, bright.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.714
I like that.

00:07:38.714 --> 00:07:40.880
VAN RIPER: So do any of you
have any final thoughts?

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.940
Anything like that can actually
speak to your peers out there?

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.440
Students?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.290
Maybe other schools?

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.670
Like why you think
they should get

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.004
involved in something like this?

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:52.169
CHRIS: I think everybody
should be a part of coding,

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.953
because it's going to
be like the future.

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.770
I think everybody's
going to code, mostly.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.719
Like you should do
this if it's available.

00:07:59.719 --> 00:08:01.260
MUARSHAWN: I'm going
to say like, try

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:02.950
something new for a chance.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.424
You know, like don't keep doing
the same thing over and OK.

00:08:05.424 --> 00:08:07.465
Because sooner or later,
it's going to be boring.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.240
RILEY: Yeah.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.330
Along the same lines, even if
you think it's like to hard

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.654
or you have a long way to go,
you just keep working at it.

00:08:19.654 --> 00:08:21.070
And even though
you're a beginner,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.230
you can still contribute in some
way to either your community

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.180
or to some project.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.381
So just don't get
discouraged about it.

00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:30.630
VAN RIPER: Well, that's great.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.100
Well I really appreciate
your time, Chris, Muarshawn,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.780
and Riley for coming
out and telling us

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.085
about your experiences.

00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:38.590
And I'd also like to thank
Joshua and Courtney Woodward

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.299
as well as the Fresno high
school for their support

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:44.740
in this first ever GDG Google
Developer Group chapter

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.940
for in a high school.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.110
As you can see from
the discussion today,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.797
students really warm to this.

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:53.255
They really are passionate
about learning about technology.

00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:55.620
And we'd really like to see
many more groups like this

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.310
be inspired by what
we heard about today.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:03.570
And you can participate
by going to csedweek.org,

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.840
and joining in an hour of
code during Computer Science

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.800
Education Week.
