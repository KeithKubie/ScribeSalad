00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.209
There are some very strong reasons why partners breaking up generally

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:11.190
try to remain friends. To the person being
– however nicely – rejected, the promise

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.550
of friendship can feel like an emotionally-reassuring
consolation prize. We may no longer be able

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.530
to share their bed, have children with them
or end our days in their company, but at least

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.720
something can be rescued from the ashes: we
will continue to be able to call them when

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.370
we like, share our fears and go to the movies
together. To the person performing – however

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.110
nicely – the execution, the promise of friendship
is equally attractive. We may be itching to

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.740
eject the partner but we are not – for that
matter – devoid of feeling. We are, as we

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.040
might say in sentimental moments, extremely
fond of the soon-to-be ex. We just don’t

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.870
want to end our time on earth with them, let
alone reject all sexual possibilities in their

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.040
name. Furthermore, we are deeply attached
to the idea that we’re not monsters. And

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.799
as we know, nice people always try to be friends
with their exes. The arguments may sound wise

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.119
but, from close up, they are deeply fraught
and in their own way, a catastrophe for both

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:18.479
sides. For the rejected party, the step from
lover to friend is an eternally humiliating

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.619
demotion. To go from the idea of a joint life-long
future to a dinner every second Thursday is,

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.740
to put it mildly, a come down. Worse, every
sighting of the ex is guaranteed to re-ignite

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.880
hope and then further insult. One isn’t
acquiring a friend, more an unwitting torturer.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.159
As for the executing party, the ex is a constant
reminder of one’s guilt and ruthlessness.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.720
One can’t even relax into being kind, lest
one’s intentions be misread and, after a

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.880
few drinks, they burst into tears or attempt to make a move.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.960
The idea of trying to be friends constitutes a touching attempt
to honour the best sides of a relationship

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.520
in which two people invested heavily.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.470
Lovers can’t, simplyvanish from each other’s lives after all
that; a friendship is invoked to memorialise

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.960
an episode of genuine importance. But, looked
at more dispassionately, friendship isn’t

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:30.040
in any real sense faithful to love. Friendship
with an ex does a grave disservice both to

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.150
the memory of the relationship at its height
and the merits of intimate friendship. It’s

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.030
at once a betrayal of everything a good relationship
was and a slight on the ideals of friendship,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.310
which shouldn’t be built out of the remnants
of another, more ardent condition. What we

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.209
should replace love with isn’t friendship
but that far more honest state: civil distance.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.159
That and a real assurance that the relationship,
in its best and most enduring light, will

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:08.500
always live on in the one place it can safely
always do so: memory.
