MAKE SPEAKER 1:
Thanks to everyone

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.198
for being here for this talk
about River Blindness Disease,

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:08.052
and how technology is helping
to end this age old scourge that

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:10.570
effects 37 million
people in Africa.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.370
I'd like to introduce
Dr. Moses Katabarwa,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.970
a senior epidemiologist
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.470
for the Carter Center, who's
leading the fight against river

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.810
blindness, and who
has spent the last 20

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.870
years of his life fixated on
the tiny black fly that carries

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.930
the parasite that's
causes river blindness.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.770
Moses Katabarwa is a
native used Ugandan,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.354
a medical anthropologist and
renowned public health expert,

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:33.020
providing scientific support for
the fight against such diseases

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.706
as a river blindness, lymphatic
filarisasis-- which is also

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.880
known as elephantitis--
and schistosomiasis.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.235
He worked with Oxfam, World
Vision International, and River

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:43.770
Blindness Foundation--
and has been

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.089
a speaker on behalf of the CDC.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.880
And currently, also,
is a adjunct professor

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.211
at Emory University.

00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:51.460
He has a Master's degree and
Doctorate in Anthropology

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.750
from the Commonwealth
Open University in the UK;

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.379
received his Master's
in Public Health

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170
degree from Rollins
School of Public Health

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.870
at Emory University; and was
awarded Emory University's

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.989
Sheth Distinguished
International Alumni Award.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.780
Please help me welcome
Dr. Moses Katabarwa.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.064
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.440
DR. KATABARWA: Good
morning, and thank you

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.320
for inviting us--
my colleague Ahana.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.540
We're here about the topic
of ending-- of end the age

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.320
old scourge.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.390
And River Blindness is
not the disease of places

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.740
that you look at and
sanitation is bad

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.950
and everything looks bad.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.380
No, it's places
that are pristine.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.160
It is found in
pristine environment.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.290
That's why I emphasizing the
photograph on the screen.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.340
Of course Daniel Wright
has done a lot for us.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.210
And he's a member of the
Global [? Oncho ?] Busters.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.580
And you are welcome to join.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.000
And once you join, you
are a lifetime member.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.296
And this is the distribution
of River Blindness,

00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:09.045
or Onchocerciasis.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.990
And this is where
The Carter Center

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.800
involved in combating
this disease.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.480
In fact, in the
Western hemisphere,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.880
we are left with
this small place.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.280
Actually, not a small place,
but few people, in the Amazon.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.310
Largely the Yanomami--
between Venezuela and Brazil.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.830
This is how the
disease presents.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.400
This is a young
man, 13 years old.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.220
And you can see on this
side of the-- of the leg,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.420
this is where the
worms are in the leg.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.610
And he's scratching
on that side.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.690
When the worms die, they
cause an immune reaction.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.710
And he has more of these worms
on this side of the body,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.900
and so he's scratching
and creating

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.240
secondary infections
that are causing this.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.510
And this is a nodule where the
female and the male worm live.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.390
The female produces
thousands of baby worms.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.140
This is in nematode worm.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.780
This is called leopard skin.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.120
If you go and find someone
who was not burnt in fire,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.080
or something like
that, and he has

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.220
this kind of white skin,
which we call leopard skin,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.140
that's Onchocerciasis.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.460
And this called-- we
call this hanging groins.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.870
But you can see how the
skin looks very rough.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.390
We even call it elephant skin.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.560
And River Blindness can cause
these terrible hydroceles.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.350
A [INAUDIBLE], for
instance does it,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.520
but-- or so, this
disease causes it.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.690
And of course, you become blind.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.100
And a patient with
River Blindness--

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.510
when they are
getting blind, they

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.090
see as if they are in a tunnel.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.260
They have what we
call tunnel vision.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.780
And this is the only disease
that causes this tunnel vision

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.190
before, of course,
you get blind.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.126
And it has, also, complications.

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:22.079
And there's a competition
called Nakalanga Syndrome.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.000
This is dwarfism.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.790
And this guy's 28 years old,
and this, also-- this guy's

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.490
28 years old.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.310
And the difference
between this, is

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.330
that this one has never grown.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.200
He's a child.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.240
He has never developed secondary
sexual characteristics,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.610
so he'll never marry,
he'll never have a kid,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.900
he's actually a child with no
pubic hair-- nothing like that.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.490
And then, this disease
can also cause epilepsy.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:58.450
And the extreme seizures,
recently mentioned

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.780
called, Nodding Disease.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.560
If you Google
Nodding Disease, you

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.450
will see how terrible it can be.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.780
We don't know whether it's
associated with this disease,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.500
but some people
already believe that it

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.620
is associated with
River Blindness.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.560
And this is 99-- over 99
of the cases are in Africa.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.800
And this is former
Onchocerciasis Control Program,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.550
that was initiated in
1974, and closed 20-- 2002.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.710
And this is the African
program for them.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.320
Onchocerciasis Control
that was initiated in '97,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.050
and is expected close in 2025.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.190
And these are the countries
that Carter Center

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.940
has-- is assisting.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.960
And they have launched-- instead
of controlling the disease,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.085
they are out to eliminate
the disease where

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:57.150
it can be found in
these countries.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.860
Uganda is at the forefront of
Onchocerciasis elimination,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.690
or River Blindness elimination.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.700
We've got 3.5 million
at risk, Sudan--

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.050
about this-- that is Sudan
North, Ethiopia-- at least 31

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.980
million people at the risk.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.970
We know that the mapping is not
complete as I will show you.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.390
Nigeria-- 37.4, the
America's, of course,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.890
we are almost finishing
the job there.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.780
But I'll be showing you
where we need Google.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.710
We use a tablet called
Ivermectin, provided my Merck

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.640
Company.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.790
It's donated free as long
as it is it required,

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.680
and as much as needed.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.470
And so when you give
it to once a year--

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.280
a one dose a year
per person, you

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.630
are controlling the disease.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.400
You are not stopping
transmission.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.060
But when you give it twice,
you are after transmission.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.860
You want to control
transmission,

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.960
and the worms in someone's body.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.400
But if you are doing vector
control, or vector elimination

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.760
with a-- by a biodegradable
agent called, Temephos,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.080
you finish the job faster.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.140
Twice a year with a tablet--
you take six to seven years.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.210
But with the vector
control, you probably

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.080
bring it down to three years.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.620
Or two years to
control transmission.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.710
And then you can
continue treating

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.200
for the next, maybe, two years.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.790
And then you are done
with-- we are done.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.050
And this is how these worms
look like in the body--

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.280
in someone's body.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:45.300
The female worm is very long,
and lives for ten to 12 years.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.600
Now, if you have
all these people,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.730
and you take them to
health facilities--

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.365
medical facilities, the medical
facilities will get clogged

00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:56.610
and will shut down.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:02.340
So what we do is treat people--
train people, and treat them

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.450
within their communities.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.340
So they learn how to do it.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.610
They determine the
dosage, they record,

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.120
we provide the medicine, they
treat, and take the records

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.050
back to health units.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.220
And through the health
units, we get reports.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.950
And order for more tablets.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:26.020
And-- so this is
a teacher training

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.850
people in the community
under Mango tree.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.500
That's the way it should be.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.470
And that's where they
should be treated from.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.059
And we don't even use
scales, like in the hospital,

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.630
to determine dosage.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.409
We use a stick as a
surrogate for weight-- height

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.750
as a surrogate for weight.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.920
And doing research, we
realized that we could actually

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.200
let weight by height.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.550
And so using any stick
calibrated will do.

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.900
And we don't have
to pay for that.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.070
Again, when you come to
these local communities--

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.250
their neighborhoods,
you discover

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.100
that women get involved
and become very active.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.040
And so this is the stick at not
cost-- was got from the bush.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.840
We helped-- the supervisor
helped to calibrate it,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.970
he's also a village person.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.950
And they are treating
their own community.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.200
This is river
gauging to determine

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.880
the amount of chemical
you can put in the river

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.075
to clean the larval
stages of the black fly.

00:09:27.075 --> 00:09:28.450
I'll be showing
you the black fly

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.060
is a vector for this nematode.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.690
And this is how
they are using it.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.600
We don't need planes.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.940
Like, in the 70's, they
used planes, in West Africa,

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.550
to dose rivers with
this a bit, but now we

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.850
use knapsacks sprayers,
train the villagers,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.810
and they do it-- show
them how to do it.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.980
This is how beautiful
an environment where

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.210
Onchocerciasis, or River
Blindness looks like.

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.420
You are all invited
to come and visit.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.630
Especially, where
there's no transmission.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.640
It's beautiful country.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.350
And this is called Simulium
damnosum, a damn nuisance.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:10.030
It bites like a bulldog.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:16.620
And as it tears your
body, the nematode worm

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.040
gets inside your body.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.450
And this is how it looks like.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.500
The larval stages, and
when the debris, and what,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.580
in the rivers.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.640
And you can even see
the flies flying off.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.630
It needs a crab in
it's life cycle--

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.990
to complete the life cycle.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.740
I'm showing you these
flies because they

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.460
are vectors for the disease.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.250
And this is how you trap crab.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:51.860
This is a crab trapping device--
locally made by communities.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.050
Actually, you trap
mud fish with this.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.170
And now they have adapted
it to trapping crabs.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.100
And they use them
to monitor where

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.000
the transmission has
been interrupted.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.800
If they are clean then we know
there's no flies breeding.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:13.740
This is Uganda, and the
control, from 1992 to 2007.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.220
And Ugandans failed to know--
we must do something else.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.540
We cannot continue
treating endlessly.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.260
And in 2007, they launched
elimination as a policy

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.510
for the country.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.220
And see where we are-- all
these places are clean.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.600
Now I zeroed here because the
gentlemen here in the Google

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.950
gave me a Google image.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.270
Because we can't go across to
DR of C there is DR of C----

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.810
the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.470
And I couldn't prove that
there was-- Congo was free.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.660
Because you need the
forest for the nice fly--

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.850
the gold plated fly.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:01.540
You need the forest
that's where it survives.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.850
It's a shy [INAUDIBLE]
cord environment.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:10.560
This is what we have done--
Carter Center assisted

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.130
problem in the Americas.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.040
And our issue here, is here.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.160
This is the problem.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.670
But all these are green
areas-- you can see.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.310
So we are left with very little
in-- but very challenging

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.830
in the Western Hemisphere.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.860
And this is Ethiopia.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.830
All of this area is unmapped.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.540
Communication is difficult.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.620
But this area is mapped.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.500
So what is going in the
blue and yellow areas?

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.740
And we have started distributing
twice bi-annually the medicine.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.890
Here it's still control.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.300
And this area needs
some refinement mapping.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.540
No work is going on, and so
there's a lot of work to do.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.040
And if we complete
mapping, we will probably

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.500
have at least 60 million
people at risk in Ethiopia.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:14.830
Already where we are,
there are about 31 million.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:20.070
So the challenges-- we still
have vast unmapped areas--

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.740
especially where countries
have country-wide elimination

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.030
policy.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:29.170
And WHO will not to verify River
Blindness Elimination for just

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.120
a small place.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.170
They need to verify
for the entire country.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.140
And then we have cross-border
transmission issues.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.190
And for some countries,
mapping agencies

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.440
have not updated their maps.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.140
And we need this type of maps.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.100
And sometimes they're
not available.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.240
Where are the communities?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.090
Sometimes it's a
jungle, like the Amazon.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.430
Where are the communities
that are affected.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.020
Mapping Onchocerciasis
is warranted

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.860
when an area is inhabited.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:04.370
Because the human
disease-- we need

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:05.980
to find-- if there are humans.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.870
That's when we go
to the mapping.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.330
But if you don't
have the technology,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.290
you will go and find nobody.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.130
And you will have been
wasting resources.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.730
But if you have
technology and you

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.170
know-- you can tell that
there are communities,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.190
then you can go where
you-- where you already

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.550
know that there are communities.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.190
Technical Challenges--
clean image acquisition--

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:32.660
rivers, roads, forests,
homes, fields--

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.970
we want to be able to-- Because
it's associated with fast

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.540
running water, you need
to see white water.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.370
You need see, because white
water means way oxygenated

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:44.870
water.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:50.280
That's where the fly likes,
because of enough oxygen

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.070
for it's eggs.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.880
Cloud cover
penetration-- I will show

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.240
you some of the-- the
Amazon is an example.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.720
How do you penetrate the clouds?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.610
Distinguishing
communities from other

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.800
cleared areas of the forest.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.110
Distinguishing active from
abandoned Yanomami communities

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.205
in the Amazon.

00:15:11.205 --> 00:15:15.090
Are there features--
smoke, for example,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.240
characteristic over
an active community?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.150
Can we tell?

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.490
Penetration of the forest
canopy to extract signals

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.980
from the heavily
forested streams.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:32.720
In the case of some flies
like Simulium neavei--

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.300
the gold plated, which it
likes forest environment.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.260
How to get signals from
lower resolution-- more

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.610
cost effective images.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:43.920
What about cloud cover?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.420
Can we develop algorithms
to extract useful data

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.800
from images with
significant cloud cover?

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.360
Can we quantify the predictions?

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.320
Can we develop ways to
predict the sites that

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:01.860
will be the most
productive breeding sites?

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.540
Extension of this
approach, if we succeed,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.370
it can be used in many diseases.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.800
Especially vector born diseases.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.020
Here we call them NTD's or
neglected tropical diseases.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.740
So the potential
for this technology,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:28.180
if we can get to it, is--
the uses is limitless.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.470
Here in USA, can we develop
signals for chrysops--

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.000
spray deer fly.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.280
Breeding sites such
as soil moisture,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.120
and high organic content.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.240
And all these are
places that they

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.790
fly-- that the Deer
Fly will thrive.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:54.370
This is the, kind
of, Yanomami Village,

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:59.100
I don't-- if I'd call
it-- in the Amazon.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.940
Can we identified these?

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.479
Then, does Google have this?

00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:08.520
This is very interesting.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.380
The satellites collect
several bands of information.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.300
In each pixel examined, based
on the relative reflectance,

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.020
observes in each pixel
among the different bands.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.359
Spectral signatures
can be identified

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:27.530
that are diagnostic for
particular landscape features.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.120
And I will leave this
information for you

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.050
to go it in details.

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:35.600
And this is what the
pixel reflectance

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.940
looks like for the breeding site
of Simulium, or the black fly.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.390
Where we see this
pattern, reflectance

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.040
will predict that
the suitable breeding

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.050
site is the habitat for
the-- exists for the fly.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.630
And this is Damnosum,
the black-- they are all

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.060
called black flies, but one
is a black, another one's gold

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.830
plated-- so the black one.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.280
This is the satellite.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.840
What we did here--
we had applied

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.797
this to identify Simulium
damnosum breeding sites where

00:18:05.797 --> 00:18:09.420
the landscape
characteristic is fast

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.940
flowing water over
precambrain rock substrate.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.110
So the upper panel shows an
area in a satellite image,

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.980
of such a habitat.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.660
The lower panel is
a ground photograph

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.290
of the breeding site.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.490
And then, when we went to
this for ground truthing,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.340
we realized that the
precambrain rocks

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.160
seem to be the best habitat
for the breeding of Simulium

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.710
damnosum, the black--
the fly which is black.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.610
And the paper will be,
if you're interested,

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:45.820
it's already published.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.760
You can look at it.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.150
There are great uses
for all this stuff.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.810
And there are two
things I want show here.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:58.680
This is my-- this forest
is about 40 kilometers

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.810
from my home-- where I was born.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.890
It's a beautiful place and they
call it [SPEAKING UGANDAN]--

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.980
means leaving you speechless.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:16.026
So that is a Onchocerciasis,
or River Blindness, area.

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.190
Do you see this?

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.130
This is a-- called [? Bindi ?]
Impenetrable Forest--

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:22.010
a tropical forest.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.840
And this is the border-- this
is Uganda-- this is DR of C.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.120
How do I prove that this
forest-- Because you need

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.810
the forest for the
fly that's transmits

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:34.780
this disease in this
area, and I wanted

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.880
to show them that in
DR of C, the forest has

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.290
been disseminated, so
the ecology's gone.

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:45.900
So how do we verify
this as transmission

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.240
interrupted of this disease?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.670
And thank God, there
was Google around.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.990
And there was my friends here.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:00.550
And we're able to prove--
and the color-- this area now

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:05.530
has moved from transmission
active to suspected

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.950
interrupted transmission.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.610
Now, if you're talking about
the disease verification,

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.690
that's a big deal.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:13.870
That's a big deal.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.380
It means that now
you are free to go

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.370
to this place for tourism.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.370
This is a mount-- this is
where you find your mountain

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.620
gorillas.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.970
So-- you can promote
tourism here now.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.020
So let's go to the
next Google map.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.330
So we can-- using
these images, we

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.300
can actually be able to
see what is happening

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.040
across the board of where
we are not allowed to go.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.690
This is Venezuela
and this is Brazil.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.250
This is the Amazon.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:51.600
So those-- the challenges they
have-- already mentioned above,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.510
apply to this place.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.880
How can we make-- how can
we identify communities

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.630
that have never been identified?

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:01.390
But when you go to the Yanomami,
they tell you, oh, this

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.950
is not the only village,
there are more villages.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.920
But you know, for
them a day-- can you

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.890
quantify a day-- a day's
walk in terms of miles.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.316
We can't.

00:21:13.316 --> 00:21:16.740
And to get in here, they
are using helicopters

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.660
from the Venezuelan Army.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.214
And they go whenever
they have a reason to go.

00:21:25.214 --> 00:21:27.130
They don't go because
you want to go and check

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.490
on these Yanomami.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.100
So having good image we
can identify these places.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.640
We can go in and train
the Yanomami, provide

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.150
the medicines, and
everything they need.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:37.870
And treat them.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:41.990
And clear the Western
Hemisphere of this scourge.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.610
You can see-- for
Ethiopia, on this side

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.440
of the country we
have done pretty

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.200
well in mapping the area.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.360
But when it comes
to this area, which

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.330
is like half of the
country, we have challenges.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:03.470
And communication--
if we are to go here,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.520
you need to know
where is the road.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:08.640
Because in some places,
we did mapping--

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.510
like in the case of Uganda,
it was done on foot.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.670
The roads were impassable.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.680
Uganda had just come out of war.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.020
Everything had been
destroyed and neglected.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:22.850
And to map this disease,
70% was done on foot,

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:28.060
like the explorers
in the 15th century.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.450
But things have changed.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.130
You know, in 21st century
should we do that?

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.990
You just to go, spend a whole
week looking for communities,

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.720
and you can't find them.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.920
Yet when we use
these Google Maps,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.280
we can actually see where
the community-- active

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.590
communities-- where they are.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.660
We can see their fields-- where
they're growing some food.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.050
We can tell their
communities, and we can also

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.990
be able to see rivers.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:58.350
You can even enlarge and in this
area you will see some rivers.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.040
The images look so good now.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.225
But you can see the potential.

00:23:03.225 --> 00:23:06.560
Potentially, that
this is a high land.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.960
You can see the
gorges, the valleys,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.830
and you can see these in-- they
like to be fast running rivers.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.650
And then, if we can connect
with the communities,

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.950
we can figure out how
do we get to there.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.900
And you can plan ahead
what you need to do.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.930
Do we need to get porters to
carry your tents, and what not,

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.900
to go in and check
on these communities

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.350
to see whether they have
the disease, or not.

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:35.100
And then provide train--
provide them with medicines.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.250
So all of that stuff--
without Google Maps--

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.700
I don't know how we can do it.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.530
I mean we can do it, but
takes years and years.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.140
So those are the
challenges we have.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.100
These we have--
WHO has now agreed

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.660
that this disease
can be eliminated.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.060
We have the technology.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.330
We have the medicines.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:04.890
The technology from mapping,
I'm sure, is available.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.060
We have the army.

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.610
The army are the communities--
the affected communities

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:13.760
themselves.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.740
The army against this disease.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.120
So we have the political
will from these countries.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:28.581
So, I think what we
need is to get people

00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:32.270
who are interested in
this kind of technologies

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.820
to help us-- put
our heads together

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.200
and to get rid of
this age old scourge.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.310
Thank you very much.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:50.120
MALE SPEAKER 2: Are there any
side effects to the pills?

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.110
And could you give them to
people as a preventive measure,

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:56.220
even if they don't show
any signs of disease?

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.970
DR. KATABARWA: If they don't
show any sign of disease,

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:04.300
there aren't serious
side effects.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.560
However, there is
another disease

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.850
called Loa Loa, which
is in the-- no matter

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.030
in forested countries.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.600
And once you take Ivermectin,
you can get a severe reaction.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.880
But there are, also, ways of
managing the severe reactions.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.390
But for those who
have the disease,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:38.160
and have an active
immune system--

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.640
first time-- a few days, because
when you take the medicine

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.710
it lasts about
two or three days.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:48.650
So those first two days
can be really tough.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.800
Because, the medicine is
killing the baby worms,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.190
and your immune system is
reacting to the dead baby

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.750
worms.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.550
And therefore,
you'll get what we

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:08.680
call, localized or
extensive body sweating.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.500
And you also itch and
scratch-- by the way,

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.530
but you scratch for-- itch
and scratch for two days,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.310
and then you are fine.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.890
But this a disease-- one of
the symptoms is scratching.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.070
So people scratch day and night.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:28.470
They use stones or hot
water-- boiling hot water

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.550
and pour on themselves, so
they can stop the scratch.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.780
And it doesn't stop.

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:36.000
They use stones--
scratch and scratch,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.650
you bleed, you
continue scratching.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.350
So, it is worth it to scratch--
itch and scratch for two days,

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:45.862
and then you get
over it, than have--

00:26:45.862 --> 00:26:48.320
you know, your entire-- your
entire life you are scratching

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.194
and-- itching and scratching?

00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:51.610
MAKE SPEAKER 3: I
want to know, is

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.580
the end goal, the complete
elimination of the black flies?

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.020
Is that what you're
trying to achieve?

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.030
DR. KATABARWA: No, in some areas
which we have deemed feasible,

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.000
we have aimed at it, and
eliminated the fly-- especially

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.280
in Uganda.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.020
But our aim is really
not to eliminate the fly.

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.200
Especially, when
it's not feasible.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.820
But once we attack the fly,
we reduce its population,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.390
and it's capacity to transmit.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.940
So if you combine that
strategy with the medicine,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:30.480
we can actually get rid of the
nematode, one, which transmits.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:32.750
And once the worm is
going, then the fly

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.625
can thrive if it
wants to thrive.

00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:38.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: You mentioned
how useful spectral imaging

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.569
could be, and I
wasn't sure-- were

00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.360
you saying that you
found a reliable source

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.510
of spectral imaging
in these remote areas,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.442
or are you still
searching for a source?

00:27:46.442 --> 00:27:48.400
DR. KATABARWA: You mean
in terms of technology?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.899
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Right, the satellite

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:51.700
with extra information
in each pixel--

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.870
DR. KATABARWA: It
is damn expensive.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.840
For a small area, it's thousand
and thousands of dollars.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.810
And I don't think
Carter Center-- I mean,

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:04.720
we'll run bankrupt.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.520
So the study was funded
by the government of USA.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.310
And my colleague,
Professor Tom Unnash,

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.710
from the University of South
Florida, and other colleagues,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.210
did this study in Burkina Faso
in Uganda-- Northern Uganda,

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.180
and we found it works.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.040
But the technology
is very expensive.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.950
But suppose we study
other diseases.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:39.880
And is there a way of
reducing the expenses.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.620
Can we make this technology
less-- more effective,

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.920
but the less expensive?

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.220
That would be great.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.320
MALE SPEAKER 4: When
someone has the disease,

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.890
I see there's a lot of
different effects on them--

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.910
with the bumps, and the itching,
and then, the blindness.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.710
When they take the medicine,
do those symptoms go away.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:05.020
Does their sight return, or
are those permanent conditions?

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.490
DR. KATABARWA: Once
the-- you have--

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:14.110
because it's a progression
for visual impaired--

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.830
it halts vision impairment.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.760
So you don't proceed.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.460
You stop where you are.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:22.850
But if you're blind,
your remain blind.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:27.790
If you have the bad skin,
and of course, itchiness,

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:34.360
which really increases the
level of the rough skin.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.720
All of those stop, and you
can actually regain your skin.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.120
But if you have gone to a level
where how have hanging goins--

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.510
the skin is hanging.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.040
It has lost its elasticity.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.180
You can't recover.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.700
You just remain--
you get healed,

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.080
but you remain with that
issue throughout you life.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.680
And once you have leopard skin,
you remain with leopard skin.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.180
The nodules can go away.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.610
And actually, we
have found, where

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.800
we've been treating
the nodules which

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.940
appear on bony prominences--
your ribcage, around the groins

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.430
here, and sometimes on your
forehead-- those ones go.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.610
Because the worms
are so-- are dying.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:22.720
And therefore, there's no
more worms being retained

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.220
and growing up to
their adult stage.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.710
And the tragedy is that
the environment where

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.900
you find this
disease, is where'd

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:34.520
you would want to
build your home.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:40.610
And school attendance-- how
do you scratch day and night?

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.240
You get to a point where
you-- you lose your senses.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.760
You become irrational.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.290
That's the nature
of this a disease.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.030
Doesn't kill very
rapidly like HIV,

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:55.480
but as you walk-- If
you have this disease,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.240
you walk in San Francisco as
a dead body-- on the street.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.500
So that's how it kills you,
and keeps you walking around.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.700
So, is that the best way
of describing the disease?

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.280
That you don't-- it doesn't kill
you so that you are buried--

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.470
no.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:20.810
You can live up to even 60
years, 70 years-- but everyone

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.450
will reject you.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:25.460
You're a destitute in
your own community.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.650
You are scratching
and-- we say back home,

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.100
if you want to scratch
yourself, don't scratch yourself

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:35.090
before your mother-in-law.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.500
This is a disease
makes you scratch

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.110
before your mother-in-law--
shamelessly.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.380
So that's how bad
it's going to be.

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.679
[APPLAUSE]
