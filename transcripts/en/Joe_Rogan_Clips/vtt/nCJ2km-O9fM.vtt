1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.200
I got listed.

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.260
Tim Pool sent me this thing really next to Richard Spencer as being a far right.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:08.850
Influence it,

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.410
right influence far right was if they call me far right.
Amazing.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.970
I'm left.
They're liars.
I am fucking left.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
Did that ball,
you know socialist.
Yeah.
I consider universal basic income.

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.760
Have really good idea.
I want free college education could easy.

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.800
I would like to spend more in taxes.

9
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:32.750
If they could fix inner city communities and take these poor neighborhoods and

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.570
we spend a fuckload them spend more you fucking real promise.
Promise.

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.770
The more money you spend,
it doesn't mean that the problems,
money problems.

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.750
That's the price.
And you sign up.
I bet you look coming out of your pores.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.790
You Socialist.
Why don't you leave my country at 6% African?

14
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:47.730
So watch your fucking mouth,
dude.

15
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:52.731
No wonder it's so a compassionate compassion is everything.

16
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
But I think these people were too compassionate.
This is what the problem is.

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
They're like,
oh,
you identify as a Wood Elf.
Oh cool.
You're an Elf.

18
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.870
I don't want to,
I didn't.
You know,
whatever your feelings.
And here's the thing,

19
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.150
they're terrified of someone coming after them.

20
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.340
So they try to embrace the more preposterous,
the better.
Yeah.

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.290
Like they're having a real hard time now with this woman,
the congressman,

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.880
you know,
a who said a bunch of antisemitic shit,
who's going to ties stop.
Right.

23
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.780
And is really shit.

24
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.690
What is it antisemetic has she said anything bad about Jews and general,

25
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.330
the anti Israeli stuff,
which,
which I think you can make a distinction.

26
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.740
I think you should be able to,

27
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:32.340
I think you should be able to make an intelligent argument that there is a

28
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.260
difference between being not anti Israeli but having problems with their

29
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.300
policies and Jews.
Right.

30
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.890
Cause there are a lot of Jews that are critical of Israel as well.
100%.
Yeah.

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.900
So it's,
you know,
but sometimes to silence you and stop the argument.
I don't,

32
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.920
I'm not familiar with what she said exactly,
but I'm not either.
Yeah.
Um,
but,

33
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:57.750
but yeah,
but go on.
What were you saying about,
about uh,
the problem,

34
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.040
they don't know what to do with her.

35
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.400
They're stuck in this weird spot because they don't like,

36
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:06.630
here's a perfect example,
where was it?
Um,
was this,

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.110
so it was somewhere in Europe where,
um,
these,

38
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.140
this Muslim group was shouting down this LBGT demonstration and the like,

39
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.710
everybody's like,
oh well Jesus,
what do we do here?

40
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.770
We have to protected classes going to war with each other.

41
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.800
And one of them is shouting down.
The other one's saying that,
you know,

42
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.130
homosexuality is forbidden by God,

43
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.980
but then we're supposed to be protective of LBGT.

44
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.800
People were supposed to be open minded and progressive and allowing them.
But,

45
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.030
but then you have these people who are saying that it's their religion,

46
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.710
that they think that this is,
this is wrong.
And this is also a protected class.

47
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.630
You don't want to be Islamophobic.

48
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.390
So what does everyone do it where everyone stands back.

49
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.620
And this is one of the weird moments where people are standing back while Lbgt

50
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.890
people were getting absolutely crucified in the streets,

51
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.790
yelled at with bullhorns,

52
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.900
told her being they're sinners in a blasphemer that actually is part of free

53
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.840
speech,
right?
So sure.
So it's part of being able to organize and express herself,

54
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.510
organize in petition your government that's constitutional.

55
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:15.100
As long as you don't incite someone to violence,

56
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.540
as long as you don't say,
Hey,
you guys go kill those gay people over there.

57
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.310
I'm not talking about constitutionally,

58
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.830
I mean constitutionally I agree it is free speech.

59
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.990
But what I'm saying is there's no outrage.
There's no commensurate outrage.

60
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.260
Like there would be if say like white nationalists were screaming at these

61
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.160
people.
So,

62
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.820
so here's my issue with the far left or the left or even at,

63
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.140
I forget the right for a second.
I have my own issues with that.
But my,

64
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.910
what the progressive argument,
I always notice that the narrative is very binary.

65
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.190
The narrative is always,
uh,
so for example,
uh,
racism is the argument,
right?

66
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.080
So we need to get rid of racism.

67
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.650
I happen to think we could be as identical as penguins and we'd still find

68
00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.390
reasons to break into US versus them.
Well,
we'd have an ideological but off.

69
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.020
Of course we did look,
look at the Middle East.

70
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.220
If racism was the ultimate problem,
then you,
the Middle East would be fairly,

71
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.280
would be a fine Sunni's and Shia,
the Ebola new robot.

72
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.390
I mean I can keep going with,

73
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.420
with the be all kinds of people that look at the Dinka and the Nuer of the Sudan

74
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:17.260
sworn enemies.
They look exactly the same.

75
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.190
So human beings don't need to have different colored skin.
I couldn't agree more.

76
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:22.300
Yeah.
So so,

77
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.290
so we are tribal and it's fun to break into these US versus them.

78
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.850
I think that the biggest problem is,

79
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.380
is kind of deciding that first of all the Internet has made it very possible for

80
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:37.240
you to purify your echo chamber.
Yeah,
that's a big problem.
And,

81
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.770
and then you surround yourself with people who think and see the world exactly

82
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:42.610
like yourself.

83
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.960
And I think we get smarter when we listened to the other side of me.

84
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:50.170
If you don't agree with them because your ideas aren't working and their ideas

85
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:50.591
aren't working,

86
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:54.790
but put your ideas together and maybe somebody gets pregnant with a new idea,

87
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.830
you know the,

88
00:04:55.831 --> 00:05:00.831
the ideas that there's some way that you could stop all division between human

89
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:04.480
beings.
As long as people are allowed to express themselves,

90
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:07.100
they live unique and individual lives.
That's never gonna happen.
No,

91
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.520
you're going to have people that come from different parts of the world where

92
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:10.780
different things are more important.

93
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.870
You're going to have people that come from different economic situations.

94
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.130
It's going to be different.
I mean,
when,
when I say that I'm almost a socialist,

95
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:19.630
what I mean is like,
look,

96
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.500
there's certain things that we just accept that we need.
Like here's one.

97
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.030
You need a well funded fire department,
right?
Who's,
who's money?

98
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:31.240
Everybody would pooling all our money into that grind.
Right?
We agree with that.

99
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.470
We agree there's well funded public education.
You have to have that right.

100
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:37.300
While we barely do that right now,

101
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.380
but we do have that and teachers are getting fucked left and right.

102
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:45.670
They're getting minimal pay children or going to school in hazardous conditions,

103
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.720
but it's at least there's some money being pumped.
Police officers,
we agree.

104
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.530
So street fixing the streets.
We agree.
We agree on a lot of things,

105
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.080
but then it gets a,
certain things would go,
okay,

106
00:05:56.081 --> 00:05:58.570
well that's where we draw the line.
Well,
why do we draw the line there?

107
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.270
Why do we draw the line,
um,
with when it comes to community upheavals,

108
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.530
like fixing,
fixing communities.
Yeah,

109
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.680
I mean infrastructure like chip,
why did,
why,

110
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.850
why don't we have like,
why don't we,

111
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.940
if we really a team or if the United States really team,

112
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.070
why don't we look at it as a team in terms of equal allocation of resources to

113
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:23.000
solve conflicts and problems including crime.
We don't,
yeah,

114
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.920
right out of times the problem is isolating the source of the problem.
Right?

115
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.480
So people disagree on what the actual problem is.
I can give you examples.

116
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.370
I mean when,

117
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.590
when we talk about illegal immigration on what to actually do about it,

118
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.150
people are all over the board with it and they'll challenge your solution in

119
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:43.940
court and there's all kinds of steel nights,
which probably is a good thing.

120
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.000
So things don't get to,
they don't swing too far in either direction.

121
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.440
A universal basic income,
universal healthcare con control.

122
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:54.830
These are actually fairly complicated issues.
You know,

123
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.730
I don't want spree shooters,
you know,
but when you get down to it and,

124
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.420
and you hear people that are really educated on the subject of guns,

125
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.490
they can get you twisted up in an argument.

126
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.700
If you start talking about gun control because you realize this is a complicated

127
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:10.920
issue and maybe it's a mental health issue,
maybe it's a thousand issues,

128
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.580
certainly a mental health,
there's a lot of issues with it.

129
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:17.630
But the ability that someone has to do,
what is it?

130
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.230
Is it only one guy?
More than one person got arrested in New Zealand?
Correct.

131
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.310
Now I think it was just one guy.

132
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.030
They got arrested but only one shoot as far as I know.

133
00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.720
So the other ones were planning it out there,
maybe.
Yeah.
No,
I think he was dead.

134
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:32.960
Yeah.
But,
but my,
my thing is that point is that you have to be ill.

135
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.220
There no other way.
You do have to be mentally ill nor to do that.

136
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.820
Now I want you to think about the fact there's more guns in there are people.

137
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.990
So in this country alone,
there's 300 plus million people.

138
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:48.530
There's more than 300 million guns,
relatively speaking.

139
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.830
The number of mass shootings is incredibly small in comparison to the amount of

140
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.991
guns and the amount of sick people and how many people are sick who don't become

141
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.570
mass shooter.
Right?
It's a big number.
Yes.
It's very true.

142
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.680
Those are things in a lot of the gun violence,
uh,
that the left talks about.

143
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:10.400
A lot of those are suicides.
So a lot of it.
Yeah,
a lot of that as suicides,

144
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.120
a lot of it is cops shooting bad guys.
A lot of his people defending themselves.

145
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.460
And then after that you have gang violence.
But so,
so,

146
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.350
but the problem is that when people argue,

147
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:22.550
they make these things very simplistic and they're not,
you know,
even the,

148
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:24.410
even identity politics.
I mean,
you know,

149
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.660
straight white males are essentially the enemy.

150
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:31.010
So the idea would be if we take straight my white males out of the equation,

151
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:34.640
because this is all power,
right?
It's all talking to Amy Schumer millions.
No,

152
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.260
but I know I'm not.

153
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:40.580
But this tyrannical hierarchy and stuff as if you took white males and took all

154
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:43.740
of them out of the equation as if there wouldn't be a new hierarchy.
Yeah.

155
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.330
That's fucking new code.
You know?
It's just the way shit happens.
People,

156
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.570
when you try to make things really equal in a communist society,

157
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.230
the people closest to the government making decisions,
they become the new elite.

158
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.330
So you're not going to fucking know,
avoid that shit.
Yeah.
