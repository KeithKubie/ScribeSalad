Intro
There's never been a better time for fans

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.030
of blockbuster movies, with more and more
movies raising the stakes, raising the budgets,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.160
and competing to top the box office.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.810
Some massive movies are on the way, which
means more behind the scenes secrets any movie

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.970
buff will want to know in our latest rapid
fire dose of trivia to Know Your Movies: 30

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.160
Mind Blowing Facts About New Movies.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.540
Suicide Squad
Batman appearing the movie makes perfect sense,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.619
given most of the villain's come from his
line of comic books.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.649
But Ben Affleck will actually make history
as the first actor to play Batman for two

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:37.840
different directors.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.670
The live action Harley Quinn is sporting a
new costume.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.670
But according to star Margot Robbie, the costume
department actually made versions of her famous

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.839
jester suit, and the skirt and corset made
famous in the Batman: Arkham series.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.879
They didn't make the cut, but there's always
the sequels!

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.440
Wonder Woman
Fans got their first look at the Wonder Woman

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.079
cast thanks to a photo in Batman V Superman
- but the connections don't end there.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.579
Look closely in Wonder Woman and you'll be
able to catch surfeit Zack Snyder playing

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.719
a soldier

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.080
The similarities between DC's Wonder Woman
and Marvel's Thor are obvious.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.920
But things got weird when actors Liam Hemsworth
and Alexander Skarsgard were considered for

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.590
Steve Trevor - Liam's brother plays Thor,
and Skarsgard's father plays his close friend.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.590
Weird.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.430
Beauty &amp; The Beast
Never underestimate nostalgia: in its first

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.270
24 hours on YouTube, the trailer for this
film clocked over 91 millions views, smashing

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.110
the records set by Captain America: Civil
War and even Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.610
The movie is famous for its unforgettable
songs, but when the director went through

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.259
auditions he surprised each actor by having
them sing "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.259
instead.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.120
According to him, it was just to confuse them.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.479
Who says directors can't have some fun?

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.770
X-Men: Apocalypse
The movie finally sees star James McAvoy shave

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.009
his head to match Patrick Stewart, but fans
might miss another detail: his wheelchair

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.469
is the exact one used by Stewart in the original
X-Men films, bringing the series full circle.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.899
Stan Lee teased that his trademark cameo in
Apocalypse would be something special, and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.600
it is - he doesn't appear alone, but alongside
his wife Joan of fifty years.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.179
How's that for romantic?

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.010
To get the villain's voice as inhuman as needed,
ator Oscar Isaac was brought in to re-record

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.390
all his dialogue, with a bass mic on one cheek,
and a bass drum mic on the other, with all

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.270
three mixed together in post.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.920
Captain America: Civil War
In the movie, Falcon gets a new gadget in

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.640
the form of a recon drone called Redwing.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.140
It's a more believable version of his pet
bird from the comics, which he could use to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.480
scan the battlefield telepathically.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.590
The studio made sure to show off star Chris
Evans biceps holding back a helicopter in

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.250
marketing, but the reason audiences had never
seen something like it is because of how unnatural

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.880
a pose it is in practise.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.540
So unnatural Evans ended up suffering some
injuries to his arms as a result.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.560
It's not an optical illusion: Captain America's
tshirts really are too small for him, on purpose,for

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.600
obvious reasons.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.150
But over the course of filming, they have
to get even smaller, since star Chris Evans

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.400
will always lose weight and size due to the
rigorous schedule.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.290
The Avengers: Infinity War
The movie will be action packed, but audiences

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.170
will also get to see it all in IMAX, since
it's the first no-documentary to be filmed

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.170
entirely in the format.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.190
Fans got the first glimpse of the Infinity
Gauntlet in Odin's trophy room, but when the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.400
one belonging to Thanos was the other hand,
they thought the studio had made a mistake.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.090
But Marvel Boss Kevin Feige shot it down,
confirming there is more than one - hopefully

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.090
for a good reason.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.830
Warcraft
Although some members of the cast have admitted

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.230
to be completely addicted to the online game,
star Travis Fimmel claims he had never actually

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.650
heard of the global sensation when he took
the job.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.230
Typical Alliance.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.700
Ninja Turtles: Out of The Shadows
Believe it or not the first version of the

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.240
movie didn't include fan favorite Casey Jones.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.670
It was only when producer Michael Bay insisted
he be worked into the plot that the filmmakers

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.140
came up with a solution.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.950
Fate took over from there: not only was Arrow
star Stephen Amell able to find time to play

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.560
the part, but he literally went from wrapping
Arrow season 3 to filming Turtles the next

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.670
day.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.840
Finding Dory (Pixar)
Although over a decade has passed since Finding

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.060
Nemo, the sequel is only set six months later.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.210
That meant a new voice actor was needed for
Nemo, since the original actor is now 22.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.530
Feel old yet?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.560
The movie originally followed some marine
life in a SeaWorld-esque Park, but after Pixar

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.919
executives saw the 2013 documentary Blackfish,
the story was changed to remove some questions

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.560
of animal cruelty.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.820
Independence Day: Resurgence
An Independence Day sequel was actually feedlot

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.460
and paid for following the original, which
would have followed Will Smith's character's

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.880
stepson fighting aliens in space.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.100
But writer Dean Devlin didn't like his work,
and actually returned the payment.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.639
His character may be level headed, but Jeff
Goldblum was anything but while filming.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.490
Aside from singing songs to his castmates
and demanding harmonies, he would even pass

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.620
out plays for the cast to perform between
takes I'm an effort to pass the time without

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.790
getting bored.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.880
That's actually not even surprising.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.930
Star Trek Beyond
It was long rumored that the first draft of

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.310
Star Trek 3 included an on screen reunion
of the original Kirk and Spock.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.939
But while the studio waited to see if Shatner
would agree, Leonard Nimoy passed away, and

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:12.009
creative changes meant a completely new story
would be told.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.530
How's this for weird: every single Star Trek
villain in the rebooted series is now ALSO

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.949
a Marvel movie hero.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.430
Eric Bana played The Incredible Hulk, Benedict
Cumberbatch is playing Doctor Strange, and

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.629
Idris Elba plays Heimdall, Gatekeeper of Asgard
in Marvel's Thor series (alongside Chris Hemsworth,

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.830
who played Kirk's father).

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.400
What are the odds?

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.879
Doctor Strange
Actor Mads Mikkelson being cast as the villain

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:38.199
makes him the third man to portray a version
of Hannibal Lecter before joining a Marvel

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.199
movie.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.699
Brian Cox first played the role in Manhunter
before joining X-Men, and Anthony Hopkins

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.659
made him famous before joining the Thor series.

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.330
The Disney ownership may play a bigger part
in Doctor Strange that you'd think.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.289
While the magic has been said to draw on The
Matrix and Harry Potter, the cinematographer

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.900
turned to Disney's Fantasia for the visual
flourishes.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.160
Fantastic Beasts
Author JK Rowling claimed to be done with

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.330
Harry Potter's world when the movie series
ended.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.449
But when the president of the studio took
her to lunch, they walked away with a new

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.449
trilogy in the works, and Rowling claiming
it never would have happened without his pitch.

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:11.540
Must have been a good lunch.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.749
Rowling has claimed that there's no overlap
between Fantastic Beasts and Harry Potter,

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:20.129
but thanks to one Easter egg in the Prisoner
of Azkaban, Newt Scamander did, indeed walks

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:22.710
the halls of Hogwarts during Harry's years.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.599
Even though he was technically dead.

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.289
OR WAS HE.

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.830
Rogue One
Since the movie is set before the original

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.479
Star Wars, Rogue One's costume designer has
hinted that fans looking closely may spot

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:38.479
some of the original costumes made for the
1977 film, back in action.

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.300
Fans will finally get to see a younger version
of Mon Mothma, the leader of the Rebels played

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.770
by Genevieve O'Reilly.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.349
But the actress played the part already - all
her scenes were simply cut out of the prequel

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.610
trilogy in editing.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.500
It wasn't a Hollywood screenwriter or George
Lucas who thought up the premise of the movie,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.810
but John Knoll, the ILM visual effects supervisor
who worked on the speckle editions and prequels.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.759
When he started to think of spinoff storied
he'd like to see told, the result was a 20

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:04.080
minute pitch that became Rogue One.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.180
