00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.630
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, hello, everyone.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:09.660
My name is Chris Chabot and we're here for
the social web fire site chat.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.060
We got quite a lineup here today, superstars
here within Google who are working on the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.060
Social Web.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.060
We're missing one.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.200
He's gonna be joining us pretty soon but I
figured we'd start with a general introduction.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.670
So if you'd like to all introduce yourself
let's start from left to right.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.390
So DeWitt, if you wanna kick it off.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.910
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Hi, I'm DeWitt Clinton.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.200
I'm an engineer.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.079
I work on a number of different products in
our developer focus area and a lot of that

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.469
overlaps with Social.

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:42.789
I'm also a prolific Buzzer and if you go to
my Buzz feed right now, it's -- you can find

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:49.650
it at profiles.google.com/dclinton -- I started
a thread of people asking questions and you

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.839
can feel free to use that to ask
questions and I brought my laptop up and I'll

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:51.839
be reading it.

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:52.839
So.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:53.839
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I'll take that.

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm Joseph Smarr.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.449
I'm a Social Web engineer at Google as well.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.449
Joined in January.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.660
Previously I was CTO at Plaxo.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.750
So I've been working on open standards and
interoperability for the Social Web for a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.660
long time and very excited about where we've
gotten, where we're going.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.930
&gt;&gt;Todd: My name is Todd Jackson, I'm a Product
Manager working on Google Buzz and Gmail.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.970
&gt;&gt;David: David Glazer, Engineering Director,
been working on different social things at

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.820
Google starting with Open social a couple
of years ago.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.440
&gt;&gt;Sami: Hi, I'm Sami Shalabi. I'm an engineer
on the Google Buzz APIs and Google Friend

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.760
Connect.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: And if you have one moment. [Laughing]

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.050
Then we have our final guest of today.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.050
Drum roll, please.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.460
&gt;&gt;Joseph: He switched into the same shirt.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.370
&gt;&gt;Chris: Introduction.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.640
&gt;&gt;John: Hi. John Panzer, working on Open Specifications
and on the Buzz APIs.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Mr. Salmon.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.770
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah. Mr. Salmon, amongst many other
things. So the format today is pretty casual,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.710
like fireside chats are.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.970
I'd like to remind you if you have any questions
if you could please step up to the microphone,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.280
otherwise we're gonna have to repeat them
and we'd like to start up with just an open

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280
round.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.569
I'm sure that after all the social stuff we
talked about these days you're gonna have

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.989
a lot of questions either about Buzz or general
strategy or anything else.

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.670
So this is the time to ask them.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.790
So who'd like to start?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.519
Ah. Or I can come to you with a microphone.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.909
It's okay.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.700
&gt;&gt;Manish: Hello. I'm Manish.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:45.020
I work at OTN Entertainment on the social
platform we are building and then I noticed

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.230
in both days, yesterday and today, that no
one is mentioning Open Social at all.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.230
So I wanted to see what is Google's strategy
with Open Social going forward?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.230
Thank you.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.459
&gt;&gt;Chris: David, I think that's a good question
for you.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.459
&gt;&gt;David: Sure.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.299
Actually, the session I came from right before
this was a session on Open Social and Open

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.329
Social in the enterprise and some of the attraction
there and

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.900
two days ago there was an Open Social meet
up that was hosted by MySpace in the city

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.939
with a -- good.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:14.939
Good.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:19.389
I would have been there but I/O and the good
thing about scheduling that with I/O is many

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.569
people were in town, bad thing is that many
of us who were busy with I/O weren't able

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:24.569
to attend in person.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.559
But Mark and I were very involved in the planning.

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:32.140
So Google strategy with Open Social is to
continue to use it in all the appropriate

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.829
places Orchid obviously is heavily, heavily
using Open Social, iGoogle is using Open Social

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.500
for all the applications that run on iGoogle,
the various APIs that the wire APIs where

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.040
it makes sense for them to be aligned like
PoCo, portable contacts, are a part of Open

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.260
Social and part of the Buzz APIs.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.040
So the core underlying standards that Open
Social and the rest of the Social Web are

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.019
built on around OpenID and OAuth continue
to be driven pretty hard.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.040
So the strategy is continue to use it everywhere
it makes sense, which is a bunch of places,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.650
and continue to work with all the other folks
who are using Open Social, and other relevant

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.430
standards to keep the standards moving towards
 – towards the ball and keep the ball moving

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.489
towards the standards.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.340
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah, I might just add that, uh,
opening up the Social Web is a

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.040
Multi-pronged approach.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.550
There's a lot of different aspects of identity,
and sharing, and on-site, and offsite, and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.550
so forth.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.540
So anyone who's followed this space for a
while knows it's a somewhat messy and frothy

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.100
cacophony of different overlapping standards
but they all are aware of each other and trying

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.780
to play well together and I think that's actually
good because ultimately it gives developers

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.950
a lot of flexibility in terms of building
blocks that they can mix and match together.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.390
So you see, for example, OAuth being used
with Open Social, RESTful APIs, and Discovery

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.390
DOC.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.490
I mean, they're all very interrelated and
I think that's a healthy thing that's going

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.490
to keep evolving.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.170
&gt;&gt;David: I actually wanna add one point that
comes up when we have this

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:59.500
conversation internally and it really brought
home when we were chatting about it how quickly

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.250
things are evolving in the space of the Social
Web and two and a half years ago when Open

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.530
Social was first introduced by the set
of companies that the -- that defined that

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.090
standard, the hottest thing in the
Social Web was running applications inside

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.180
somebody else's site and – and putting social
applications inside a web site and that was

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.320
the coolest, hottest, bestest thing.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.600
And it was.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.870
And that, now, is one of many interesting
things happening on the Social Web and it's

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.740
far from the middle of the action.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.950
It's just -- it's one of many important things.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.250
So the technology that the – that the Open
Social standards community and -- and the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.790
Shindig implementation has invested most heavily
in really nails that problem and anywhere

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.390
that – that somebody is trying solve that
problem, whether it's in the classic social

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.420
sense it's something like Orchid in a sort
of extended sense in somewhere like Linkedin

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:58.041
or somewhere like iGoogle whether it's, whether
it's more in an enterprise space which is

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:03.040
the analogous thing where something like Atlassian
has re-factored their entire suite of development

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.350
tools based on Open Social.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.180
Anywhere that that is the problem, that is
the answer.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.000
But the social web has become bigger than
that one problem.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.120
So the set of answers is bigger than that
one standard.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.660
&gt;&gt;Chris: And we have one question in the Buzz
as well that was kind of related to it.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.210
What are your experiences with implementing
these fast-moving standards compared to implementing

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.750
standards coming out of the standard bodies?

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.790
Have there been a lot of interoperability
issues?

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.900
Are you having difficulties landing on the
right spec version?

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.150
&gt;&gt;Sami: As we were implementing the Buzz APIs,
one of the things that was apparent is there's

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.640
a lot of good movement in this standard space
but the standards are still young.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:49.450
And we're trying to build something that is
 -- is immediately useful to people so that

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.010
they can do very interesting things with the
 -- with the Buzz infrastructure.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:02.400
However, we've had to introduce additional
extensions to the existing standards and one

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.390
of our goals is to try to remove every proprietary
extension to these standards so that it allows

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:17.640
anyone to become a -- a -- a core component
or a core player in the -- in the Social Web.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.730
[pause]

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.010
Cool.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.190
Any questions?

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.290
[pause]

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.470
&gt;&gt;Chris: Anybody?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.712
We go on back here.

00:07:29.712 --> 00:07:30.712
If you can walk up to the microphone.

00:07:30.712 --> 00:07:31.712
[pause]

00:07:31.712 --> 00:07:34.270
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: I was just wondering if
there's any plans for us to see some of these

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.640
social applications within the new Google
TV framework.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
Good question.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640
Interesting.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.640
Who wants to take it?

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.970
&gt;&gt;David: I -- let me -- how -- how many people
in the audience are thinking of building apps

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.970
for Google TV?

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.970
[pause]

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.150
&gt;&gt;David: How many of you think you might build
some social features into those apps?

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.150
[pause]

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.150
[laughing]

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.150
&gt;&gt;Chris: There you go.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:55.150
[laughing]

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.920
&gt;&gt;Joseph: That's one of the advantages of
building on the web as the platform is, is,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.610
does Google TV support OpenID?

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.610
Yes, it does.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.610
Why?

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:03.610
'Cause the web supports OpenID.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.180
I mean, I think that's actually kinda nice
that we didn't have to do anything special

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.180
to make that work.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.180
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.180
Next question.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.180
[pause]

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:16.110
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, while you think about it, I'll
take one from the Buzzes we've been getting.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.110
What are the benefits of using these open
standards?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.850
Do you find that it's more difficult?

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.850
Are you slower going?

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:27.430
Having troubles coming up with specifications
with the community?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.080
Are there benefits to doing open or would
a closed system be better?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080
[pause]

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.090
&gt;&gt;David: Yes to all of the above.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.090
[laughing]

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.600
DeWitt: That's a saluting question, Chris.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.000
Chris: Yeah, I know.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
DeWitt: No.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.140
We hate open here; right? I know.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:47.490
So the decision was made really early on with
Buzz to, to go all in on -- on the open side

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:48.490
of this.

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:54.750
I mean, I think for everybody here, there's
a desire to see what we're doing in Buzz,

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.960
what we're doing in Open Social, implementable
literally by everybody.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.510
So it should not be a Google thing.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.630
So even if it was a little more difficult
and in some cases it is actual actually a

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:16.940
lot more difficult toimplement to a community-lead,
openly-licensed spec, it's an investment that

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.900
we're willing to make and we feel like we
get more out of it by investing up front and

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:27.410
saying, hey, let's do Activity Streams, let's
do PoCo, let's do Media RSS. Knowing that

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:35.140
what we'll end up with is a – a network
of sites and implementations rather than just

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.180
Google.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.290
So harder, yes.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.290
Worth it, absolutely.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:45.310
I don't think anyone up here has any regrets
about this strategy.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.330
So.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.340
[pause]

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.390
&gt;&gt;Joseph: We do get benefits from it too,
right?

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.460
For example, take something like OAuth 2.0
which is being worked on right now as sort

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:59.250
of a next generation way of accessing private
data securely and it's a lot simpler for developers.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.700
There is lots of really smart people outside
of Google who worked on that.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.392
We obviously have been working on it too and
so we get all the advantage of that insight,

00:10:05.392 --> 00:10:08.600
all of that field experience, all of that
trial and error.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.020
And, of course, all of the developers who
start using OAuth maybe to work with the property

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.940
other than Google and then they come to Google
and realize they already know how to build

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.000
that, especially since all those plumbing
layers tend to be the hard part to get right

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.080
and it's not the fun part.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.000
The fun part is what you build on top of it
and so I think we absolutely see the benefits

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.960
of it as well so that's why I think it's worth
investing.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.610
I mean, no one would think today to set up
a web API that wasn't over HTTP.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.871
It seems sorta silly to ask but in a way that's
kind of what we're building for the social

00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:34.871
era.

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:37.080
&gt;&gt;David: I agree with all of that.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.450
The one -- one thing I wanna as add is 'cause
there were a couple of different threads in

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:45.960
that question as asked, is the -- there was
a -- there was a comment about standard and

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.200
there was a comment about interoperable and
I -- I wanna say that at least in my opinion

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.540
one of those is very clearly a means and one
is an end; right?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.270
The end is mass -- is the maximum choice in
interoperability.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.000
That's the goal, right?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.750
And it just so happens that the best way that
I know or that I've seen in any industry to

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.100
allow maximum choice in interoperability is
open standards 'cause everyone knows what

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.630
to build and everyone knows that if they build
it they'll be allowed to use it and you need

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:19.190
both of those to be true. And if -- and the
goal is, get maximum interoperability which

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:20.190
is maximum choice.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.380
The means is open standards and that's the
best way we know to get there as an industry.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.380
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.380
Thank you.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.620
We have a question.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.850
&gt;&gt;Bill: Hi.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.710
My name's Neil.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.839
The Twitter library of Congress deal, that
was the gift that was announced on the 13th

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:41.880
of April kinda got my mind reeling about long-term
data retention. I understand that it's open

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.050
and everybody agrees to the terms of service
that our stuff's right out there but that

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:51.890
type of deal could not be facilitated without
a lot of money and a lot of resources on one

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.110
side and the other.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.270
So I guess I -- I was wondering if you could
speak to -- particularly on the Salmon protocol

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.440
 -- if you ever thought of maybe an expiration
tag, something that will allow an author,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.780
at the time of publishing, of posting that
data, to put an expiration on it.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.990
And second -- second of all I guess -- I think
about these things in terms of robots.txt

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.500
for web crawlers and that there's a no index
no follow convention and that's on a per page

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.570
basis, not just in the robots.txt file as
a metatag.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:28.100
I -- I just -- I wanna kind of revisit that
idea that there's a possibility this data's

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.700
retained forever and that necessarily wasn't
the intention and then the value of that data

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.420
beyond the real-time now traveling into stale,
actually, does not – no longer serves a

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.881
purpose or could serve a different purpose
in the future for the author than it was in

00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:44.750
the context of the real-time to interact.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:45.750
[pause]

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.750
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:55.450
&gt;&gt;John: So I'll give a quick answer about
Salmon and hand it over -- there's a bunch

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:06.361
of questions in there. So I think that Salmon
is extensible and you

00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:08.950
can put a lot of additional metadata in there
and a potential thing might be a, like, newspapers

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.640
have this as stale after X date and we're
going to ask you to remove it after X date.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.660
The one thing about putting data out to the
universe is that once you broadcast it out,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.660
you can't be guaranteed anything.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.660
&gt;&gt;Bill: Sure.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:18.660
&gt;&gt;John: I mean, that's sort of obvious, right?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.750
It's like sending radio waves into outer space
they're out there potentially forever.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:26.300
But you can have signals that tell people
how to be polite and how to do the useful

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.770
things with your data, and the services that
are well-behaved, if you come to an agreement,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.870
they can honor that.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:38.610
So the protocols can allow that, you can come
to agreements and then it's up to the services

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.180
to, to act on this.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.273
And I think you had a bunch of other questions.

00:13:43.273 --> 00:13:47.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think that we can summarize part
of his question to one of the things that

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:52.209
Joseph Smarr and DeWitt Clinton both I think
have a strong opinion about, who owns that

00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:53.209
data?

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:56.339
Who gets to make the choice of how long it's
retained?

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.070
&gt;&gt;John: One sole comment and then I'll hand
it over to Joseph is that I think users should

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.070
own their own words.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.270
I've worked on blogger for a long time.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.980
I very strongly believe in that.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.430
And they should be able to make these decisions
in a fully transparent way, whatever the outcome

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.430
is.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:14.020
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I think one of the things is -- and
it's a very complex issue, obviously and I

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.959
think I'll throw it over to Todd to talk about.

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:21.149
To me, when I hear that what I think of is
one of the things that's weird about technology

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:25.760
and the communication technology today is
this thing between ephemeral technologies

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.730
and things that last, that stand in the written
record has been very blurred, right?

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:32.700
And we see this all time where people use
e-mail very ephemerally and it sometimes sticks

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.779
around and gets pulled up in legal discovery.

00:14:34.779 --> 00:14:35.950
Or is chat IM -- does that get logged or not?

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.649
Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't and
why should – is calling on the phone now

00:14:39.649 --> 00:14:44.339
or transcribing voice calls are, like -- and
people end up hopping into different technologies

00:14:44.339 --> 00:14:49.089
because they have these different idiosyncratic
properties but really that notion of permanence

00:14:49.089 --> 00:14:51.209
being per medium is kind of orthogonal, right?

00:14:51.209 --> 00:14:59.370
It's more how does the technology work and
what policies are around it?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:20.750
And that seems like somewhere where we think
about a lot in the context of Gmail where

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:36.400
it's sort of sometimes synchronous, sometimes
asynchronous, sometimes ephemeral, sometimes

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.420
permanent.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:45.320
And so that must be something you guys have
to think about in general, and ditto with

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320
Buzz.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:55.330
&gt;&gt;Todd: In general, with Gmail, Gmail was
founded on the idea of users

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:05.410
want to store everything for as long as they
want to store it and they shouldn't be forced

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:16.149
to delete it or have to separate from the
thing -- the data that they've produced for

00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:25.529
any silly or artificial reason.

00:16:25.529 --> 00:16:38.580
I think it is a complex issue and I think
John hit it on the head when he said, if you're

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:56.360
producing data that's in the public sphere,
it's in

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.100
the public sphere.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:14.560
There are hints and ways that you can tag
it to say here's how I intend it to be use.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:27.569
I think it's a really sort of elegant solution
and we'll see sort of how it -- how it plays

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.569
out.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.569
Yeah.

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:33.270
The spirit is that the user -- the user owns
their data and can hold

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.510
onto their data, or export their data as much
as -- as much as they'd like.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.880
&gt;&gt;Bill: And I guess that's why I'm asking
the question is to hopefully encourage you

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.750
to think about long-term data retention because
we were just at

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:49.059
the cusp of this now and, we're launching
applications and I mean, I -- I was sitting

00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:53.060
listening to Chris Messina talk and also the
PubSubHubbub talk and the amount of data – they're

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.490
pushing more data than Twitter's pushing?

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:03.030
And so again it's a tiny little piece of metadata
and robots.txt is not a law.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.820
We just obey it because it's a good thing
to do.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.870
And I'm hoping that maybe I can encourage
you guys to think about what can we do that's

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:15.820
good for the people because the providers
don't wanna do it because, I mean, there's

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.490
great things that we can do business value
wise for that data to have it long-term retained

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.809
but for the users, I just want you guys to
think about them.

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:26.809
[pause]

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:27.809
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank you.

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:29.299
&gt;&gt;Todd: Great question.

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:30.799
&gt;&gt;Chris: Next question.

00:18:30.799 --> 00:18:32.679
&gt;&gt;Bud: I'm Bud Gibson.

00:18:32.679 --> 00:18:40.799
I'd like to advocate for a question in DeWitt's
Buzzstream which is, when are we gonna start

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:46.929
to see Buzz-Salmon integration and maybe more
broadly when are we actually gonna see Salmon

00:18:46.929 --> 00:18:47.929
doing something?

00:18:47.929 --> 00:18:50.080
I'm really enthused about the whole idea.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.030
Chris: I love this question.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.970
DeWitt: I posted the question.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.970
[laughing]

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.970
'Dear DeWitt.'

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.090
Chris: You're to ask for it as an audience
member.

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.730
Joseph: I have this friend –

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.730
[laughing]

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.010
John: So I think this is a great question.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.570
And I -- thank you.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.410
And, yeah.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.720
And so very enthusiastic about Salmon and
Buzz integration and, I'm obviously -- I'm

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:30.460
Mr. Salmon, I'm working, working on this and
it's something that we hope to do in the -- in

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.860
the future I can say that.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.120
We don't have schedules but we're very, very
interested in that.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.120
Yeah.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.120
&gt;&gt;Chris: Excellent question.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.120
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I think I would say I think we're
proud that actually other companies have implemented

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:52.820
even more quickly than we've been gotten around
to.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:20:01.679
We've been working on the specs in I/O and
we demoed this yesterday at our Virginia Islands

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:07.850
talk that it clicks set and status net and
others all have this federation, and then

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:08.850
that's awesome.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.650
'Cause ultimately one of the questions came
up before I was going to say is, you know,

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.590
is this hard work?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:27.140
And one of the things is that almost all of
these standards we're working on, there's

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:41.220
not a whole ton of code that you have to write
to implement them.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:49.360
It's much more around what is the right interface
and what are the right building blocks.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:56.570
And that can be hard to negotiate 'cause this
is all pretty very complex and subtle stuff

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:10.530
but the total amount of code that you have
to write is usually quite small.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:25.510
We've all tried hard to work to make these
as developer-friendly as possible.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:39.230
So
it's neat when people can take a good idea

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.860
and just implement it in a day and, we're
trying to move as fast as we can but it's

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:51.390
really cool to see people moving even faster
and it's great to see that enthusiasm.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.390
&gt;&gt;John: Yeah.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:58.720
I just wanna note on the Salmon side it's
been great to get the immediate feedback about,

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:06.570
oh, this is very easy implement on all these
other platforms that I'm not working on and

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:12.690
this is -- this -- this particular thing was
hard to let's change it quickly.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:20.000
So that immediate feedback is very, very valuable
and it -- it may mean that the protocols change

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.700
a little bit but it makes them much, much
better and so it's an investment that I think

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.980
pays off very well.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:40.790
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And, the one other thing I'd add
to that is I guess, what, Buzz is about a

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:45.090
hundred days old right now, which is in some
ways incredible, right?

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:51.240
It's a very, very new product and when we
launched it we made a promise, maybe overpromised

00:22:51.240 --> 00:23:01.320
but we wanted to reach for it which is that
when we built an API for this we're going

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:11.840
to build it around a number of protocols,
they were actually outside Google's control,

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:19.210
so we said we are going to build this around
Activity Streams, we're gonna build this around

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:24.650
PoCo, and Media RSS, and PubSubHubbub, and
OAuth, and Atom, and AtomPub and just sorta

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:29.250
promised the world and, that's a -- that's
a gutsy thing I think to do as a company 'cause

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.840
of course that landscape can change on us.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:46.039
So here we are a hundred days later and yesterday
we launched the first iteration of the public

00:23:46.039 --> 00:24:07.390
Buzz API and it supports PoCo, and AtomPub,
and Atom, and OAuth, and Activity Streams.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:14.490
We haven't implemented Salmon yet.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:27.049
It -- it is our plan and hopefully we can
 -- we can live up to all those promises that

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:30.250
we made early on.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:49.570
So, I'm actually amazed and I know it's Sami
and his team's work that -- that built this

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:55.549
API and I'm a big fan as a user of it.

00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:56.549
And so.

00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:57.549
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

00:24:57.549 --> 00:25:03.710
John and I checked in just enough code to
get the shirt.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.710
They did all the hard work.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:06.710
[laughing]

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.710
[pause]

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.120
&gt;&gt;Chris: So just to mix things up a little
bit, I'm gonna ask a question where I kind

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.179
of know the answer already but we're hearing
it a lot at the Google I/O.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:16.970
What is the difference between Buzz and Wave?

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.760
And I think Todd, you can do a good job at
explaining this.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.370
&gt;&gt;Todd: Buzz and Wave are, are two products
that are good for communication and sort of

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:34.430
different flavors of communication I would
say.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:41.730
Wave is a product that's -- that's very, very
good for collaborative, working

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.940
environments and people working on -- on things
together.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:53.790
I think Buzz has a little bit more of a sort
of social and sharing flavor to it.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:26:03.390
It's integrated into Gmail which is a -- which
is a place where people are sort of talking

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:06.620
and chatting and sharing things already.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:14.810
So I think it's sort of a strategy of Google
saying, we're gonna invest in two products

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:23.230
that are both communication products but sort
of different flavors of communication products

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:40.390
and seeing how users use them; what are
the ways that they're interesting and different

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:41.390
from one another?

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:49.890
&gt;&gt;Chris: And going down the road, do you see
a point where they would become more integrated?

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.640
&gt;&gt;Todd: It's certainly something that we're
open to. Yeah.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:04.160
And in fact, the two products while they don't
share code they do borrow a lot of ideas from

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.580
one another.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:14.450
So
one of the things that you saw when we did

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:23.320
the version of inbox -- what we call "inbox
integration" in Buzz where you get these sort

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:31.400
of live e-mails that come right into your
inbox, people comment on them and they sort

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.180
of drop down in real time right in place.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:41.910
So some of these -- some of the ideas -- things
that we saw happening in Wave we moved over

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:42.910
to Buzz.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:43.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: Awesome.

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:45.330
Anybody's got anything to add?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.710
DeWitt, you looked passionate for a moment.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:48.710
No?

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:49.710
[laughing]

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.710
Okay.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:51.730
What's going on around social network federation?

00:27:51.730 --> 00:28:00.220
And I think that kinda touches on Salmon but
it's a bit of a wider question when you think

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.940
about identity, relationships, pictures, everything
else.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:10.480
So it's a very open question so anybody who
wants to dive in and give their opinion.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.480
[pause]

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:20.800
I don't know how many of you were able to
come to the talk that John and I gave yesterday

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.380
on bridging the islands but I think, besides
getting to see Chris Messina's awesome artwork

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.380
 -- look for it.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:31.270
If you haven't seen it, it's really cool.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:37.480
I think that metaphor is one that really resonates
for us and we've actually talked about it

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:47.650
since the days of Open Social that, you first
need to be able to get a bunch of islands

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:52.870
speaking a common tongue and then you can
bridge those islands and really let people

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:58.400
live and travel wherever they want and have
it just work.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:08.010
And the metaphor we were trying to go for
in our talk was that if I go move to a new

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:15.200
physical location, I should still be able
to stay in touch with my family and friends

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.240
and I should still be able to share rich information
with them.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:26.740
You shouldn't feel impoverished because you
want to go live in different places and that

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.900
 -- that feels like the right way for the
Social Web to evolve.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:37.080
It's -- obviously it's how e-mail has evolved.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:50.090
You can use one e-mail provider, I can use
another one.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.970
It's how cell phones work.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:30:03.080
It's how a lot of these communication technologies
work and -- and that allows for that innovation

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.580
and that user choice.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.809
And so, that's why, again, open standards
interoperability really make that possible

00:30:08.809 --> 00:30:23.750
if
I can show up and say, hey, I've already got

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:29.850
an account here with OpenID and OAuth.

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:37.100
If I can use WebFinger and say, here's where
else my stuff lives.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:44.000
If I can share information richly with PubSubHubbub
and Activity Stream so I don't have to dumb

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.169
it down or slow it down to go between sites.

00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:55.240
If I can then participate in conversations
even when I'm not in the same place as you

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.270
using Salmon.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:05.490
These technologies all are bridging the islands
and that, I think, is going forward exactly

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:09.720
how we wanna keep things going.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:19.960
&gt;&gt;Chris: So I'm gonna combine this with one
other question we've got in on the Buzz stream

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.260
and that is, when is Buzz gonna support OpenID?

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.809
&gt;&gt;Joseph: In which direction?

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:25.750
&gt;&gt;Chris: As a login option.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.090
&gt;&gt;Joseph: As a relying party action.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.970
I mean, that's -- that's definitely the direction
we're trying go.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:34.350
As we've said in the past, Google actually
already is -- you're talking about being an

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:45.029
OpenID relying party which is, say, in coming
with one of your existing accounts, we already

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:57.460
have to do this with a lot of our enterprise
customers because we run apps for your domain

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:05.330
on lots of domains that often have their own
login systems.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:15.730
And so obviously there are a lot of complexities
associated with that but we've been trying

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:23.520
to really eat our own dog food there and figure
out how to make that work and of course I

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.289
think it has a tremendous application in the
consumer space as well.

00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:28.289
[pause]

00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:34.520
&gt;&gt;Chris: Anybody wanna walk up to the microphone
or shall I take another one from the Wave

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520
or Buzz?

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520
[pause]

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520
&gt;&gt;Chris: Ah.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.549
We got a question here.

00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:40.549
Cool.

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:41.549
[pause]

00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:50.620
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: This is a question on the
namespace situation. I think it's still the

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:58.039
case that if I open a Buzz account, I'm either
gonna reveal my Gmail address or I'm gonna

00:32:58.039 --> 00:33:01.299
have this giant number that nobody understands.

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:03.150
So how's that moving?

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:09.659
And also, any clarification on finally moving
Buzz out into its own stand-alone product

00:33:09.659 --> 00:33:11.049
separate from Gmail?

00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:13.380
&gt;&gt;Todd: Both really good questions.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:14.380
So yes.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.530
Buzz currently does use the Gmail namespace.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:23.160
We thought that was the best way to start
things off and it makes sense that I own a

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:29.391
certain name in the Gmail namespace and I
wouldn't want to lose it, right, and to have

00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:31.960
someone else to come in and claim it.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:36.240
So we're still working on some of the issues
that have to do with that but we've heard

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.100
loud and clear that people -- the long stream
of numbers at the

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:46.429
end of your profile is not what people want.

00:33:46.429 --> 00:33:54.860
They want a name that's friendlier and easier
to see so we're trying work on that.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:01.299
And your second question was on a stand-alone
Buzz site outside of Gmail.

00:34:01.299 --> 00:34:03.251
That's also something we're definitely interested
in.

00:34:03.251 --> 00:34:12.100
We've heard loud and clear that people want
to come and try this product and they don't

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:18.480
necessarily need a new Gmail address in order
 -- they don't want a new Gmail address in

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.240
order to do that so it's something that we're
working hard on.

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.240
[pause]

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.240
&gt;&gt;Chris: Chris Messina, you have a question.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240
[laughing]

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.240
&gt;&gt;Chris Messina: Yeah.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240
Hey, guys.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.830
So I'm actually curious in terms of the relevancy
stuff that you guys do in Buzz right now.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:37.399
How's that gonna appear in the API or will
I be able to dump a bunch of stuff at it and

00:34:37.399 --> 00:34:39.490
use it in my own apps?

00:34:39.490 --> 00:34:45.760
Because one of the things that's interesting
on the one hand, of course, is you get this

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.820
Activity Stream of all this stuff in chronological
order.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:58.680
On the other hand, my experience in the Buzz
App has a bunch of condensed stuff and things

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:05.650
that I imagine are gonna be made more relevant
to me over time based on different signals.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:15.220
So how can that experience I guess be made
portable for other people to embed in their

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.340
external apps?

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.720
&gt;&gt;Todd: That's a really good question.

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:25.910
This is something that actually we're in the
middle of making many, many changes and improvements

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:26.910
to.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:36.030
So today the way that it -- Buzz works when
you view it inside Gmail is that it's sorted

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.420
by the last comment time.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:44.230
So any time someone leaves a new comment on
an item it jumps back onto the top.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:51.460
And the reason we did that is because we really
like the conversational nature of Buzz.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.430
We want things -- the items to be engaging
and involve conversation.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:36:00.370
We are in the process of re-thinking that
some.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:07.210
One of the things that we really want to do
is, is we want conversations to come back

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:10.810
up to the top when they're interesting to
you.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:15.490
So because somebody that you're following
left a new comment, because the combination

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:19.760
of activity that many people have done on
something makes it significantly interesting

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.510
to pop back up to the top for you.

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:29.700
So I think you'll see a lot of development
and sort of what we call -- we call this "bumping"

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.800
and "personalized bumping" and it's something
we're gonna explore a lot in the future.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.310
While also -- another thing that we've heard
from users is, I just want the purely chronological

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:39.450
view by post time stamp.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:46.490
So we want to also give -- offer, like, multiple
ways to view the Buzz stream, sort of slice

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.520
it and dice it.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.640
And you'll see these corresponding changes
are happening into the API.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:58.500
But this is an area of really -- I think of
strong interest from the Buzz team.

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:05.390
It's something that we're passionate about
and it's something that you'll see us explore

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:06.390
a lot.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:07.390
&gt;&gt;Chris Messina: Thanks.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.390
Chris: Cool.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:10.710
We have another familiar face with a question.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:11.710
[laughing]

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:12.890
&gt;&gt;Robert Scoble: Robert Scoble.

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:18.310
I keep thinking about malleable social graphs
and the first one that showed me that -- the

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:27.119
power of that is foursquare because if you
check in here, you only see people who are

00:37:27.119 --> 00:37:28.119
near here.

00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:32.690
Now, take that and there's two different pieces
to this question.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:40.320
One is, when are you gonna hook up to the
other data silos in the web, like foursquare,

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.500
like tripIt, like other things that I'm showing
the web by my behaviors.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.720
My liking behaviors across the web, not just
on Buzz.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720
That's one problem.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.740
And another problem is, how am I gonna discover
new people based on their expertise?

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:58.280
For instance, if somebody's visited four barbecue
places in Austin, they've automatically set

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:04.859
themselves apart from the crowd and become
an authority on Austin barbecue and I might

00:38:04.859 --> 00:38:13.910
want -- if I'm going to Austin or if I wanna
talk about barbecue, I only wanna hear from

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:14.920
those people.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:24.339
I don't wanna hear from the rest of the people
who have no freaking clue about barbecue,

00:38:24.339 --> 00:38:25.339
right?

00:38:25.339 --> 00:38:34.200
And who haven't demonstrated the system that
they're an authority and credible on barbecue.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.750
How are you gonna build this malleable social
graph to both let us discover new people and

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:42.280
see content only from people who are authoritative
and credible on -- on the world?

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:46.040
&gt;&gt;Joseph: So I think the question was, do
I like barbecue and the answer is, yes.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.040
[laughing]

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.040
&gt;&gt;Joseph: No, I –

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.040
[laughing]

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.011
&gt;&gt;Chris: So how could Robert discover you?

00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:59.839
&gt;&gt;Robert Scoble: Are you credible on barbecue,
and if you are, I wanna see your, like.

00:38:59.839 --> 00:39:01.140
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Right.

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.140
Right.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.670
I'm a credible consumer of barbecue.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:13.630
&gt;&gt;Robert Scoble: But if haven't been to four
barbecue places, don't show me your thoughts

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.630
on –

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.630
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Totally.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.660
I -- I very much agree with everything you
said.

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:28.720
When I talk about bridging the islands, one
of the things that -- not only is it so let

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:39.190
users have choice to use the tools that they
want but it's so that individual tools can

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:44.780
really special in individual social experiences.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:57.020
I think foursquare is a great example of something
that, by being its own experience, it can

00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:07.210
really nail that experience and I actually
choose to associate with a different set of

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.930
friend on foursquare than I do on the other
tools I use.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:20.500
But of course I want that to then enrich the
rest of the things that I do.

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:31.150
And that's honestly it's just something that
for us has been very early days but that's

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:42.510
absolutely the -- the -- the payoff of allowing
all these different sites to flourish.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:55.070
You wanna make it really easy for me to go
to a place like foursquare and quickly sign

00:40:55.070 --> 00:41:03.869
up and find my friends and so forth and then
to use all that check-in history of me and

00:41:03.869 --> 00:41:06.950
my friends to inform me back on Google.

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.619
It'd be nice to see it on Google Maps and
everywhere else.

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:18.390
So that's the one thing is that I think absolutely
the more that there's two-way data flows,

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:19.590
the way everyone wins, really.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:25.440
And then the second point was using that not
just based on my current social graph but

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:30.270
actually based on interest and authority.

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:37.400
I don't have anything particularly smart to
say about that.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:40.260
Maybe other people can.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:50.970
But I guess that I would point out that by
making the data open, one of the things you

00:41:50.970 --> 00:41:57.690
let people do is re-mix it in different ways
like that.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:09.400
So maybe Buzz is gonna have one way of presenting
data to you and that may or may not be appropriate

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:20.839
to try to pivot on other axes but if the data's
available, other apps can try to do that and

00:42:20.839 --> 00:42:37.920
I think you've seen a lot of that in the Twitter
ecosystem where they'll take it and provide

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:45.551
a completely different view that's not based
on time line but it's based on keyword or

00:42:45.551 --> 00:42:52.150
based on a set of people or location and I
think that's a great example of the kind of

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:56.230
innovation you can unlock when you let the
data free.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.150
&gt;&gt; [Asking question in the background]

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.590
&gt;&gt;Chris: So just to repeat the question so
YouTube picks up on it as well,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.590
Twitter has lists as a solution.

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:04.970
Do you consider doing something similar?

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.970
&gt;&gt;Todd: Yeah.

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:12.970
The feature request of some kind of filters,
or lists, or groups, something along those

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:21.210
lines is something that we've heard often
and that we're thinking about it and working

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:22.210
on.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:26.560
Also, just one of the things you mentioned
is just the ability to see what you've liked.

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.960
In Buzz, you can't -- I can't see what Robert
Scoble has liked.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.160
That's a feature that we're launching very
soon.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.559
Hopefully like next week or so.

00:43:36.559 --> 00:43:38.180
&gt;&gt; [Asking question in the background]

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.180
&gt;&gt;Todd: That's correct.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.180
Yeah.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.180
So I think -- yeah.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180
Interoperability is -- is –

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:48.619
&gt;&gt;Joseph: You can imagine pulling those images
APIs for that stuff.

00:43:48.619 --> 00:44:03.470
In theory, all this stuff should flow and
you should be able to aggregate it all together.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.990
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: We just call those activities, right?

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:12.090
The action of liking some entity is an activity
and then, as we develop protocols like Salmon,

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.540
those activities can be federated.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:22.220
So you could imagine a world in which starring
something on twitter or liking it in Facebook

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.800
gets propagated to you on whatever network
you're on.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.200
&gt;&gt;Joseph: It's also a good use case for Activity
Streams, right?

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:36.000
Right now, almost all of the syndication between
web sites is just RSS and atom which really

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.609
don't have innate notions of things like location
or liking and Activity Streams do.

00:44:41.609 --> 00:44:49.150
That's exactly the kind of richer semantics
you want so that I know that a geo located

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:56.099
check-in can be on any service and I can still
aggregate it

00:44:56.099 --> 00:45:01.060
around a map or that it's a like and I can
aggregate that, or it's a shared

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.060
link, or it's a photo.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.870
You don't have to do a custom integration
on a per-site basis.

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:10.530
&gt;&gt;John: And, to follow on that, one of the
benefits to users of going and doing all these

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:17.359
things and building up this data and making
it open in some cases just totally public

00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:22.700
is that they built up a reputation and the
fact that they -- this stuff is actually linkable

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:35.280
to each other is a feature in these cases
because you can -- you can build up a reputation

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:40.240
as the best person to talk to about barbecue,
and it doesn't matter which service it was

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:46.000
that you used and it really shouldn't because
if you built a reputation somewhere, you should

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.441
be able to carry that.

00:45:47.441 --> 00:45:49.720
It should be a portable reputation.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.720
[pause]

00:45:50.720 --> 00:46:00.500
&gt;&gt;Sami: One additional point I'd like to add
to that is, I mean, we're in a space where

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:12.190
the -- we have a theories on what the answers
are going to be and if you have ideas or things

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:25.640
that you wanna build based on the social infrastructure
that -- that we're building and it's -- and

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:32.420
what we're building isn't -- doesn't make
that available, it'll be great if you reach

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:41.710
out to us so that we can figure out ways to
make -- to help you build these very new innovative

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:46.430
use cases because not all innovation is going
to come out of Google.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:52.869
The beauty of – of having APIs is that everyone
participates in -- in innovating in this space.

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:54.970
So please reach out.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.010
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:57.060
Next question.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.109
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yeah.

00:46:58.109 --> 00:47:02.300
I feel, like -- first of all, thanks, guys.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:10.010
And it's terrific work and it's great to see
all of the new improvements as well in the

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:11.010
progress.

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:20.020
But I feel like there's an elephant in the
room and it's about to hit 500 million users.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:27.589
Where are we around Facebook and Facebook
Connect and Open Graph?

00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:28.589
Right?

00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:35.180
Would Google -- would you guys ever think
about putting a Facebook Connect button on

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.180
your sites?

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180
If not, why not?

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:42.770
How -- how could all of the work that you
guys are doing also inter-operate well with

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.900
this enormous monster that's down the road?

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.900
[pause]

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.710
&gt;&gt;Chris: Who wants to take it?

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:54.380
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah. Yeah, no. It's -- it's obviously
a great question and it's -- it's one where

00:47:54.380 --> 00:48:00.420
I think there is a lot of good news.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:09.310
I mean, Facebook's gotten very involved in
a lot of work on open standards and there's

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.790
just this internet identity workshop this
week which has been kind of the grass roots

00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:20.550
place where a lot of us get together and work
on these things and Facebook's one of the

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:25.210
most active and forward-thinking participants
and they -- they -- in fact they shipped OAuth

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:31.461
2.0 as their authentication mechanism for
all their new Graph API stuff even as it's

00:48:31.461 --> 00:48:36.619
still in draft they were one of the first
to ship Activity Streams or in their feeds.

00:48:36.619 --> 00:48:47.880
So anyway, there's a lot of different issues
to work out in a lot of different dimensions

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:55.380
but I think it's just great to see that the
platform keeps opening up, it keeps getting

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:01.290
more liberal, and it keeps operating for more
of these interoperability scenarios to take

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:02.290
place.

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:03.730
I think it's a very positive direction.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.730
[pause]

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:05.730
&gt;&gt;David: Thanks.

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:07.980
I'd also add that there are Google apps that
 - today, like YouTube, that are well integrated

00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:11.930
with Facebook and do auto sharing to Facebook
so, where there are some product by product

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:15.810
choices about wherever it makes the most sense
for users.

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:22.010
I -- I'd also say that, the -- the -- the
elephant in the room, the story of the eight

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.930
blind men and the elephant.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:30.160
Facebook in the area of social, there's many
different aspects and that's why there are

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.160
many different answers and many different
parts of it.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.650
And you asked about the Open Graph API but
you actually probably meant the Graph API

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:44.910
which is much less open than the Open Graph
API and it covers a different part of the

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:49.170
space and they're both interesting things
but there's a large -- a large set of details

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:50.630
to talk about.

00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.630
[pause]

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:56.110
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: One other thing I'd add to that.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:57.110
David's absolutely right.

00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.420
There is actually no Open Graph API.

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:04.550
There is a Open Graph Protocol and a Graph
API.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:11.800
But speaking of open things, I mean, it's
definitely in Google's best interest to work

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:17.210
with Facebook, work with twitter, work with
all of these, these elephants to figure out

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:20.100
what the common protocols could be.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.240
What other things could we build?

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.390
Could we build an open connect?

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:25.770
Could we build an OAuth?

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:26.770
An OpenID?

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:31.359
And use all of us working together to help
make the web itself more social.

00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:35.950
I don't think ultimately Google does very
well if we get everybody implementing only

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.250
a very strictly Google-branded version of
this stuff.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:45.030
We do much better when the entire web is implementing
the same connect protocol because that's in

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:50.440
our interest and, and I honestly believe it's
in, twitter or Facebook's best interest to

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.230
do this as well.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:58.430
We'll go out of our way to work with 'em on
these things.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:59.430
[pause]

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:06.240
&gt;&gt;Chris: Could you expand that a little bit
why it's in our best interest?

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:10.900
&gt;&gt;David: What's good for the web is good for
Google.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.900
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Yeah.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:12.900
It is so simple.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.080
I mean, our business was born on the web.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.210
It will be on the web forever.

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.530
The web is much, much bigger than Google.

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:24.740
The web is much bigger than Facebook.

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:28.020
And to the extent that we can continue to
grow the web, Google as a business does well.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.610
Plus, I think a lot of us here just personally
believe that.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:33.390
It's not just the business.

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:37.430
Like, we wake up every morning going, hey,
I wanna fight for this.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.690
Like, this is exciting.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:43.210
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah. I was gonna say, it motivates
a lot of us personally is just, like, it's

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.900
a lot better as a user when your stuff works
together, right?

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.611
I mean, whether that's your TV and your MP
three player or your social networks.

00:51:47.611 --> 00:51:49.970
And particularly for social networks it's
communication.

00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:52.650
Everybody's doing different things in different
places.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:59.940
And so it would drive me nuts if I could only
call other Sprint users on my phone, right?

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.890
Or -- or only e-mail other Gmail people.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:06.599
I mean, actually, that's the way e-mail used
to be.

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:08.890
They had to invent the @ symbol, right?

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:09.890
Right?

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:22.680
I mean, 'cause people were, doesn't it suck
that we can't e-mail these people at Berkeley

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.480
from Stanford?

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.819
And like talk about the big game.

00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:26.819
[laughing]

00:52:26.819 --> 00:52:34.680
&gt;&gt;Joseph: So I think we each have to remember
how early we are in this space and how much

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:39.300
turnover there already has been in terms of
marketshare, and new

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:48.849
companies coming out all the time and I don't
see that stopping at all and I

00:52:48.849 --> 00:52:54.540
wanna use social on a zillion different web
sites and have it all work.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:04.089
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: One thing I just wanna add to that
is you say how early we are but how far we've

00:53:04.089 --> 00:53:05.089
come.

00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:06.760
I mean, it is amazing.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:12.950
I mean, if you think back just a couple years
ago you had AOL, or Friendster.

00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:18.900
These sites didn't federate or talk to each
other at all.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:25.030
I don't know if they had APIs.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:39.859
It was not -- you couldn't possibly do it
and now we're at the point where we have these

00:53:39.859 --> 00:53:40.859
incredible container formats.

00:53:40.859 --> 00:53:42.810
We have Atom, and AtomPub.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:48.000
We have a notion of expressing these activities.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.099
We've invented WebFinger.

00:53:50.099 --> 00:53:52.200
We have PubSubHubbub.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.010
Activity Streams are real.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:54:05.609
Like, in -- in just a couple of years we've
gone from zero interop in the social space

00:54:05.609 --> 00:54:10.260
to it's almost working, and big pieces of
it already are working.

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:17.260
So if you look at the trajectory -- and I
love looking at trajectories.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:26.359
It's not where we are now, it's where we were
six months ago or a year before that and where

00:54:26.359 --> 00:54:35.670
can we predict we're going to be? In a very
short amount of time, we will have this Holy

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:41.680
Grail of, like, I should be able to mention
Joseph, on a completely different network

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.210
from Google Buzz.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:48.960
It should just work and I predict that that's
 -- that's very, very close.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:55:01.990
&gt;&gt;Chris: And I'd like to ask for a quick expansion
of that to tie it into a question we had on

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:10.319
the Wave and that is, how do you feel the
Buzz launch has affected this situation?

00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.319
[pause]

00:55:11.319 --> 00:55:14.400
&gt;&gt;Chris: How do you feel that launching Buzz
has driven this forward?

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.220
Has it affected the development of the open
and social web?

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.550
Has it done a lot of good for these protocols?

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.089
Is it a good use case?

00:55:22.089 --> 00:55:23.780
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: It changed everything.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:24.780
[laughing]

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:25.780
&gt;&gt;Chris: All right.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:26.780
Yeah.

00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.780
[laughing]

00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.780
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: Well, it -- okay.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.780
One, it's a social network I like and -- no.

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.109
I mean, I think it opened up a new opportunity
for saying how do we do some long form communication.

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:33.740
As a product even I think it was -- and I
can say that 'cause I didn't work on building

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.420
the product itself -- I'm saying this as a
fan.

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.720
I think it's a very good product.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:43.150
What I do think maybe drew a line in the sand
was we are going to build the API around -- for

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.150
Buzz around open protocols.

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.079
We'll take that risk, we'll embrace that challenge
and I do think that raises the bar.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:54.330
I think it forces other companies to maybe
justify why they wouldn't use a open protocol,

00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:56.740
if we've proven that it can be done.

00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.740
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.680
I think it's also just much harder to innovate
from arm's length so I'm really glad we had

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:00.680
this question saying, hey, when are you gonna
ship Salmon?

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:01.680
I mean, how would we ship Salmon if we didn't
have Buzz?

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.680
Right?

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:03.680
So I think it's really good to actually have
a platform where you have to work all these

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.680
things out and I think -- and the point is
we've taken a strategic attitude from day

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.420
one that we want this to be one of many islands
that are well bridged so that it can be great

00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:12.950
but it can kinda do what it does and, and
everybody benefits.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:13.950
[pause]

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:14.950
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:15.950
Next question.

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:16.950
[pause]

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:20.780
&gt;&gt;Audience: One of the questions I have, and
I'm not certain it's even a programmable question

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:25.190
which makes it difficult, is that when I think
about just the way I interact with people

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:29.599
in the real world, I might be friends with
perhaps this person over here and I really

00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:36.400
respect his opinion about coding for example
but I think he's a complete idiot when it

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.400
comes to health care.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.780
And over here, this guy also knows him and
they agree on health care but they don't agree

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.780
on coding.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:50.280
So it's like for myself, it's like for politics
and stuff like that --Republican versus Democrat,

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.920
people have different people that they respect.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.200
So the person who's gathering the most global,
shall we say status around health care may

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.200
be someone I say, no.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.200
I want to actually do a not operation.

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.080
Or anything that he recommends I wanna exclude.

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.850
&gt;&gt;Chris: Mm hmm.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.099
&gt;&gt;Audience: And -- and with the social space
it seems like just that one party or another

00:57:07.099 --> 00:57:11.550
party can kind of pollute the tag space if
you will and dominate the conversation.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.650
We saw that on Digg with all the Ron Paul
fans.

00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:21.109
And -- and it just seems like there -- there
needs to be a way -- as much as we wanna talk

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:24.319
about private versus public it seems like
there needs to be, like, a series of publics

00:57:24.319 --> 00:57:25.319
if you will.

00:57:25.319 --> 00:57:26.550
And the thing I liked about Wave is the idea
of a federation models built into Wave and

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:32.490
it seems like there needs to be some sort
of federation model built into how we talk

00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:37.780
about not privacy per se but how far we want
the information to spread.

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:38.780
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.880
I think that's a valid question.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.000
I think there's actually a few questions in
there.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.809
It's how should these trust relationships
be federated between different services?

00:57:45.809 --> 00:57:52.450
And the other question I heard is, should
you be able to express these trust relationships

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.930
and have 'em reflected in the servers?

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:58.579
&gt;&gt;Todd: Well, the part of the question that
I really found interesting and something that

00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:05.550
I think about every day and that the Buzz
team is -- and Google in general is passionate

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:08.089
about solving, is an information problem.

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:14.350
Thinking he's an expert in one thing and she's
an expert -- she's an expert in another and

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.090
wanting to see that perfect stream of information
where you see the stuff that you find incredibly

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.119
relevant and known, and known and interesting
experts and things.

00:58:17.119 --> 00:58:19.480
I think those are the kinds of problems that
Google needs to solve.

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.480
&gt;&gt;Audience: Or experts defined by me, not
 –

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.480
&gt;&gt;Todd: Exactly.

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:22.480
Exactly.

00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480
Well, in that it's personalized and that you
see the information that you care most about.

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.680
And so I think we're -- we're very, very early
in this space but that -- that kind of information

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.570
problem is the kind of information problem
that gets people at Google really, really

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.570
excited.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:28.570
So it's something that you'll see us working
on.

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:29.570
I can't really say more than that.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:30.570
[pause]

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:31.570
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:32.570
Thank you.

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:33.570
Next question.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:34.570
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yeah.

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:35.570
I wanna bring up kind of I think a related
point to what he just described which is I

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:36.570
actually have different personas.

00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:37.570
I think I have four or five twitter logins
and they do very different things, okay, and

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:38.570
I interact with completely different people.

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:39.570
I interact with a different set of people
on Buzz than I do on twitter, any persona,

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:40.570
and I interact with yet another group on Facebook.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:41.570
Facebook is the gym buddies, and friends from
30 years ago.

00:58:41.570 --> 00:58:43.609
Buzz seems to be people thinking about social
networks and oddly, twitter is internet marketing.

00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:46.090
So, and so I'm doing that and I'm sort of
thinking now that I've been doing Buzz for

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.280
a while I -- I've been sort of thinking, well,
this is actually more of a medium than a place.

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.960
To be perfectly honest with you, I think of
Facebook as a place.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.960
Buzz seems to be more of a medium.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.960
Have you given any thought to this issue,
which is, I'm actually multiple people, and

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.859
 -- and at times I -- the people I interact
with would like for me not to be gym bud when

00:58:54.859 --> 00:58:55.859
I'm talking about social networking.

00:58:55.859 --> 00:58:56.859
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think we have a good question here.

00:58:56.859 --> 00:58:57.859
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

00:58:57.859 --> 00:58:58.859
I think all of you asked good questions.

00:58:58.859 --> 00:58:59.859
[laughing]

00:58:59.859 --> 00:59:00.859
All right.

00:59:00.859 --> 00:59:01.859
I'll leave that one as an exercise for the
reader.

00:59:01.859 --> 00:59:02.859
[laughing]

00:59:02.859 --> 00:59:03.859
&gt;&gt;Joseph: You're absolutely right.

00:59:03.859 --> 00:59:04.859
And one thing -- this is a common I think,
the thing we have to be careful when we talk

00:59:04.859 --> 00:59:05.859
about that the ability to link together your
profile and sources of data doesn't mean you

00:59:05.859 --> 00:59:06.859
should have everything all into one big lump.

00:59:06.859 --> 00:59:07.859
Quite the opposite.

00:59:07.859 --> 00:59:08.859
It actually gives you the freedom to be as
fragmented or unfragmented as you wanna be

00:59:08.859 --> 00:59:09.859
and right now the problem is everything starts
out completely separate.

00:59:09.859 --> 00:59:10.859
So for example, this is something that comes
to my mind a lot, when I come to a conference

00:59:10.859 --> 00:59:16.590
like Google I/O, I run into a lot of people
that I've met before and it's actually kind

00:59:16.590 --> 00:59:21.640
of a neat feature of the brain that, I like,
can remember that I met them before, maybe

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.800
in a different context, and then make a decision
based on the current context and my prior

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.800
relationship whether I wanna also engage with
them here or engage with them differently

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.800
and maybe I'll talk to Google employees differently
than old friends, versus colleagues etc.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:31.800
But the point is, there's a link there.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.800
It's not you're a completely new opaque identifier
in a new data base and I have to start from

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.800
scratch.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:34.800
And I think that speaks to Robert's point
as well that he asked earlier.

00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:35.800
You're gonna wanna develop these nuances and
so you're gonna to want to have that fluidity

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:36.800
of not being afraid to go someplace else and
start over but still bring in maybe I wanna

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.950
know who I know on this site and then choose
not to share with them or maybe I do wanna

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:41.250
be -- have completely separate accounts that
aren't linked together at all and that's fine,

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:42.250
too.

00:59:42.250 --> 00:59:43.250
And actually right now because there aren't
good ways of linking accounts together, sometimes

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:44.250
people have to resort to these more heuristic
methods and that's actually -- that's when

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:45.250
privacy lines can get crossed, right?

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:46.250
Where you didn't want things to get correlated.

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.250
But if you have an explicit way of saying,
here's how I want things to be correlated,

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.250
then it's much more explicit that when those
aren't there, you don't want them to be correlated.

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:52.270
So I think that's actually going to help both
sides of the industry.

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:53.270
[pause]

00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:54.270
&gt;&gt;John: Just one other -- one other thought
about this is, it's not only what you want

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:55.270
or what you decide.

00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:56.270
It's also what your friends decide.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:57.270
So if your friends have decided they're gonna
be on Facebook and they're doing internet

00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:58.270
marketing on Facebook but you wanna be social
on Facebook – on Facebook, that's kind of

00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:59.270
a problem.

00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:00.270
It's -- it's hard to make this work and when
you're since it's actually two ways and so

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.270
I think that having some -- having a mechanisms,
especially common mechanisms, that let users

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:02.270
decide, let people decide how they want to
present themselves to the world and not how

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:03.270
to be tied to the service is really important,
especially as – as everybody gets on these

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.270
services and people start to use them for
slightly different purposes.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:05.270
I don't think that the services can all align
with everybody's social desires.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.270
That's -- I don't think it's actually possible.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.270
I think they can -- they can help people present
themselves the way they do in real life where

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.270
they have real social connections and they
can make intelligent decisions.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:09.270
[pause]

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:10.270
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And just one thing that I think
underlies what John's speaking about is what

01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:11.270
we all need to do, not just Google, is, is
provide users the tools in which to both develop

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.270
these social spaces and also understand what's
going on, on the web.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:13.270
So you think about the different networks
and how they're linked.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.270
We need to surface that and make that relationship
transparent into empower the user to make

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:15.270
smart choices.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:16.270
We always want them to have informed consent
when -- when they participate in these environments

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.270
and, what's interesting about it is, I would
actually rather -- I hope this isn't too controversial

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:18.270
 -- I would rather Google --
okay.

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:19.270
So you could imagine a world in which there
are a million small social networks and they

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.270
all worked pretty well together.

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:21.270
I would rather that world than Google be,
have a billion users and be the dominant social

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:22.270
network.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:23.270
And -- and I think that that speaks to our
need to let our people, us, have those different

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.270
spaces to use and say, well –

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank you.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.270
So Mark, hello.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.270
You have a question.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.270
&gt;&gt;Mark: I sure do.

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.270
So we talked about improvements in the Buzz
API, things like Groups, we talked about bringing

01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.270
these things together.

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.270
How do you intend to advance the industry
by engaging things in, like, Open Social which

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:32.270
you guys were very active in, to bring the
industry together and forward, not just Buzz?

01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.270
&gt;&gt;David: That's a good question.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:34.270
There was a -- there was a similar question
before your -- before you came in and I referred

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:35.270
back to your previous session, actually, as
part of the answer.

01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:36.270
I think -- no.

01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.270
No.

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:38.270
That was not a -- that was -- that was a -- that
was a plus.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:39.270
That was a – a part of the answer I think
is something that Sami has talked about a

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:40.270
bunch which is the idea with the Buzz APIs,
and DeWitt was hitting this point a lot, is

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:41.270
that they are standard APIs, that they are
open APIs and they're based on open standards

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.270
and where that's not true, it's because we
didn't know how to take the standards as they

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:43.270
exist today and solve the needs of Buzz and
every time that Sami and his team did something

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.270
that wasn't lined up with an existing open
standard, they did it with the intent of saying,

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:45.270
we think this could become part of the standard
and we commit to changing the Buzz APIs to

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:46.270
match the correct standard once it stops moving.

01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:47.270
I think I early on had a conversation with
DeWitt and with Sami about this and I started

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.270
black and white because it's just easier and
said, why don't you just implement standard?

01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:49.270
And they said, because it doesn't solve the
problem.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:50.270
And I said, okay.

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:51.270
Well, what fraction of it does?

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.270
And it was roughly a third, a third, a third.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.270
It was a third where what the Buzz API needed
to do to expose Buzz was well-spoken to by

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:54.270
some existing standard and for that just used
it.

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.270
And there was a -- another third where it
was well – what the Buzz API is doing is

01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:56.270
an area that just isn't spoken to by any standard.

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:57.270
It's just green field and we're gonna invent
something that feels like it's a good proposed

01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:58.270
extension.

01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:59.270
And then there were other -- another area
where, for some complicated reason, and each

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:00.270
one went off, we can't do it the way the relevant
standard says and we need to propose that

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:01.270
the standard move towards something that.

01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:02.270
And that's been the plan and I think something
we've tried to be really clear about in the

01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:03.270
messaging Buzz API early users is, this is
going to change because it's going to change

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.270
to become more standard with some version
of the API moving and the standards moving

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.270
to come together.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:06.270
&gt;&gt;DeWitt: And then the other thing I'd just
add to that really quickly is,

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.270
there's no Buzz protocol.

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:08.270
I mean, very important that we reposition
it that's why -- 'cause this is how we're

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:09.270
building it.

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:10.270
There's Buzz the product, it's the thing you
see in Gmail.

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:11.270
There is the Buzz API but that's really just
the collection of other protocols.

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.270
And with regards to Open Social, we managed
to pull together with Open Social in industry.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:13.270
I mean, there are so many participants.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.270
We managed to get IBM, and MySpace, and Yahoo!,
and all these other, I mean, really hard-to-get-together-people

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.270
in the same room.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.270
Everybody got in the same room and we not
only agreed on actually really impressive

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:17.270
specification but we agreed to a governance
model.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:18.270
Like, how can all of these companies work
together to build common intellectual property.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.270
I think that's pretty phenomenal.

01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:20.270
What I hope to see is that, you know, what
we're doing with the protocols around Buzz,

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.270
or Wave, or all these other – other products,
they will get folded into Open Social, and

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:22.270
vice versa.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:23.270
[pause]

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:24.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:25.270
Just quickly, one of the things that I'm most
excited about from the Open Social perspective

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.270
is I feel like Open Social actually designed
a pretty good set of RESTful APIs which is

01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:27.270
how you interact across different sites with
Open Social sites and yet they didn't really

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.270
get their fair share of the attention early
on because there was so much focus, as David

01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:29.270
said earlier, on the end app experience.

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.270
But Buzz is also trying very hard to do that
cross site interoperability and it's no coincidence

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.270
that the Buzz APIs look a lot like Open Social
APIs --sometimes exactly the same, sometimes

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:32.270
a little different.

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:33.270
And in particular, we always knew that the
activities part of the Open Social RESTful

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:34.270
APIs were a little primitive and a little
weak because things like Activity Streams

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:35.270
really hadn't matured yet and I'm hoping that
since that's sort of the core of what Buzz

01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.270
does, it's really gonna help us get that right
and in turn inform Open Social and because

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.270
we designed them similarly, that translation
of technology's gonna be really simple.

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:38.270
So that's a kind of the way we're thinking
about how to make this all work together.

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.270
&gt;&gt;David: Just making that tangible I would
love to see Open Social 1.X RESTful API be

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:40.270
exactly the same as what the Buzz product
supports at the time that that API exists.

01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:41.270
And that will take movement on both the product
and the API but I -- but that's very much

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:42.270
the intent is have that model of -- of, of
API governance apply.

01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:43.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:44.270
Cool.

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.270
Next question.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:46.270
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member: Hi.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.270
I love Buzz.

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.270
Thank you. And I am just wondering, there
are people I follow who bring up topics that

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:49.270
I'm not particularly interested in, similar
to what somebody else mentioned I think, and

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:50.270
I would love to be able to use the same kind
of filtering that Gmail already has, specifically

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.270
 –

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: Ah.

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:53.270
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member: -- on Buzz so that
I don't filter out an entire person but just

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.270
 – I don't wanna hear all the political
stuff or I don't wanna hear the abortion debates

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.270
or whatever.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.270
And can -- are you gonna be doing that?

01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:57.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: From Joseph, mine is political.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:58.270
[laughing]

01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: Filters of that power, --

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:00.270
&gt;&gt; [Asking question in the background]

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:01.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: It's, it's a great suggestion.

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.270
We are working on various ways to filter.

01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:03.270
That would be more -- one of the more powerful
ways of doing it.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:04.270
I actually hadn't thought of that.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:05.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: It would be cool if you could actually
do topic-base clustering and actually try

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:06.270
to guess, does this sound like political speech
 -- kinda like Google news did or something?

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:07.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: Right. I don't know.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:08.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: We have some, like, smart machine
learning people that we can throw on that.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:09.270
&gt;&gt; [Asking question in the background]
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

01:02:09.270 --> 01:02:10.270
&gt;&gt; [Asking question in the background]

01:02:10.270 --> 01:02:11.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: That could work, too.

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:12.270
You have an idea.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.270
&gt;&gt;Audience: So, I wanted to come back for
a moment to talking about correlation and

01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.270
privacy because frequently as we imagine how
we can make these transparent -- make these

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:15.270
systems transparent, the management of them
becomes incredibly onerous.

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:16.270
Right it's like if I wanna go to Facebook,
for example, boy, can I tweak every setting

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.270
and it's unlikely that I ever will and frankly
there are times when you're pretty sure they're

01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:18.270
gaining on that.

01:02:18.270 --> 01:02:19.270
So I guess the question that I would put is,
how would you imagine that we can actually

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:20.270
have that transparent informed consent as
not only we're coming into a more and more

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:21.270
complex social world on the web but as we're
discovering new uses after the fact.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.270
So after I've gone through and managed it
very carefully, oh, you've just invented a

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:23.270
new way to use that data.

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:24.270
[pause]

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:25.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: There's no simple answer but a couple
of -- couple of thoughts.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:26.270
One is, it seems to me that you're gonna have
to start to have tools that help you manage

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:27.270
some of this stuff and the -- the interoperability
in open standard is kind of a prerequisite.

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:28.270
So here.

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:29.270
Let me give you a good example.

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:30.270
As I mentioned earlier, I recently moved from
Plaxo to Google and, I'm

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:31.270
a pretty, like, with it, savvy, tech guy on
the web but I can't tell you the number of

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:32.270
web sites that still say I work at Plaxo 'cause
I don't even remember all the sites I signed

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.270
up for let alone had a chance to change my
job title on all of them.

01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:34.270
Now, I wasn't doing that because I wanted
to have multiple personas.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:35.270
It's just broken and if those sites all support
the kind of basic APIs, one place you might

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.270
look is the Mozilla Labs guys have been doing
great work and they have the specification

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:37.270
of an account management API where a site
could describe, here's how you programmatically

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.270
login and log out, here's how you programmatically
change basic account information.

01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:39.270
If you imagine something like that existed
on all those web sites, maybe my browser or

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:40.270
a web site could help me see all that and
change all that information in one place.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:41.270
And you can imagine doing similar things with
privacy settings; right?

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.270
If you could make the privacy options portable
so that if, for example, I block somebody

01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:43.270
on one site, maybe that should follow me to
another site which of course then means I

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:44.270
have to know that it's the same person on
another site.

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:45.270
So you just can't solve any of those problems
without these standards but once you get them,

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.270
there's all kinds of wonderful value adds
like that on top that you could build.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.270
And maybe this'll be a place that smart browsers
can really help us.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:48.270
'Cause after all, they're the ones that are
really sort of intermediating

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:49.270
that.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.270
Next question.

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:52.270
&gt;&gt;Audience: Advertising.

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:53.270
When does the social team talk to the advertising
team?

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.270
Will we expect to see more about the integration
of these technologies next year?

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.270
Never?

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:56.270
One of the two?

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: [Laughing] That's an A or a B kind
of question but what is your general thought?

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:58.270
&gt;&gt;David: Principle is -- the principle – it's
gonna sound – it's gonna sound trite but

01:02:58.270 --> 01:02:59.270
it really is the starting principle.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:00.270
When we thinks it makes things better for
users and -- and that is, that there are ways

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:01.270
to do -- there are ways those two teams could
talk that would be very bad for users and

01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:02.270
there are ways they could talk that would
be very good for users, right?

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:03.270
And -- and that means it's -- that means it's
not -- we're not gonna rush anything in that

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:04.270
area because it's -- there's some sharp edges
in there and we're not gonna do anything imprudent

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:05.270
but at the same time it was -- I forget which
of the CEOs in the keynote this morning said

01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.270
he would prefer to see ads for Lexus than
for diapers when he's watching TV.

01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:07.270
And, and I understand that preference and
it would be a very -- that -- that's an example

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:08.270
if you could get that right where you actually
could help users a lot by -- by doing things

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:09.270
like that and the advertising team with things
like the -- the interspaced stuff that's going

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:10.270
out there and is -- is -- is dabbling in that
to see what's good for users.

01:03:10.270 --> 01:03:11.270
But -- but the -- the full answer is longer
and more complicated because there are a goods

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:12.270
 -- goods and bads.

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:13.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I would also just mention, one of
the things I do a lot in my social

01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:14.270
interactions is tell people about the products
I'm passionate about and that is, that's sort

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.270
of a form of advertising and it would be nice
if it were easier for me to not only share

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:16.270
the products that I'm passionate about but
follow products that I care about and I just

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.270
had -- for example, every time a band I love
I realized, oh, my God, they released an album

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.270
a year ago and I didn't hear about it, like,
everybody lost there, right?

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:19.270
And so it seems like there's lots of opportunities
there that, where the two come together very

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.270
naturally.

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:21.270
&gt;&gt;David: Let me -- let me ask some questions
here to -- to just calibrate people a little

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:22.270
bit.

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:23.270
Suppose that -- and this is completely hypothetical
because we don't talk to the ads team.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:24.270
No.

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:25.270
[laughing]

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:26.270
This is in the -- this is in the realm of
 –

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:27.270
&gt;&gt;Audience: You think they're advertising
people at Google?

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.270
Really?

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:29.270
[laughing]

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.270
David: This -- but this is in the realm of
thinking what are some of the really good

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:31.270
and really bad things.

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:32.270
Suppose -- suppose that there were a preference
you could set somewhere in your account at

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:33.270
Google that said, take advantage of the information
on my profile to change the ads that I see.

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:34.270
How many of you would check that box?

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.270
Okay.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.270
Suppose there were an option that said, take
advantage of what my friends are doing online

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:37.270
to change the ads that I see.

01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.270
How many of you would –

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: That they've shared with me.

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:40.270
&gt;&gt;David: Yeah.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.270
[pause]

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:42.270
Yeah.

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:43.270
I'm being intentionally squishy here.

01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:44.270
It was interesting.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:45.270
There were less hands.
Y'all had to think.

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:46.270
That was interesting.

01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.270
Okay.

01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.270
Here's one.

01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:49.270
Take advantage of the contents of my e-mail
to figure out what brands I

01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.270
might be interested in and change the ads
that I see when I'm surfing the web.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:51.270
How many of you would check that box?

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:52.270
Only – only in a very narrow way.

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:53.270
And -- okay.

01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:54.270
So my point here isn't to actually -- this
isn't market research, right?

01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:55.270
[laughing]

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:56.270
This is -- this is not as a -- but I'm -- I'm
just trying to give you a hint of the kinds

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:57.270
of interesting questions, right?

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.270
I was most interested in the speed with which
hands did and didn't go up because -- because

01:03:58.270 --> 01:03:59.270
I have to think about how I would answer each
of those questions and it depends on the details

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.270
whether it's a good idea or a bad idea to
do each of those.

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:01.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.270
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I don't know.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:03.270
I heard "ship it".

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:04.270
[laughing]

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:05.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Okay.

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:06.270
So because Buzz is such a new product and
we recently had the Buzz API launches, I'd

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:07.270
like to ask Todd ask Sami to give their closing
thoughts

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.270
on how this has been going and then we have
to stop in about ten seconds.

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.270
[laughing]

01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yeah.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:11.270
&gt;&gt;Audience: So you caught my ear with the
digesting of a corpus, I mean, the body of

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:12.270
whatever Google has access to.

01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:13.270
What about something involving maybe, like,
a realtime approach where you have maybe deep

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:14.270
back an inspection&gt;

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.270
Are costs given content in real-time as opposed
to the corpus?

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:16.270
And I know you guys serve up AdSense but what
if there was a way to say, where I know you

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.270
are, how I've classified where you may be,
what you may be doing, what your gestures

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:18.270
might be, and then how that might affect what
might get served up.

01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:19.270
Is that something you might be interested
in?

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.270
&gt;&gt;David: If we could get it right, that would
be very useful.

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.270
I mean, I would love to have ads that were
that interesting to me.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:22.270
&gt;&gt;Audience: Yeah.

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:23.270
&gt;&gt;David: And it's harder.

01:04:23.270 --> 01:04:24.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: So, Todd, any closing thoughts for
us?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:25.270
&gt;&gt;Todd: I would say just from the product
perspective of Buzz, DeWitt mentioned Buzz

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:26.270
is about three months old.

01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:27.270
The team set a very early goal to be launching
a feature a week and we've hit that rate.

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:28.270
We've launched 15 new features since Buzz
launched.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.270
It's something that you're gonna continue
to see us do as actively innovate the product.

01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.270
There's some great stuff coming next week
and the week after that I'm really excited

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:31.270
about.

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.270
So keep your eyes open and listening and making
the product better every day.

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:33.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.270
Sami?

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.270
Sami.

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:36.270
[laughing]

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.270
Sami: So, kind of my thoughts is -- is to
reiterate the fact that, I mean, these APIs

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.270
are young and we want -- we really want to
hear your use cases so that we can help you

01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:39.270
build great apps, great unique innovative
apps.

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.270
So please do reach out.

01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:41.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: Cool.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.270
Well, thank you all for being here.

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.270
Let's give them an applause.

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.270
[Applause]

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.278
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank you for coming to the session.
