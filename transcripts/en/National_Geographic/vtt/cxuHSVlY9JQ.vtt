00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:05.300
Why is it that we as a
country have such a hard time

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.867
coming to terms with
our past and some

00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.266
of the uglier chapters?

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.867
We think that saying
I'm sorry makes you weak.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.367
And I think that's what has
to change in this country.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.333
You can't actually
tell the truth

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.433
if you're not
willing to confront

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.700
the mistakes you've made.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.166
If you go to South Africa, you
see a nation that is committed

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.166
to never forgetting apartheid.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.700
There's an Apartheid Museum.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.700
If you go to Rwanda, you see
a country that is determined

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.367
to not forget the genocide.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.300
And if you go to
the genocide museum,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.700
they actually have
human skulls in there--

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.166
that's just how powerfully
they want to express

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.800
their pain and anguish.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.567
I was in Berlin a month ago.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.633
And when you go to Berlin,
you can't go 100 meters

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.300
without seeing markers and
stones that have been placed

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.633
next to the homes
of Jewish families

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.900
that were abducted
during the Holocaust.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.600
And the Germans want you to
go to that Holocaust Memorial,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.433
because they want to
change their identity.

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:03.767
They haven't pretended that
there wasn't this thing

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:05.400
called the Holocaust.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.734
But in America, we don't
talk about slavery.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.767
We don't talk about lynching.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:09.900
We don't talk about segregation.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.166
And because of
that, we don't have

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:16.400
a healthy relationship with one
another on the topic of race.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.834
Why are memorials,
statues, schools, highways--

00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:26.467
why is this symbolism
so important?

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.600
There are some people, I think,
who think, it doesn't matter.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.700
It doesn't matter.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.200
What's the big deal?

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.467
When we honor
people that tried

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:37.400
to defend and
perpetuate slavery,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.934
we create that same
kind of dissonance.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.200
We cannot legitimize slavery.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.667
We can not legitimize lynching.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.367
We cannot honor segregation
and racial hierarchy.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:53.367
We just can't do it and recover.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:57.300
And that's the reason
why those statues matter.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.333
Those street names matter.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:03.533
Those statues and
schools and highways

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.333
send an incredibly
powerful symbol that is

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:09.600
really almost hard to describe.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.800
It is hard to describe.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.633
And the history around them
makes that symbol even more

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.433
disruptive, even more painful.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:20.467
Because these monuments
and memorials were largely

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:24.533
erected to signal triumph
of a narrative war.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:26.567
The North won the Civil
War, but the South

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:27.934
won the narrative war.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.200
They won the battle
of never having

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.633
to apologize for the
violence and destruction,

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.700
for having enslaved people.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.600
It was designed to
communicate to black people

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.700
that racial hierarchy,
white supremacy will

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.867
still be the law of the land.

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:46.600
And I don't think
we've appreciated

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.633
the harm, the psychic harm
of what these symbols can do.

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:53.233
And not just to
African-Americans and people

00:02:53.233 --> 00:02:55.300
of color, to all of us.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.600
Because when we are
forced, in this region,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.266
to make ourselves proud
of things that are not

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.900
worthy of pride,
to make ourselves

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.667
proud of things that
should really induce shame,

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:08.900
we corrupt ourselves.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.400
We really do.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.934
Should statues of Robert
E. Lee and Jefferson

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:17.266
Davis and other
Confederate heroes

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.900
be removed, in your view?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.500
I wouldn't remove
them because we all

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.567
get closer to recognizing
that they should have never

00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:25.300
been put up in the first place.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.166
I want to get to the point
where we accept and acknowledge

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.300
that we're celebrating
things that we

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.767
shouldn't be celebrating.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:34.200
We should actually name some
streets after white Southerners

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.934
who tried to end slavery.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.633
We can name streets and
schools after white Southerners

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.500
who tried to stop lynching.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.200
And then we could
all be proud of that.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.533
And it would do something
that these symbols don't do,

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:47.633
which is that it could
bring people together.

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:51.266
How do you convince people
who feel these statues are so

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.700
associated with their
personal stories

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.800
that they don't
want let that go?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800
My interest in talking
about our history

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.767
is to not punish America
for this history.

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:02.233
I want to liberate us.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:06.500
And there is a way to
be a white southerner

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.166
and proud of who you
are and acknowledge

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.333
the pain of this past.

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:12.934
That's what
restoration is about.

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.200
That's what
reconciliation is about.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.300
Native Americans have to
watch all this unfolding

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.500
and think, when are people
going to accept and acknowledge

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.233
what happened to us?

00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.300
You can't live in a community
like Montgomery, Alabama

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.867
without being mindful
that the Creek Indian

00:04:32.867 --> 00:04:36.800
Nation were forced to cede
21 million acres of land

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.033
to create this space.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:42.500
And then they were forced on
a trail of tears to the west.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.700
Their burial grounds,
their sacred spaces

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.900
were destroyed to build hotels
and banks so that black people

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.166
could then be enslaved.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.367
And that story of the
Native American genocide

00:04:54.367 --> 00:04:56.233
is a story that we
also have to confront.

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:57.834
We have to talk about that.

00:04:57.834 --> 00:05:00.266
We have to deal with that.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:02.867
Are you optimistic
we're at a moment in time

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.467
that we can come to
terms with the past?

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.834
I'm optimistic because
maybe we're in a moment where

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:10.934
the silence is breaking down.

00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:12.500
And if we can break
down the silence,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.500
I have no doubt that something
beautiful can emerge.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.266
