00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm Ted Widmer, director
of the Kluge Center.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.780
On behalf of the Library of
Congress, it's my pleasure

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.320
to welcome you this evening

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.220
as we continue a wonderful
five-year collaboration

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.440
with the Daniel K. Inouye Institute
to commemorate the life, legacy,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.640
and values of the late
senator Daniel Inouye.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.490
Before we begin, please take a
moment to silence your cell phones.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.200
Also, please note this event is
being live-streamed and recorded

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.430
for the Library's website.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.890
And if you have a question
this evening,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.930
you are giving the library
permission to use your question

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.750
for a future broadcast
as in forever.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.380 position:56%
So please ask your question clearly,
and please ask only one question.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.770
And for those of you who
are tweeting this event,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.440
we are using the hashtag
Inouye and hashtag Kluge.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.420
Senator Daniel K. Inouye was an
Olympian figure here in Washington

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.650
and in his home state of Hawaii.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.640
Born in Honolulu on September 7,
1924, to Japanese American parents,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.910
he graduated from high school less
than six months after Pearl Harbor.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.350 position:56%
After the ban was lifted on Japanese
Americans serving their country,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.910
he enlisted in the Army and served
in the famous 442nd regiment

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.020 position:56%
of the U.S. Army, a unit of Japanese
American soldiers who fought

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.520
with extraordinary gallantry
in Italy, France, and Germany.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.310
On October 21, 1945, in the
war's final weeks in Europe,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.390
he was severely wounded
in battle after taking

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.480
out two German machine gun
nests and lost his right arm.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.860
He returned home with a
distinguished service cross,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.820
bronze star medal,
two Purple Hearts,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.060
and 12 other medals and citations.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.920
He received extensive medical
treatment, and his commitment

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.180
to bipartisanship may have stemmed

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.080
from the lifelong friendship he
formed with another wounded veteran

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.100
in the same hospital, the future
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.400
After coming home, he graduated
from the University of Hawaii,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.990 position:56%
then law school, and became Hawaii's
first representative in 1959

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.390
when Hawaii became a state.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.350
Three years later he
was elected senator,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.710 position:56%
part of a freshman class inspired by
the young President John F. Kennedy,

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.010
including his brother,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.970
Edward Kennedy [inaudible]
and George McGovern.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.070 position:56%
He served for nearly half a century
in the Senate, leaving a rich legacy

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.840
that includes the National Museum
of the Native American just

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.180
down the street and
prominent service

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.190
on the Senate Watergate committee,
the Senate Iran Contra Committee,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.350
and the Senate Appropriations
Committee,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.330
which he chaired from 2009 to 2012.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.910
He was awarded the Congressional
Medal of Honor on June 1, 2000,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.640
for his military service,
a day I was proud to be

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.130
in the audience at the White House.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.900
After his death on
December 17, 2012,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.340
he was posthumously awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom,

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.600
becoming the first senator
to receive both the Medal

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.300
of Freedom and the Medal of Honor.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.310
Tonight the John W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.870
and the Daniel K. Inouye
Institute present the third

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.140
in a five-year distinguished
lecture series

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.100
to commemorate Daniel Inouye's
commitment to bipartisanship,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.900
moral courage, public
service and civic engagement.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.820
We also celebrate tonight another
great American who believed

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.440
in courage and civic engagement,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.310
President John F. Kennedy
born 100 years ago this month.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.550
This year's lecture was
planned in collaboration

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.220
with the Kennedy Center
and the Peace Corp to focus

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.520
on values held dear

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.260
by both President Kennedy
and Senator Inouye.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.110
It was also designed to honor
the special role of Hawaii

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.180
in the development
of the Peace Corp.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.780 position:56%
As the panels outside indicate, more
than 7500 volunteers were trained

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.610
in Hawaii between 1962 and 1972.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.270
This evening our speakers
will consider the topic

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.540
of inspiring a sense of
service and idealism.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.570
They will highlight the
evolution of the Peace Corp,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.220
which was established by
President Kennedy on March 1, 1961,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.150
and discussed how it's ideals
remained relevant today,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.210
five decades later.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.600
The event is made possible
by a generous donation

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.200 position:56%
from the Daniel K. Inouye Institute.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.450 position:56%
We are most privileged to have with
us this evening the Senator's widow,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.720
the driving force behind his
legacy, Mrs. Irene Inouye.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.510
I ask you please to join
me in recognizing her.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:18.200
[ Applause ]

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.500
Thank you.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.800
I'd now like to introduce
our distinguished panelists,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.150
as you will hear the Peace
Corp played a significant role

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.980
in both of their lives.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.690
Reed Hastings grew up locally.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.820
His father was an attorney for the
Department of Health, Education,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.320
and Welfare under President Nixon.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.110
One of his early memories,
according to an interview he gave

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.430
in the New York Times, is
getting a tour of Camp David

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.390
from the then Attorney
General, Elliott Richardson,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.150
and noticing that Camp David
had Golden toilet seats.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.930
There were no such amenities
in Peace Corp, where he served

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.630
from 1983 to 1985 after
attending Bowdoin College.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.280
He taught math in a high
school in Northwest Swaziland

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.010
where there was no
electricity at all.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.690
But it could be said
that Netflix began there.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.070
He took his GRE exam in Swaziland.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.210
He was then admitted to Stanford's
program in computer science.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.480
He enjoyed a very successful
business career.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.120
He created and sold
a software company,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.930
always displaying the versatility
and self-reliance prized

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.350
by the Peace Corp. That
background prepared him well

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.330
for the day he received a
late fee from a video store

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.480
after renting the moving Apollo 13.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.750
He was in fact six week's late
and owed $40 in on-the-spot.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.350
He decided to create a new
company for people who wanted

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.920
to rent movies for
longer than one day.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.960
Netflix was founded in 1997
as a DVD subscription service.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.470
Ten years later in 2007, it started
streaming content via the Internet.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.980
It now has over 100 million
members in over 190 countries,

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.970
more than the population of
Germany, France, or England.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.620
Reed is an active educational
philanthropist.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.590
He served on the California
State Board

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.350
of Education from 2000 to 2004.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.650
He is on the board

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.180
of many educational organizations
including the California Charter

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.330
Schools Association, Dreambox
Learning, the KIPP Foundation,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.910
Pahara and the Hispanic
Foundation of Silicon Valley.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.440
He is also a board member of
Facebook and was on the board

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.910
of Microsoft from 2007 to 2012.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.040
Our other panelist,
Secretary Elaine Chao,

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.760
is the 18th U.S. Secretary
of Transportation.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.750
At the age of eight, she
immigrated from Taiwan

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.670
to the United States,
speaking no English.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.670
She graduated from high school
in New York, Mount Holyoke

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.370
and Harvard Business School then
began a remarkable public career

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.780
that has always given
inspiration to others.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.170
From 2001 to 2009, she was the
24th U.S. Secretary of Labor,

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.370
the first Asian American
woman to be appointed

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.830
to the Cabinet of American History.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.180 position:56%
Prior to that, she was the President
and CEO of United Way of America,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.590
and before that the Deputy
Secretary of Transportation.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.370
And she was the director of the
Peace Corp from 1991 to 1993,

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:11.120
an eventful period in World history
and especially for the countries

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.360
in the former Soviet Union.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.700
She was nominated for that post
by President George H. W. Bush,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.460
and during her tenure
she developed one

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.150
of President Kennedy's original
ideas for the Peace Corp,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.190
which is that it should operate
in the Eastern European countries

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.320
where development and
expression were often stifled.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.450
Under her leadership, the Peace
Corp expanded into Poland,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.290
Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.080
Our conversation tonight will
be moderated by Ann Compton,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.430
former ABC News White
House correspondent.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.300
She joined ABC News in 1973.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.040
She has covered seven presidents.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.300
On September 11, 2001, she was the
only broadcast reporter allowed

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.610
to remain on Air Force One
during the dramatic hours

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.150
when President Bush was unable
to return here to Washington.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.820
She's traveled around the
globe, through all 50 states,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.550
with presidents, vice
presidents, and first ladies.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.510
We're delighted she can
be here with us tonight.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.520
After their conversation, we will
a lot some time for questions,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.470
but first we will begin the Q and A
with some video recorded questions

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.850
from Peace Corp volunteers and
University of Hawaii students.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.410
Then we will have microphones
available,

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.580
and we will take a few
questions from the live audience.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.250
Please join me in welcoming
our distinguished panelists

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.050
to the stage.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.250
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Thank you.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.560
Good evening.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:57.280
Aloha. During the questioning
tonight, and the conversation

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.990
between these two guests, we're
looking for that thread that goes

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.950
between public service
and the idea that the rest

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:13.500
of our collective experiences lead
into that and can illuminate that.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.760 position:56%
Elaine Chao, I've known you since we
were both young girls covering the

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.110
Reagan administration.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.750
She actually brought
her spouse tonight,

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.750
Senate majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, here.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.270
They got married much after
Elaine and I first [inaudible].

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.070
Thank you for coming.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.330
[ Applause ]

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.600
Secretary Chao, you
began as a banker.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.900
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Yes.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:42.920
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And your first
government job was a White

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.420
House fellow.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.510
How did you get from there
into a Cabinet position,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:52.050
and what was that thread that
got you to head the Peace Corp?

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.450
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: The
thread is curiosity.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.120
As you've heard, I'm an
immigrant to this country.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.710
I didn't understand
so much about America.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:04.470
So when I was a banker, I thought--

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.070
I was involved in a
number of transactions.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:12.260
If it was with a private sector, it
would just be four people, myself,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.780
the banker, the borrower, his,
and most of the time it was a he,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.200
his lawyer, my lawyer,
and we would be able

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.100
to finish a deal in two hours.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.380
But whenever I did a government
deal, there would be reams

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.560
of documents, 35 lawyers on
their side, the government side,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.930
and it took like months
to close a deal.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.860
So I was kind of curious.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.160
Why did this happen?

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.450
Why the difference, and so I heard

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.140
about the White House
fellowship program, and I applied.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.440
But it was out of a sense
of love for this country,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.730
curiosity about how our
government functioned,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:58.210
and wanting to understand the
larger society here in American.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.030
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And then you had
been in a deputy Cabinet position,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.110
how did the Peace Corp rise out of
that, and I remember what happened

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.480
in 1991, the year that you
took over the Peace Corp

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.380 position:56%
because I remember missing Christmas
with our four little children.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.010
It was the day the
Soviet Union fell about

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.740
and President George Herbert
Walker Bush flew from Camp David

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.930
to the White House on Christmas
night to address the nation

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.930
and congratulate Gorbachev
for having the courage

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.830
to break up the Soviet Union.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:37.500
You now have a Peace Corp. There
were no Peace Corp representatives

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.210
on the ground in those
country, were there?

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.510
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Yes.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.720
You know, President George H.W.
Bush was actually quite prescient,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.610
and he had a very good
feel for world affairs.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:55.640 position:56%
So in the summer of 1991, he already
had a feeling that the collapse,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.990
I think, because we've never
talked about it in this sense,

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.360
and I'll explain, but
he must have had a sense

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.360
that the former Soviet
Union was going to collapse,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.190
and that the peoples in the
former Soviet Union will need help

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.400
from a people-to-people
kind of exchange,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.020
but they'll require
different skill sets.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.080
They will require a more
sophisticated kind of assistance,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.780
and so I was in California
in June of 1991,

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.090
and he mentioned his interest
in placing me at Peace Corp,

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.480
and he said the Peoples
of the Soviet Union,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:42.860
if this ever came about, would
need assistance in adjusting

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:46.370
to a more industrialized,
and to join the community,

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:50.530
the international community, if
anything like that were to happen.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.770
And I have to give my husband some
credit-- he wasn't my husband then.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.460
I was just going out with him.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.270
But he was cute.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.390
He still is.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:06.340
So I discussed it with him,
and he was very encouraging

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.950
of my entering the Peace
Corp as a director.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.240
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Reed Hastings,
so you graduate from Bowdoin,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.170
you're going to go into the
Marine Corp, how did that turn

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.780
into the Peace Corp and then
into an entrepreneurial,

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.040
legendary entrepreneurial career?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.620
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Well I wanted
to do some form of service,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.150
and the Marine Corp has a
program where you can do summers

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.450
at Quantico, and then when you
graduate you get commissioned

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.270
as a second lieutenant, so I did
the junior year, I guess summer.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.680
And it was hard.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.710
I realized, you know, the
system is very well organized

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.480
and very impressive, but,
you know, as a junior person,

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.310
it's following orders
a lot, and I realized

00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:59.930
that might not be my sweet spot.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:06.440 position:56%
And so I was able to petition out
of that and then join the Peace Corp

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.420
where you're sent to many distant
places, and you really have

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:12.850
to make it up as you go along,

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.820
and it really develops your
leadership muscle in that way.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.800
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Did you get
to pick where you were going?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.100
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: No.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.400
I got assigned Swaziland.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.540
This was all pre-Internet,
and so, you know,

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.770
you go to your local library,
and you look up an encyclopedia.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.660
I never heard of the place, but
like, you know, many of the places

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.180
in the world that Peace Corp
volunteers are sent, you know,

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.510
it's a very optimistic people, and
I was a high school math teacher

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.830 position:56%
and just had a fantastic experience.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Well, let
me switch to this, Reed,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:50.270
you live in California,
Silicon Valley.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.310
Many of the students watching
in Hawaii from two locations,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:16:00.970
the Washington Beltway seems like
a strange creature and probably not

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.760
at times a very appealing one.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.480
Do you think from your
point of view,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.100
can you explain how
you view Washington

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:14.900 position:56%
and whether a public service career
at this moment probably doesn't look

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.650
that appetizing to
some young people?

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.710
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: I think it
looks appetizing to many people,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:24.410
and whether it's Washington or
Sacramento for us in California,

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:29.070 position:56%
you know, some people choose a life,
like the secretary that's dedicated

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.670
to public service decade
after decade,

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.600
and I think that's very powerful
because you develop a lot of skills

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.250
and connections, and you
could be more effective.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:39.620
Other people like myself
dabble in it.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.960
So two years in the Peace Corp.
Then I'm in the private sector.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.250
Then I volunteered on the state
board of education in California,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.350
so I spent a lot of
time in Sacramento.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: You became chairman.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:50.950
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: That's right,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:55.800
but you're basically supporting the
professionals, like the secretary,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.760
that are dedicating their
lives, and so as long

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.230 position:56%
as you realize different people make
different choices and that's okay

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.790
and you work together,
I think there's a lot

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.760 position:56%
of different opportunities to
either do I would call it, you know,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.320
small tier occasional service
like I've done and mostly focus

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.590
on the private sector, or long-term

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.320
in many different roles,
like the secretary.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.620
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I totally
agree with that.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.920
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Good.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.220
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: And I think
it's really important actually

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.690
to have these different
paths into public service

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.750
at federal, state, local levels.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.510
I think our nation benefits
when people have a diversity

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.990
of experience in the private
sector, in the volunteer sector,

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.690
and they come into
the public sector.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.420
All of that is helpful.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.840
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And from the
point of view of the students

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.930
who are watching tonight from
Hawaii, should they worry

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.990
about being put off if they
see Washington looking chaotic

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.510
right now?

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.790
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Democracy
is chaotic.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.580
Democracy is messy.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.880
So it's really funny.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:05.590
I teach English to some
immigrants from Asia,

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:11.180
and they keep on asking me, they
keep on say, who's in charge?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.260
And I tell them, there's
nobody in charge.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.050
But then they say, you and I
know each other now well enough,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.440
you can really tell me,
who's in charge in America.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.660
So the dynamic aspects of our
society and the balance of power

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.320 position:56%
between the different branches at
the federal level, I mean, you know,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.180
making laws is like making
sausage, it is messy.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:35.650
Democracy is messy.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.330
We have such a cacophonous
nation of people.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.820
People talk about partisanship,
gridlock, and our country is made

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.910
up of, our Congress is made up
of representatives, senators,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.900
and congressmen, who
represent where they're from,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.650
and they're giving
voice to their people,

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.950
the people that they represent.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And
who sent them there?

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Who sent them there?

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.240
So we have such a diverse country
so of course our national discourse

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.720
and our dialogue is going to be
kind of chaotic and messy as well.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.020
But that's democracy.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.070
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: So let me ask
both of you, how do you express

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.860
that to the people, the young
Peace Corp volunteers are

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.640
out there dealing with it.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.860
Reed do you have stories
about when you [inaudible],

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.410
about ways in which people's lives
were changed because you were there

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.620
and Secretary Chao for you as
well, ways in which you know

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:38.770
that during your tenure lives
were changed in places overseas.

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.070
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.690
You know, the Peace Corp
and many things similar

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.890
to it are great experiences to
just grow a sense of the world.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.230
It's inevitable that if you grow up
in the U.S. and don't get a chance

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.690
to travel, as most of us don't,
that, you know, you have one view

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.310
of the world, and once you've
lived outside the U.S. for a while

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:04.510
and you just see how broad it is
and the wonderful nature of people

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.490
around the world, it's a
very powerful experience.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:12.940
And so I just felt, you know, very
connected to everyone, and again,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.180
you know, times may look
chaotic today, but, you know,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.030
they're not really that
chaotic compared to World War II

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:23.590
or the civil year war or the 13
years before we had a constitution,

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.370
you know, the first 13
years that are public.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.520 position:56%
So, you know, you have to have some
perspective, and you might also look

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.920
at it and say in difficult times is

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.580
when service is most
needed and most valuable.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:39.680
So I certainly would encourage
any young person to be involved

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.610
and not think about, you
know, the last 20 years as,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.200
you know, a turnoff of politics.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.560
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Were there
times with some of the students

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:55.140
and residents that you dealt
with that you felt you really,

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.420 position:56%
you were able to make the connection

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.860
to help them better
understand America.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:06.380
The 1980s were a different
time, but not that different.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.830
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah, but
I think you really do it

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.250
as a Peace Corp volunteer
by example.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.980
It's not, you know, giving lectures

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.380
on the separation of
powers or something.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.790
You know, it's living
your life in a rural area

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:22.000
and being a decent person
and, you know, for them,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.660
it breaks down the
theory of what America is

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.910
to make it very real and personal.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:31.110
And so the Peace Corp has always
been about a very person touch,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.370
and with the secretary's leadership
around the world, you know,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.480
I'm sure you get to visit, I got
one little slice of Swaziland.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.780
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I did, I did.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:41.780
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: And you probably
have a much broader view of it.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.930
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: But Reed was so
inspiring when he said what he said

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:50.780
about the chaos, and I think
the Civil War, 13 years before,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.540
and I didn't think about
that, but that's really true.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:22:00.400
So when you ask about what's
really, what differences I've seen,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.830
you know, when I was director
of the Peace Corp and I went

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.320
to visit all these Peace Corp
volunteers, and when I would speak

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.700 position:56%
with the Peace Corp volunteers, and
there are some who are watching now,

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.850
they tell me, and I feel
of myself that I change

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.500
because I went to visit them.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.040
And there are some volunteers
here from Tonga, I went to Tonga,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.490
and I was single at the time, so
they gave me the wedding dress.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:34.080
You know, it's like a straw mat
that you wrap around yourself,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:35.980
and it was the wedding dress.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.850
And I'm sure the volunteers
in Tonga understand this.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:43.000
And which were the other areas,
America Samoa did I hear?

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.530
I was there.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:49.730
You know, the hospitality of the
local people is just overwhelming.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:54.610
Every single place I went,
the tremendous outpouring

00:22:54.610 --> 00:23:03.480
of warmth toward Americans is just
so, so impressive and inspiring.

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.620
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And
that personal one on one

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.930
with residents may
have a softening effect

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:15.280
if politically a country
is not as warm

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.340
with the United States'
relationship as--

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.030
did you ever have any instances
where you worried or thought

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.840
of bring Americans
home from a country?

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.140
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: We did.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.970
As the Peace Corp director,
the first responsibility is

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.130
to ensure the safety and
security of the volunteers.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:36.210
So we indeed did withdraw
Peace Corp volunteers

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:38.310
from I believe it was
Pakistan at the time.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.820
We had a little problem there, but
when I was Peace Corp director,

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.050
one of the first things we
did, which I was very proud of,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.420
was to have an emergency plan.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.710
It was kind of sad
that we had to do this,

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.540
but because Peace Corp
volunteers are spread so far,

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.720
it took about three days of even
more to gather them together.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.020
And so the world was changing.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.860
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Were you
able to air lift them out?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.360
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Oh my gosh, yes.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.050
And so we actually had
instituted a plan which enable us,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.940
the local Peace Corp
office, to communicate

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:15.060
with Peace Corp volunteers faster
so that they can be congregated

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.010
in one place for immediate
evacuation if necessary.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.380
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: One question that
we heard from students who sent

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.480
in their questions and from
some in the Peace Corp as well,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.110
asking whether the Peace Corp
volunteers representing the United

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:37.190
States around the world are
representing of the diversity

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.590
of the United States,
of women, minorities,

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:42.560
was that an issue at all for you?

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.860
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Absolutely.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.100
And I don't want to hog this,
because Reed is so interesting,

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:52.210
but yes, absolutely, I think Peace
Corp has a hard time recruiting.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.200
I don't know now, but 20 years ago

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.170
when I was there we had difficulty
recruiting among communities,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.850
people from communities of color.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.150
I'm Asian American.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.000
You know, my responsibility
is to my family.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.560
I wanted to make sure that I
was financially responsible,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:12.410
and the thought of taking two years
off and not getting paid except

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.780
for a very small stipend was just
not an option for a lot of people

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.480
in different communities.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.240
And so I don't think
we should be surprised.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.100
I mean that's just kind of like the
differences the cultural diversity

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.010
that we have, but we also have
to do a more affirmative job,

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:33.840
a better job, of making
known, you know,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.300
what it's like to be a
Peace Corp volunteer.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.300
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Reed,
in your experience,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.540
especially when you
come out, you were both,

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.800
you are in the private sector
now, are there good arguments

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.550
for young people to get involved

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.440
who might not be traditional
Peace Corp candidates?

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.960
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah, I mean
I think it's a great experience

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.290
for someone who's pretty
independent minded,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:03.360
and one of the great things the
United States government does is

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.380
delay any student loan
repayments during

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:07.230
that time you're a
Peace Corp volunteer.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.630
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Now explain that.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.930
I didn't realize that.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.230
That might be a big factor.

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.900
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah, so, I mean
many of our students who have built

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.720
up debt during [inaudible]
college, and then if you go

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.680
in the Peace Corp, that is
deferred for that time period.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.750
And then the Peace Corp is
doing a better job of reentry

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.540
and skills development and things.

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:31.660 position:56%
So it's a remarkable program because
it's now, you know, about 50 years,

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.050
and if you think of most programs
created in I don't know the last 20

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.710
or 30 years, they get
pretty partisan.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.310
They get associated
with a political party,

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.490
and the Peace Corp has really
been a very bipartisan effort

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.590
that has wide support, and, you
know, that's quite unique really

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.250
in the last hundred years.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:52.460
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Let me broaden
from that to a bigger aspect here.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.890
Both of you have worked,
you have worked

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.540
and you are currently
in the private sector.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:04.050
What are the lessons that you
from the private sector learn

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.970 position:56%
that are skills that you could take,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.860
that your Peace Corp volunteers
during your tenure could use

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.830
and that skills that you took
or think now you took with you.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:19.750 position:56%
Let me start with you, Mr. Hastings,
what the private sector skills

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.380
that really can be employed
when you're overseas

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:26.680
in a position representing
the United States like that.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.390
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Well I
would say a bracing failure,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:33.280
because when you're 22 and 23 and
you're on your own in a remote part

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.310
of the world, you do a lot of
stupid stuff, and, you know,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:40.000
some of it works out, you
know, but, you know, someone,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.850
I look at the misadventures, like
this bee-keeping project I started

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.730 position:56%
to do for local entrepreneurs, it
didn't work out, but this other one,

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.050
which was water tanks in local high
school did, and so you just got

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.600
to be willing, got to be relatively
fearless and just try things.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.070
And I think that mindset of being,
you know, okay with some failure

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.500
and being willing to try
is tremendously helpful

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.370
in the private sector.

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.670
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: You know,

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.420
as a former secretary
of labor, workforce--

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:09.720
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: For
eight years, right?

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.020
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Yes.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.320
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: All eight years.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.620
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: All eight years.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.700 position:56%
The workforce of the future is very,
you know, is very interesting to me

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.850
and very important to the country.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.690
I think what's really
important now as we go

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.090
into the future is the
workers of the future have

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:33.700
to be knowledge workers, and Reed
is in the area of technology.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.600
Technology is changing so much the
way we live and work and travel,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.900
because now I'm in transportation,

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:46.910
but what's really important is
the rod to work that was so valued

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.980
in the past is no longer valuable.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:57.340 position:56%
What's most valuable is creativity,
ingenuity, and the ability to think.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.400 position:56%
So the Peace Corp volunteer
experience is actually very helpful.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.470
It doesn't really matter
if you want to, you know,

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:06.350
some people may say
well I've never worked

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.620
in the private sector
before, how can this help.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.570
Every employer is looking for
workers who have the ability

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:21.630
to be curious, to learn, to adjust,
be flexible, and to be creative

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.970
and resourceful, and
these are skills

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:29.240
that if one can gain are very
helpful in any kind of job

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.440
in all three sectors, public,
private, and also the nonprofit.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.910
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Well, and
that, of course the purpose

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.210
of this program is to
encourage young people

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.930
to consider public service.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.980
Those are the kind of skills, the
creativity, the thinking to be able

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:47.840
to write, to be able to imagine,
which would be incredibly important

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.510
for a public service job as well.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.820
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: That's
absolutely right.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:56.890
I mean just pushing yourself to
do things that are challenge.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:03.760
You know, whether it's banking and
whether it's Peace Corp, you know,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:07.610
I think people learn the most when
they're in challenge situations,

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.090
and that's what stimulates
the most learning,

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.610 position:56%
back to the secretary's observation,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:15.110
it's continuous learning
in our society today.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.590
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We had a
question about public partner,

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.790
private public partnerships
in a time

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:27.440
when government funds are
limited, when Americans want,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.810
some American's want government
to have a smaller role,

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.210
at least want the private
sector to pick up some of that.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:39.140
Where are those public-private
partnerships important

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:42.810
for this government now,
for the country right now,

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.990
and for the next generation
of leaders coming along?

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.640
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Well, in terms of,
this is a very timely question,

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.760
because this administration
has as one

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.730
of its top priorities
the infrastructure,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:01.140
the deteriorating infrastructure
of our country and how we need

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:06.990 position:56%
to rebuild, refurbish, rehabilitate,
repair the existing infrastructure.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:13.190
We do not have enough money as a
country to be able to address all

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.650
of the needs of the infrastructure
through government funding alone,

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:21.140
and we would not want to fund
direct government funding

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.960
on all these different projects

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.370
because they would have
deleterious impact on our deficit

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:31.110
and also potentially dislocate the
private sector markets as well.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:32.470
There is plenty.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.160
There is a lot of private
sector monies,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.210
resources that are available,
and currently there are states

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:46.900
and other places, municipalities,
that prohibit the private sector

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.950
from investing in public
infrastructure,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:53.640
so there must be a way in
which we cannot discriminate

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.660
against a private sector and
allow them to participate

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.110
in the rebuilding of
our infrastructure.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.940
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: An example,
a toll road, a bridge,

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:01.240
what are some [inaudible].

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.180
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: When you have
public private partnerships,

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:10.430
it's an effort by-- so for example,
in the infrastructure project,

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.260
the federal funding will
probably be about 200 billion,

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:19.160 position:56%
and we will leverage that, because
a lot of times, just like C capital,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.950
if you can get some
government monies,

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.730
the government monies is kind of
like a good housekeeping seal.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.030
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Seal of approval.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.330
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: And it will attract

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:31.710
and entice other resources
to come in.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:36.450
So if of the 200 billion
there will be an opportunity

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:44.960
to attract private sector
funding through innovative ways

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.720
in which you can incentivize
the private sector to come in.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:54.150
So, for example, just today, I
just came from Atlanta, Georgia,

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.810
to participate in the
opening of I-25.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:06.970
It is the major artery in Atlanta,
Georgia, the bridge on this I-25,

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:12.870
on March 30th, erupted in a huge
fire that resulted in the collapse

00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.060
of the section of the bridge.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.000
This is a major artery in
Atlanta, and it messed up traffic,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.710
but it's not a public-private
partnership

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:26.640
but through incentivizing
the private sector.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.250
This project came in under
budget, ahead of schedule,

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.650
and in basically seven weeks it
was able to rebuild this section

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:43.380
of the bridge, and now Georgians
are able to be on the move again.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.260
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Silicon
Valley, anxious to help

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:50.120
on public private partnerships,
and of course your involvement

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.480
in education in the state
of California is legendary.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.140
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: You know,
some of the most exciting stuff

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.750
in private partnerships is things

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:02.730
like the private rocket
ship efforts,

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:05.100
which you never would
have thought ten years ago

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.590
that several different private
companies would be developing

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:11.040
rockets and doing amazing
things at amazing efficiency,

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.610
and then we have self-driving cars
and, you know, over the next five

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:20.320
or ten years, that's going to be a
tremendous revolution in, you know,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.730
how we all get around and
people's relationship with cars.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:28.470
So all these different sectors
are in the education side.

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:32.880
People are doing web-based learning
and augment what's happening

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.430
in a classroom to provide more
individualized instruction.

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.160
And so we're seeing
the role of technology

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.840
in multiple different sectors
where, you know, maybe a long time

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.290 position:56%
about is mostly from the government.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:48.370
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I want to ask both
of you, before we go to questions

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.870
from the audience, a
little bit about leadership

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.220 position:56%
because there are students in Hawaii
tonight, and there are students

00:34:55.220 --> 00:35:00.030
in the audience here and those who
will be able to see this online,

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.180
and they're always looking
for some kind of key

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.850
of what makes great leadership.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:09.930
And I wonder if I could ask each of
you, starting with you secretary,

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.450
Chao, to talk about with risk of
oversimplifying things, leadership,

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.770
there are leadership qualities
that apply both to government

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:24.250 position:56%
and to the private sector that these
students probably ought to focus on.

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.090
Well, I would turn the
question a little bit different.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.270
I would say that leadership
can be learned.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.350 position:56%
When I was younger, I always
thought, you know, leaders are born.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.500
Leadership can be learned.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.150
So I think it's really
important for young people

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:42.090 position:56%
to practice being a leader, and they
can do so in a very low-risk way

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.740
by volunteering with a agency

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.020
or with a cause they
feel strongly about,

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.370
and they can learn communication
skills, and they can learn all

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:54.440
about leadership skills as well.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.330
Having said that, I think
a great quality for leaders

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.960
to have is a sense of integrity,
that they have to be true

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.830
to themselves, that they are
true to those that they serve,

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.360
and that there is a
pureness of heart.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.580
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That's
a challenge though,

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:17.670 position:56%
sometimes when your own personal
integrity is up against a brick wall

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.760
of something that seems
to be testing that.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.500
Hold true to it?

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.810
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I hope not.

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.110
I don't know.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.230
There are very few times when most
of us are put in that situation,

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.720
I am very glad to say, but
when that situation does come,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.310
I think it's really
important to know who you are,

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:39.110 position:56%
what you stand for, your own values,

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:42.880
and be strong enough
to stand up for them.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.350
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Again,
maybe a little too influenced

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.170 position:56%
by Frank Underwood because she knows
that House of Cards is coming back

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.660
in three weeks just to see
the fictional dark underside.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.500
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: House of Cards.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.220
Oh, you may have started
Netflix and online streaming

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.710
and all those red envelops
that used to come in--

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.010
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yes.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:03.310
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: But
he's also the godfather

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:09.850
of President Francis
Underwood on House of Cards.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.150
[laughter]

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.450
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: [Inaudible] I
would say, back to your question

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.930
on leadership, it's about being
the best person you can be,

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:17.750 position:56%
and you could think of it as there's
two types of people in the world.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.260
There's the people who pick up
the trash when they see it lying

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.670
on the floor and there's
the people who walk by.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.960 position:56%
And if you want to be a leader, you
have to be the first type of person.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.580
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: That's
a great answer.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:36.230
One more quick question before we
start with those that have come in.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.770
The idea of success in life
is obviously everything

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.420
that students want to aspire
for, all of us want to aspire to,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.160
but can you learn from setbacks.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.460
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Absolutely.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.760
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Secretary--

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.340
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Those are the
best learning experiences.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:52.640
I agree with Reed.

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.940
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: They're
the hardest.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.250
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Or the
hardest, but you learn the most.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.550
Don't you agree?

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:57.850
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Right.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:59.510
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: You said before
that you have to be ready to fail,

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:04.170
and I think the hardest periods
in your life are the times

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:08.820
that you will experience the
greatest personal growth.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:13.230 position:56%
And so I think for those, everyone,
you know, for those who are thinking

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.030
about this all of us
encounter difficulties in life,

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:21.780
and we have to have the
strength to be able to prevail

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:27.030
and have confidence in ourselves,
but also know that this is the time

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.320
when we are really being
tested and being made,

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.510
our character and who we are.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:34.810
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: It's hard though.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.110
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: It's very hard.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:40.000
And of course if I didn't have
to do it, I wouldn't do it.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.790
But those times, don't
you think that those times

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.320 position:56%
when you have the most difficulties,
that's when I've learned the most.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:49.080
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Reed Hastings,
I think probably 95 percent

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.660
of people have never
heard of Quickster,

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.490
but your company had what
some called a death spiral,

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.250
and look at you now.

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.760
Was that a key learning
experience for you?

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.590
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah,
that was a major experience

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.610
about six years ago, and
Netflix was splitting the DVD

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.150
and streaming business as a part.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:13.800
And we made a big mistake.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.040
And the customers went from loving
us to hating us pretty quickly,

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:23.830
and it took us many years to earn
back the trust, and out of that,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.610
you know, we really learned a lot
about listening to the customers.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:30.550
If we saw something that
was a long-term strategy,

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.580
it's just going a little bit slower

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.710
and bringing customers
along with us.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.860
It's also what made me realize I
could never do electoral politics,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.530
because, you know, I just
don't have the ear for it.

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:46.220
And so I'm really built for
business, and I encourage people

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.410 position:56%
to really think about, you know,
what they're good at, and, you know,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.830
from myself, I realize
I'm good at business,

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.040
so I'm happy paying my
taxes and volunteering some

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.130
and being very thankful for
the public servants amongst us.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.430
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: All of our
mothers probably tell us

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.970
when you make a mistake, apologize.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:05.970
Is that a good business strategy?

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.870
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Generally, yes.

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.910
[laughter] But I would
say to be frank,

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.130
I mean the customers
don't care that much.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.960
They want the thing fixed.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.350
You know, the apology is okay,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.590
but if you think the
apology itself is going

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.180
to make a big difference,
there's deeper issues.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.190
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I'm Asian America.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.620
I always apologize.

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.750
[laughter]

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.570
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Ladies
and gentlemen, oops,

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.510
let's take a few questions,
and I'm going to start

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:39.570
with a Peace Corp volunteer
in Tonga.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:44.240
Adkins Trout [phonetic] has
a question for Reed Hastings.

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:48.860
Let us please go to the question
from Tonga, here is Adkins Trout.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:55.530
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Oh my
God, that looks great!

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:59.040
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Hi, my
name is Adkins Trout,

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.850
and I'm a Peace Corp
volunteer here in Tonga.

00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.700
I work in the education sector,

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.670
and my question today
is for Reed Hastings.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:19.780
In a world where the
gap between the rich

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.830
and the poor is rapidly
widening every day,

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:29.760 position:56%
what do you think are some of the
ways that service work can be useful

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.120
in helping privileged people

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:36.170
in the developed world
better understand their peers

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:37.500
in the developing world?

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.800
Thanks.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.100
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Well,
in the world-wide basis,

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.340
actually inequality has sharply
declined over the last 30 years.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.750
We've got many, many fewer
on a global basis and poverty

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:52.500
than we've ever had thanks to
the benefits of trade and of all

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.360
of the international work
that everyone is doing.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.760
But to get to the question, which
is how do you create more empathy

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.420
and awareness, some of that is
definitely through entertainment.

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.650
Some of our shows, like
Three Percent coming

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.690
out of Brazil is an
amazing show about elites

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:07.600
and the meritocracy
and very insightful.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.230
Another of our shows, Orange is the
New Black, is set here in the U.S.,

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:11.530
but it's a sector of the population

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.830
that very few people have
exposure to, women in prison.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.250
So often entertainment is really
what opens people's hearts

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:15.550
and gets them to connect
in what we're doing.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.850
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Wonderful.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.150
We have a question
from the University

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.450
of Hawaii for Secretary Chao.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.750
Victoria Cuba.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.340
We have that question coming--

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.640
&gt;&gt; My name is Victoria Cuba.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.620
I am a junior at the
University of Hawaii

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.020
at Manoa studying journalism
and digital media.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:35.180
My question is for secretary Chao.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.370
As the first Asian American
woman to be appointed

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:41.190
to the President's Cabinet and as a
former director of the Peace Corp,

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.740
what is the one inspirational
thing you would like to share

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:48.650
with other women of minority
looking to serve others?

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:55.600
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Have confidence in
yourself, don't be afraid, explore.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.910 position:56%
I mean when I was growing up, I knew
so little about mainstream America,

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:07.030
but I had wonderful parents, a
wonderful family, and they imbued

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.440
within me a tremendous gift,
and as I mentioned earlier,

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.640
that was the gift of curiosity.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:18.390
My parents, you know, sacrificed
so much to bring us to America,

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.870
and even though they could not
envision what futures lie ahead

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:26.850
of their six daughters, there were
six of us, they were confident

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.580
that this country will
offer them opportunities

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.270
that they cannot imagine
but that they knew existed.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:38.360
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: You were the eldest
of six daughters as I recall.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.660
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Yes.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.810
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Does the eldest
have a special responsibility

00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.220
or get special pressure?

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.520
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Of course.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.080
As Asian American families,
I'm the one in charge,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.060
and I take care of everybody.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.300
I don't know whether my sisters
will all agree that I'm the one

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.680
in charge, but I do
take care of everybody.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.270
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We'll
do one more question

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.690
from the University of Hawaii.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:01.680
This one is for Reed Hastings,
and the question comes

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.060
from a student, Tyler Gentile.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.510
&gt;&gt; Aloha. My name is Tyler Gentile.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.290
I'm a senior at the
University of Hawaii

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:10.870
at Manoa studying communications.

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.040
My question is for Mr. Hastings.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.620
How does your experience abroad
in the Peace Corp attribute

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.450
to your success as an entrepreneur?

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:21.520
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: I think the
experience abroad has helped me

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.340
tremendously in terms of
empathy in connect with people

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.540
that you didn't grow up with,
and fundamentally in business

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.790
and communications, it's trying
to get out of your own skin

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.620
and to understand how a message
might be received as opposed

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.530
to just what you're saying.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.250
And so you get a lot of practice

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.660
with that being a high school
math teacher in rural Swaziland.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:52.090
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I would like to
open up the floor now to questions

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:55.640
from the audience here
in Washington as well.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.060
I see a couple of hands going
up, two or three over here,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:03.600
and we have a microphone
coming down the-- good evening.

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.930
Thank you for joining
us, and speak right up.

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.230
&gt;&gt; Yes, good evening.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:11.330 position:56%
I have a short question for
secretary Chao and for Mr. Hastings.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.910
Secretary Chao, you mentioned
public private partnerships.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.870
Would you be open to them
in passenger rail as well?

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:23.060 position:56%
And to Mr. Hastings, do you see
there being I guess some the without

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.290 position:56%
or three skills that you took from
being that math teacher in Swaziland

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.780
that you say you use every
day in your current work?

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.430
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I'm so sorry,
I didn't hear the question.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.730
Would I be open to what?

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.100
&gt;&gt; Public private partnerships
in passenger rail,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.330
like long distance
passenger trains and the like.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.370
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I think that will
be very interesting to explore.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.110
&gt;&gt; Great. Thank you.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:47.600
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: And the
skills, I think, you know,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:54.120
are really what you learn in
teaching is classroom management,

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:59.310
public speaking, some of those
skills are some of the most useful.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.610
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Public speaking.

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.930
Get that students.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.030
I don't see a microphone on this--

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.400
oh yes, please go find someone over
here, and we'll get a microphone

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.970
to the next question over here.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.270
&gt;&gt; Hi, hello.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.770
Thank you, Madam Secretary and
Mr. Hastings for coming to speak.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.220
My question is about if you
think that there is a trend

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.670
in public service towards
or for the privileged,

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:27.110
and to give some context why I'm
asking this question is we see,

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:32.110
you know, on Capitol Hill,
many internships are,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:35.580
they don't offer a stipend let
along like the metro stipend,

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:38.640
and even within the federal
government, if you try to apply

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.510
for an internship, many of those
offered do not offer any kind

00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:44.580
of an assistance or
even a metro stipend.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.910
And so my question is, you know,
Madam Secretary, you had mentioned

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:52.120 position:56%
in the Peace Corp that there are
barriers because some people cannot,

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.630
you know, work for free
especially full-time hours,

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.770
and so what are your thoughts
on this, and how can we fix it

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.540
because obviously from
both of you speaking

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.420
that public service
is very important,

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:06.640
but there are economic
barriers, and it kind of sounds

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:10.550
like we've given some people, you
know, the vehicle and the key,

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:13.270
but there's no actual
gas in the car to,

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:14.570
you know, do public service, so--

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:15.870
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Practical question.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I'm not so negative.

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.770
I really think this country
has incredible opportunities,

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:26.430
and what I encourage in young
people and in parents is to believe

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.960
in the goodness of this country
and to find, be resourceful

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:33.450
and find different ways to
have different experiences.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:35.950
I think there are very
few people, like myself,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.760
who came to this country with
very, very little, but I was armed

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.330
with the most wealthy of assets,
and that is a sense of who I am,

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:51.350
and I was also fortified
by the love of my family.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:56.510
Armed those two tremendous
treasures, that gave me the courage

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.070
to out and explore and
do all sorts of things.

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:03.380
So I was on scholarship
during my years in college.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.560 position:56%
Then as our family situation got
better, I gave the scholarship back,

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:12.090
and now my family establishes
scholarships for others.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.280
So I think the most important
thing I would say is never give

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.580
up because there's

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:20.900
so many philanthropic
organizations in this country.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.200
I was head of United Way.

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.410
I was director of the Peace Corp.
When I was head of United Way,

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:28.530
I never felt that I was
begging anyone for money.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:32.660
It felt that I was giving them
an opportunity to participate

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:35.870
in the ground floor on
something bigger than themselves,

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.640
more important than themselves.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:41.520
There's so many generous
benefactors who want to help,

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.440
and so there are many ways you know
to connect those in need with those

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.470 position:56%
who want to give, and that's part of
the function of the social sector,

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:56.050 position:56%
the volunteer sector, so I just
really encourage people, number one,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:49:00.080
not be afraid, because when I
first came to America, if anything,

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.420
if I can something to
the young Elaine Chao,

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.520
it would be don't be afraid.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:07.050
There are so many people
who want to be of help.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.380
So [inaudible] yourselves, find
what you love to do, and go out

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.170
and help find others who
can help make that happen.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.470
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Could
you add to that Reed?

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:16.770
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: I think
that was a great answer.

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.070
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: If you
don't have the resources,

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:19.370
how do you go find them?

00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:21.660
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: I don't have
anything to add to that one.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.960
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Okay.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.650
We have a microphone right here.

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:26.420
I'll get to you shortly.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.610
Yes? Can you stand and thank you?

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.490
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for
this informative panel.

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:36.960
My name is Contesa Verbon
[phonetic] from the New York Times.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:41.120
I'd like to ask the panelists, how
do you make Peace Corp relevant

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:49.250
in view of [inaudible] has Peace
Corp withdrawn from other countries

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:53.050
that are involved in extremism.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.800
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I believe the
acting Peace Corp director is here.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.100
I hope to see her.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:58.400
I have not seen her yet.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.790
The Peace Corp is in so
many different countries.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:02.090
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Yeah, please stand.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:03.390
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: You should get
up and answer this question.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.190
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Please
stand, thank you [inaudible].

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:10.040
[ Applause ]

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.340
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Peace
Corp is involved

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.540
in so many different countries, and
I think in an international world

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.840
in which we are in,
Peace Corp volunteers

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.740
who understand other cultures,
who understand America,

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:22.210
can be great bridges
of understanding

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:26.040
in an increasingly
complicated international world.

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:28.240
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Find her afterward.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.150
We have another microphone.

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.030
Yes, right here.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.330
Please stand.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:37.590
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Liz, and I was
inspired by my Peace Corp service

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.960
in Morocco to start something
called Corp Africa [phonetic],

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.260
which is Peace Corp for Africa.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.550
And they are so proud to be,
they're inspired by Americans,

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.570
but they love their countries.

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:55.120
And I would be so honored to
pass along your advice to them

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:59.190
as they try to create a
service, a cultural service

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.970
in [inaudible] countries.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.250
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Thank you.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:06.450
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Are
you asking for advice?

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:11.420 position:56%
I think what you are doing is great,
and it's emblematic of what one

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.950 position:56%
of the impacts of the Peace Corp
is, which is changing the volunteers

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:19.540
so that when they come back to the
U.S. that they're a voice for all

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:20.840
of these kinds of efforts.

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.150
So it's great, thank you.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:25.640
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: We have
a microphone over here,

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.970
and then I promise I'll
get it down here to you.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:29.270
Yes, thank you.

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.210
&gt;&gt; Hi, Secretary Chao, my
name is Jen-tu [phonetic].

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.990
I'm very proud of you
as an Asian American

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.740
to serve our country
for so many years.

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:38.040
Thank you for doing that.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.340
I brought my daughter, 13
years old, to get inspired.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.050
I myself came to the
country 22 years ago,

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:50.260 position:56%
and I went to [inaudible] leadership
program in Montgomery county,

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.010
Maryland, and I found very few
immigrants, first-generation,

00:51:55.010 --> 00:51:59.520
that's how I call myself, to be in
those leadership programs and offer

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:02.840
to do a certain level
of public service.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.120
And I still find myself, right
now I dedicated myself to,

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.430
I run a small business but
try to encourage community

00:52:10.430 --> 00:52:14.730 position:56%
to participate more in the social
and political and political activity

00:52:14.730 --> 00:52:18.120
in the United States to
be 100 percent American.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:23.300
But I found myself very challenging
to change the mentality of people

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.820 position:56%
like me to be fully participate in
the society because they always say,

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:31.060
hey, you know, maybe my language

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:35.720
or maybe my culture is not
fully adapted to the country.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.690
So what is your suggestion to
the first-generation Americans

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:46.340
like myself, to be able to fully
participate in the American life.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.270
Thank you.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:50.480
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: You know, I
understand their plight very well

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.770
because when you're first
generation, I'm first generation,

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.370
you worry about survival.

00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:59.640
You just want to have
financial security.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:04.780
So for a lot of these first
generation their first priority is

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.120
to be able to be financially secure
and take care of their families.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.530 position:56%
I am confident that as their
financial situation gets better they

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:18.910 position:56%
will become more and more integrated

00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:22.990
and take a larger role
in mainstream America.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:27.570
I think as their children
becomes better assimilated

00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:29.990
that they would take a
larger and larger role.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:32.510
So I complement you
for your efforts.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:36.410
I want you to kind of continue
because I think it's important,

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.220
and I have faith and hope

00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:44.700
that as people get more financially
secure they are turning out.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:46.930
But then in the meantime I
ask them also to get involved

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:48.560
in their local communities.

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:52.900
So for my parents, my mother
didn't speak English, it was very,

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.960
they were very active in the
Chinese American community,

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.590
and I thought that
was important as well.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:00.890
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Thank
you for that question.

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:03.380
We have one over.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:04.680
Hi.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:08.310
&gt;&gt; Hello. I have a
question for Secretary Chao.

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:12.660
You mentioned that when you
entered the Peace Corp you wanted

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:18.270
to bring the diversity
of American into the Corp

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:22.750
such as recruiting people from
different ethnicities perhaps,

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:27.190
perhaps some different
economic statuses as well.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:30.210
What about the diversity of age.

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.050
Lillian Carter of course was
famous for going to India

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:36.690
when she was in her late 60s.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.940
How common is that, and of course
there's life-long learning,

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:44.760 position:56%
but there's also life-long teaching.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:54.270
And many of our mature older
people do have the time

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:56.380
to volunteer for the Peace Corp.

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.360
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: It sounds
like we've got a new volunteer.

00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.630
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I think
that's a great observation,

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:08.680
and I think Peace Corp, again the
acting Peace Corp director is here,

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.820
Peace Corp has always had a certain
percentage of more mature citizens,

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:19.380
but I will point out that Peace
Corp volunteers work in very,

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.700
very difficult positions.

00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:27.360
And so in some of these
localities that the health needs

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:32.580 position:56%
of someone who's more mature becomes
more important, and the remote areas

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:34.880
of Peace Corp volunteers
are assigned,

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:38.370
and sometimes the lengthier access

00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:44.350
to healthcare facilities could
be a factor in recruiting more

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:47.150
of more mature Americans.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:49.200
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I don't know
what the current numbers are,

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.990
but I expect during your tenure--

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:53.290
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Sorry.

00:55:53.290 --> 00:55:54.590
It's hay fever, not the cold.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:56:00.490
During your tenure, the number
of retirees or senior Americans

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:04.580
who had the time to devote for that
was a small percentage of this?

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.730
&gt;&gt; It was about 10 percent usually.

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:08.430
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Can I ask
the acting Peace Corp director.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.230
Please, yes.

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.130
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.430
&gt;&gt; So my name is Sheila Crowley.

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.760
I'm the acting director of
the Peace Corp. And a couple

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.290
of points on the diversity.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:24.120
I just want to point out that
we have a made amazing strides

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.500
in representing the face
of America, and 36 percent

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.720
of our applicants are
now ethnically,

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.000 position:56%
represent as ethnically diverse, and
what we call our onward strength,

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.880
meaning the volunteers in the
field, is about 28 percent

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.580
up from 14 percent since 2010.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.130 position:56%
So were making really great strides,

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.840
and we have good strategies,
and it's working.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:50.310
In terms of age diversity, which
we also recognize as a need,

00:56:50.310 --> 00:56:54.800
it's only about seven percent of
50 plus, but we have a program

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.400
for both called Peace Corp response

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:02.130
where our short-term targeted
project based assignments

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:05.100
that are sort of tailored
to people with experience

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.830 position:56%
and generally those are older folks.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:12.660
So we are very open and welcoming
to people who are 50 plus.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.970
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Let me ask
you two quick followups.

00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:18.320
When you talk about a
short-term targeted program,

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.900
that might be very, very attractive
to somebody who is just about to,

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.800
you know, to retire from workforce
but doesn't want to sit home.

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.320
Are you talking about two or
three weeks, five or six months,

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:32.060
or does each project have
a different character?

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:39.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So it depends on the project and
the country and the need, but three,

00:57:39.110 --> 00:57:48.990
six, nine, twelve months, and then
actually I do just want to point

00:57:48.990 --> 00:58:00.420 position:56%
out that our, I think our oldest
serving volunteer just left Morocco.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.170
She's 85 years old.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:05.470
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Wow.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:06.770
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Awesome.

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:12.640
&gt;&gt; She's pretty amazing, and
I was a country director,

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.570
and my oldest volunteer was 80.

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:20.720 position:56%
And that also sent a powerful
message to our partners in the field

00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.610
that we were never too
old or young to serve.

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:26.680
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: And may I
ask you one other question

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.180
which had come in, which had come

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.290
in from a Hawaii student asking
how can you, what can you say

00:58:34.290 --> 00:58:37.580
to minorities and nontraditional
volunteers to encourage them

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:43.270 position:56%
to go ahead and explore the
possibility of a Peace Corp service?

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:47.320
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I would
say is talk to a recruiter,

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:50.720
and we have recruiters
around the United States,

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.570
but the other thing I
would say is I think

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.680
in the past Peace Corp would often
be sort of viewed as something

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.500
that you sort of did
after college to get away

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.790
and to have a great experience,

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:04.400
but you were really
putting your career on hold.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.650
I think Peace Corp now
is a career accelerator.

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:08.510
It always has been, but we've
really sort of in the 21st Century

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:09.810
with the Internet and all
the different projects

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.420
that volunteers are doing, there's
incredible benefits in terms

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:12.890
of leadership development,
flexibility, adaptability,

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.390
all the things that were mentioned,
and then we have benefits.

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:15.690
We have a scholarship program

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:16.990
that return Peace Corp volunteers
can apply to for graduate school

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:18.290
after Peace Corp. It's
called the Fellows program.

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:19.590
And then we also have a
readjustment allowance

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:21.080
that helps them get started when
they reenter the United States.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.380
So we have lots of benefits
that would serve them.

00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Thank you very much.

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.480
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.170
[ Applause ]

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:30.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: I think we have time

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.770
for one more question
from the audience.

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:33.530
Yes, you've been very
patient waiting.

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:34.830
Thank you so much.

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:36.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:38.870
Glenn Bluehorse, president of
National Peace Corp Association,

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.470
and I served in the Peace Corp
in Guatemala in 1988 to '91.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.810
Secretary Chao, thank you for
your decades of public service

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:48.650
and national service and Reed for
your service in the Peace Corp

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:51.450
and elsewhere, and you
are very inspiring,

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:54.270
and this is certainly an evening
of inspiration and for service.

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:57.460
As a matter of fact, thanks to
the great recruitment process

00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.780
that Peace Corp has
now, over 20,000,

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:04.000
sometimes close 25,000
individuals are applying to serve

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.150
in the Peace Corp, but with
funding for only 7000 volunteers

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:12.020
at any given time, thousands of
individuals, American citizens,

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.580
young global citizens, young
citizens who would like to serve

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:16.770
in the Peace Corp don't
have that opportunity.

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:18.070
What can with do about that?

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.670
And the question is for
either or both of you.

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:24.180
How can we ensure that those
Americans have the opportunity

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.890
to serve?

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Why I think what's
been amazing about the Peace Corp is

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:30.490
that it's very, I have
the numbers approximately

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:34.370
from 2500 to 5000 down to four.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.710
I didn't know it was up to
seven now and that it's been

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:40.570
over 50 years quite
a stable program.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.910
So you wouldn't want
to grow it too quickly.

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:47.320
I think you might see a whole
number of side effects of that,

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.680
and on balance, it's been
incredible bipartisan support

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.090
in good and bad budget times.

01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:58.490
The funding's been really reliable
compared to many federal programs,

01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:02.920
and so I think we should also just
be positive about what we've got

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.540
in the Peace Corp for the budget.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.280
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Can I just
go back to the question,

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.130
one of the previous
question was asked.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.940
I think it's also important, again,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.490
speaking from the Asian
American perspective, you know,

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:17.820
for us I think it's really
important that we help our parents,

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.170
and I say this to young people.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:23.490
Their parents may not understand
what Peace Corp is all about.

01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:26.540
So for these young people,

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.380
who at least in the Asian American
community, you have to kind

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:34.730
of convince your parents that
this is a good path forward.

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:37.030
And so I would encourage
young people to kind

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:40.400
of explain what Peace Corp is as
they make this decision, you know,

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.610
to those around them,
so that they understand

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.600
and will support that decision.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:49.170
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: As a moderator,
I'm going to take the opportunity

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.050
to not ask the last question.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:56.840 position:56%
We have one more videotaped question
from a Peace Corp volunteer,

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.390
who is in Guatemala, and let me
introduce now Susanna Gonzales.

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.500
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is
Susanna Gonzales.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:07.370
I'm a Peace Corp volunteer

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.320
in Guatemala working
on youth development.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:14.620
My question is for both
secretary Chao and Mr. Hastings.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.100
How do we make opportunities
to serve an organization

01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:21.790
such as the Peace Corp more
assessible to those who come

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:25.890
from disadvantaged
communities in the states?

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.720
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Well,
we have touched on this,

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.200
but let me give both of you a
chance to sum up your thoughts.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:35.060
I love the fact that she's
on a rooftop with the horns--

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.590
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: A dog--

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:37.900
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: With
the dogs barking

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:42.250
and the true Peace Corp experience.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:48.510
If you could sum up how you think
the skills that you have been able

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:51.110
to learn from not only
the leadership

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:54.370
but in business would
translate into bringing some

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:57.730
of those less traditional
volunteers into--

01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.200
start with you, Secretary Chao.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.330
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I think Rick needs
to answer this because Rick is

01:03:01.330 --> 01:03:04.410
so extraordinarily successful,
and people don't think

01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:07.520
about the transition from Peace
Corp into the business sector,

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.930
so I think you would have a
lot of encouragement to offer.

01:03:10.930 --> 01:03:14.330
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: Yeah, in
answering our volunteer's question,

01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:17.970 position:56%
the Peace Corp in the last 10 or 15
years has made a big effort in terms

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:20.690
of diversifying, and you
heard some of the numbers,

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:22.900
and so I really think we're
on the right course, you know,

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:27.750 position:56%
as finding great role models, where,
you know, it's not just white men

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.510
and white women, you know, talking
about how great the Peace Corp was

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.730
because people, you know, follow
the role models that they see.

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:38.510
And so as we have more volunteers
like Susanna, I think it's natural

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.500
that it's spreading and so I
think it's a really big success.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:42.800
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Last word?

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.220
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I think
that the life skills

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:51.010
that Peace Corp volunteers learn
is very helpful and very applicable

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:57.200
to all aspects of life and also in
any chosen occupation or career.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:02.590
The qualities of flexibility,
curiosity, and being resourceful.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:06.400
I mean these Peace Corp volunteers
are thrown into pretty interesting

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.160
and unexpected circumstances
and situations,

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.990
and they have to learn how to
adjust and be problem solvers.

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:16.290
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: We're
going to get you back

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:18.070
as a second term Peace
Corp director.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:21.510
You have such passion for it.

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:23.730
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: I'll go back
as a Peace Corp volunteer.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:25.030
&gt;&gt; Reed Hastings: A volunteer next.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.330
Okay.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.010
&gt;&gt; Ann Compton: Thanks to the
internet world, we live in a world

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.770 position:56%
where we all think we know much more
about the world than we used to,

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:37.380
but there's nothing like
boots on the ground and living

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:42.000
within another culture to not only
appreciate what they are going

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.130
through but what the United States
has in terms of values, standards,

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:50.980
business, practices, and
human-to-human contact

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:52.450
that really makes it exceptional.

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:57.300
Thank you so much, Secretary Elaine
Chao, Rick Hastings of Netflix,

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.370
and thank you all for joining us.

01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:01.170
&gt;&gt; Elaine Chao: Thank you.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:08.510
[ Applause ]

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:09.810
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Thank
you all so much.

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.110
What a wonderful panel.

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:13.530
We're deeply grateful to Secretary
Chao and Reed Hastings today.

01:05:13.530 --> 01:05:15.640
They came a long way
to be here tonight,

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.050
and we're grateful
to Ann Compton also.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:22.550 position:56%
We're always grateful to Mrs. Inouye
and the Daniel K. Inouye Institute,

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.860
and we're so happy that we
had the students in Hawaii

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:28.170
on the two campuses and the
many Peace Corp volunteers

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.470
around the world.

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:32.900 position:56%
We couldn't see all of you, but we
felt your service and your idealism,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.940
and we're inspired by you.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.090
The Kluge Center and the Inouye
Institute will be putting forth two

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:42.050
more programs in this series
over the next two years.

01:05:42.050 --> 01:05:45.730
