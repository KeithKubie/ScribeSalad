00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.773
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi, guys. That was pretty incredible, wasn't it?

00:00:02.773 --> 00:00:06.284
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually, Susan, no. We missed it. That happened really quickly.

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:10.161
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It did happen quickly. Actually, the lowest any of our contestants could hear

00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.972
was only 0 decibels.

00:00:11.972 --> 00:00:14.155
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What? Susan, 0? That sounds pretty low.

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:19.214
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is low, but that is actually the threshold of the average human hearing. I

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:23.485
was really hoping to go into the negative decibels today but what can you do?

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.571
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, thanks Susan.

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:26.118
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anytime.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:30.464
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, I guess we didn't see any records set for volume threshold today.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.132
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, we certainly did not, I'm actually a little bit pointed with our

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.754
performance. But, but what are you going to do?

00:00:35.754 --> 00:00:38.407
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, I know on the plus side, I bet our sponsors are happy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:38.407 --> 00:00:40.970
You're absolutely right, actually. let's, let's go to them, now.
