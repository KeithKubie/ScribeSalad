00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:08.990
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon and welcome to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.880
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.260
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce science writer Sam

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.970
Kean.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.910
As you know, no one brings in
more speakers on neuroscience

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.560
than this office.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.850
Last Halloween, Tim
Verstynen spoke eloquently

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.930
on the neuroscience
of the zombie brain,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.900
and today Sam will
discuss his newest book,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.800
"The Tale of the
Dueling Neurosurgeons:

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.320
The History of the
Human Brain as Revealed

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.410
by True Stories of Trauma,
Madness, and Recovery."

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.820
In this book he shows
how neuroscience

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.930
developed over the centuries.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.040
The old fashioned way scientists
would wait for misfortune

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.710
to strike in the form
of strokes, seizures,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.290
infectious diseases,
horrendous accidents,

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.600
and see how the victims coped.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.440
Speaking of accidents,
are there any descendants

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.450
of the French house
of Valois here today?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.450
Show of hands?

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.510
OK.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.590
Because the book's
title refers to what

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.890
happened after King
Henri II or Henry II

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.030
was lanced through the skull
during a joust in 1559.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.890
Sam has written two previous
books, "The Disappearing Spoon:

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.280
And Other True Tales
of Madness, Love,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.810
and the History of the
World from the Periodic

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.800
Table of the Elements,"
and "The Violinist's Thumb:

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.380
And Other Lost Tales of
Love, War, and Genius

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.970
as Written by Our Genetic Code."

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.220
Please join me in
welcoming Sam Kean.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.750
SAM KEAN: Well hello, everyone.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.020
Thank you all for joining
me this afternoon.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.310
So people often
want to know what

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.920
inspired you to write a book.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.750
And with this book
what inspired me

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.320
was doubt, or
skepticism, or mistrust,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.640
whatever you want to call it.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.960
Because a few years
ago I was reading

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.860
about someone who
suffered a brain injury,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.960
and his behavior changed in this
really drastic way after it.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.050
And I was reading
this story and I just

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.490
said to myself, you
know, bull sugar.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.790
I said, there's no way
that this story is true.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.600
It's just-- his
behavior was too odd.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.924
I just didn't believe it.

00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:29.340
Anyway, I kind of
forgot about it.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.045
And then I read about something
a few weeks later very similar.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:33.830
A woman suffered a brain injury.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.490
Her behavior changed in this
really specific, strange way

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.250
and I thought, baloney.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.230
I thought, there's no way
that can possibly be true.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.890
So I set out to try to
disapprove these stories

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.590
and I ended up, in the
end, proving myself wrong.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320
These stories were true.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.130
But I realized that they offered
kind of an interesting insight

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.610
into the way the brain works.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.877
So what kind of
stories were these?

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:02.210
Well, I'm sure we've all heard
stories of people getting

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.644
injured and then they
lose the ability to speak,

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:08.060
or their memory
goes on the blink,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.876
or they're paralyzed in part of
their body, things like that.

00:03:10.876 --> 00:03:13.000
So it wasn't stories like
that, because I'd already

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.606
heard things like that.

00:03:14.606 --> 00:03:16.230
Instead these were
stories about things

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.425
they were very startlingly
specific talents

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:22.210
that people lost.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.260
For instance, I think we
all know generally what

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.160
kind of animals are
in this picture here?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.070
Even if we don't know
the genus and species,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.990
we can generally
recognize what they are.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.110
But if you get nicked in
the temporal lobe in one

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.910
specific spot--
the temporal lobe

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.540
is on the side of your brain.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.400
You get nicked in one specific
spot, all knowledge of animals

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.270
can just disappear
out of your mind.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.950
These people can still tell
plants apart just fine.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.060
They can recognize different
people's faces no problem.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.940
But elephants, dogs, raccoons,
turtles, whatever, they all

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.970
look exactly the same to them.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.880
They cannot tell
these animals apart.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.080
Or kind of the opposite
thing can happen.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.050
Maybe some people can
recognize animals just fine,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.690
but all knowledge of plants
just sort of-- poof--

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.860
disappears out of their mind.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.720
And what's going on here
is that our ancestors way,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.200
way back when, some people
were better than others

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.890
at recognising and
remembering certain animals,

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.065
certain plants,
things like that.

00:04:22.065 --> 00:04:24.690
And it turns out the people who
were really good at remembering

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.890
animals, plants, and
could classify them--

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.190
that these animals
are good to eat,

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.300
these animals are
dangerous, these animals are

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.740
good companions.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.820
Those people kind
of had an advantage

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.180
over the people who
were bad at recognizing,

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.830
telling other animals
apart, things like that.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.050
And eventually this
sort of ability

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.400
to recognize animals and plants
got hard wired into our brain.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.880
It gave those people
a big advantage.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.570
But the downside of
having the hard wiring

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.830
is that if that spot of
the brain gets injured,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.307
that knowledge
can just disappear

00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:58.140
and you're going to
have a deficit suddenly.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.940
So that's what kind of was
going on with these people.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.730
Again, kind of giving an insight
into how the brain evolved,

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.090
a little bit about its history.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.830
The other story
I heard I thought

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.737
was maybe even a
little stranger.

00:05:10.737 --> 00:05:12.820
Again, we've all heard
stories about people who've

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.250
been injured in one
part of their brain

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.880
and suddenly they lose
the ability to speak.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.950
They just can't form
words, can't get

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.600
sentences out of them.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.130
But sometimes what's
actually going on

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.460
is that the language centers
of the brain are actually OK.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.060
They're undamaged.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.500
What's damaged is the wires that
connect the language centers

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.080
to the mouth, the teeth,
the tongue, and the lips.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.580
So again, the
language center is OK.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.800
It's that the wires sending
the information are broken.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.590
But one thing you learn
about neuroscience

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.280
when you start reading
is that there's

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.120
a lot of different
ways for information

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.850
to move around in the brain.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.620
There's a lot of back
alleys, a lot of detours,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.870
things like that.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.870
Information can go through
a lot of different routes.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.360
So sometimes the
direct connection

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.310
is broken but there
are back alleys

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.370
that the information can take.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.540
Specifically, there
are back alleys

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.900
that go from the
language centers

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.720
to the emotional
centers of the brain,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.840
and from the emotional
centers they can still

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.430
access the teeth, the
tongue, and the lips.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.050
So when you're talking
to these people

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.550
where the direct
connection's broken

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.380
but this back route through
the emotions is still there,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.170
you try to engage
them in conversation,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.820
they just can't
get the words out.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.760
They're just
struggling to speak.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.180
But if you provoke
them, you get them mad,

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.680
you start to rile
them up a little bit,

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.660
they can swear at you just fine.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.190
They'll say you
beepity-beep-beep,

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.830
and then, you know, they'll
sort of grab their mouth

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.470
because in a lot of
cases they didn't even

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.350
realize that they
could swear like this.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.810
It just sort of bubbles up
out of them unconsciously.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.940
Another thing that can
happen, very similar,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.550
is there are connections
sometimes between the language

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.050
centers, the parts of the
brain that process music,

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.400
and from there it can get
to the teeth, the tongue,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.520
and the lips.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.220
And with these people
they can't speak again

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.400
but they can sing
song lyrics just fine.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.110
An example of this was
Gabrielle Giffords,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.970
the Congresswoman from Arizona.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.550
A few years ago after
she got shot in the head,

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.770
she lost the ability to
speak, but she could still

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.580
sing a lot of song lyrics.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.360
She was singing songs like
"Girls Just Want to Have Fun."

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.830
And I don't know why Cindy
Lauper was the song that

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.740
ended up sticking in her
head, but she actually

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.820
re-learned,
re-taught herself how

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.060
to speak by practicing
singing these song lyrics over

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.680
and over again.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.870
And I was sitting there thinking
to myself one day like, wow.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.520
I bet you could write a whole
history of the brain just sort

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.880
of based on these
different injuries

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.820
and what each one teaches you
about how the brain works,

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.980
what that part does, et cetera.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.970
And then sort of the
cartoon light bulb

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.850
went off over my head and
I said, oh boy, you know,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.580
I should write a book like that.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.160
That would be a lot of fun.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.070
And so that's where
this book came from,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.550
was trying to prove those
other stories wrong, but not

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.019
only proving that
they were correct

00:08:04.019 --> 00:08:06.310
but finding out that it had
a lot of interesting things

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.020
to say about the
history of the brain.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.580
Because until the
past few decades or so

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.930
there really only was one
way to study the brain.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.530
You had to wait for injuries to
strike people and then see how

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.950
their minds changed afterward.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.880
Sometimes these were tumors
or gun shots, lobotomies

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.350
that went wrong, rabies
infections, all these sorts

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.640
of different things.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.659
And there were some really
miraculous tales of recovery

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.669
out there.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:37.240
But if people's bodies
recovered, their minds didn't.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.840
At least not quite.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.070
Because there was often
something a little off,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.850
something a little unusual
about the people afterward.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.490
Some people started
lying incessantly,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.820
some people lost
all fear of death,

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.250
parents suddenly couldn't
recognize their children

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.360
anymore.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.390
But in each case it gave
a very important clue

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.800
about what that specific
area of the brain did.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.160
And basically all of
the major breakthroughs

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.330
in the history of
neuroscience came about

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.070
because of these sorts of cases.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.620
And stories are probably more
important to neuroscience

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.080
than maybe any other
scientific field out there.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.140
So I'm happy to be able to share
a few of those stories with you

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.080
this afternoon.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.150
So we're going to start with
something sort of visceral,

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.000
kind of a basic brain
function, and that is emotions.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.620
So here's a picture of
something that, if you saw it--

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.540
or if you actually saw
this in real life--

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.980
it would probably
cause an emotion

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.870
to rise up inside of you.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.229
So just a quick overview of
some of the emotional structures

00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:40.770
in the brain.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.103
And don't worry too much about
all the details, but just

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:44.450
a quick overview.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.700
If a big tiger jumped
up in front of you

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.660
like this, first thing
that would happen,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.430
obviously, is your
eyes, your ears,

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.990
your senses would take
in the information

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.400
and they would send it to a
structure in the center there

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.950
called the thalamus, the big
oval, the yellow oval there

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.020
in the middle.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.150
The thalamus is
really a relay center.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.110
It takes information
in and starts

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.800
sending it to other parts of
the brain for more processing.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.860
One of the places it
sends the information

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.970
is to the hippocampus,
the long green thing

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.800
going around the outside.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.870
I'll talk a little bit
more about that later,

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.760
but the hippocampus
is basically involved

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.260
with forming and
storing memories.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.910
That's its basic role.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.950
Another place the thalamus sends
information is to the amygdala.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.840
The amygdala is
involved in processing

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.520
a lot of different emotions,
but its basic job is to say, OK,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.500
so what?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.560
There's something
in front of me.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.030
I'm getting some information
about it, but so what?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.200
Should I care about
this thing or not?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.770
And in this case the amygdala
is going to say, OK, you know,

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.460
there's this big
cat in front of me.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.440
It's growling.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.940
It's starting to run at me.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.690
It's probably something I
should care about right now.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:53.230
So it's going to
send information

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.820
to another structure called the
hypothalamus, the purple thing

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.580
there.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.300
And what the
hypothalamus does is

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.580
it's really kind
of the interaction

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.510
between the brain the body.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.314
So the hypothalamus is going to
give you a shot of adrenaline.

00:11:06.314 --> 00:11:07.980
It's going to make
you want to run away.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.190
It's going to make you
want to do something

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.544
with that information.

00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:13.210
So there's other parts
of the brain that

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.918
do get involved with
emotions, but that's

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:17.630
kind of a basic overview
of the limbic system,

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.150
kind of how the emotional
centers in the brain work.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.050
But because these are
organic brain structures,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.410
if you suffered damage
to one of these parts

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.360
this process can go awry.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.820
And this story of one of these
emotional centers going awry

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.800
involves a woman who
was born in Iowa.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:45.120
She was growing up there in the
1960s, and when she was young

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.970
she had perfectly normal
emotional responses.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.570
In particular, she had a
perfectly normal fear response.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.620
So for instance,
when she was young

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.590
she was at her
neighbor's house one day

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.910
and she remembered
a doberman came out

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.370
and it kind of cornered
her in the kitchen.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.360
Her heart started pounding,
her throat went dry.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.920
Pretty typical fear response.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.590
But at about the
age of nine or ten

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.490
she came down with
the very rare disease

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.180
that ended up destroying both
of the amygdala in her brain.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.600
She was left with what
her doctors described

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.520
as two black holes where
her amygdala should be.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.910
And basically since that point
she has not felt a lick of fear

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.450
in her life.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.990
And studies involving
this woman--

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.146
in the medical literature
she's known as SM.

00:12:35.146 --> 00:12:37.562
I'm just going to call her
Sarah, just to kind of give her

00:12:37.562 --> 00:12:38.650
a name.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.190
But stories involving
Sarah are actually

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.160
kind of a hoot to read
about because they basically

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.150
involve scientists
trying to think up

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.780
ever-more-elaborate
ways to frighten her.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.700
So for instance, one time
they decided, well, you know,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.860
we're going to drive
her to this pet store.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.280
We're going to expose her
to some spiders and snakes,

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.004
see how she reacts to that.

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:00.170
Now, on the drive to the
pet store Sarah was saying,

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.530
you know, I'm not
really that into snakes.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.870
I don't think I'm going to like
this whole experience a lot.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.750
But once she got
there she practically

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.415
jumped out of the car, ran
inside, grabbed the snake out

00:13:12.415 --> 00:13:15.200
of the clerk's hand, let
it wrap itself around her.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.160
She started playing with it.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.360
You know, she was
having a good time.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.150
And the part I remember reading
about that was really startling

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.270
was that the snake--
it was, like,

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.900
flicking its tongue at her.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.073
And every time it tried to
flick its tongue at her,

00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:32.050
Sarah was trying to grab
on to the snake's tongue,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.100
like trying to time
it and grab it.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.760
And I admit, I'm
no reptile expert,

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.840
but I'm pretty
sure snakes do not

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.770
like having their tongues
grabbed like that.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.797
They don't respond well to that.

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:43.630
But she didn't care.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.690
She was having fun and just
playing with this snake.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.120
Another thing they
tried to do is

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.970
they tried to bring
to this haunted house.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.120
It was in an old lunatic asylum.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.090
There were a lot of dark corners
and creaking floorboards,

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.260
pretty spooky.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.350
They matched her up with five
other women about her age

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.770
as kind of a control
group and they sent her

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.344
through this haunted house
to see what would happen.

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.760
And the other women, they were
kind of ducking their eyes,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.640
they would scream
every once in a while.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.910
You know, pretty typical
responses in a haunted house.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.740
But Sarah didn't care.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.490
Sarah would look at
in and kind of go, eh,

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.698
and then kind of wander
ahead, kind of wandering into

00:14:17.698 --> 00:14:20.750
places she shouldn't have been,
poking her nose into areas.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.350
And toward the end of the
trip through the haunted house

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.284
this monster jumped out.

00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:27.950
It was an actor in a
costume, obviously.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.320
But a monster jumped
out and said, rawr,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.095
and tried to scare her.

00:14:32.095 --> 00:14:34.537
And Sarah didn't blink, she
just kind of looked at it.

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:36.120
But she got kind of
curious because it

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.912
had kind of this bloody
goo on the side of its mask

00:14:38.912 --> 00:14:40.620
and she wanted to know
what it felt like,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.110
so she started walking
toward the monster.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.240
Then she kind of lunged at it.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.350
And she actually ended
up scaring the monster,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.950
because he didn't expect
to get backed down

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.990
into a corner in this
little haunted house.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.240
So every test they would
run her through they

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.370
could not find any
situation where she looked

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.480
like she was feeling fear.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.700
But they want to be good
scientists about this

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.890
so they said, well, let's
explore some other things.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.530
One thing they wanted
to make sure of-- she's

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.440
obviously not showing fear,
but maybe she's just sort of

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.010
blunted to all emotions.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.150
Maybe fear is just
an obvious one,

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.280
but maybe she really can't
feel any emotions very well.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.010
So what they did is they started
showing her a bunch of movie

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.760
clips, you know, happy,
sad, disgusting scenes,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.070
seeing how she reacted.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:29.830
And it turns out
Sarah was experiencing

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.350
these other emotions just fine.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.500
In fact, she was sort
of overly-emotional

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.850
in these other cases.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.800
She was happy at the right
times, sat at the right times,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.610
disgusted at other
times, but fear--

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.280
she just wasn't feeling fear.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.250
And that's kind of the
first big insight you

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.110
can get from studying
people like Sarah,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.560
is that, for whatever
reason, you really

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.010
need an amygdala to feel fear.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.190
The amygdala is involved
in processing lots

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.510
of different emotions,
but the other emotions

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.600
can go on one of
those back alleys.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.310
They can take one of
those detours in the brain

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.970
and still get processed
in other ways.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.590
But for some reason
the amygdala-- or fear,

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.370
I should say-- really
needs the amygdala.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.320
It really has to
be intact or you're

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.677
going to struggle with
the fear response.

00:16:15.677 --> 00:16:17.260
So again, that's
kind of a big insight

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.450
we can get that we wouldn't
have gotten unless they'd

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.700
suffered damage to the
amygdala and just sort of taken

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.939
it offline like that.

00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:26.480
Another thing these
scientists wanted

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.140
to make sure of
though was-- you know,

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.180
these were all sort of
contrived situations

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.600
that they were putting Sarah in.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.190
Nothing much is going to
happen at the haunted house.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.840
It's pretty safe in reality.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.730
And even at the pet
store with the snakes

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.190
there was a clerk there,
there were people there,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.773
they weren't giving her the most
poisonous snakes or anything.

00:16:44.773 --> 00:16:47.170
Like, she was probably
not in that much danger.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.110
So they wanted to know were
there any situations in real

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.790
life were she actually should
have felt fear but she just

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.405
didn't?

00:16:54.405 --> 00:16:57.810
And it turns out there was
one of these incidents, what

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.360
I call the Knife Incident.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.109
So Sarah was in her
home town one day.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:09.790
She was walking home through
the dark-- already a bad idea--

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.680
and she decides he's going to
cut through this unlit park.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:17.440
So she's walking through
there and she sees this man

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.970
on a bench off to the side.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.896
She later described him as
looking really drugged out.

00:17:21.896 --> 00:17:23.479
The man noticed her
and he called out.

00:17:23.479 --> 00:17:25.420
He said, hey, come over here.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.520
So Sarah said, OK.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.520
And she walked right over
to where this man was.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.370
Immediately he jumped
up, he had a knife,

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:35.950
he spun her around and held
the knife to her throat.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.200
So they later asked
her, you know,

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.500
what was going through your
mind at this moment when

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.670
you had the knife at
your throat like this?

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:46.180
And she remembered thinking
it was kind of inconvenience

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.370
that he'd done this and
she was a little angry,

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.210
like, she was going to
be late getting home now.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:54.970
But, you know, the things
that we would fear, like,

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.910
oh my god I'm going to
die-- those things just

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.640
weren't going through her head.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.770
She wasn't happy, but
she wasn't scared either.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.820
She just wasn't
getting this response.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.150
And after a minute
or two the man

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.340
noticed she wasn't, like,
panicking, struggling,

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.910
or anything and
Sarah said to him,

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.364
God's angels are
going to protect me.

00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:18.530
And then after that the man
got a little weirded out

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.300
and he pulled the knife away
and just kind of backed off.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.210
And instead of running,
sprinting for her life,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.670
Sarah just kind to brushed
herself off and just kept

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.100
going through the park.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.140
Next day she went right back
to the park, cut right back

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.530
through the park again.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.920
She really was incapable
of feeling fear even

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.860
in these really dire,
serious situations.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.040
And overall, in looking,
studying the behavior of Sarah

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.370
and other people
like her, I think

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.250
probably the biggest
insight we can get into this

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.420
is that fear really involves
two steps in the brain.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.430
There's the part where we focus
our attention on something,

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.270
and then, a split-second
later, we feel fear.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.850
Our heart starts pounding,
we get a shot of adrenaline,

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.990
we run away, we start to
fight, we do something.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.430
And in most of us these
things happen, these two steps

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.040
happen so quickly
we really don't

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.290
differentiate between them.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:12.510
We notice it, we
lock our attention on

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.740
and then immediately
we're afraid.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.650
But in Sarah,
these steps-- we're

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.680
able to tease them apart
because she was still

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.480
getting the first step.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.690
She was locking her
attention onto things.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.840
Because if you remember
at the snake store

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.360
or at the haunted
house, it's not

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.310
like she was just
indifferent to these things

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.080
where she was like, OK,
a snake or a monster,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.900
she was fascinated
with these things

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.922
and she was really locking her
attention onto these things.

00:19:38.922 --> 00:19:40.630
Which is important if
you think about it,

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.300
because our ancestors
way back when--

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.322
if a snake went slithering
through the grass

00:19:45.322 --> 00:19:47.280
or something like that
they wanted to make sure

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.090
they paid close
attention to that.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.710
You don't want to
find a deadly snake

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.700
and then get distracted by a
monkey or a cloud or something

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.550
like that.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.940
You really want to pay
close attention to it.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.800
But because of her
amygdala damage

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.280
Sarah wasn't getting
the second step,

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.260
which was to get the
heck out of there

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.420
or start running or
something like that.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.650
So again, we really aren't able
to tease these two steps apart

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:13.050
unless we see people like
this with brain damage.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.720
And overall, I think
that there's even

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.910
kind of a more interesting
and important lesson there,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.080
and that-- excuse me.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.640
And that is, we normally
think about emotions

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.060
and logical thinking
or reasoning

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.810
as being kind of
separate in the brain.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.820
In fact, if anything
we think about emotions

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:34.300
as kind of disrupting
our ability to reason.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.770
But one of the big insights in
the past about 30 or so years

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.400
of neuroscience is
that emotions really

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.810
do play a very important
role in every day reasoning.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.202
They really, really
are important.

00:20:46.202 --> 00:20:47.660
And in fact, when
you start to look

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.354
at cases of people like
Sarah or other people

00:20:50.354 --> 00:20:51.770
that I talk about
in the book that

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.850
do have emotional
problems-- damage

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.090
to the emotional
systems-- they behave

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.160
in really strange,
really irrational ways.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.547
In fact, it's the
lack of emotion

00:21:03.547 --> 00:21:05.005
that's starting to
make them behave

00:21:05.005 --> 00:21:06.930
in these really odd ways.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.810
So it's not so much that reason
and emotion are different

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.250
or they're kind of
opposed, but emotion really

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.859
plays into reason.

00:21:13.859 --> 00:21:15.650
And again, that's not
how we normally think

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.560
about how our brain works.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.050
But again, it's a
really important lesson

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.140
for the past three decades
or so of neuroscience.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.050
And emotion really is
fundamental to a lot

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.580
of different thinking
in the brain,

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.870
including how our
logical brain works.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.370
And it's thanks to
people like Sarah

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.260
we've gotten these insights.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.600
So again, now with
something pretty basic,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.590
pretty visceral- emotions.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.090
For the next part
of the talk I want

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.000
to jump to something
a little higher-level

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.350
and talk a little bit about
identity, personal identity.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.320
And I'm going to talk about
a few different stories here

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.330
involving a few
different people,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.320
and really talk about how
brain damage-- what it

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.620
does to your sense of identity.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:04.570
So the first story involves
this man right here,

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.520
a man by the name
of Clive Wearing.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.390
So he was involved in the
classical music scene in London

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:14.970
in the late '70s, early 1980s.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:20.060
A very well known conductor, did
some writing music on his own.

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.110
When the BBC needed to broadcast
Charles and Diana's, wedding

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.550
for instance, Clive was
the one they called on

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.270
to arrange the score
for the broadcaster.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:30.660
So very well known,
very well-connected.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:34.890
But in about 1985 or so Clive
came down with what he thought

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:35.525
was a flu.

00:22:35.525 --> 00:22:38.930
You know, he was feeling achy,
feeling kind of run down.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.450
Doctor went to visit him and
said, OK, just get some fluids,

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.220
get some rest.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.090
But he just wasn't
getting better.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.460
For instance, about
eight or ten days in he

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.435
wondered outside once and
couldn't remember where he was.

00:22:53.435 --> 00:22:56.174
He got in a taxi, couldn't
remember his address,

00:22:56.174 --> 00:22:58.090
they had to drop him off
at the police station

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.540
and his wife had to
come get him there.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.240
And then finally, about 16 days
into this illness, they drug

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.950
Clive to the hospital.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.390
And it turns out he didn't
have the flu at all.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.370
He had an infection
in his brain.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:16.510
And the infection was what's
called the herpes virus.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.890
It's the same virus
that causes cold sores.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.782
And actually it's the same virus
that the people I mentioned

00:23:22.782 --> 00:23:24.490
at the beginning of
the talk who couldn't

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.550
recognize animals and plants.

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.260
They all suffered from an
infection of the herpes virus

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.650
as well.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.910
And I don't mean to throw
any panic into anyone

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.800
in the audience, but
every once in a while

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.740
one of these cold sore
viruses will go rogue

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.310
and will start to migrate up
the olfactory nerve, the smell

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.980
nerve.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.340
It will get inside the
brain, and once it gets there

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.000
it just starts
destroying things.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.920
It just wreaks havoc
inside the brain.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.820
Where Clive suffered
a lot of damage

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.620
especially was to
his limbic system.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.580
In particular, his hippocampus,
which was the structure

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.200
I mentioned earlier
as very involved

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.320
with forming and
storing memories.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.980
So when Clive woke up
he was an amnesiac.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.270
Now, just to explain a
little bit about amnesia.

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.110
The kind of amnesia you see
in neuroscience patients

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.230
like Clive-- it's
not like quite what

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.480
you see in the movies
or something like that.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.630
They don't forget their
names, they actually

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.580
retain a lot of muscle memories,
motor memories, riding a bike,

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.850
playing the piano.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.870
Usually you retain those things.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.360
And you might even retain some
information from your past.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.840
It's pretty spotty, but maybe
you'll remember, you know,

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.790
like the rules to a card
game or something like that.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.650
There's little bits there.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.870
But you do lose
most of your past.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.840
And what you really
loose is you lose

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.885
the ability to form new
memories going forward.

00:24:50.885 --> 00:24:55.990
And in fact, Clive suffered
from the worst case of amnesia

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.630
that the neuroscientific
community had ever seen.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:02.330
For instance, he would
be talking with someone

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.210
and they might have, like, a
blue shirt on or something,

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.579
and he would look away from
them and he would look back

00:25:08.579 --> 00:25:11.120
and their shirt would seem to
be a different color because he

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.550
couldn't remember what color
their shirt was before.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:18.910
Or he'd be playing solitaire
or something and he would blink

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.100
and the cards would seem to have
rearranged themselves suddenly.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.410
That's how short-term
his memory was at first.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.690
It couldn't even last from
the beginning of a blink

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.640
to the end of a blink.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.450
And what this ended up doing is
it really affected-- obviously

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.460
not only Clive's
day-to-day life,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.740
but it started bringing up
an unusual symptom in that it

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.190
started affecting what he
called his consciousness

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.240
or his ability to be awake in
that the way he interpreted

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.070
what was going on is he thought
that he just become conscious

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.620
for the first time.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:57.760
It was like the past had not
even existed before and now

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.050
he had just sprung into being.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:03.280
And as you can imagine, this
was kind of an exciting moment

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.380
for Clive in that,
if you had just

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.620
become awake right now
for the very first time,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.637
you'd be really excited.

00:26:09.637 --> 00:26:11.720
Like, wow, I've just been
given this gift of life.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.090
This is amazing.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.130
And what he would
do is he would try

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:19.767
to record this moment in his
diary whenever it happened.

00:26:19.767 --> 00:26:21.433
He would see his
diary, he would grab it

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:25.250
and he would write 8:31, now
I am really, completely awake.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.790
9:06, now I am perfectly,
overwhelmingly awake.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:32.410
9:34, Now I am superlatively,
actually awake.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.500
He was very good with
adverbs, Clive was.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500
And if he didn't have
his diary lying around he

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.920
would write something
on the wall,

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.950
he would write something
on the furniture just

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.560
to record this
momentous occasion.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.530
But every time he
would get his diary

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.280
back he would open it to the
fresh page and-- you know,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.810
he has dozens of diaries just
filled with pages like this--

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:55.360
but he would find the
latest fresh page,

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.670
he would see the old entry
there and he would say, well,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.130
that entry's clearly
false because now

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:02.820
is the first time I'm awake.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.280
So he would cross
the old entry out,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.260
write the new entry in there.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.705
10 minutes later he would
have the exact same epiphany.

00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:11.710
He would grab his diary,
he would open it up

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.200
and he would say, well, that
last entry is clearly false

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.130
because now I'm awake
for the very first time.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.310
Cross the old entry out,
write the new entry in there.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.660
As I said, he has
dozens of diaries

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.390
just filled with page after
page of entries like this.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:34.560
And this isn't normal for people
with even very severe amnesia.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.050
They know there's
something wrong.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.090
They know they can't
remember things,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.450
but they don't think they've
just become conscious

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.570
for the very first time.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.920
It's a very unusual symptom.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.340
So the obviously question is,
why is this happening to Clive?

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.070
What about his brain damage
is causing this to happen?

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.364
And neuroscientists
don't quite know yet.

00:27:54.364 --> 00:27:56.530
They'll probably have to
wait until he passes away--

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.363
he's still alive now--
and look at his brain

00:27:58.363 --> 00:28:00.530
to try to figure
out what's going on.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.773
But one thing we can say
from Clive and other patients

00:28:03.773 --> 00:28:07.960
like him is that-- we can
say two things, actually.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.510
One, we know that
it's not like there's

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.570
a little consciousness
parked in your brain

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.890
and if that part gets damaged
then your consciousness

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.370
goes on the blink.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.350
Consciousness is a
brain-wide phenomenon.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.040
There's a lot of different
parts of the brain involved

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.050
with consciousness, which is
why we've never quite seen

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:27.130
this symptom before.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:31.100
We probably haven't seen someone
with the exact brain damage

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.670
that Clive has.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.480
So again, it's a brain-wide
thing, a system-wide thing.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.849
You can't just be looking
at individual parts here.

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.765
That's really where the
future of neuroscience

00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:43.900
is going, is looking not
just at individual parts

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.340
but whole systems and
how they're interacting

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.360
in the brain overall.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.190
But I think the second
thing we can get out

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.210
of this-- excuse me-- is in
some ways even more interesting.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.630
And that is, despite
all of the problems

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.220
that Clive is having, he
never really lost a sense

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:07.240
of personal identity, in that
he knows who he is deep down.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.650
In fact, if you put Clive
in front of the piano,

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.840
ask him to start
playing or something,

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.250
he can start playing music.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.930
He can, in fact, sight
read music just fine.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.410
Because, as I
mentioned, sight reading

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:21.540
is really more of a muscle
memory, a motor memory,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.110
than it is an explicit
conscious memory.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.620
So Clive will sit down
and he'll start playing.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.390
But something
unusual happens when

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:30.390
he starts playing
in that he starts

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.300
to feel like himself again.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.160
He feels like the old Clive.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.840
Something about the music, about
the momentum, the phrasing,

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.500
something about it allows
him to tap into his old self.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.140
As soon as he stops playing
it all kind of falls apart

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.600
and he's sort of lost again.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.470
But for those few
minutes at least

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.470
he feels like himself again.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.070
And he gets glimpses of
this in other moments too.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.581
When he meets his wife
again, for instance.

00:29:56.581 --> 00:29:58.830
She doesn't live with him,
he's at an assisted nursing

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.760
facility.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:04.100
But every time she comes over
he jumps up for joy because this

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.630
happened to him when
he was fairly newlywed

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.270
and he still has kind of
that puppy love for her.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:13.750
And he can still tap into that
every single time he sees her.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.450
And she admits it gets kind
of hard sometimes-- you know,

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.670
fake enthusiasm for the 10,000
reunion when she comes over.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.810
But again, it's still
something deep inside him

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.140
that he's able to tap into.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.597
His personal identity is
still there on some level.

00:30:29.597 --> 00:30:31.680
And the next story I'm
going to talk about I think

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.960
gets at this idea of personal
identity even better.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:43.820
So this story involves a woman
who was living a few hours

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.630
outside of Vancouver in
about 2005 when she found out

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.940
that she was pregnant, found
out she was going to have twins.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.000
And so she was kind
of excited about this,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.680
but in one of the ultrasound
visits they said, we're sorry,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.580
we have some bad news.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.450
Your twins are
conjoined-- what used

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.565
to be called Siamese twins.

00:31:05.565 --> 00:31:07.690
But she decided she was
going to have the children,

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.150
she was going to
bring them to term.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.525
And as you can
see in the picture

00:31:10.525 --> 00:31:14.890
here the babies were actually
conjoined at the head.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.300
They had a Siamese brain.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.690
And I should say that the
two children-- they're

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.380
Krista and Tatiana-- they
are still alive today.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.610
They're fairly healthy, fairly
happy, they're in school.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.110
Things turned out about as well
as they could have for them.

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.920
But because they do
have this Siamese brain

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.460
they show some very unusual,
very interesting behavior.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.440
Specifically, the part of
their brain that's connected

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.200
is a structure
called the thalamus.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.010
I mentioned the thalamus
before as a relay center

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.140
for the brain.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:50.210
So what it does is
it takes information

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:52.990
in from your senses, from
your eyes, your ears,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:56.270
your mouth-- excuse
me-- your mouth,

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.240
and it relays it to
different parts of the brain.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.000
So because they share a thalamus
they share sensory information

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.150
on some level.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.060
So what does that mean?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.330
Well, if one of the girls is
taking a sip on a cup of juice

00:32:11.330 --> 00:32:14.900
the other girl can taste
the juice in her mouth.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.910
Or if you tickle
one of the girls,

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.910
the other girl will
start to laugh.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.210
If you give one of them a
shot at the doctor's office

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.290
the other will grab
her arm in pain.

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:27.380
They fall asleep together,
they maybe even dream together.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.340
And so the obvious
question is, wow,

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:35.200
are they two individual
people or is this somehow one

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.990
person connected together?

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.320
How would you even ask-- go
about answering that question?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.100
And it's a little ambiguous.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.140
We don't quite know
yet, but I think

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.660
a lot of the evidence
points to them

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.340
being two individual people.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:52.750
For instance, one thing
that the girls tend

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:56.100
to do when they meet somebody
new is they'll walk up to them

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.740
and one of them will say
something like, I am just me.

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.490
And it's kind of a
strange thing to say.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.900
Like, we wouldn't go
up to just somebody

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.460
and start saying
something like that.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.649
That seems kind of obvious.

00:33:07.649 --> 00:33:09.690
But it seems like they
have some sort of instinct

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.230
where they want to assert this.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.750
They want to say this to kind
of differentiate themselves.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.550
So again, they're kind of
asserting their independence

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.270
from each other.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.240
Another thing is that they have
distinct likes and dislikes.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.150
For instance, one of the
girls happens to like ketchup.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.390
She loves ketchup on her hot
dogs on her fries, whatever.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:34.400
Unfortunately her sister
thinks ketchup is disgusting

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.210
and ends up scraping
at her tongue

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.300
whenever her sister eats it.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.330
And it's kind of an
amusing anecdote,

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.980
but it is important
in that they're

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.770
getting very similar
sensory information

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.940
but they're reacting to
it in a distinct way.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.690
So they're getting
the same inputs

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.890
but they're having
different experiences,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.240
different reactions.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.850
And I think that goes a long
way in showing that they're not

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:58.860
the same person.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.410
Something different is
going on in their reaction

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.540
to this very similar
thing, to this ketchup.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.570
And the last anecdote I think
maybe is even the best example.

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.100
Someone was watching
them one day

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.654
and they were at a
fast food restaurant.

00:34:13.654 --> 00:34:14.820
And, you know, they're kids.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.600
It had been a long day, they
start to snip at each other,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.150
they start fighting,
they're pushing each other,

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.550
calling names.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.400
Finally one of the
girls got sick of it.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:27.190
She reached out, she slapped
her sister in the face,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.370
and then grabbed
her own face in pain

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.100
because it hurt her to do that.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.300
So maybe that's a
good lesson for kids.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.350
Don't hit your
siblings like that.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.989
But again, it kind
of goes to show

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.389
that, in this really heated
moment when she was just

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:43.080
lashing out, if she had thought
of herself-- she wouldn't have

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.960
lashed out at someone she
thought was identical with her.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.639
Like, you don't start slapping
yourself when you get mad.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.940
You want to hit other people.

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.860
You slap other people.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.520
So in this
instinctive moment she

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.850
was kind of defining her
sister as a different person.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:01.580
And in both of these cases, with
Clive and with these two girls,

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.490
again what I really
want emphasize

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:06.180
is that, despite their
unusual brain structure--

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.110
or in Clive's case a lot of
the damage to his brain--

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.550
even despite the fact
that his consciousness was

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.480
going on the blink
he still retained

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.560
a sense of personal identity.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.550
And that's something I
found in story after story

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:22.800
throughout the book, that the
sense of personal identity

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.590
is something that's really,
really hard to dislodge.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.340
It's not always at the surface.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.940
It can be buried sometimes
but it almost never, ever

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.170
disappears in people.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.150
You can still get
at it at some level.

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.100
And there's something kind of
reassuring in that, I think,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.850
that even if we were to
suffer kind of this really

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.520
drastic brain damage we probably
wouldn't lose a sense of who

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:49.440
we are deep, deep down.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.870
And throughout the book, I
talk about stories from people

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.090
from all walks of
life, people who

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.130
are very famous
like Woodrow Wilson

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.070
and the neurological
disorders he suffered

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.640
from while he was in office.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.170
People like Dostoevsky-- you
know, the flashes of God he

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.490
would see when he was
getting ready to write.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:07.670
Things like that.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.740
Or there were stories of very
lowly, normal, everyday people

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.160
like Phineas Gage, that railroad
worker who had this spike blown

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.480
through the top of his head.

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.560
Probably the most
misunderstood man

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.880
in the history of neuroscience.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.180
Most of the people
though are more

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.220
like Phineas Gage in that
they were just normal,

00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.640
everyday people who
suffered something drastic

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.990
and then their lives changed.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.440
They became sort of a
martyr to neuroscience

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.990
through no choice of their
own and became kind of famous

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.310
in the annals of neuroscience.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.920
But one thing I realized
in going through this book

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.670
is, there's a tendency to
treat these people a little bit

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.980
like freaks sometimes.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.030
You know, you see
them, you see whatever

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:53.080
outstanding neuroscientific
symptom they show

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.420
and you start to focus on that.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.500
You get really excited
about that thing.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.900
And really these cases are what
pushed neuroscience forward

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.230
for century after century.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.070
But it's only really
when you start

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.290
to look at these
peoples' whole lives

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.320
that you really get a sense of
what an amazing organ the brain

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.040
is.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.790
Because even when they suffer a
lot of damage, like Clive did,

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.380
they still retain a lot of
the things that we retain.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.110
He loved music,
he loved his wife,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.100
he had the same joys and
disappointments that we do,

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.520
he suffered the same
disappointments.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.630
In 95 percent of
the ways his brain

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.974
worked exactly like ours do.

00:37:30.974 --> 00:37:32.390
And even though
there's a tendency

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:35.860
to focus on that one
thing, when you step back

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.650
and look at how the
brain works overall

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:42.592
you really see what an
amazing, resilient organ it is.

00:37:42.592 --> 00:37:44.300
And I started to think
about these people

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.200
a little bit like optical
illusions, in that you

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.240
can focus on the
one thing, you can

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.730
focus on the damage and
their outstanding symptoms,

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.630
but if you just look
at it a different way--

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.830
you're looking at the same thing
but you start to notice, wow,

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.000
how courageous they are, how
perseverant, how their brain is

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.570
resilient over time, the
way the brain compensates,

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:07.910
gets around these
sorts of damage.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.890
You really start to see
what an incredible organ

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.240
it is when it starts to
recover in its day-to-day,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.249
year-to-year,
lifetime-to-lifetime process.

00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:18.790
And it's really how
I wanted the book

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.730
to grow from beginning
to end, as you

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.160
start to see more of these
tales of perseverance, courage,

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.390
recovery, things like that.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.320
As I said before,
stories probably

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.430
mean more to neuroscience
than maybe any other field

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.930
out there.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.520
Their really baked into
the core of neuroscience.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.250
And above all, I
think what they help

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.980
us do is they help
us understand what

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.364
it means to be a human being.

00:38:42.364 --> 00:38:45.030
So I'm happy I was able to share
a few of those stories with you

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.760
today.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:46.960
Thank you.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:52.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:56.630
And I'm happy to answer any
questions, if anyone has any?

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.520
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about-- I almost

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.950
think of it as a
hardware-software distinction.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.680
You mentioned
resilience and the way

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:08.000
that things go through, like,
back alleys to accomplish

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.110
the same thing.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:13.910
Isn't the fact that it's a back
alley just because they hadn't

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:15.690
needed to go that way before?

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.700
And it's almost like a default
configuration of the software

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.650
and an alternate path
would work just as well,

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.230
but maybe it's not as strong?

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.110
I don't have a-- I get a sense
from these kinds of stories

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.100
that there's a mentality
of the hardware determines

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.250
the behavior, the hardware
determines the capabilities.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.730
But if somebody
loses the ability

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:41.570
to categorize animals
they can relearn

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.570
the ability to
categorize animals,

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:46.330
I presume, because they've
got the rest of their brain

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.430
available for that.

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.830
Could you speak to that at all?

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:50.455
SAM KEAN: Yeah.

00:39:50.455 --> 00:39:53.950
One thing that-- so I
use the metaphor-- people

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.090
use the metaphor of
wiring for the brain.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.990
And it's a good metaphor
in a lot of ways,

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:02.550
but it does miss something
in that a wire is just

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:03.420
sending a signal.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.110
A wire doesn't really
change over time.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.070
When you lay the wire
it's pretty much there

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.861
and it's going to do
what it does depending

00:40:09.861 --> 00:40:11.110
on what's coming down.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:16.450
Neurons are different from that
in that each neuron connects

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.030
to thousands of other neurons.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.410
There are branches going
all over the place.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:23.330
Sometimes though neurons
ignore information

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.910
coming from certain branches.

00:40:24.910 --> 00:40:27.890
So the neuron is trying to send
a signal but the other neuron's

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:28.940
ignoring it.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.650
So there are a lot of
these alternative pathways,

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.610
but information maybe
isn't going down them

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.160
unless something
happens, damage occurs.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.670
In which case, the
neuron will learn

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.960
to start accepting
information from other areas.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.570
So basically it's
like it's rewiring in

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.600
that the signal is going
in a different route,

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.190
but you're not actually laying
down new wires in the brain.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.140
It's not like new
neurons are growing,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.780
it's just that the information's
going along a different route.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:02.630
So the wiring metaphor
is good up into a point

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.760
because wires don't
change their behavior.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.125
They're not quite dynamic
in the way that neurons are.

00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:09.750
AUDIENCE: In your
research for the book

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:11.630
did you discover any
brain injuries that

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:16.920
caused maybe not a disability
as much as maybe an advantage

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.060
to the person that
received the injury?

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.480
Like a different way of thinking
about the injury that maybe

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.340
propelled them, made
them good at math

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.275
or better at art or
anything like that?

00:41:27.275 --> 00:41:27.900
SAM KEAN: Yeah.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.816
There are stories out.

00:41:28.816 --> 00:41:32.180
There are people who didn't
care a whistle about poetry

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.476
or painting before, they
suffer a brain injury

00:41:34.476 --> 00:41:36.600
and all of a sudden they're
obsessed with painting,

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.020
they love poetry suddenly.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.490
They get it in a way that they
never really got it before.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.950
Well, there was a story
about a year or so ago now

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.700
of a guy who had a brain
injury and he suddenly

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.040
became very good at math.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.760
You know, he was sort of
like this prodigy suddenly.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.760
I don't think he'd been
terrible at math before,

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.100
but not nearly as good
as he was suddenly.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.140
So you do see cases like
this where people suddenly

00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.550
get a talent.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.172
And they do think--
it's sort of rude

00:42:05.172 --> 00:42:06.630
to refer to them
as idiot savants--

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:10.050
people who have one ability,
like the ability to just hear

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:11.950
music and play it instantly.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:15.380
In a lot of cases these
people do have damage

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.540
to the left side of their
brain which is usually

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.660
the dominant, controlling side.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.530
And what they think is that,
because the dominant side isn't

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.040
working or isn't
dominating the way

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.440
it normally is, that the sort
of stereotypical right brain

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.430
talents have a chance
to flower a little bit.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.760
So you do see cases
where damage or an injury

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.800
allows a talent to come out in
a way that wouldn't have before.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.740
What almost always happens
though is the people lose

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.030
other abilities.

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.160
I have never seen-- I've
never seen a case of someone

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:49.140
suffering an injury,
just getting a talent,

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.970
and nothing else
happens to them.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.650
Usually they suffer a lot
of their day-to-day life

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.417
and this is just one
small compensation

00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:57.250
for all the other things
that have happened.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.560
AUDIENCE: Lately
I've been hearing

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.320
a lot about neural
plasticity and things

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.500
like people's behavior or
people's personalities,

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.750
how our brain and our
minds and our personalities

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.680
aren't necessarily hardwired
and baked in forever,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.580
but certain techniques,
certain practices

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.700
can change the way we
see things and the way we

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:27.270
react to things, the way we
behave and so on and so forth.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:31.590
So if neuroplasticity
is a thing and really it

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.080
seems to be working-- at
least that's what I'm reading,

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.800
a lot of psychology-- you
know, treatments and research

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.120
is centered around it.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.000
How is that connected to an
actual, physical brain injury?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.840
Like, why wouldn't the brain
use the neuroplasticity

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:56.387
to compensate for
a physical ailment?

00:43:56.387 --> 00:43:57.220
You see what I mean?

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:57.280
SAM KEAN: Yep.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.780
AUDIENCE: So if
behaviors can change

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:04.642
why can't skills and memory
and knowledge change over time?

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:07.100
SAM KEAN: Well, our knowledge
and our skills and our memory

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:07.940
are changing.

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:10.930
That's one thing
that we do sort of

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.800
retain the ability-- we know
that our memories change

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:14.300
over time.

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.390
That's one thing that
the adult brain can do.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.190
The adult brain is not as
good as the brain of children.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.394
It's not as plastic
as a child's brain.

00:44:22.394 --> 00:44:24.060
And now we all know,
obviously, children

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:27.050
can pick up skills, languages,
whatever, very, very quickly.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.850
Much more quickly
than adults can.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:31.720
So neuroplasticity does occur.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.330
We can sort of rewire what's
going on in our brains.

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.550
It that in the adult brain
it takes a lot more work,

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:39.960
a lot more practice.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.950
You just have to really
go over it over and over,

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.820
really labor, really work
because the brain just

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.640
isn't as plastic as that age.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.880
You lose the ability to
start sending information

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.500
down alternative
routes, for neurons

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.860
to sort of talk to their
neighbors in different ways.

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.320
You just lose that ability.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.600
And overall it's
probably a good thing

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.505
because if our brains
were too plastic

00:45:05.505 --> 00:45:07.630
you would learn something
and then the next day you

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:08.380
would just forget it.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.980
It would kind of go
out of your brain,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.127
or you would lose the ability to
ride a bike because you hadn't

00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:15.210
ridden one in five years
and your brain would say,

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.293
I'll just get rid of that.

00:45:16.293 --> 00:45:17.970
Like, you just dump
the information.

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:20.880
So you don't want
infinite plasticity.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.070
That would be bad.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.830
But we do know that we can
rewire it to some extent.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.490
Not to an infinite
degree, because there's

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.830
some things that you probably
just won't be able to pick up,

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.450
even if you practice
them a lot, just

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.530
depending on your brain, your
temperament, things like that.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:40.710
So you can rewire yourself to
some degree, but I don't know.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.209
I think it remains an open
question, how far you can go.

00:45:43.209 --> 00:45:43.750
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.230
So you're saying that if the
same physical injury happens

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.530
to a child versus
an adult, the child

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:53.070
will have a much better chance
of regaining the ability

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.400
that he or she lost?

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.650
SAM KEAN: Yeah, vastly.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:57.150
Yeah.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.720
You see stories of
children who-- they open up

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:02.214
their-- adults, I should say.

00:46:02.214 --> 00:46:04.380
They open up their brain
or they look at their brain

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.430
and there's a big hole or
something there and say, what?

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.055
You don't have this
part of your brain.

00:46:08.055 --> 00:46:10.330
And they're going, well--
They just-- their brain

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.159
got around it.

00:46:11.159 --> 00:46:11.700
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.909
Thank you.

00:46:13.909 --> 00:46:15.700
AUDIENCE: I loved "The
Disappearing Spoon."

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.260
SAM KEAN: Oh, thank you.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.530
AUDIENCE: And I still
recommend this book,

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.220
like, it's probably one
of my favorite books

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.050
in the last decade.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.392
SAM KEAN: Oh, thank you.

00:46:21.392 --> 00:46:23.600
AUDIENCE: Can you tell me
what are you writing about,

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.790
what are you working on now?

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.270
Because I'm going
to read anything

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.520
you read and I'm just excited.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.260
SAM KEAN: So I'm
working on a book now.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.400
I don't know-- we haven't nailed
down the publication date yet,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.480
but it's going to
be called something

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.340
like "Caesar's Last Breath."

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:39.450
Basically the idea is,
you take a deep breath.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:42.950
You inhale all these gases,
obviously nitrogen, oxygen,

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.670
things like that.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:47.090
But you also inhale a
lot of refrigerants,

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:48.630
you inhale
pollutants, you inhale

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.260
little bits of anesthesia.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.740
You inhale all these
different gases, some of them

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.610
industrial, some of the natural,
some of them from volcanoes,

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.670
whatever.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:59.860
And basically if you look at all
the different gases you inhale

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.720
every single time you
can kind of reconstruct

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:06.110
the whole history of the world,
where everything came from,

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:08.710
all the stages that human
beings went through,

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.860
where we're going in the
future, every single time

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.610
you take a breath.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.280
All of these stages are kind
of washing through your lungs.

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.940
So it's kind of taking the
gases and kind of jumping off

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.600
from there into the
time Einstein tried

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.700
to build a refrigerator,
or to Roswell, or back

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.180
to our early volcano
days, things like that.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.230
So "Caesar's Last Breath"--
kind of the history of the world

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:31.749
in every breath.

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:32.790
Well, thank you everyone.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:33.760
I appreciate it.

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.240
I'm happy to sign books,
too, if you want that.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.090
[APPLAUSE]
