00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.550
- [Instructor] In this
video, we're gonna get

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.790
some more practice setting
up systems of equations.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.090
Not solving them, but
just setting them up.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.760
So we're told Sanjay's
dog weighs five times

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.210
as much as his cat.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.470
His dog is also 20 kilograms
heavier than his cat.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.320
Let c be the cat's weight and
let d be the dog's weight.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.920
So pause this video and
see if you can set up

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.040
a system of equation, two linear
equations with two unknowns

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.040
that we could use to solve for c and d,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.790
but we don't have to in this video.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.520
All right so let's do it together.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.780
So, what I like to do is
usually there's a sentence

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.010
or two that describes
each of the equations

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.900
we wanna set up.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.900
So this first one tells us
Sanjay's dog weighs five times

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.570
as much as his cat.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.290
So how much does his dog weigh?

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.750
So his dog weighs d, so we
know d is going to be equal

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.280
to five times as much as his cat weighs.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.200
So his cat weighs c, so d is
going to be equal to five times

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.180
as much as his cat weighs.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.920
So that's one linear
equation using d and c.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.590
And so what's another one?

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.340
Well, then we are told his dog
is also 20 kilograms heavier

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.820
than his cat.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.640
So we could say that the
dog's weight is going

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.500
to be equal to the cat's weight plus what?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.720
Plus 20 kilograms.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.190
We're assuming everything's in kilograms,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.710
so I don't have to write the units.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.780
But there you have it, I have
just set up two equations

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.000
in two unknowns, two linear equations,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.520
based on the information
given in this word problem,

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.191
which we could then
solve, and I encourage you

00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.460
to do so if you're curious.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.560
But sometimes, the difficult
part is just to find,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.430
is to re-express the
information that you're given

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.580
in a mathematical form.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.240
But as you see, as you get practice,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.350
it becomes somewhat intuitive.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.390
What we see in blue is
just another way of writing

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.710
what we underline in blue
and what we see in yellow

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.480
is just another way of
writing or expressing

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.743
wat we underlined in yellow up there.
