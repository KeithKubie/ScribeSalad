ZAMBRICKI LI: So
we have a saying.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.920
We say, it doesn't
matter who's to blame.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.046
We're all in this together.

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.045
And that's one of the
things this song is about.

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.870
It's like, if the
ship is sinking,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.040
we can either all kind of band
together to kind of save it.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.915

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.510
ZAMBRICKI LI: So
sometimes, you know,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.882
when you say
goodbye to somebody,

00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:49.670
you don't realize
till years later

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.180
that it was your last goodbye
whether it's, you know,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.790
that person goes off and your
lives just kind of depart

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:58.750
or whatever happens.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.567
So we just try to treat every
goodbye like it's meaningful--

00:05:03.567 --> 00:05:05.400
not that it's necessarily
your last goodbye,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.190
but you just never know
what is going to happen.

AUSTIN BISNOW: I'm trying
to fit in at Google,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.200
although I did just slide
down the slide, which

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.240
is also very Google.

And I got shocked.

00:09:12.372 --> 00:09:15.262
Do you guys get shocked
when you slide down?

00:09:15.262 --> 00:09:16.220
There should be a sign.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.428
Like, you guys all know that.

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.010

should we give the performers

right beforehand?

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.740
Yeah, they're telling
us, go down the slide.

Everyone goes on the slide.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.070
You have to go down the slide
if you're new to Google.

to do "Shake Me Up"?

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.620
BRIAN ZAGHI: Sure.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.120
AUSTIN BISNOW: So
we've been working

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.710
on an acoustic version of some
of the songs on the album,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.040
a collection, secretly--

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.920
not so secret after
this comes out.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.170
Hopefully we'll
release it in April.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.000
And, yeah, we had
about five days

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
off in between
festivals in Florida.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.500
And we recorded
some of these songs.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.200
And so this is an
interpolation of one

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.200
of the songs from our album "In
The Wind" but very different.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.390
I mean, it showed us
that, when you change,

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.480
it can be the same song.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.370
And you change the,
you know, production.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.980
And you feel it and
you interpret it

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.800
in a totally different way.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.370
We just released a video
for this on YouTube.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.010
And it's like a
full-on, you know,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.960
football game and a dance.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.850
And Zang's step-dad is, you
know, chasing his dream,

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.120
playing football--

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.200
his character is--
doing end zone dances.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.140
But, yeah, let's
talk about a bit

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.770
about the meaning of this song.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:46.306
Yeah.

00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:47.680
Zambricki, you
were saying, like,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.850
it came from a Bob Dylan
song, "Forever Young."

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.641
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:54.810
Originally, when I was playing,
thinking about the lyrics,

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.890
there's a Bob Dylan song
called "Forever Young."

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.360
And I read that he wrote it as
like a letter to his children.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.410
So when I was working
on lyrics for this song,

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.320
I was thinking about it as like
a letter to our grandchildren,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:09.770
so like one step further.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.390
AUSTIN BISNOW: Trying to
one-up Dylan, you know?

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.830
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah, just
trying to one-up Dylan.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.760
AUSTIN BISNOW: We never will.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.000
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.190
Maybe we never will,
but, hey, we're reaching.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.130
So, in the verses,
it's kind of like what

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.060
we want to say to them,
kind of like advice

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.025
even though they're,
maybe, far from existence.

00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:26.900
AUSTIN BISNOW: None of
us even have children.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.380
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah, we
don't even have children.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.160
AUSTIN BISNOW: That we know of.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.620
No, I'm just kidding.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.540
ZAMBRICKI LI: And then,
you know, in the chorus

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.206
it's kind of like the
flip side of that.

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:38.900
Like, if we're lucky and we
do get to have grandchildren

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.180
and then they grow up,
then they can kind of

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.370
do the same thing back
for us and kind of give us

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.570
the same type of advice.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.110
And, hopefully, if
we did it right,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.950
then they'll be able
to pick us up, too.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.450
AUSTIN BISNOW: So
in the chorus it's

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.900
like, if we get
stuck in our ways,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.560
will someone be there
for us to pick us up?

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.280
And then, in the bridge,
we say, "Before it

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.140
ends, before we're gone, life's
too short, goodbyes too long.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.730
Release yourself from the storm.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.407
It rolls on."

00:12:09.407 --> 00:12:10.865
And when we were
writing this, this

00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:14.460
is the last song we
wrote for "In the Wind."

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.830
And we were writing it in
the studio like the day

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.556
we were recording
it and finishing it.

00:12:21.556 --> 00:12:27.260
And Zang's dad had just passed
away a few months before that.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.240
And he had suffered
from mental illness.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.100
And this was just
like a "release

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.150
yourself from the storm.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.930
It rolls on."

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.100
You can get carried
away with the storm,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.725
or you can let it go.

00:12:43.725 --> 00:12:45.312

ZAMBRICKI LI: This is all for--

00:18:40.701 --> 00:18:41.620
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:42.080
AUSTIN BISNOW:
It's the beginning

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.010
of the end of Magic Giant.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.300
BRIAN ZAGHI: I heard that Google
interviews are like the most

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.910
complex and they give you
the hardest questions.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.931
ZAMBRICKI LI: But if
you do a talk first,

00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:50.180
then you've got like a leg up.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.080
BRIAN ZAGHI: Exactly.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.163
That's why I'm doing this.

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:55.100
I'm hoping, one day--

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.210
AUSTIN BISNOW: Tell them how
you started playing bass.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.765
I don't know, I just
think it's funny.

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.140
BRIAN ZAGHI: The
first instrument

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.050
I ever played was an upright
bass, which at the time

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.420
was three times the size of me.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.260
And it was in school.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.210
First, on my schedule card,
it said all my classes--

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.440
math, this, that.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.097
It said strings.

00:19:19.097 --> 00:19:20.680
And, at the time, I
was a little nerd.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.769
I was like, oh, cool.

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:23.810
Like, there's a string
physics class or something

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.976
with strings where I get
to learn how to use strings

00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:27.320
in some cool mathematical way.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.220
AUSTIN BISNOW: String theory.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.845
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah,
sure, string theory.

00:19:29.845 --> 00:19:33.620
That's what I was thinking
when I was nine years old.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.770
So I get into the class,
and it's like an orchestra.

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.944
And everyone's
choosing instruments.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.610
And so the teacher's
like, OK, everyone,

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:41.930
pick your instruments.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:46.130
And in the distance I see
this closet of upright basses.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.460
And I was like, I want that.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.310
And I yelled it,
like, in the class.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.630
I want that one!

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.600
And just, in my mind,
I had this vision,

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.010
you know, like me and this bass.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:59.122
I would carry it on my back like
a super ninja musician turtle.

00:19:59.122 --> 00:20:00.830
And, like, we would
just be best friends.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.944
And I would always take
it home and practice it.

00:20:02.944 --> 00:20:03.860
And that's what I did.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.570
And it felt great.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.780
LAURA MURPHY: Well, you not
only wield that special power,

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.710
but also you're a salsa dancer?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.830
And that's how you sort
of started with these two?

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.290
Is that right, as well?

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.320
ZAMBRICKI LI: So we
actually kind of--

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.370
I don't know if it's
a professional term,

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.377
but we kind of like
Google stalked him.

00:20:22.377 --> 00:20:23.710
BRIAN ZAGHI: So thank you, guys.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.300
This is why--

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.800
ZAMBRICKI LI: And I don't know
if Google stalking is a term.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:26.940
LAURA MURPHY: Bringing
the world together.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.815
ZAMBRICKI LI: It was
more like a deep search.

00:20:28.815 --> 00:20:30.810
After we met him,
we looked him up.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.470
And one of the first
videos that popped up

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.550
was him dancing salsa.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.680
And we were like, wow.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.800
It was so foreign.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.955
It was like an alien type of
skill set that the two of us

00:20:42.955 --> 00:20:44.205
had never kind of experienced.

00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:45.454
We were like, yeah, that's it.

00:20:45.454 --> 00:20:47.390
That's a vibe we don't have.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.490
So it was really good.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:50.532
And we've since learned--

00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:52.073
AUSTIN BISNOW: So
we were like, yeah.

00:20:52.073 --> 00:20:53.390
Wow, the SEO on that's amazing.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:55.070
We should to do a Google Talk.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:00.277
Let's start a band so that
one day we will be in Detroit.

00:21:00.277 --> 00:21:01.610
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, it's strange.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:04.540
I guess you guys are the
reason we're here right now.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.290
LAURA MURPHY: I don't
know that we've ever

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.670
had a guest say that before.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.590
So you guys just moved
to the top of the list.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.850
Thank you.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.470
And scene.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.700
Just kidding.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.158
ZAMBRICKI LI: But
it's interesting.

00:21:15.158 --> 00:21:18.350
I never knew this, but he
dances salsa-- and very well,

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.040
by the way.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.880
You can look it up on Google.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.509
But there's a deep
salsa community

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:25.800
all over the country and world.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.850
So now, when we're
touring, after the show

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.465
he goes salsa dancing.

00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:32.090
And he'll like
disappear after the show

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.790
and come back like
super sweaty later.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.384
I'm like, we just played a show.

00:21:35.384 --> 00:21:36.800
You got super
sweaty, and then you

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.750
went and danced salsa for hours.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.615
BRIAN ZAGHI: I'm already sweaty,
I might as well keep it going.

00:21:40.615 --> 00:21:41.380
ZAMBRICKI LI: But
it's really cool.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.921
Like, the tour
schedule and the salsa

00:21:42.921 --> 00:21:45.400
schedule sometimes
just really coincide.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.960
So it's nice that we can help
with your original passions.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.530
LAURA MURPHY: It is
really incredible

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.450
to see the following
that you guys have

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.150
once you spend some time looking
on some of your social media

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.400
channels or going to
one of your live shows.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.630
It's pretty cult like.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.100
It's inspiring, as well.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.190
So what would you say,
just a little bit more

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.470
about how the band gets
their name out there?

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:07.900
What would you say are the
best platforms for you guys

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.720
to not only connect with your
fans outside of live shows

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.900
but also to stay
connected to them?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.015
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, Google+
has been huge for us.

00:22:15.015 --> 00:22:16.053
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.053 --> 00:22:16.985
It's so big.

00:22:16.985 --> 00:22:18.276
LAURA MURPHY: For real, though.

00:22:18.276 --> 00:22:20.484
ZAMBRICKI LI: Ooh, they're
going to edit that out.

00:22:20.484 --> 00:22:21.275
BRIAN ZAGHI: Sorry.

00:22:21.275 --> 00:22:22.884
It's good.

00:22:22.884 --> 00:22:24.550
AUSTIN BISNOW: One
thing that's actually

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:27.340
developed since we
released the album in May

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:32.170
is like a community--

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.270
they call themselves
the Magic Misfits--

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.200
of, like, the people
that come to our shows

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.060
and are all very supportive.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:45.270
I mean, like, they'll come
to 13 shows in one tour.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.380
And, you know, they'll
come to 30 shows a year

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.610
or whatever it is.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.120
And so they'll get on there,
and they'll like share stories.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.500
ZAMBRICKI LI: It's like an
old-school message board

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.041
kind of vibe.

00:22:54.041 --> 00:22:56.400
So you go there and it's
all like [IMITATES TYPING]..

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.860
We're not members of it.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.780
AUSTIN BISNOW: And
it's like a safe--

00:22:58.780 --> 00:22:59.170
LAURA MURPHY: Oh.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:22:59.770
You can't be?

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.480
ZAMBRICKI LI: I don't know.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.030
We probably could be.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.590
It just feels a little, like--

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:03.070
LAURA MURPHY: Creepy?

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.500
ZAMBRICKI LI: --creepy,
yeah, to be on there.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.125
AUSTIN BISNOW: Let
them do their thing.

00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:08.350
But, yeah, it's like
they're all so supportive.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.551
And they're like, oh,
I'm going to Detroit.

00:23:11.551 --> 00:23:12.550
Can I crash with anyone?

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.160
Or someone will be like, oh,
I'm coming from Ann Arbor,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.225
ride with me-- you know,
like that sort of thing.

00:23:17.225 --> 00:23:18.070
It's super cool.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.930
I feel like that has developed.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:22.370
It's such, you know, a core.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.620
It's really cool.

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.010
LAURA MURPHY: To stay connected?

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.550
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, it's cool.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.960
And it's a way of saying
connected because, also,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.690
in this digital age, it's not
as easy to stay connected.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:32.030
But somehow it is feeding
and it is helping.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.270
Like, the way that
they can connect online

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.950
and through all these platforms
that are being created

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:41.230
helps them connect and
build relationships

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.442
outside of the digital.

00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:43.900
ZAMBRICKI LI: Well,
then it's also,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.483
when they come to
the show, since they

00:23:45.483 --> 00:23:47.620
know each other from
online, then it's

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.440
kind of like they
know each other.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:48.880
And it's like--

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.080
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah,
the rapport is there.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.205
ZAMBRICKI LI: They already
kind of know each other.

00:23:52.205 --> 00:23:55.997
It's like online dating
except around our music.

00:23:55.997 --> 00:23:56.830
LAURA MURPHY: It is.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.680
Well, and I was talking about
that tour bus that's out front.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.860
If you guys haven't had
a chance to check it out,

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:02.620
it's incredible.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.290
It's amazing.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.420
So let's talk a little
bit about the tour.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:04.780
ZAMBRICKI LI: After
this, let's all go.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.770
We can all pile in.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.260
LAURA MURPHY:
We're all invited--

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.110
mimosas and bagels and whatever.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.650
But let's talk a little bit
about how your tour is going.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.950
I was looking at your schedule.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:14.680
It's absolutely insane.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.990
And if you didn't see
this on Instagram today,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.360
these guys posted, "So
excited to be in Detroit."

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.390
They had a beautiful photo
from one of the last times

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.960
they were here.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.170
It was taken outside
The Shelter, I believe.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:29.320
And they're posting about
today being their day off.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.480
And they're so excited
to be at Google.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.320
I love these guys.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:33.400
So today's their day off.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.360
They're here with us.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.475
I think tomorrow you're headed
to Toronto and then the East

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:36.520
Coast.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.530
ZAMBRICKI LI: We head to
Toronto tonight, yeah,

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.660
and then the show is tomorrow.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.590
LAURA MURPHY: So how
is the tour going?

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.110
Is there anything fun
you can share with us?

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.651
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah,
it's going great.

00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:45.440
I mean, since, you know,
we're on our first album,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.810
we're a fairly new band.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.090
And now that we
have an album out,

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.650
it's been really
cool because a lot

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.966
of the people who come to
the shows kind of lived

00:24:52.966 --> 00:24:53.590
with the album.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.180
And they know.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.020
So they're like
singing all the words.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.680
So every night it's
like we get to the city.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.990
Like, you know, last night
we played in Ann Arbor.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:03.610
And we've only been
there once before.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.510
So we kind of still
don't know what

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:06.160
to expect when we
go to these places.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.076
And then we get in there
and everyone's, like,

00:25:08.076 --> 00:25:08.985
singing the bridge.

00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:10.000
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, they
sing it louder than we can.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.900
ZAMBRICKI LI: It's really cool.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.800
Yeah, it's awesome.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.341
So that's been kind
of connecting it,

00:25:13.341 --> 00:25:16.137
where it's just like
been an awesome surprise

00:25:16.137 --> 00:25:18.720
because some of these places we
haven't really been that much.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.803
And, you know, the music's
out there in the world.

00:25:20.803 --> 00:25:22.930
And, like, we see people
on social media and stuff.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.910
But then it like makes it
real when you go there.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.870
Then you can look
them in the eye.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.750
And it's like, that's
right, you're real.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:28.626
This is a real thing.

00:25:28.626 --> 00:25:30.875
BRIAN ZAGHI: And one thing
I really love about the way

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:32.590
that we tour or just
touring in general

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.412
is that we're stuck together
for such a long period of time.

00:25:35.412 --> 00:25:36.870
ZAMBRICKI LI:
[INAUDIBLE] you like?

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.090
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, because then
we just start writing things.

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:40.660
And, like, it's really
cool that our writing

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.180
process kind of flourishes
when we're all together stuck

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.980
on a bus.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.860
I mean, the last tour
we did last summer--

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.470
or two summers ago, I guess--

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.406
we toured in a mobile.

00:25:51.406 --> 00:25:52.780
Like, we bought
this shuttle bus.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.630
And we converted it into a
mobile solar-powered recording

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.510
studio that we took
along this tour that

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.340
was like in these beautiful
parts of the country.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.622
And we were playing
these festivals.

00:26:03.622 --> 00:26:05.080
And as we were
writing these songs,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.540
we'd record parts of
the songs in, like,

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.595
a flower field in Crested Butte,
Colorado, or like an old--

00:26:12.595 --> 00:26:13.720
ZAMBRICKI LI: Train tunnel.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.950
BRIAN ZAGHI: --train tunnel in
Snoqualmie, Washington State,

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.450
so all these interesting
places where there are not

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.700
only beautiful scenery
but also these,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.530
like, sound anomalies
that would sound

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.690
really cool on recordings.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.060
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.140
So, basically, we looked
at our summer tour.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.620
And we had all these
festivals and all these things

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:31.190
kind of popping up.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.880
So instead of, like, booking
more shows to fill the gaps,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.980
we actually booked
sessions out in nature,

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.650
so like the Redwood trees
in northern California.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.980
There's this road called
Avenue of the Giants.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.200
And they have these huge
trees, like half the size

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.610
of this room wide.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:47.920
It actually sounds beautiful
in there, you know?

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.060
Like, in here we have foam.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.700
And we're, like, doing all these
things to make it sound good.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.440
But if you go inside of
a Redwood tree, like,

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:53.950
you're done.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.454
It's like a million
dollar studio.

00:26:55.454 --> 00:26:57.370
So that's where we
recorded some of the violin

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:58.972
parts, some of the banjo parts.

00:26:58.972 --> 00:27:00.430
BRIAN ZAGHI: Like
inside of a tree.

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.055
The tree trunk has,
like, a cavern.

00:27:02.055 --> 00:27:03.430
LAURA MURPHY:
Hollowed out, yeah.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.205
ZAMBRICKI LI: So we would pull--

00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:04.640
BRIAN ZAGHI: Naturally
hollowed out.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.370
ZAMBRICKI LI: So we'd pull the
bus up to the side of the road,

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.490
greet the ranger or
whomever would pull us

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.230
over because they think we're
doing something nefarious.

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.063
AUSTIN BISNOW: Because
we didn't technically

00:27:13.063 --> 00:27:14.130
have a session booked.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.040
It was internal.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.330
It was on our Google Calendar.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:17.530
LAURA MURPHY: We did
it ourselves, yeah.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.310
ZAMBRICKI LI: But it's cool.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:20.140
It had a real, like,
Magellan kind of feel.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.973
You look at the map.

00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:23.110
And you're like, let's go
to Avenue of the Giants.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.790
And you drive for like eight
hours, and then you're there.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.530
You know?

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.330
AUSTIN BISNOW:
"Coming to America"

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.910
where he's like,
"I need a queen.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.747
I'll go to Queens, New York."

00:27:29.747 --> 00:27:31.330
ZAMBRICKI LI: I need
to make a record.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:32.010
LAURA MURPHY: Amazing movie.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.385
AUSTIN BISNOW:
Magic Giant, we'll

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:35.020
go to Avenue of the Giants.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.840
ZAMBRICKI LI: So we pulled the
bus up to the Redwood Grove.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.850
And then it's being
powered by the sun

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.060
because we have solar
panels on the bus.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.220
And then we run
all the equipment--

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.570
the wires and the
equipment-- out and just--

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:44.790
AUSTIN BISNOW: Is
Google on the sun?

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.030
LAURA MURPHY: No, not yet.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.010
ZAMBRICKI LI: You guys have
got to get on the sun, man.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.240
LAURA MURPHY: We're
working on it.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.650
ZAMBRICKI LI: And, I
mean, it's beautiful.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.105
It's dead quiet because
we're not running generators.

00:27:52.105 --> 00:27:53.110
We're not running power.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.710
There's nothing going on.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.250
There's not even
lights or anything.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.100
Everything makes
little sound, you know?

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.100
When you add it all
together, it kind of creates

00:27:59.100 --> 00:27:59.830
this noise floor.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.270
So you go out in
nature, and it's just

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.202
completely dead quiet.

00:28:02.202 --> 00:28:03.910
You have this beautiful
acoustic anomaly,

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.910
which is a Redwood tree.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.590
And you record it there.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:08.770
And it also makes it
so it's like now, when

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.690
we play the songs
and think back on it,

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.090
we have all these other
memories kind of attached to it.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.840
It's really cool.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.256
AUSTIN BISNOW: One
story from that

00:28:15.256 --> 00:28:20.560
as we played the beginning of
"Jade," which is the opening

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.450
song on the album,
at this place,

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.402
Hidden Lake on Powder
Mountain, Utah.

00:28:25.402 --> 00:28:28.990
Well, it was hidden
until I said that.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.390
The first lyric is,
"Sang the bird forever,

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.900
and then she flew away."

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.150
And, as Zang played, like, the
first take, he played that.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.450
And birds chirped
over that part.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.897
And it gave us
chills in the moment.

00:28:42.897 --> 00:28:44.230
Then we went back to the studio.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.590
And we were like, wait,
is this too cliche?

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.310
ZAMBRICKI LI: It sounded like
we did it in Logic or something.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.320
AUSTIN BISNOW: People are going
to think we added this in.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.040
ZAMBRICKI LI: It sounded like it
was like, chirp, chirp, chirp,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.304
like you flew it in a sample.

00:28:52.304 --> 00:28:53.720
So we got a little
self-conscious.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.570
We were like, OK,
can we take it out?

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.400
Let's just take it out because
it's a little on the nose.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.774
And then we tried
to take it out.

00:28:58.774 --> 00:29:01.353
But you can't take it out
because it's in the recording.

00:29:01.353 --> 00:29:02.070
LAURA MURPHY: That's
the part of nature.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.300
It's what you intended it to be.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:03.350
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.808
So we just kind of
took it and then

00:29:04.808 --> 00:29:06.340
like distorted it a little bit.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.250
So it's like the album starts
with, like, distorted birds.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.740
And that was kind of almost
the theme of the record.

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:13.520
It became, take these
things in nature.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.020
And then we went
back to the studio.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.925
We kind of like still
took the license

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:19.300
that you normally take when
you're making a record as far

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.310
as being able to kind
of manipulate the sounds

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:23.590
and create, like, the
colors that you want.

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.175
But we used it from, like, a
purely organic starting point.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:27.550
LAURA MURPHY: It's
so fascinating

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.160
how completely in
tune you guys are

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.170
with a lot of things around
you, be it recording in nature

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:36.760
or what's going on in
the digital social world.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.230
And I find it amazing that one
of your highest-viewed videos

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.970
on YouTube is the
one where you shot

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.570
from a chairlift or a ski lift.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.280
And tell us a little
bit about that.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.930
Was that a challenge
with the audio?

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:53.080
Or did you have to do a little
magic afterwards with that?

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.352
BRIAN ZAGHI: That
was a challenge.

00:29:55.352 --> 00:29:56.560
A couple of things helped us.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.660
One, they have these field
recorders that we would use.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:03.640
So my guitar and his
banjo were directly

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.290
fed into this field recorder.

00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:07.960
And then Austin, it
was all a selfie.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.450
He was holding a phone.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.340
And on that phone, there
are these external mics

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.110
that you can plug
into the phone.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.340
And we used one from Shure.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.980
Shure makes one that plugs
into the phone that has, like,

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.400
a pretty nice condenser
mic on that phone.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.899
So we were recording--

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:25.940
ZAMBRICKI LI: And then we
take it back and blend.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.606
There's actually one
other kind of trick

00:30:27.606 --> 00:30:29.260
that you can do that
we've done before.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.250
I don't know if we
did it on that video.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.200
We may have done it,
like, on the banjo.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.540
You actually just take
a phone and tape it

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.660
to the back of your
instrument and then use, like,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.640
the voice memo inside
the phone, which they all

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.780
come with voice memos.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:43.240
And the microphones
on these phones

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.680
are actually
getting really good.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.690
So we'd tape it to the back
of the instrument-- like, say,

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.148
tape it to the back
of the guitar--

00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:50.030
so you get like a really
close, direct sound.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.850
You just try not to bang into
it when you're playing it.

00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:54.100
So you kind of have to be
careful and conscious of it.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.290
And then we go
back to the studio.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.930
We can take all these
different sources.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:58.450
And then we kind of do,
like, a regular mix.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.130
So it becomes a
blend that you do.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.856
So you can kind of like mix it.

00:31:02.856 --> 00:31:04.480
There's some things
you can't take out,

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.540
you know, all that
kind of thing.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.280
But you have a little
bit of flexibility.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.790
So it's not like just the
phone in front of you,

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:10.917
which gets his vocal.

00:31:10.917 --> 00:31:12.250
LAURA MURPHY: That's incredible.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:12.750
I love it.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.015
Your inspiration seems
to come from everywhere,

00:31:16.015 --> 00:31:19.270
including the name of
your band, Magic Giant.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.274
I read that it was
inspired by a TED Talk?

00:31:21.274 --> 00:31:22.315
AUSTIN BISNOW: It's true.

00:31:22.315 --> 00:31:24.023
BRIAN ZAGHI: It was
a Google Talk, right?

00:31:24.023 --> 00:31:25.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.636 --> 00:31:27.260
AUSTIN BISNOW: So,
yeah, it came from--

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.301
LAURA MURPHY: A TED Talk?

00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:29.760
AUSTIN BISNOW: --a
TED Talk about--

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.800
ZAMBRICKI LI: He's just
kissing the ring whenever

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.810
he can over there, yeah.

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:33.250
LAURA MURPHY: It's OK.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.940
Well, he's sitting
closest to me.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.410
BRIAN ZAGHI: That's right.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.665
ZAMBRICKI LI:
You're charming him.

00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:37.860
LAURA MURPHY: You
want to hold hands?

00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.290
ZAMBRICKI LI: I'm afraid.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.900
AUSTIN BISNOW: --by this
visual artist, Peter Tunney.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.060
And he was describing
his mentor,

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.400
who happened to
be Jonas Salk, who

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.350
came up with the cure for
polio among other things.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.350
But he was describing
him as a giant

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.310
in every sense of the word.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:56.150
And they showed a photo of him.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:00.680
And he was like, you know, in
the low five-foot-something.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.630
And we just thought
that was so cool.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.700
You don't have to be
big to be a giant.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:04.960
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.334
And also, earlier
in the talk, he

00:32:06.334 --> 00:32:09.530
was talking about
when he was young.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:10.940
He was doing magic.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.670
And then he went into this
story about his mentor,

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.450
who is this giant
personality-- you

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.770
know, found the cure for polio,
did all these amazing things.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.510
And when he showed the photo,
he was just like, you know,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:22.590
this average Joe.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.690
BRIAN ZAGHI: You're
expecting a giant.

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:24.740
ZAMBRICKI LI: You're
expecting someone.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.417
He cured polio.

00:32:25.417 --> 00:32:26.750
He did all these amazing things.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:27.740
And then he's just-- you know.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.865
And I think that's, like,
a big part of what it is.

00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:33.980
It's like the biggest
minds or the people

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.660
that change the
world are not always

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.070
Andre the Giant or whatever.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.850
It's just like--

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:38.820
AUSTIN BISNOW: It could be.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.460
ZAMBRICKI LI: It could be, yeah.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.020
But it's just Jonas Salk
from Queens or whatever.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.700
So it's kind of
like the name came

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.110
from compressing the
entire Peter Tunney TED

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.180
Talk into two words.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.820
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.160
Being five foot nothing, I
can relate to that mantra.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.910
I like that a lot.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.122
AUSTIN BISNOW: No,
you're a giant.

00:32:57.122 --> 00:32:58.580
ZAMBRICKI LI: And
that's the thing.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.770
You don't have to be
big to be a giant.

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.310
LAURA MURPHY: That's
very inspiring.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:05.240
I do want to give you guys
a few more minutes here

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.670
because I was so
fascinated, one,

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.640
not only by the show last
night but just even talking

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.520
to you guys for a few minutes
about where you want to go.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.940
I'd love to hear sort of,
after the end of the tour--

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.670
which I know ends
around Coachella,

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.100
giant headliner there--

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.310
what do you guys sort of see
as the future of the band?

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.310
Do you see yourselves taking on
another giant tour right away

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.760
or time in the studio?

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:30.800
AUSTIN BISNOW: Maybe we're going
to be software engineering.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.680
I'm not sure.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.300
LAURA MURPHY: Or
software engineering.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:33.850
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.570
I mean, we've been
writing on this tour.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:38.234
So we have one song
that we just started

00:33:38.234 --> 00:33:40.400
playing kind of like every
night we played acoustic.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.600
So probably, by the
end of the tour,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.310
we'll have it worked
out enough to record it.

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.900
So we're going to
record a new song.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.120
We're going to keep writing.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.080
AUSTIN BISNOW: We have
more tours coming up, too.

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.060
ZAMBRICKI LI: We have
more tours coming up.

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.809
AUSTIN BISNOW: We might
go back to Europe.

00:33:50.809 --> 00:33:52.204
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, nice.

00:33:52.204 --> 00:33:54.620
ZAMBRICKI LI: You know, we
have this really cool community

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.071
of people that have been
kind of coming along with us.

00:33:57.071 --> 00:33:58.820
And, you know, we want
to keep that going.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.280
I think, like, fans are cool.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.539
But community's better.

00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:04.580
So, like, anything that
we can do to kind of keep

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.460
fostering that as we
keep working on music

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.298
and planning out everything,
that's what we're going for.

00:34:11.298 --> 00:34:15.489
LAURA MURPHY: And that
Coachella concert--

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:19.340
I don't know, festival--
that you have coming up,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.670
are you ready for that?

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:23.059
Do you think that's probably
one of the bigger shows

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:24.350
that you'll headline this year?

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.766
Or do you have plans beyond
that that we don't know about?

00:34:26.766 --> 00:34:28.629
ZAMBRICKI LI: We're
doing Bottle Rock, which

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:30.159
is in Napa, which is also--

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.010
LAURA MURPHY: That's in Napa.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.439
Is that after
Coachella this year?

00:34:33.439 --> 00:34:34.230
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.219
It's after, yeah.

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:35.900
LAURA MURPHY: I think it is.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.010
ZAMBRICKI LI: So, yes, we're
looking forward to that.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.350
I mean, yeah, we're definitely
really excited about Coachella.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.969
It's cool because
it's two weekends.

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.409
We play both Sundays.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.750
So it's like it's a
whole little chapter.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.659
So it's going to be really good.

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:48.368
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:34:48.368 --> 00:34:49.909
Everyone in this
room knows about it,

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:52.775
but YouTube puts a lot into
broadcasting Coachella live.

00:34:52.775 --> 00:34:54.900
AUSTIN BISNOW: Right, they
do the whole live thing.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.100
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.960
We'll all have to
check it out and look

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.880
for when your set is
on those two weekends

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.089
so we can watch you
guys on YouTube Live.

00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:02.630
AUSTIN BISNOW: I
know it's on Sunday.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:03.230
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah,
it's on Sunday.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.890
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, Sunday?

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.280
AUSTIN BISNOW: That's as
much as we know so far.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.350
LAURA MURPHY: The first
or the second weekend?

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.850
ZAMBRICKI LI: Both
weekends, yeah.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:07.640
They do a mirror.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.410
It's the same exact
lineup both weekends.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.493
LAURA MURPHY: OK, awesome.

00:35:10.493 --> 00:35:12.530
Yeah, and they have
cameras on each stage.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:13.040
Great.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.475
Awesome.

00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:13.910
BRIAN ZAGHI: Right on.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:16.490
AUSTIN BISNOW: One thing we're
doing is, for every album

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.470
that is purchased at a
show, we plant a tree

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:22.910
through an organization
called One Tree Planted.

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.160
That's something we're
passionate about, too.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.165
LAURA MURPHY: Do you
solicit funds for that?

00:35:28.165 --> 00:35:29.970
I know you give your own funds.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.609
But do you take donations?

00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:34.650
ZAMBRICKI LI: We have
worked with matchers, yeah.

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:35.941
Like, some people have matched.

00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:36.990
Like, we'll do a tour.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.990
And then we'll get, like,
a partner for the tour

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.004
that will match
every one that we do.

00:35:41.004 --> 00:35:42.920
AUSTIN BISNOW: And this
tour, it's GreenNotes.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.380
And they're also doing
carbon offsets for the tour.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.972
And we're doing bio-diesel
and, you know, no--

00:35:48.972 --> 00:35:50.180
LAURA MURPHY: Zero emissions?

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.220
AUSTIN BISNOW: Yeah,
and no disposable

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.747
plastics that we have.

00:35:53.747 --> 00:35:56.205
BRIAN ZAGHI: There's a cool
thing, the first I've seen it--

00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:56.480
AUSTIN BISNOW: Oh, yeah.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.230
BRIAN ZAGHI: We have
these VIP bracelets

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.530
because we have, like,
a VIP intimate session

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.707
before some of the shows.

00:36:01.707 --> 00:36:03.290
And they actually
have these bracelets

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.720
that are made out of some
kind of biodegradable thing.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.310
And they hold seeds in them.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:08.870
So they're called
seed bracelets.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.150
So when you're done, you
can plant these bracelets.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.250
And, like, I don't
know what grows out

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.804
of them but some kind of flower.

00:36:14.804 --> 00:36:15.470
Something grows.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:17.072
LAURA MURPHY: Hmm,
what does grow?

00:36:17.072 --> 00:36:18.530
ZAMBRICKI LI: Wait,
should we check

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.115
what grows before we give
them out to everybody?

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:21.430
BRIAN ZAGHI: No, I think
it's lavender, actually.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.930
They said it was lavender.

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:24.170
AUSTIN BISNOW: They said
it was a sculpture of Zang.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.126
Like, it's already sculpted.

00:36:26.126 --> 00:36:27.360
BRIAN ZAGHI: A lavender bush.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:27.530
LAURA MURPHY: Mr. Tango.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.030
AUSTIN BISNOW: And
he's doing salsa.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:31.900
It's just really cool.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.430
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
that's very incredible.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.419
Do you want to talk
about Mr. Tango at all?

00:36:36.419 --> 00:36:37.460
It's kind of a phenomena.

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:38.610
ZAMBRICKI LI: You can't
talk about it because--

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.750
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, I mean,
it's not you, Zang, obviously.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.791
ZAMBRICKI LI: He's only
Mr. Tango when he wears--

00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:44.310
LAURA MURPHY: The fur coat?

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.929
ZAMBRICKI LI: No, he has
to be wearing the glasses.

00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:48.470
AUSTIN BISNOW: You
spotted Mr. Tango.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:49.430
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, do
you have to have--

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.470
AUSTIN BISNOW: I've
never met Mr. Tango.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.730
LAURA MURPHY: I'm so
fascinated by these videos.

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.640
If you guys haven't
seen this, they

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.560
have a celebrity guest
called Mr. Tango.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.435
And they follow him
like a paparazzi.

00:37:02.435 --> 00:37:03.560
BRIAN ZAGHI: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.460
LAURA MURPHY: And your views
on those videos are incredible.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.860
People love them so much.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.281
And who is this sweet little old
lady in the compilation Tango

00:37:12.281 --> 00:37:12.780
video?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.680
BRIAN ZAGHI: That's
his grandmother.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.180
ZAMBRICKI LI:
That's his grandma.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.290
AUSTIN BISNOW: That's my
94-and-1/2-year-old grandma.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.498
ZAMBRICKI LI: Yeah, she's 94.

00:37:17.498 --> 00:37:21.140
We actually just went to
her home in Salt Lake City

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.850
and played some songs for her.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.290
And, you know, she's 94.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.000
And she's sharp as a tack.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.020
And she's singing along.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:27.739
It's beautiful.

00:37:27.739 --> 00:37:29.030
LAURA MURPHY: I love her, yeah.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.962
Actually, your
step-dad, I didn't

00:37:30.962 --> 00:37:33.420
know that was your step-dad
playing football in your video.

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.390
ZAMBRICKI LI: He's
actually in our video

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:36.350
for "Window," as well.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.560
He's like our Robert De Niro,
our internal Robert De Niro.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.944
He just has this face where it's
just like, when he shows pain,

00:37:42.944 --> 00:37:43.860
you really believe it.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.960
Not everyone can do that.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.310
You either have it or you don't.

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:48.275
LAURA MURPHY: But he wasn't
actually playing football

00:37:48.275 --> 00:37:49.386
and tackling those guys, was he?

00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:50.390
BRIAN ZAGHI: He was
playing football.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.110
He was playing.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.401
ZAMBRICKI LI: What do you mean?

00:37:52.401 --> 00:37:53.300
Or was it a dream?

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:53.883
We don't know.

00:37:53.883 --> 00:37:55.670
LAURA MURPHY: Or was it?

00:37:55.670 --> 00:38:00.129
So whoever this Mr. Tango
is, how did that get started?

00:38:00.129 --> 00:38:02.170
ZAMBRICKI LI: If you see
him, let us let us know.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.900
LAURA MURPHY: I will.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.358
BRIAN ZAGHI: We
also have a passion

00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:07.640
for, like, just comedic skits
and video and things like that.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.720
It's not just music.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.870
We love other sort of
like art forms and things.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:12.170
So we just try.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:12.680
We imitate.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.780
We have fun on our social media.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.000
It's not just music, I think.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.924
We love doing all sorts of--

00:38:17.924 --> 00:38:20.090
AUSTIN BISNOW: Yeah, good
luck looking a Google Talk

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:21.410
with Mr. Tango because--

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.870
ZAMBRICKI LI: You can't get him.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:22.430
AUSTIN BISNOW:
--he's hard to find.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.165
ZAMBRICKI LI: He's
not available.

00:38:23.165 --> 00:38:24.420
AUSTIN BISNOW: Yeah,
he's not available.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.040
He's booked.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.690
LAURA MURPHY: When
you guys hopefully

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.320
come through here again at
least in a couple of months,

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.140
our office is actually
moving to downtown Detroit.

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.610
So we'll have a
much bigger space.

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.350
We would love for
you to come back.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.840
And maybe we can invite
Mr. Tango for a talk, too.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.572
BRIAN ZAGHI: We'll
talk to his publicist.

00:38:40.572 --> 00:38:41.930
LAURA MURPHY: Perfect.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.460
Well, it's been an
absolute pleasure

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.790
having you guys here today.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.830
Thank you so much.

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.114
Google, let's give them
a huge round of applause.

00:38:48.114 --> 00:38:49.280
BRIAN ZAGHI: Thank you guys.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.890
LAURA MURPHY: Magic Giant,
you saw them here first

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:53.450
unless you've seen them before.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:58.660
But these guys are going
to be huge superstars.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.030
So thank you so much.
