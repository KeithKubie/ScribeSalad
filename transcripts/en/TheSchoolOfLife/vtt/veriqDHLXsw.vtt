00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:09.020
The idea that work might be fulfilling, rather than just painfully necessary, is a strikingly recent invention.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.920
Open Dr. Johnson's celebrated dictionary, published in 1755, and the word fulfillment doesn't even appear.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.040
Nowadays in a prosperous world, we don't only expect to obtain money through our labor,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.480
we also, to a greater or lesser extent, expect to find meaning and satisfaction.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.340
It's a big ask and helps to explain why so many of us have career crises often on a Sunday evening as the Sun begins to set.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.680
To help us on the quest for fulfilling work here are six useful ideas:

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.380
Firstly, accept the being confused about careers is perfectly normal.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.140
In a pre-industrial world there were, at most, some 2,000 different trades out there;

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.940
nowadays there' are estimated to be half a million different options.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.440
The result: we can become so anxious about making the wrong choice, we end up making no choice at all;

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.620
psychologists call this "the paradox of choice", paralysis stemming from too many options.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.980
We should acknowledge that confusion is natural, and fear entirely normal;

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.360
but let neither of these scupper our chances forever.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.520
Secondly, know yourself.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.380
It's the oldest philosophical recommendation, and has particular relevance to careers.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.120
For 99% of us knowing what we want to do doesn't arise spontaneously;

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.120
like for example, knowing what to eat.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.780
Most of us don't have a calling;

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.300
we don't hear a commanding god like voice directing us to accountancy, or packaging and distribution.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.820
That isn't to say we don't have taste or inclinations, we just don't know them clearly enough,

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.900
which is a perilous position to be in, as not having a plan quickly puts us at the mercy of those who do have one.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.000
We only catch glimpses, little hints of our tastes.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.360
So what we have to do is learn to pick up on their faint sounds:

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.260
start by parking any concerns for money for a time;

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.680
financial panic too often kills all dialogue with the more authentic, passionate sides of one's nature.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.260
Write down, without being too logical or analytical about it, everything you've ever enjoyed doing or making,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.740
which might include building a tree-house, or sorting out the winter clothes.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.320
The weirder and more offbeat list, the better.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.880
In the long and confused tangle that follows there will, somewhere, be the shape of an ideal future working self,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.520
but it'll be very messed up, and in need of being analyzed thoroughly

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.200
That's where philosophy comes in;

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.580
Philosophy is the art clearing up, and demanding logic of our first thoughts.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.460
Thirdly, think a lot.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.660
If it might take a couple of days, even a week, to choose a new car,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.540
it could, fairly, take a year or more of sustained daily reflection to start to identify a career that fits.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.960
We tend to feel guilty about this: imagining we're being self-indulgent-far from it;

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.640
we may need to empty every weekend for months to sort out the biggest conundrum of our lives.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.380
To make sure we don't continue to spend the rest of our lives trapped in a job unwittingly chosen for us by our unknowing 16 year old selves,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.580
we need to be properly generous about the amount of time we'll need to give this.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.320
Fourthly, try something

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.020
It's tempting to imagine we'll be able to work out the shape of the workplace,

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.040
and of our own characters simply through pure process of reflection, but we need data,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.240
and we can only understand ourselves and others by colliding with the real world,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.500
in the process getting to know both it and our own natures.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.460
We need to take small, non-irrevocable steps to gather information,

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.340
for example by: shadowing, interning, or volunteering.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.780
We mustn't think we always have to resign on Monday;

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.760
we can investigate our futures through branching projects on the side of existing jobs.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000
Five, reflect on what makes people unhappy.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.440
Every successful business is at heart an attempt to solve someone else's problem;

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.960
the bigger and more urgent problem, the greater the opportunity.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.680
To flex your entrepreneurial muscles, consider an average day and everything in it that might make someone unhappy:

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.580
from losing the house keys, to finding the food a little greasy, to arguing yet again with their spouse.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.940
Each of these is a business opportunity waiting to be exploited;

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.780
it's a chance for us to serve, which is what work really is.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.320
It's easy to imagine that everything's been done and tried- nonsense;

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.320
we're unhappy enough for capitalism to have many more centuries of invention and creativity to it.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.120
Six, be confident.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.860
So many bad self help books are about confidence;

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.580
it can be tempting to dismiss the whole topic as nonsense;

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.920
but in a peculiar and rather humbling way,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.040
it really does seem as if the difference between success and failure is sometimes nothing less than the courage to give it a go.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.520
The ability to imagine oneself into a role, to surmise one doesn't need to ask anyone for permission

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.180
that many of the top positions simply belong to those who dare to boldly ask for them.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.400
A lack of confidence is at heart a misunderstanding of the way the world works;

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.400
it's an internalized feudalism which imagines that only certain people but not oneself, have the right, preordained, to get certain things.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.420
It isn't true.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.500
As we know, a lot more is possible than we might think at our moments of timidity  and doubt.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.140
That's a start of the path towards a job we won't regret on our death beds, which should always be the ultimate criterion.
