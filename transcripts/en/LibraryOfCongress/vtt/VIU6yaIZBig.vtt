00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.510
Welcome David Shannon.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:07.320
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.470
&gt;&gt; David Shannon: Hi you guys
look really comfy don't go

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.410
to sleep OK.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.410
It hurts my self esteem.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.750
Alright so let's
see did it work?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.110
Ah, yeah there we go.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.920
It's David's birthday
yeah can you believe this?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.840
No, David turned 20
years old this year.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.510
Yeah it's been 20 years.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.520
He still doesn't look a
day over five does he?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.210
So yeah so I thought
I would just kind

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.420
of celebrate David's birthday
by just thanking everybody

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.140
out there who -- who's
made David last this long

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.970
and has had so much fun.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.210
I'm just going to kind of share
with you guys some of the ways

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.450
that people have had fun with
No, David because that's --

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.470
that's been so rewarding for me.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.690
So there he is.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.210
I don't know if you know the
story about how I got the idea

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.000
for No, David, do you know that?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.090
Well, I got the idea from a book
I made when I was a little kid.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.750
It was eight pages long,
I drew a bunch of pictures

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.350
of me doing stuff I
wasn't supposed to do

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.470
and the only words in the
whole book were no and David.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.760
Because that's all
I knew how to spell.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.890
And my mom saved it.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.330
And many years later she pulled
it out of her magic closet

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.180
and showed it to me and I
said this might make a good

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.550
children's' book.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.710
So I wrote a few more words,
not a lot more, just a few.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.800
And I drew new pictures
and that's where the No,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.360
David that you know kind of --

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.610
this No, David that's
where he come from.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.380
But this is what the
original looked like.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.950
[laughter] There it is, yeah.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.920
So when I first started
drawing the new version

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.520
of David I drew it
kind of realistically

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.110
and it lost all its personality

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.140
and just fell flat
and sat there.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.870
And I went well what was
it about this original

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.240
that I was responding to?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.500
So I went back and I looked
it and I tried to draw

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.370
like a five year old and that's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.520
where the drawing
style came from.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.980
Here's another piece.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.820
And so whenever I got stuck
on anything I just went back

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.670
to the original so
the type style,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.530
the writing and the
pointy teeth.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.230
I don't know if you can
tell that's David on a chair

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.460
and that's a box
of Coco Krispies

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.360
with -- remember Snagglepus?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.800
Exit stage left, that
-- that's what it is.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.290
There's another one of me
getting into cookie dough

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.650
and do you guys realize this,

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.380
when I was a little kid cookie
dough ice cream hadn't been

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.220
invented yet.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.080
Yeah I know terrible,
they were hard times --

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.750
they were hard times.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.130
And so and you couldn't get it
in rolls like that at the store.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.800
The only way you could get
cookie dough was to steal it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.550
when your mom was making
chocolate chip cookies

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.370
because she would let
you lick the beaters.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.090
You could do -- she'd
go here's the beater.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.650
And then after that
you had to have more.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.780
So then when her back was turned
you'd -- it was delicious.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.700
So anyway, you could see
there's a lot of similarities

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:05.630
between like the that
no, David this no, David.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:15.190
So even the pointy teeth and
stuff came from the original.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.300
So let's see where am I?

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.500
So over the years all kinds
of people have been having fun

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.010
with David especially
like in schools.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.670
So like teachers decorate
their doors with David,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.450
and they decorate
their walls with David.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.750
I love these.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.030
And they decorate their
kids with David [laughter].

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.690
Sometimes I go into these
schools and there's whole walls

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.220
of Davids, like there's
about 100 of them and its --

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.150
it's pretty terrifying really.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.870
It's like an army of Davids.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.640
You know you think -- you
think zombies are frightening.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.450
Sometimes they decorate
their principal.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.490
Isn't that great?

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.170
I mean you know really.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.220
Here's another one.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.000
Personally I think
he's just made

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.260
for a Christmas ornament,
don't you?

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.570
They make cakes, there's
a lot of baking involved

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.860
with celebrating
David's birthday.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.630
And cake pops.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.090
And this kid's name
is David by the way.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:42.450
Yeah, is that beautiful?

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:52.260
Oh, well now it's also -- it's
also very gratifying to be able

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.980
to influence the
youth of America.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.970
My favorite part of this picture
is the hand coming in get, get,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.540
get your finger out
of your nose.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.490
Now just in case though people
you know don't accuse me

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.190
of your kid reading my --

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.630
my books and engaging
in bad behavior

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.780
because it's not
just the David book.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:23.010
It's not just David that does
that, you see that happens

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.750
to be the picture he's
looking at right there.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.470
No influence there at all

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.340
because actually all my
books make kids do this.

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.420
Yeah that's a bad --
that's Alice the fairy.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:45.090
But by far the most -- the
most wonderful thing is all the

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.000
letters and the -- I have
a whole collection of No,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.310
David books that kids have made.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.600
And sometimes it's you know
maybe I should've called it no,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.070
your kids name here.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.380
But they're just
wonderful, they're all --

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.890
there's yes, David books
and no, David books

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.640
and David goes to the zoo.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.770
Fantastic stuff and I
thought I'd read a couple

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.070
of the letters.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.390
Here's a few of the
drawings first of all.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.450
I wish I could draw
like this, seriously.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:26.200
There's David's rock band,
heavy metal I'm sure.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.680
Look at that one.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.620
So here's a few of these
letters, they're just -

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.920
they're really hilarious.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.390
Ok this is -- this is
the good kind right here.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:47.270
Dear crazy Mr. Davey thank you

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.670
for coming I absolutely
love your books

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.270
and I hope you make more.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.370
I hope I get to see you
more, I love all your books

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.760
and I am obsessed with them.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.490
You are -- you are the
best book writer ever.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:08.180
If I get to meet you again
I will scream with joy.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.110
So this letter I -- I saved

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:16.420
and whenever my family gives me
too much guff I pull out this

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.350
and say, let me just read
this letter to you again.

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:22.260
But then I get these too.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.770
Dear David Shannon, I've
read No, David recently

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:31.000
and I liked it but maybe
you should right more words.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.400
You also should add a little
bit more detail to the picture.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.700
Like when David was reaching

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.040
for the cookies you should
add little drops of sweat

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.600
since he was determined
and frustrated.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.180
You also should write the words
of what the sounds are from like

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.890
when David was banging
pots and pans.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.570
You should add like
a crash or bang.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.490
I'd like that.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.450
Then the book would
be more exciting

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.410
and fiction readers
would read it.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.850
They would get so,
so, so into the book.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.220
They wouldn't know
where they were,

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:16.400
that David Shannon is how I
want you to change this book.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.520
A lot of critics out there.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.970
I just read your book No, David
could you please just make it

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:31.870
so David has a towel
instead of the nakedness.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.440
Do you guys know that
picture of David running

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.700
down the street naked?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.370
Yeah. He says could you imagine
what kid's parents would say?

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.670
The parents would
say, never check out

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.260
or read this book again.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:55.990
That's why I think you should
take the nakedness out.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:03.440
Dear David Shannon, don't
eat gum, you are nasty.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.870
Listen to the teacher.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.010
You are bad, I don't' like you.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:15.750
David you are very bad, I
don't very, very like you.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.320
I don't like you so
much love Nate ps.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.270
I like your books.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:33.530
Yeah, so -- so I wasn't going
to do anymore David books.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.920
I had put that behind me because
each -- each book I tried to --

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.100
I don't want to do the same
book over and over again.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.460
I tried to sort of explore a
different level of authority

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.030
or a different set of rules
because David's all about kind

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.770
of breaking the rules right.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.920
And so like after No, David
the next book was David Goes

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.360
to School because
that's the next level

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.210
of authority is your
teacher right.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.480
She's the next person that
says no to you after your mom.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.100
So but my editor was
celebrating her 25th anniversary

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.600
of her imprint and
David was celebrated --

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.360
is celebrating his 20th birthday

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.970
so my editor kept
saying I'd sure

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.390
like to have a new David book.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:25.460
I say no. I'd sure
like to have one.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.720
And then I realized I'd
been kicking around an idea

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.130
about my big brother --

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.980
about the relationships
between siblings.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.650
And I say well what am I doing?

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.890
This is perfect for a No, David
book because your relationship

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.010
with your older sibling is
you know that's a whole --

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.880
that's a whole new set of rules.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.340
It's a whole new set of --

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.970
of things that you
get in trouble about.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.480
You know brothers
get in trouble.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:03.260
So that's where this book
came from and let's see.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.160
So the interesting thing
about siblings is they live

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.760
under the same roof,
in the same house,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.180
but they have two different
sets of rules don't they?

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.720
So like the older
brother gets to do things

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.070
that the younger brother can't

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.580
because he's bigger
and he's older.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.900
But the little brother
can get away with things

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.910
that the older brother can't.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.360
So and eventually that
creates some tension

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.260
which is always good for a
story -- a little conflict.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.980
So David wants to play
football but he's too little.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.300
Stop following me, anybody
here have a little brother

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.940
or a little sister?

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.450
Do they follow you around?

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.470
They do don't they, yeah.

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.340
Yeah, stop following me.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:57.550
But of course David
bothers his brother too,

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.400
because his brother has
things like homework.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.960
You know his job
is to do homework;

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.030
David's job at this point
is just to be silly.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.420
So that doesn't go together.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.400
And my brother -- my
brother was very concerned

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.130
about being mature.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:15.260
He would always say to
me you are so immature.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.030
So we -- we -- my little sister
and I called him Mr. maturity.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.040
And he's -- he's still
kind of like that.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:33.260
Yeah, but David finds ways at
getting back at his brother.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.800
Oh, but then his
brother retaliates.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.960
This is how it happens, can
you guys see the loogy coming

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.260
down on the left there?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:47.940
Yeah, this is a true story
ah-huh and so if I yell for --

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.230
it says, go ahead call mom.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.620
So if I yelled for help guess

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.310
where that loogy
went, in my mouth.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.950
Yeah, otherwise he
would just drop it down

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.250
and suck it back down.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.500
And then drop it down,
and suck it back up.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.620
Yeah horrible things.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:13.640
But I've polled kids on
this and this is still going

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.290
on today, this activity.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.930
So eventually they
both get in trouble

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.260
because they were roughhousing.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.130
But in the end -- so
after, after they get

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.260
in trouble mom says go
outside, go outside and play.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.830
And David finally
gets to play football.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:40.000
And this is how it
happens is that his brother

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.290
and their friends they're
starting a football game

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:46.710
and they only -- they have
an uneven number of players.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.980
They have seven guys
or nine guys

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:54.690
and so they finally go
David, you want to play?

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.660
And David says yes and of
course he gets flattened.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.240
But in the end both David

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.810
and his brother do grow
up just a little bit.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:10.670
And that's how Grow
Up David ends.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.470
Thank you.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:21.280
So we have -- we have time for
questions I hope, we do, good.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.680
Alright anybody got a question?

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.920
What's your question?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.880
Ok good question.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.450
He asked how long it took
me to make Grow Up David.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:40.970
Well I'll tell you it takes
a long time to make a book

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.620
because I always start out --

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.570
whenever I'm doing a book I read
the story a whole bunch of times

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.890
so I know it really well.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.720
And then I get out
a big piece of paper

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.870
and I start making little
tiny sketches called thumbnail

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.420
sketches in pencil.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.610
And they're really scribbly
and I make hundreds of them

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:01.910
because I'm just
trying to figure

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.340
out what picture is going
to go on which page?

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.050
And it's kind of like a puzzle
because if I change something

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:11.770
on page 20 sometimes I
have to go back to page 12

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.690
and change something there too.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.770
So when I get that
all figured out,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.610
then I do full size pencil
drawings and make lots

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.040
of mistakes and I erase a
lot and sometimes I get mad

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:27.760
and I crumple it up and
throw it over my shoulder

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.060
and go that's terrible.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.090
And then I run back and I
get it and smooth it out

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.410
and go really ah
it wasn't so bad.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.490
And then when I get the
drawings all done I do full

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:37.790
color paintings.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.700
And then I send those

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.740
to the book company called the
publisher and they take pictures

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.580
of the paintings and they
put the words next to them

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.420
and sew them all together
and put the hard cover on.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.950
And so all of that
takes about a year --

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.290
takes me about a
year to do a book.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.840
So yeah, a long time huh?

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.390
The David books take
a little bit less time

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.230
because I don't have
to stay in the lines

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:06.180
when I color them
which is always nice.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.480
Yeah.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.320
&gt;&gt; Who are your enemies?

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.700
&gt;&gt; Who are my enemies
[laughter]?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.310
I hope not you.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:24.970
My enemies, I've never,
ever been asked that before.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.060
You know I -- I -- I
try not to have enemies,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:36.620
I suppose Voldemort would be
-- would be one of my enemies.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:42.080
Well sometimes my brother was
definitely my enemy, yeah,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.690
and then other times he
was my very best friend.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:49.440
So it's always nice to turn
enemies into best friends.

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.740
Yeah.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.040
&gt;&gt; What is it like
to be an author?

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.340
&gt;&gt; What is it like
to be an author?

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.780
It's absolute hell.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:59.760
Because you have to
come up with ideas

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.030
and you know actually
I am always

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.040
so grateful whenever
an idea strikes me.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.690
You know because you always
are worried they'll stop.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.700
So what I do is I keep a --
I keep a special notebook

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.930
and I write down all my
ideas so I don't forget them.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.930
I even write down the
ideas I think are dumb

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.130
because sometimes they turn
out to be the best ones.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.080
Or they'll make me think
of a really good idea.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.400
So you know -- and then
sometimes I'll have an idea

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.350
and I'll say oh, this is
an incredibly great idea.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.010
I am a genius and I'll write
down and then I'll look

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.010
at it the next day
and I'll say oh, oh,

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:43.570
oh this is a terrible
idea I am not a genius.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:48.140
So you never know, so I
always keep a notebook.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.340
&gt;&gt; How come you never see
the older brother's face?

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a good question.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.980
Well that started out with No,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.850
David where you don't see the
any of the grown-ups face.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.970
You don't see the mom's face.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.090
And there were two
reasons for that.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.760
One is so that it stays at
David's like a kid's eye level,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.920
a kid's eye view of everything.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.880
The other thing was I
wanted kids to be able

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.570
to picture their own mom.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:22.700
Right, I didn't want to have you
know a different mom I wanted

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.510
them to sort of like whenever
they read all those things

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:26.830
that their mom says to them.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.060
I wanted them to be able
to picture their mom.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.920
So in this case I
want kids to be able

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.830
to picture their big
brother or big sister.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.540
&gt;&gt; What is your favorite
David book?

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.990
&gt;&gt; What is my favorite
David book?

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.330
Well I think it's probably
got to be No, David.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.750
Because that's the one

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:49.110
that really reminds
me of being a kid.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.830
So and I try to do as
many things to remind me

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.610
of being a kid as I can.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.390
What's your favorite one?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.310
Do you have a favorite one?

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.520
Oop we don't have
a mic I can't hear.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.430
&gt;&gt; Grow Up David.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.730
&gt;&gt; Oh it is ok.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.030
Well that's great.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.740
Well I -- a lot of times I like
the one that I've just finished.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.330
So that's a good idea.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:20.670
&gt;&gt; I have two questions
the first on is,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.930
is there going to
be No, David Here?

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.780
&gt;&gt; Is there going to
be No, David here.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:31.700
You mean is he coming?

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.730
Good gravy I hope not.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:42.090
&gt;&gt; And the other
question is, never mind.

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.800
&gt;&gt; Oh, I know what your
second question was.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.540
It's what was I going to ask?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.620
[laughter].

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.010
Ok we got a couple more.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.310
What?

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.760
&gt;&gt; How old is David?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.060
&gt;&gt; How old is David?

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.880
How old are you?

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.180
&gt;&gt; Three.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.960
&gt;&gt; Well David's probably just
a little bit older than you.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.830
I always think that
he's about five.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.150
But you never know I
mean he's kind of as old

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.680
as whatever kid is
reading about him.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.810
Well let's just say
he's ageless.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.400
Five ok five.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.910
&gt;&gt; Do you have, do you
still have a westie?

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:34.110
&gt;&gt; Oh, good question, yeah do
you guys know about Fergus?

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:39.190
Yeah, Fergus is my little
white dog and I put him

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.220
in all my books somewhere.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:45.200
Sometimes he's really hidden,
and sometimes he's easy to find.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.060
Sometimes he's really hard to
find, but he's in all my books.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:54.600
And he really was my dog
but I have some sad news,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:01.830
Fergus passed away but
he was 19 years old.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.220
Yeah I know.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.980
I'll do the math for you
that's 133 in dog years.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.710
So he had a very good life

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.410
and now I have a new
westie and his name is Roy.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.680
And he's completely
different from Fergus.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.930
The best example
is Fergus thought

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:29.190
that he was a human;
Roy thinks I'm a dog.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:32.440
Yeah and I'm doing a new
book about Roy right now,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.280
it's called Roy Digs Dirt.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.660
And he does, but he -- I
drew him a little differently

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.040
so he doesn't -- I didn't
want him to look like Fergus

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.810
so he doesn't really look
like a westie in the new book.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.830
But he has the personality and
I'm going to keep putting Fergus

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.930
in all my books so keep
looking for him OK.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:56.270
But listen don't tell Roy
because Roy thinks it's him OK.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:01.250
Alright you guys it's
time to vacate the stage

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.860
for the next incredible author.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.640
Thank you so much for coming.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.290
Thanks to everybody
who's had fun with No,

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.310
David and the National
Book Festival.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.610
Thank you.
