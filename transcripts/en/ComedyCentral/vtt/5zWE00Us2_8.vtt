00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.502
I write with my left hand.
I destroy with my right.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.537
Are you lefthanded?
I write lefthanded.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.738
It's the only thing
I do lefthanded.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.173
That's bizarre.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:08.341
Yeah.
You throw right-handed?

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.509
Yeah.
That's so weird.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.710
Really? What do you jack?

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.078
Right.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.246
Can you do left, though?

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.480
Yeah.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.215
Do you hold it like a pencil,
though?

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.619
Nah, dude. I fucking jerk off.
I have a different release.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:31.464
Well, it's BO staff day two,
here at The Bonfire.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:34.567
Has the energy changed?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.603
Yes. I think it has.
It feels a lot more secure.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:39.406
It's the Bonfire

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.087
[inaudible 00:00:38].

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.228
The Boakerson,
it works much better.

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.331
I'll tell you this,
You're a BO staff guy.

00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.734
Me being a hatchet man,
also known as a tomahawk,

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.869
I see why you like it.

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.804
I think I use it more
for hiking and moving,

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:15.408
but I think it's your look
and I want to respect that ...

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:20.280
Put the BO staff right here.
I have it for security reasons.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.282
That was a real long journey
to say

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:24.851
you don't want to
hold the staff anymore.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.720
Nah, man. I was explaining why.
I'd understand you'd get upset.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.455
I'm going to put mine down too
Dan,

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.390
because I don't want to
intimidate everybody,

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.659
'Cause you know how good my
skills with the BO staff are.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:36.329
I think [crosstalk 00:01:34]-

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.797
I'll put it down for you guys.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.365
'Cause I don't want
to hold it anymore.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:40.533
Jay, listen.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:41.801
No, I'm committing
to the BO staff.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.703
Good, I hope you get
really sick of it.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:45.571
We have a phone call
coming later

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.840
that this BO staff's gonna
come in real handy with.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:50.143
By the way,
whoever's on 35, fuck you.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.811
Fuck you 35.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.179
Fuck you 35.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.682
Who is it? NBC suck our dicks.
Fuck you.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:59.252
Your summer programming
is for shit.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.455
Use the stairs once in a
while you fucking assholes.

00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:03.689
Blow me.
[crosstalk 00:02:03]

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:08.194
Suck a dick Univision.
Suck a dick.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.363
Sucko [inaudible 00:02:08]

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.564
It's Meryl Lynch

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:12.765
It's Meryl Lynch?

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.934
Fuck you for bleeding
the middle class.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.770
Fuck you Meryl lynch.
Sub-prime mortgage rate, fucks.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.906
You guys ballooned it
and then took all that money.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.674
[crosstalk 00:02:21]

00:02:22.875 --> 00:02:23.943
That's Meryl

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:26.512
Lynch coming to exact revenge
on all of our nuts.

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:31.884
On our financial nuts?
They hit you with the fee.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:35.455
Bad investments.
IRAs.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.191
You lost that in a rath fund.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.763
Suck our dicks Meryl Lynch.

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:46.866
It's the salacious hour.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.537
You asked me if I ever
filmed myself having sex.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.239
I responded quickly.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:57.977
Once, on an old digital camera
with my ex-girlfriend

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.246
and then we watched it
and immediately...

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.538
... bottom half
humping into her.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.307
I know, but even if.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:43.823
Our caller topic is if you have
any filming yourself

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:54.701
Our caller topic is if you have
any filming yourself

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.937
or someone fucking
and it just goes haywire-

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.205
Not coming out.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:02.775
Or looking at the video and just
seeing how awful a thing was,

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.010
my big revelation-

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.812
You did a great joke about it.

00:04:06.845 --> 00:04:08.581
That was bad.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:11.417
Me on top of my ex-girlfriend,
who was so tiny-

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.853
Didn't you say it was
the Independence Day ship?

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:15.554
The shadow came over?
Like in Independence Day?

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:16.789
It was timely everybody,

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:18.457
I've been doing comedy
for a zillion years.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.859
Ten years.
Everything's ten years.

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.327
Not ten years.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.296
You've been working here
for ten years.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.398
BO staffin ten years.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:26.899
I've been working
BO staffs for ten years.

00:04:26.932 --> 00:04:28.401
Everything I do now
is gonna be ten years.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.802
You know when like
a little kid hears something

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:30.970
and they just hold on to it,

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:32.672
they're like two weeks,
two weeks.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.407
Everything for me now
is ten years.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.009
A44 comedy 9 is the number
to call in

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:41.047
if you want to tell
your sex mishap story.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.048
Welcome to the salaticious.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:46.552
I filmed my girlfriend
blowing me from the top.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.488
Bad angle bud.

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:52.792
Well that angle wasn't great,
but it was okay.

00:04:52.825 --> 00:04:54.060
The pov.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.928
But I was like when I see
the video later,

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.398
and this is like
Sony hand cam days.

00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:01.734
Dude that's when you could
hear it move on those pov tapes,

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.070
like Shane's world.
Like oh yeah.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:06.806
This makes me happy to think
that I don't know,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.974
that I don't believe that
this would happen anymore

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:12.011
at my size now,
but maybe it would.

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:16.782
I don't know. I always thought
she was an okay at blowjob,

00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:17.916
I don't have a very big dick

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.619
and she really couldn't pin it,
you know what I mean.

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:24.357
She couldn't take it
all the way and her mouth,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.459
she could she
just wasn't very good.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.060
And I always thought
she was just bad at it.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.730
When I filmed her from the side,
this poor girl,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.799
what I found out was,
that every time

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:36.769
she goes to put my dick deeper
into her mouth,

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:40.906
my stupid, fucking belly drills
her in the forehead.

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.108
Oh man.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.577
So she's getting knocked back
constantly.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.645
Oh no, its like trying to watch
a bird fly inside

00:05:46.678 --> 00:05:51.717
through a window. Thunk.
You're like go around. Stop it.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.985
You're killing yourself.

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:57.790
Stop it please. Thunk. Thunk.
Thunk.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.960
I'm gonna get it. Thunk.
No stop it.

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:04.029
No stop it.[crosstalk 00:06:01]
All over the window.

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:09.935
Go sideways.[crosstalk 00:06:07]

00:06:09.968 --> 00:06:11.738
Yeah dude,
you don't even realize,

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.543
trying to go to the drinking
fountain in a neck brace.

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.112
They really close it off.

00:06:22.114 --> 00:06:26.051
Is this, Lou, I have a question.
Cause this could be spelled.

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:27.987
Duggan.
Is it?

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.091
Dude, I swear to God
that's the guy that I told you.

00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:35.561
I met him after a show
at the Punchline

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:37.596
and he goes what's up man
I'm Duggan.

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:38.864
Who's Duggan?

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:40.900
I go, oh yeah, like Jays
joke in the elevator.

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:41.968
Like you guys are going
to Duggans rager.

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:45.171
And he goes what?
I was like nothing. It's cool.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.807
It's fucking Duggan.[crosstalk
00:06:47]

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.575
Dug's on the line.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:51.710
What's the crackle Dug's?

00:06:51.743 --> 00:06:53.679
What's up Dug's?

00:06:53.712 --> 00:06:54.980
Crackle, crackle boys.

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:56.783
You driving the Gremlin?

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.620
Tearing up the roads?

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.557
Going down to RC's
to fucking rip some bong,

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.593
some bangers and have
some beers, total Duggan style.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:10.463
Just coming from work, Dan.
Heading home from work.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:11.764
Why you domesticated Duggan.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:13.833
You have an embarrassing sex
tape moment?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.969
Yeah.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.538
Did you almost just get
in a crazy accident?

00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:21.640
This mother fucker
will kill yeah.

00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:23.876
I was having sex
with this girl named Cheryl.

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:27.947
Duggan?

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.886
So the story goes is that
I'm allowed to go

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.922
and film my wife giving me head.

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.991
I can't film her
having sex or anything.

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:43.062
So I ask her to go
and put a little costume on,

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:46.866
a little Halloween wig,
its Halloween time last year.

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:50.569
And I ask her
if I can go and film it.

00:07:50.602 --> 00:07:54.640
She said yes, but no female
nudity, only male nudity.

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:56.909
So I was okay with that.

00:07:56.942 --> 00:07:59.144
SO I went upstairs
into the bedroom,

00:07:59.177 --> 00:08:01.847
she had this really
sexy black wig on

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.616
and this very nice thin dress

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:06.719
and proceeded to do
all kinds of things to me.

00:08:07.586 --> 00:08:09.922
Got the camera phone out
and started to go and record it

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:12.592
and I forgot
she had the wig on

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:16.996
and went and grabbed her hair
and the fucking wig came off.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.266
I lost my shit
and dropped the camera

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.935
and it was fairly embarrassing,
but funny story.

00:08:22.968 --> 00:08:24.637
You should have kept the camera
on her

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.939
and said another name
as you pulled the wig.

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:29.775
Where you went oh
this entire time you were...

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:33.312
Can you play thins after
everyone's story.[crosstalk

00:08:33.345 --> 00:08:35.281
00:08:35]

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.117
You ever take the wig off
and realize

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.119
that role play
is much more,

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:42.888
welcome to salacious phone
calls on the bonfire.

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:46.058
[crosstalk 00:08:44]
Cause then you start laughing

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:47.826
and you're like well
we got to hang this up.

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:48.894
That's not good.

00:08:48.927 --> 00:08:51.196
Yeah and her hairs
all matted down from the wig.

00:08:51.229 --> 00:08:53.132
Well its always weird
when people nail the filming.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:54.867
Like that guy that
sent us clips of him

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.602
double teaming that chick,

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:58.704
like those were
professionally shot.

00:08:58.737 --> 00:09:00.239
[crosstalk 00:09:00]

00:09:00.272 --> 00:09:02.207
He sent us one video,
I didn't see the butt video,

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.143
but the video
that he sent of blowing you,

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:06.245
dude is there like
a professional crew in there?

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:08.714
Looked like he was sawing
her associated in two.

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:11.284
I mean he was really like.

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:15.087
But I'm saying like they had
like soft lighting.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.689
The camera crew
that's filming us now

has to come in her
and mat the lighting,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.925
so it looks not that bad.

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:21.694
You know how much tissue
it takes

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.028
to get this production
off the ground?

00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:25.031
A lot. A whole box of Kleenex.

00:09:25.998 --> 00:09:28.768
Lets take another one,
we have a Canadian caller.

00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:33.339
What do you think a Canadian sex
tape mishap could be Dan?

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:34.707
On ice.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.874
Whenever its on ice.

00:09:35.907 --> 00:09:37.076
Yeah, they were at a..

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.944
And then she slipped on the ice.

00:09:38.977 --> 00:09:40.613
And she put her tooth
through my dick.

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.648
Oh no, sorry.

00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.216

00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.987

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.856
Awesome, how are you guys doing?

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:53.726

Sorry Marky Mark.

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:44.143
You and your ex
were gonna make a sex tape.

00:10:44.876 --> 00:10:47.980
Yeah, so I live up
in the oil industry

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:50.015
in Ft.Mcmurray, Alberta.

00:10:50.048 --> 00:10:51.383
Hell yeah.

00:10:51.416 --> 00:10:53.953
So we got some pretty
trashy girls up here.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.122
Is that near Calgary? I'm going
to Calgary in two weekends.

00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:58.924
I believe its near Edmonton.

00:10:59.324 --> 00:11:03.295
Yeah, Calgary is 4 hours south
and I'm 5 hours north.

00:11:03.328 --> 00:11:05.064
Damn it.
Right in the middle huh?

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:07.066
Canadian knowledge.
Alberta is a big province.

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:08.233
Is it by Edmonton?

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:10.302
Its in between Edmonton
and Calgary.

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:11.470
Did you know that for real?

00:11:11.503 --> 00:11:14.006
Oh no, I'm north. 5 hours north.

00:11:14.906 --> 00:11:17.943
5 hours north of Edmonton?
I didn't know that at all.

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:22.214
[crosstalk 00:11:17]
Dude its a total guess.

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:23.749
You almost good face

00:11:23.782 --> 00:11:26.318

everyone knows that.[crosstalk
00:11:28]

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.289
Dude that's my fucking,
I was raised by a single mom.

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:31.857
That's how you got
out of everything.

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.126
It was confidence.
My mom was like did you

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:37.429
just eat three cookies
right off the sheet?

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:39.231
Why would I do that?

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:41.867
Told you we have rats in here.

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:46.238
So anyways,
you're in a desolate,

00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:48.040
well you're in a remote town.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.343
Yeah up in where
we make all the oil.

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:54.480
Hell yeah.
Fossil fuels are what's up.

00:11:55.113 --> 00:11:56.315
Damn you are up there.

00:11:56.348 --> 00:11:57.983
We're looking at a map
right now.

00:11:58.016 --> 00:11:59.218
Fuck.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.419
Yeah, way up there.

00:12:00.452 --> 00:12:02.421
Some guy rolled
his transport truck today

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:05.791
and his excavator blew off
and blocked the highway.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:09.428
Same thing happened to me
on my block in Queens. Crazy.

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:15.334
I'm just kidding.[crosstalk
00:12:11]

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:18.370
Hopefully my ex
isn't listening but.

00:12:19.104 --> 00:12:23.909
If she is, what's up Marcy.
Shout out Marcy.

00:12:23.942 --> 00:12:27.813
Yo. So what happened?

00:12:28.847 --> 00:12:32.318
So I like to leave it like
the 80's and go all bush.

00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:34.219
Jays a fan of that.

00:12:34.252 --> 00:12:37.022
She went down on me
at my parents place.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.893
You know we were
drinking and smoking.

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.264
Well lets just say
she looks like her brother

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:47.366
and when she had me
all the way in,

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.401
looked like her brother
with a beard.

00:12:49.434 --> 00:12:51.069
That's hilarious.

00:12:51.102 --> 00:12:53.138
But you weren't
filming this right?

00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:55.007
This was just you
realizing that...

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.109
Oh, his fucking dick hair

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:59.111
is so long that
it made it look like...

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:03.315
It made it look like
she had a goatee.

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:05.450
Looked exactly like her brother?

00:13:05.483 --> 00:13:10.556
And then he popped
immediately.[crosstalk 00:13:09]

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:13.893
Looked exactly like her brother
when he sucks my dick.

00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:18.197
Oh my God, you and your brother
have the same eyes

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.065
when I'm all the way
down your throat.

00:13:20.098 --> 00:13:21.300
Weird.

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.902
You both gag the same way do ya.

00:13:23.935 --> 00:13:28.507
Weird. Ya know that I don't know
if its a family secret or not.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.276
Do ya?

00:13:31.409 --> 00:13:34.446
That's weird, the gag reflex
must not be in your family.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:39.585
That's a good mishap.

00:13:40.886 --> 00:13:42.087
If it was filmed.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.024
How about James in Texas?

00:13:46.057 --> 00:13:48.227
This sounds like,
this is juicier.

00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:52.497
This is pretty juicy.
Crackle, crackle buddy.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.333
What's going on?

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:59.371
It was Valentines Day
and I rolled out the red carpet,

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:02.407
got the hotel room with
the rose petals and all that.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.943
What was the hotel?

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:09.348
It was like a Ramada Inn.
[crosstalk 00:14:10]

00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:11.650
I like it, yeah dude
don't let him knock ya.

I'm a residence inn guy myself.

00:14:13.184 --> 00:14:14.586
The red carpet.

00:14:14.619 --> 00:14:15.620
Yeah there's some
Southern homes,

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:18.290
I don't want to brag about
the wine we had but

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:22.228
[crosstalk
00:14:19]

00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:25.130
Go big, get minis.

00:14:25.163 --> 00:14:26.966
Well that's what
I'm talking about.

00:14:28.099 --> 00:14:30.970
I propped up the phone on the TV
and I recorded it.

00:14:31.436 --> 00:14:33.138
And I put it
in one of those apps

00:14:33.171 --> 00:14:35.407
that has like a photo
and video vault,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.511
so it when on the camera
or photo reel on the phone.

00:14:39.544 --> 00:14:41.380
Yeah, you went dark web with it.

00:14:41.413 --> 00:14:45.017
Yeah I had to go MI-6.

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:48.553
You had to scramble the signal.

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:53.258
Yeah, right. I ended up,
we gave that phone to her son,

00:14:53.291 --> 00:14:56.061
cause he had cracked his
and I had already upgraded

00:14:56.094 --> 00:14:58.330
and I guess we didn't
delete the app off of it.

00:14:58.363 --> 00:15:01.200
So, he knew the passcode
and he saw it.

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.537
And at first the video
is kind of, its like her on top

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.975
and its just showing
like the balls and two asses

00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:12.477
and the gooch on me.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.382
The gooch. Aww man, your stepson
said full gooch.

00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:20.385
Yeah, but then about
seven minutes in I get up

00:15:20.418 --> 00:15:22.354
from drinking
fifteen whiskeys on,

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:27.125
kinda hit it doggy style,
so I can get my rocks off

00:15:27.158 --> 00:15:30.028
and I had a blue pill
that night.

00:15:30.061 --> 00:15:33.432
Oh man, your Ivan Dragho'n it.

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:35.634
You're all fucking
jacked up on steroids.

00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:38.504
She comes, she comes.

00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:43.041
It wasn't a pre-season game,
it was mid-season form.

00:15:43.074 --> 00:15:46.345
I was firing off the line, beer
gut, sweating down my chest.

00:15:46.378 --> 00:15:48.013
I love this dude.

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.716
Just rammin' his mom home

00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:55.053
and it definitely,
he's a little bit of a shit

00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:57.522
and I'm kinda glad
that we broke up, so I guess.

00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:01.226
Oh fuck, how far after,
how long were you guys together?

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:03.262
So her son,
this is not your kid?

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:07.332
No, he was her son
and we lived together.

00:16:07.365 --> 00:16:09.134
How old was he?

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:10.602
15.

00:16:10.635 --> 00:16:12.637
Just saw you wrecking his mom.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.175
You caught him at a moment
where he is either

00:16:16.741 --> 00:16:19.144
one hell of an artist
or a needle drug user.

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:20.345
Possibly both.

00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:22.047
Was his mom hot?
Was it something

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.117
where his friends
would be blown away by that?

00:16:26.217 --> 00:16:28.553
Yeah, I mean she was definitly
one of the moms

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:33.392
that you could rub one off to,
I mean, I guess back in the day,

00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:34.793
now you can get on the phone.

And then your like I'm gonna
go home and jerk off to this.

Near that house
and in that friendship.

00:17:01.619 --> 00:17:04.322
That's spilled a lot of seed.
And this really fucked him up,

he's gonna be into
some sick shit.

I don't know choking,
maybe getting beat up.

00:17:07.525 --> 00:17:09.728
Was his mom a real noise
maker in the video?

00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:11.563
Was she like losing it?

00:17:11.596 --> 00:17:13.532
Yeah, she was pretty happy
with the rose petals

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.233
and all of the stuff
I surprised her with,

00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:18.137

the rose petals,

so she acted like
I took her to pound town.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:27.679
Is that the name of the file?

00:17:27.712 --> 00:17:30.515

00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:51.203
His manners need
to be worked on.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.705
I feel like that kid
either jerked off to it

00:17:53.738 --> 00:17:55.474
or he's gonna become
a serial killer.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:58.710
Dude that's, both of those
things fold into each other.

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:02.848
James, it just plays
in his head.

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:07.286
He goes, enjoy the phone
asshole as he's leaving.

00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:09.888
I think this is what
he hears

00:18:09.921 --> 00:18:11.456
everybody just choose
a different tone

00:18:11.489 --> 00:18:12.757
and keep saying James
with us right now.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:19.264
Everybody, Lou, everyone.
[crosstalk 00:18:18]

00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:22.868
He goes I can't stop the voices.
I can't stop the voices

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:25.237
and that's why he became
an MMA fighter.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.705
And now I'm the light
heavyweight champion

00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:27.873
of the world.

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:32.344
Everyone becomes James.
Sarah Mcpants.

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:33.612
James, thanks so much
for calling in.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:34.813
Thanks you guys.

00:18:34.846 --> 00:18:37.182
Thanks for being
fucking hilarious.

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:38.783
Yeah, fuck that kid.

00:18:38.816 --> 00:18:41.353
That guy is so goddamn funny.
Sometimes callers call in

00:18:41.386 --> 00:18:43.188
and your like, dude,
your funny dude.

00:18:43.221 --> 00:18:45.157
He's like you know
I'm firing off the line.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.492
I'm like I wanna fucking
come off the wagon for this dude

00:18:47.525 --> 00:18:49.828
and just drink a six pack of
beer with James at a airport.

00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:51.096
I don't wanna go nowhere.

00:18:51.129 --> 00:18:55.200
Have we ever officially talked
to our MMA fighter on the air?

00:18:55.233 --> 00:18:56.434
Dustin?

00:18:56.467 --> 00:18:57.602
I gotta organize that
or something,

00:18:57.635 --> 00:18:59.404
he's gotta call in sometime.

00:18:59.837 --> 00:19:01.038
Our head of security
makes you call,

00:19:01.072 --> 00:19:03.375
but you're talking about Dustin,
oh no the guy from Madison.

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:04.676
Madison, yeah.

00:19:04.709 --> 00:19:05.677
Yeah he's gotta call in.

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.647
Well he said he wanted
to come in the studio.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.715
Might have to be like a,

00:19:09.748 --> 00:19:11.716
I remember what it was
he has to come in earlier

00:19:11.749 --> 00:19:12.917
for a pre-recording.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:15.820
Sarah Mcpants tweeting I've
made videos for my boyfriend

00:19:15.853 --> 00:19:17.489
when he's away
and nothing makes you go

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:21.393
from feeling horny to suicidal
faster than seeing yourself.

00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:23.528
Yeah that's absolutely true
Sarah.

00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:25.830
I usually just fire,
I don't ever put my face in it.

00:19:25.863 --> 00:19:27.265
You just come,
you send it to me.

00:19:27.298 --> 00:19:28.266
Yeah that's it.

00:19:28.299 --> 00:19:31.203
Jay just wants to see
the shot that I deleted

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:33.572
and then I curl up in a ball
and Mike tries to comfort me.

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.773
I am all about the shot.

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:35.974
The shot.

00:19:36.007 --> 00:19:37.342
All about the shot.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:39.378
Buckshot.
You wanna take our last break?

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:43.715
Yeah, sure. We could do that.

00:19:43.748 --> 00:19:45.417
Come back we'll talk
more sex tape mishaps.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:46.485
If we have 'em.

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.887
They keep coming in. Oh buddy.
We're lighting up.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.356
The lines are lighting up.
Call in with yours black

00:19:51.389 --> 00:19:53.525
Lou's waiting to hear
your salacious filth.

00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:56.428
Ah dude, but yeah, I also
wanted this story is perfectly.

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:00.398
Okay. That is salacious.

00:20:00.431 --> 00:20:02.701
Yeah it is another
salacious hour at the bonfire.

00:20:02.734 --> 00:20:04.503
We haven't been here
for so long.

00:20:05.036 --> 00:20:07.206
We'll be right back everybody,
bonfire.

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.741
Before we take the call
I just want to basically say

00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:12.877
what I think is being said here.
And I want Kevin from Texas

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.280
to essentially give me
a one word answer here

00:20:15.313 --> 00:20:18.550
because this makes me so,
this has been making me laugh.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.888
Dude, goddamn it Lou.

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:25.724
You can't die of a fake
asthma attack,

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:29.361
you're too goddamn good.
[crosstalk

00:20:29.394 --> 00:20:30.895
00:20:29]
But you were saying,

00:20:30.928 --> 00:20:32.831
this call has been making you
laugh on the call screen.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.266
Just how Lou wrote it up,

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:35.700
and I hope this is
the right answer here.

00:20:35.733 --> 00:20:37.636
It says, and just say yes

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:39.871
if I'm right about
what's being described here,

00:20:39.904 --> 00:20:41.273
unless I'm wrong.

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:43.775
Kevin says he made a sex video
with an ex,

00:20:44.542 --> 00:20:46.912
showed it to co-workers
bragingly, I'm assuming.

00:20:47.578 --> 00:20:50.315
Not knowing that one of
the co-workers was her cousin.

00:20:51.582 --> 00:20:53.618
Yes, please say that's a yes.

00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:55.053
Kevin is that the answer?

00:20:55.086 --> 00:20:56.421
Yes.

00:20:56.454 --> 00:21:01.326
Dude, that is awesome.

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.494
How great is that, you just go,

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:03.828
your bragging,
you go look at that.

00:21:03.861 --> 00:21:05.463
He goes, you wish
you had titties like that.

00:21:05.496 --> 00:21:07.599
He goes, my cousins titties,
you mean?

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:13.938
Dude that's a heart shoots
in your fucking tonsils.

00:21:13.971 --> 00:21:15.039
That's brain on the wall.

00:21:15.072 --> 00:21:18.843
[crosstalk 00:21:17]Why
is it getting cold in here?

00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:21.579
You think about hitting the
cousin, just to do something.

00:21:21.612 --> 00:21:23.481
He goes, aww man just check out
this pig,

00:21:23.514 --> 00:21:24.449
that was her ankles
behind her ears,

00:21:24.482 --> 00:21:27.585
he goes that's my baby cousin.
What Jerrod?

00:21:27.618 --> 00:21:29.020
I took care of her
after her mom died.

00:21:29.053 --> 00:21:30.388
You son of a bitch.

00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:32.391
She's more like a sister
than a cousin.

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:37.395
That's fucking crazy.

00:21:37.428 --> 00:21:39.064
Now he can't go to HR
with anything.

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:45.403
He's getting bullied
at work.[crosstalk 00:21:45]

00:21:45.436 --> 00:21:47.306
He goes my jaw
is wired shut.

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:49.841
Things got weird.
That's fucking...

00:21:49.874 --> 00:21:52.711
Have you been, how long did
you work with the guy after?

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.513
DO you still work with him?

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:58.817
We worked together for like
a year and a half and me

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.387
and one of my other co-workers
we got an apartment together

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.056
and my bedroom
had a little mirror.

00:22:05.022 --> 00:22:07.625
The closet had two mirrors
on the doors.

00:22:07.658 --> 00:22:08.859
You're a sensual man.

00:22:08.893 --> 00:22:12.998
The same co-worker was like
oh man you should give yourself,

00:22:13.631 --> 00:22:16.501
you know the porn star thumbs up
while you're hitting it.

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:19.838
And so that's what I did.
And I was showing him the video

00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:23.542
and then he said that's
my fucking cousin man.

00:22:24.442 --> 00:22:27.545
What I like is its his idea.
I like that its the dudes idea,

00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:29.981
he goes heres what you do,
super fucking awesome.

00:22:30.014 --> 00:22:32.617
Your banging a chick
you Patrick Bateman her.

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.886
You film it, show it to me,
oh my God.

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.388
That's what he's saying,

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.622
I told him how to fuck
his cousin,

00:22:37.655 --> 00:22:38.723
not knowing it was his cousin.

00:22:38.756 --> 00:22:40.992
That's exactly what I'm saying.
[crosstalk 00:22:41]

00:22:41.025 --> 00:22:45.797
I had no idea, because, yeah no.
I knew the chick about a year.

00:22:47.465 --> 00:22:49.033
Buddy promise me one thing,

00:22:49.066 --> 00:22:52.070
you will shove your thumb
in the next pigs butt

00:22:52.103 --> 00:22:55.974
that you fuck.Oh my God,
that's my baby sister Melissa.

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:57.142
Little Laurie.

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:04.816
No. I saved her from a well.
