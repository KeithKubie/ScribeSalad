00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.850
Let's talk a little bit about
what I'll call the Plutsky

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.830
Plan, because it came from
my friend, Todd Plutsky.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.940
But I think it's a good plan.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.200
But let's think about a little
bit of its repercussions and

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.470
see if it's more or less likely
to actually work.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.800
Well first of all, you know, I
threw out in the last video 50

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.820
banks, maybe that's logistically
difficult.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.390
Instead of having 50 banks
with $14 billion initial

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.830
capital, maybe you do five banks
with $140 forty billion

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:22.470
initial capital.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.430
But the point being is that you
should have more than one

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.430
bank, it shouldn't be too big to
fail, and you should try to

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.790
instill some type of
competition there.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.510
But because they have pristine
balance sheets, all of these

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.860
banks are going to be able to
lever 10:1, which we know

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.870
isn't crazy.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.950
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley
and all the likes have

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.940
been leveraging up 30 to 40:1.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.190
So 10:1 is normal for a bank.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.560
And frankly, they're probably
going to be able to attract a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.420
lot more-- you know we said
foreign governments probably

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.410
would be willing to lend to
them, the private sector is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.750
willing to lend to them.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.170
If these are commercial banks,
which means that they can take

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.930
deposits, a lot of people are
going to be willing to

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.980
essentially put their money with
this bank because it has

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.290
a clean balance sheet, and
essentially it'll be owned

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.560
individually by the American
people, and it will have the

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.150
federal backstop above and
beyond the FDIC insurance

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.030
limit and all that.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.230
Although I do like the
one provision to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.430
increase the FDIC caps.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.550
Maybe I'll do the insurance
caps on deposits.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.380
But it will actually be able
attract a lot of deposits from

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.170
everyday people.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.920
They'll feel safer
with these banks.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.760
So in terms of whether you'll
be able to capitalize these

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.810
banks and lever up 10:1,
I don't think

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.290
there's an issue there.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.080
Then there's a question, will
it solve the fundamental

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.230
problem of keeping credit
markets flowing to those

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.720
people that it needs
to keep credit to?

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560
Well we already said it'll have
no trouble being able to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.380
have access to funds above and
beyond how much the government

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.650
capitalizes it with.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.840
It'll be able to attract
deposits, it'll be able to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.280
attract investment from the
private sector and from

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.520
international money, especially
with this five year

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.720
government backstop.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.050
So it will be able to
essentially put 10 times this

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.770
money back into the system.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.930
So if you take $700 billion
collectively, this will

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.090
introduce 10 times as much.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.045
So $7 trillion of new loans.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.480
So this $7 trillion -- I mean
that's literally half of the

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.320
American GDP.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.770
I mean you might argue that is
too much -- that might provide

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.310
too much credit, and it might go
from, you know, thawing to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.640
overheating credit markets.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.630
So then you might say well if
$7 trillion is too much

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.320
liquidity, well why don't we
just reduce this number a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.910
little bit.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.450
Instead of saying $700 billion,
why don't you make it

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.670
a $100 billion, right?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.550
Because then $100 billion, if
you do 10 banks with $10

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.640
billion each, so you introduce
$100 billion.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.050
They all lever up because it's
all new liabilities and new

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.880
assets, clean balance sheets,
it'll introduce $1 trillion of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.260
new loans that it can go put
to work for people building

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.000
factories and doing
real things.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.810
And because their incentive is
not to bail out their friends,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.060
it's not to help out the
companies they used to work

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.300
for, the companies that are
donating to them in some way

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.920
or contributing to them, or
promising jobs in some way.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.580
It won't go -- this $1 trillion
is not going to go to

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.150
buy assets at higher prices
than they should.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.310
You know it could go to buy
assets at discount prices if

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.150
the new managers of these banks
do see a good return.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.710
But most probably they'll invest
it in areas of the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.600
economy where they do see a
positive return on investment.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.570
And one person had sent me a
note and said, hey, wouldn't

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.640
introducing all of this
liquidity into the financial

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.820
system, whether it's $7 trillion
or $1 trillion,

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.930
wouldn't that lead to
hyperinflation?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.680
And I'll probably do a whole
series on inflation.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.770
I think there's a lot of
misunderstanding around it.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.010
In general, if anyone makes a
positive investment -- so if I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.270
have $1 and I make it an
investment where it generates

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.480
$1.20 of benefit, that
by definition is not

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.160
inflationary.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.120
Because I had $1 in the world
and I created $1.20 of wealth.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.990
So actually, the pie
gets bigger.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.970
A good way to think about
inflation -- I'll do a lot

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.529
about this because it is a
very abstract concept.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.310
Let's say this is the
pie of goods and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.250
services in the world.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.290
Or let's just say
a country right?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.370
Goods and services.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.130
Goods and services in a year.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.230
You could say it's our
GDP, or however you

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.800
want to measure it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.570
Goods and services
in a year, right?

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.580
That's the goods and
services in a year.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.980
And let's say I have another
pool of the amount of money

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.800
there is in a given year.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.120
So money.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.080
And the money supply is an
interesting thing, because

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.300
it's not just dependent
on the amount of

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.080
physical coins or dollars.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.980
It also is a function of how
quickly those transact and how

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.900
much leverage there
is in the system.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.130
So you can actually have a whole
economy where everyone

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.650
just has one dollar bill, but
every time someone needs

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.070
something from someone
else, they exchange

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.830
that one dollar bill.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.390
So that one dollar bill gets
used, you know, 15 trillion

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.010
times a year.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.970
So you'd actually have $15
trillion of money, because the

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.500
velocity would be so high.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.240
But anyway let's just say that
this is the pool of money.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.620
If this pool, the pool of money
grows faster than the

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.870
actual goods and services and
the actual productive capacity

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.810
of that country, then
you have inflation.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.240
So if this circle grows
faster than this

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.290
one you have inflation.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.270
If this circle grows
faster than this

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.540
circle, you have deflation.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.900
You have the same, or you have
some amount of money

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.000
representing more goods and
services, so goods and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120
services actually
become cheaper.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.690
And the problem that we're
talking about right now, this

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.590
credit crisis, this is a problem
of deleveraging, where

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.850
the government injects a dollar
into this current

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.220
broken banking system, and
instead of that dollar -- you

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.950
know, the normal system is you
lend a dollar to a bank, so

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.410
you lend $1 to a bank,
and then, let's say

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.110
this is the Fed right?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.660
This is how they inject
liquidity.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.440
They lend a dollar to a bank.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.690
Let me draw a bank here.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.850
Then that bank has to keep -- it
can only lever 10:1-- so it

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.140
essentially has to keep in
reserve $0.10 of that dollar,

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.490
but then it lends $0.90 to
somebody else, to another

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.530
bank, right?

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.370
Then that other bank has to keep
10% of that, so it lends

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.370
$0.81 to someone else.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.610
And then that someone else can
lend whatever $0.81 times 0.9

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.710
is, so I don't know,
seventy-something cents to

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.160
someone else.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.970
But you get the idea, that in a
normal, functioning banking

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.810
system, one dollar injected
into the system has this

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.900
multiplier effect,
so it actually

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.000
creates a lot of money.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.400
And that's what people are
implicitly talking about when

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.920
they talk about the
printing press.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.100
But what's going on right now is
the Fed lends $1 to Bank A,

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.290
but Bank A is so scared that it
doesn't lend out to anyone

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.580
else, it just keeps
that dollar.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.870
Because right now their main
priority isn't to try to get a

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.090
little bit of incremental
interest on whatever money

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.350
they have, their main priority
is survival.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.770
So that dollar just goes
into a black hole.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.080
And so that's what the
Fed's frustration is.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.490
It keeps lending money into
the system but that money

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.770
keeps disappearing.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.105
And actually as the economy
slows, the velocity of money

00:07:17.105 --> 00:07:18.530
is going to slow down as well.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.250
So the main problem when you
have a credit crisis and when

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.500
you have a recession
is actually the

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.340
money supply shrinks.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.970
The amount of goods and services
probably shrinks as

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.830
well, but the money supply
shrinks even more.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.200
So your main problem
is deflation.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.660
And you know, that was the
main problem in the Great

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.025
Depression, and that was
the main problem in

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:39.040
the Japanese crisis.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.430
And you know, Ben Bernanke, he's
written papers about this

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.000
and he's like, well you can
always cure deflation by

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.680
printing money and dropping
money from a helicopter.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.110
Well to some degree that's
what they've already been

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.200
trying to do.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.700
They've already been-- the Fed's
been willing to take

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.450
pretty large credit risks on
bank and lending money into

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.930
the system.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.440
But the problem is, if this
multiplier effect is

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.390
disappearing at a faster rate
than you are dropping money

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.970
from a helicopter, you still
have deflation, right?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.220
Before when you not only let
people lever 10:1, you let

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.840
them lever 30:1 and 40:1, every
dollar you put in the

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.660
system became $40 that was given
to someone else, and

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.370
then they could lever up.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.670
So you had this huge
explosion of money.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.235
And frankly, the only reason why
we didn't have inflation--

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.770
I mean the last 5, 10 years
we had this huge

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.950
explosion of money.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.390
And the only reason why it
didn't, at least in measurable

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.720
inflation, show up, is that
on the other side of the

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.590
equation, you had all of this
new productive capacity come

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.679
on line in China and India.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.780
And so manufactured goods
got a lot cheaper.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.190
But in things that were not
manufactured goods, like

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.430
commodities, like homes, you had
this huge asset inflation.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.870
Or even college tuition, or
healthcare-- things that are

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.525
dependent on American labor--
became hugely expensive, and

00:08:58.525 --> 00:09:02.890
that's because you had this
huge, huge infusion-- you

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.170
know, there's different ways
to measure money, but the

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.490
broadest indicator, which is
called M3-- and I know I'm

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.890
kind of going out of the domain,
but I'll make a bunch

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:10.780
of videos on this.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.310
The broadest indicator, M3,
which the government stopped

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.910
officially reporting, exploded
because there was so much

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.780
leverage in the system.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.650
Now things are-- the exact
opposite is happening.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.440
The leverage is disappearing
from the system.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.120
There's no lending
to each other.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.760
Everyone is going from 1:30
leverage to 1:10 leverage.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.000
So money is actually
disappearing in the system.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.430
The velocity is slowing.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.630
This is shrinking, but this is
shrinking more, no matter what

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.560
the Fed is doing.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:40.370
And frankly, this new $700
billion bail out, I personally

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.800
think this is the helicopter
that Ben Bernanke always

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.040
talked about using.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.940
And whenever you're going to
drop money from a helicopter,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.220
the question is, where
do you drop it?

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.650
And they think they should drop
it into an already broken

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.770
banking system.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.620
The point of this video and the
last is maybe you should

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.380
just drop it into a new banking
system, or maybe you

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.480
just drop it into everyone's
pockets and see what happens.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.110
And you let new banks
form where they can.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.710
Anyway, that's all
for this video.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.690
I know it was a little
bit rambling.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.840
But hopefully you learned
a little bit.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.620
See you in the next video.
