00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.200
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So, Chuck Fischer
is here in the lovely design tie,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.480
which I thought he designed
himself but he says not.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.890 position:56%
He's a New York designer and
painter with about 10 previous books

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.810
to his credit, many
of them pop-up books.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.410
You can find his work in the Cooper
Hewitt national design museum.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.280
He's designed China and
crystal patterns for Lenox.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.100
And what I really like about your
2015 White House pop-up book is

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.780
that it's got individual hanging
chandeliers when opened up,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.140
it's really fascinating to me.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.850
Mark Ramsdell, here at my far
right, has been a pastry chef

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.890
and instructor for
more than 30 years

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.380
and he was an assistant pastry chef

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.480
at the White House during
the Clinton and Bush years.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.650
He was a student of Chef
Mesnier's he meet him in 1980

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.760
at L'Academie de Cuisine, which is
our premier professional culinary

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.140
academy here in the DC area.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.250
And he later became head

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.440
of that school's pastry
chef program himself.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.680
So, he's been collaborating
basically,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.950
he says carrying Chef Mesnier's
things around for many, many years.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.210
He lives in Bethesda
and he recently,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.410
I think they both collaborated
on, if Facebook is right,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.650
the 70th wedding anniversary cake
for Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.950
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Correct.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.250
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick:
Pretty impressive.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.760
So, save your questions about that.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.050
And then of course, Chef Mesnier
himself has been, I think,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.420 position:56%
in 2004 you participated in the
festival when it was out on the mall

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.300
and talked about your
"Dessert University" book,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.520 position:56%
which at that time, I guess, you had
put together while you were working

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.210
in the White House
in his spare time.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.340
Let's see, he's won 18 gold
medals, 4 silver and 3 bronze

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.030
for his pastry creations in
competitions around the world.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.810
He's a member of the
AcadÃ©mie Culinaire De France

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.070
and the French Legion of Honor,
which she earned in 2005.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.730
He's inducted-- He was inducted
that same year into the chocolate

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.260 position:56%
and pastry hall of fame, like great.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.140
I didn't even know
there was such a thing

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.050
and it makes me happy
to know there is.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.140
He was awarded the
doctorate of culinary arts

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.650
from their prestigious Johnson and
Wales University in South Carolina.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.990 position:56%
And this would be your seventh book?

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.290
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yes.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.990
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So,
it kind of does it all.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.440
What's really fun is just
to listen to him speak.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.190
So, I'm going to make sure that
he has a chance to do that.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.220
And now, I'm turning it
over to Chuck Fischer.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.510
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fisher: Thank you.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.810
Thanks Bonnie.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.650
It's great to be here at the
National Book Festival by the way,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.430
especially to share the
stage with Chef Mesnier

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.820
and Ramsdell, Chef Ramsdell.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940 position:56%
And I'm going to talk a little bit--

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.410
of course, I'm going to
talk about our new book.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.520
All right is this going to be on?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.790
The PowerPoint?

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.150
Yeah, there we go, "The Gingerbread
White House Pop-Up Book".

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.210
And-- But before we get to that,
I'm going to talk a little bit

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.640
about pop-up books in general.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.460
And so, my-- I've done
three pop-up books

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.800
with the White House as a theme.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.020
This is my first book
published by Rizzoli in 2004.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.310 position:56%
And as Bonnie mentioned, this is
the book that was published in 2014,

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.300
actually by Applewood press
and this is what I designed

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.470
and created as a doll house.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.830
So, when you turn the book around
and you'll see in the video,

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.120
that it's open like a doll
house for the state rooms

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.400
and everything is historically
correct

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.860
and the chandeliers,
they are hanging.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.180
And all the paintings are
there that are in the rooms

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.800
and everything was vetted by
the curator at the White House.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.250
So, that is a really
fun, fun project.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.940
And there are punch out pieces
as there are in the new book.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.780
So, I thought maybe this is a video

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.200
that the Smithsonian libraries
commissioned and this is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.120
about how pop-up books are made.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.570
This was for the exhibit
"Fold, Pull,

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.390
Pop and Turn" at the
museum of American history.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.390
There we go.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.370
An author and artist and
I design pop-up books.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.110
It's my pleasure to take part

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.370
in the Smithsonian institution
libraries exhibition,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.170
paper engineering, Fold, Pull,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.220
Pop and Turn at the national
museum of American history.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.480
Pop-up books cover many subjects.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.470
Earliest known examples of books

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.560
with movable date to
the 14th century.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.650
Just as with those books, modern
pop-up books are assembled by hand.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.350
From concept to printing,
it takes about 18 months

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.670
to create a new pop-up book.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.170
To show you how pop-up
book is created,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.470
I'll take you through the
process of creating one

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.340
of the pop-ups in my book "Angels".

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.090
This book was inspired by
my fascination with angels

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.540
and their images in
art and literature.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.300
I start by conducting research
at museums and libraries

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.060
such as the Cooper Hewitt National
Design Museum in New York City.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.520
Based on my research, I create
an outline which includes ideas

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.650 position:56%
for pop-ups, an overall visual style

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.930
for the book and a
draft of the text.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.240
Once the outline is complete,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.010
I present it to my
editor for approval.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.170
I hire a writer to
assist me with the text.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.270
The next step is to sketch
ideas for the pop-ups.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.790
This pop-up is based on the
story Archangel Gabriel.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.260
I collaborate with the paper--

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.970
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Malfunction.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.550
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: We
love PowerPoint, don't we?

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:34.510
[ Laughter ]

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.930
Well. Should we try to wait?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.430
OK.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.730
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: Wait a second.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.030
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: While waiting.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.330
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: OK.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.800
If not, I can just talk it through.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.610
Let's just do that.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.570
Can I have my bag?

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.330
I actually have some
visuals in my-- Oops sorry.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.630
Thank you.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.410
Oh, here we go maybe
it'll play again.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.200
I'm Chuck Fischer, an author and
artist and I design pop-up books.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.920
It's my pleasure to take part

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.190
in the Smithsonian institution
libraries exhibition,

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.010
paper engineering, Fold, Pull,

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.510
Pop and Turn at the national
museum of American history.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:28.310
Pop-up books cover many subjects.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.310
Earliest known examples of books

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.390
with movable parts date
to the 14th century.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.480
Just as with those books, modern
pop-up books are assembled by hand.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.180
From concept to printing,
it takes about 18 months

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.510
to create a new pop-up book.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.000
To show you how pop-up
book is created,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.300
I'll take you through the
process of creating one

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.910
of the pop-ups in my book "Angel".

00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:01.500
OK. Let's just get-- Let's
just do a little show and tell.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:05.340
So, where'd the video stop?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.580
Was it-- So, I come
up with the concepts.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.080
I'm an artist and an author.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.550
So, I come up with two sketches

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.070
of each spread that's
going to be on the pop-up.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.070
And then, I send these
to a paper engineer

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.290
who I collaborate very close
with a number of books.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.770
I've collaborated with
a few paper engineers

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:29.490
but primarily Bruce Foster,
who was just going to be

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.710
on the video talking about
his side of the process.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.010
But anyway.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:39.440
So, Bruce takes my sketches
and I sketch them to look

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440 position:56%
like they are three dimensional,
the way I'd like to see them pop-up.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.960
Then he figures out the engineering
and he does it all of by hand,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.540
of course, cutting paper.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.140
And then, he presents
to me a white dummy.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.160
And this is a pop-up of the
White House, the new one--

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.410
For the gingerbread White House.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.390
And this is after the
little pieces--

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:07.020
the patterns that he sends to me
been refined and so that we know

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.690
that the mechanics are
working, the engineering.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.500
The thing about pop-up
books, they have to open

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.160
and close, open and close.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.900
Where like Origami, it's just

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.190
like you can create
something and leave it up.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.160
So, it has to be very sturdy.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.650
It has to, you know, just be able
to do that, to open and close

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.590 position:56%
and then this is a packet and inside
the packet we have the book that's

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.280
written by Chef Mesnier
and Chef Ramsdell

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.330
and we have punch out pieces.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.290
And so, once I receive this--

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:44.750
and every piece that makes up
that pop-up has to be illustrated.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.190
And so, that's my next step.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.620
And I even happen to bring
some of my original paintings.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.380
I think, you can come back
and look at them later.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.680
But, so this is what I do.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.630
I paint two scales, sometimes
a little larger than scale

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.950
and that's one side
of the White House

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.320
as it is the gingerbread house.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.200
And I didn't bring all the
pieces that make up the pop-up

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.680 position:56%
but there's the portico flat and you
can imagine-- when you see the book,

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.540
how it folds and it creates the
three dimensional White House.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.620
And one of the things
that we've done

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.880
with this book is we included
a lot of presidential pets.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:32.610
And so, I illustrated many of
the different presidential pets.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.760
Of course, the American
flag and a snowman

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.340
and here are some more
pet illustrations.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.800
But anyway, when you see the
book and you read the text

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.540 position:56%
that talks a lot about their
interactions with the first families

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.680
and their pets and it was fun to
really feature them in the book.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.800
And of course, they make
the pets and the decorations

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:05.180
on the real gingerbread
White Houses out of marzipan

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.960
and many other things
which they'll talk about.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.260
And I get to paint them.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.750 position:56%
So, anyway, it's very inspirational.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:18.100
I learned a lot about the
gingerbread White House

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.430
from their book.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.700
It's just fantastic.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.100
Beautiful illustration, a
coffee table book which they'll,

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.870
of course, be talking about.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:32.580
Now, is the PowerPoint like--
will it go on beyond videos?

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:37.270
Because I have some images that
are-- I think will be fun to show.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.270
Well, this is about the White House
Historical Association, this slide.

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.290
They're the publishers of the book.

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:49.010
And it's just such a wonderful
organization and, you know,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.020
it's through the sale of books like
ours and of course, the Christmas--

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.450
the official White House
Christmas Ornament that--

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.170
and of course, private donations.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.100
They go to so many
worthy causes, you know,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:06.330 position:56%
having to do with the beautification
and as it says, the appreciation

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.130
and enjoyment of the
executive mansion.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.190
So, I've been-- had
a long association

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.530
with the White House
Historical Association.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.380
Actually, since my first
White House pop-up book

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.800
and I created an exclusive
line of gift products

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.630
on the White House neighborhood.

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.810
And I've also designed
for the holiday cards.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.910
So, holidays well, I love
Christmas, I love the holidays.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.970
And three of my pop-up
books are holiday theme.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:43.050 position:56%
This is "Christmas Around the World"
and then my best seller "Christmas

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:49.500
in New York" and my last Christmas
book before this one is Charles

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.080
Dickens' "A Christmas Carol".

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.970
So, you can-- I love,
love the holidays.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.260
So, I was just thrilled
when I got a call

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.190
from the White House
Historical Association about--

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:08.480
with the idea of creating a holiday
theme book about gingerbread,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.600
the White House and
the-- and a pop-up.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.870
So, you can imagine,
I said yes right away.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:21.500
And that's when then-- we're
going to be-- he came--

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.470
well, I mean, I already knew Chef
Mesnier, we've done book signings

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.830
in the past and Chef Ramsdell, and
I was-- and I knew their books.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.670
But the book that they
wrote with their memories

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:36.370
and all the recipes was just so--
that's where I just got inspired

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.270
in how to create the art for
the gingerbread White House.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.780
This is a slide of some--

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.830
I also create interactive
book apps of holidays.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.610
I'm not-- That was a video so I'm
not going to even try that one.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.160
So, this is the cover
of our new book,

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.680
the "Gingerbread White
House, a Pop-up Book".

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.470
And it just came together in
a very short amount of time.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:09.990
Like I said in the video, it
usually takes 18 months for a book

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.510
from conception to publication.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:17.940
But anyway, this year I heard from
the association and we decided

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.710
that we would do everything
possible to make it happen

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.740
for this Christmas season.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:27.710
And we're thrilled that it's come
together and we have the book.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:32.590
And this is-- that's
actually a Christmas--

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.420
paper Christmas ornament
that's in the book.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:38.200
And anyone who's interested, I
have also created a little black

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:43.410 position:56%
and white line drawing of that
ornament so that take home and color

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.530
and if you'd like to
pick one up, I have it,

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.290
when we're signing books later.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.010
And of course, here's the book that
they're going to be talking about.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:52.980
And this is-- On the
right is the cover

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:55.310
of the book within our pop-up book.

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.350
And that's where they
share their memories

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:05.220
and those are my illustrations of
these two very handsome gentlemen.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.850
And it's been a fun collaboration.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.450
Here's-- Oh yeah, these
are the punch out.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.900
It also comes with punch
out pieces like paper dolls,

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.120
there's the presidential
limousine the Christmas ornaments,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.540
some of the pets, Chef Mesnier and
you know, other little objects.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.520
So, you can interact
with the actual pop-up.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.980
And there, you can see
all the pieces on display.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.900
And, you know, the goal was just to
create holiday magic and joy and--

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.600
for the entire family and so
that you could bring, you know,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.440
the beauty and the
excitement that happens

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.790
at the White House every year
on a more sort of human scale.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.150
And maybe this book will become
your own holiday centerpiece.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.450
So, thank you.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.460
Yes. I'd love to show the book.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:05.710
So, this is the book and this
is the pop-up gingerbread house.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.090
And again, you'll see
when you look close,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.500
there's a lot of pets
surrounding the house

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.800
and there's the presidential
seal and gingerbread

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.490
and little santa with
the American flag.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.830
And then within here is the
booklet with the history

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.210
and with the anecdotes
and with their portraits.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:31.700
And also, two pages
of punch out sheets.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.860
Oh there. Here we go.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:41.390 position:56%
And they have a little stand so that
you can set them up and just play

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.260
and learn about the
history of Christmas

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.900
and gingerbread houses
at the White House.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.470
Thanks.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.730
[ Applause ]

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.530
Oh yeah.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.260
[ Applause ]

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.560
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Good job.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.860
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: Thank you.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.160
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick:
Thank you Mark-- Chuck.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.620
I'm going to be doing that all
day, just to tell you right now,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.810
but I really can tell them apart.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.100
So, I feel like whoever is
sitting sort of in this line

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.450
of side is going to be listening
to me more than seeing me.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.100
So, I don't usually stand
up for things like this

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.310
but maybe I guess I better.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:22.080
I have long been fascinated
with pop-up books as I said.

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.260
But really, that process of making
it come together with collaborators

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.550
because it was just more than the
design of course, it's the story

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.640
that you had to tell about
working in the White House,

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.320
about cooking there, about creating
these incredible masterpieces year

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.580
after year based on
input from who's living

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.530
at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue at that time.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:51.090
So, how do you-- Let's start
off, Chef Mesnier, with you.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.950
The differences in sort of
winnowing down this very,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:03.960
very complete with recipes and
how-to's down to pop-up book size.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.830
I mean, where do you start?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:12.190
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Well, it all--
This is all with your mind if,

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.290
you know, your mind is
very powerful as you know.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.590
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Yours is.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.300
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: And
before you create anything,

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:22.690
it better appeared in your head.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.280
That's the first thing.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.930
And you leave it before
you put it on paper.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:33.920
And the transition from making
those huge gingerbread houses

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.500
to the pop-up book, first of
all, come to mind children.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.430
You're doing it for the children.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.930
So, right away your mind
goes back, for me it's easy

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.150
because I'm getting old, to go
back when I was five years old,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.780
I do that everyday anyway.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:54.450
You understand that
that's really how it is.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:00.610
You have to play the part and feel
like one of those kids that comes

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.590
to Washington for the first time

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.660
and I've heard sometimes the family
talking about the White House

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.280 position:56%
and sometimes the pets and all that.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.040
And maybe that day,
they will be lucky,

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:17.490 position:56%
one of the pet may be strolling
through the field of the White House

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.670
and everything and
that's how you take it.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.080
And my favorite part of the
book and in the booklet is

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.130
when I give a tour to the children.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.910
It's fun. I really was giving
a tour to the children.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:38.220
And I can dream up a lot of thing,
you know, sometimes a little crazy

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.430
or sometimes a little down to earth
but you have to put it together

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:47.500
and that's how you really do
go from those huge building

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:53.260
to presenting something for
little kids in much smaller scale

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:59.740
by simply changing yourself to
a grown up to a little kids.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.990
That's simple as that.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:03.700
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: That's true.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.470
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: And chef, you've
worked with him such a long time,

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.180
what's the sort of key

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.290
to collaborating on
an effort like this?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.660
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Well,
can I talk just

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:14.770 position:56%
about gingerbread houses in general?

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.070
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Absolutely.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.370
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: OK.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.090
In both cases, the first book that
we did, we wanted to do a book

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.010
about large gingerbread
house construction.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.110
You've seen the ones at the White
House, you might have seen the ones

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.450
that we did at Mt. Vernon.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.620
They all weighed 300 to 500 pounds.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.540
Very, very large and we wanted
to bring it then to the book

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.990
such that you could
actually do it yourself.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.470
So the first book we used
the vehicle of the history

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.320
of the White House
gingerbread houses, is that.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.850
And then in the second
one, as chef said,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.610 position:56%
through the eyes of children, right.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.650
But the thing that I wanted
to say is that in both books,

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.350
we made sure because we think
it so important and so much fun

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.320
to provide enough material
for how one would go

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.660
about preparing the
gingerbread house.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.650
We have a couple of basic
things that we live by.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.710
It doesn't matter how large
it is or how small it is,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.340
the principles are the same

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:20.970
and the first principle is every
single thing must be edible.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:28.830
No TV-- wood, PVC pipes,
no chicken wire, no glue.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.620
Everything has to be edible.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.440
So, the book includes a very
good recipe for gingerbread.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.450
And if we're working with a
500 pound White House model

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.810
or if I'm working with children
in school, it's always the same.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.670
The concept we're--
we make gingerbread.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.510
We're basically making the wood.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.530
We could talk for a long time

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.520
but I'll just give you a
couple little simple things.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.690
We start with sheets of gingerbread
just like sheets of wood.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.200
But gingerbread has
a lot of sugar on it.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.970
So, if you make your
gingerbread nice and flat and dry,

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.590
even if it's dry and hard
on a day like today, humid,

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.650 position:56%
the sugar is hygroscopic, it's going
to start to absorb the moisture

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:21.000 position:56%
and sooner or later, the gingerbread
is going to become soft again.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.350
So, we take all of our gingerbread
sheets and we put a thin layer

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.840
of tampered chocolate on the back.

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:30.460
Tampering is not a mystery
anymore, it's in the books.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:32.940
And that stiffens the gingerbread

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.680
such that it could be raining
outside and it has, several times,

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.230
open the door, it's raining.

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.160
People come in and
splashing their feet around.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.190
And we also use tampered chocolate
to glue the building together.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.400
All of the books you see use
royal icing or white icing

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.970
but white icing dries out
and becomes very brittle

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.440
and then everything falls apart.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.060
The other part of the book,
and then I'll stop talking,

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.060
is that as pastry chefs, we
have sort of tools available

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.070
to us, Chuck mentioned it.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.690
We have marzipan and we have
royal icing and we have chocolate

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:10.860
and we have rolled fondant
and so forth and so on.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.500
So, that's where the concept
either at chef's size,

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.110
the whole White House,
or with a child.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:21.840
You simply say, let your mind
go and then when your mind goes,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.770
take a look at Chuck's
pop-up books, my god.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.400
Then, you take a look at your
marzipan and your chocolate

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.960
and your royal and
you say, "What fits?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.010 position:56%
What can I make out of what things?"

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.040
You make your production
plan and three months later,

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.690
you're putting it together.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:39.990
All edible.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.290
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: All right.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.690
So, I'm leaping way, way
ahead here, but I bet somebody

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.750
in this room wants
to know what happens

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.990
to those great gingerbread
houses that you made every year.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.290
Where do they go?

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:51.090
Did people in the kitchen
get to break them down

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.590
and eat them for family meal?

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.040
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: The mice.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.510
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Mice?

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.680
[ Laughter ]

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.170
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Where
do they go chef?

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.400
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Well, I
decided-- when I started to do--

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.770
let's back talk a bit, you know,
the White House and gingerbread,

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.310
when you got started,
you got started

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.580 position:56%
at the White House to a German chef.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.860 position:56%
Many years ago, he did the classical
A-frame house like it was done

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.820
in Germany for many years, it was
a small house, collectively small.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.760
But they were nevertheless they
were very attractive, very nice.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.040
But when I started to do that,
I want it to go much larger.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.220 position:56%
I wanted to change many, many thing.

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.860
And that was the first question
the first year when I took it over.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.080
They said, "What you're going to
do with that after Christmas?"

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.350
Well, when I came to the house
and then I did just that on top

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.420
of the roof and I saw how much
dust we had collected, I said,

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.450
"No one is going to eat that
house over my dead body."

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.750
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So--

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.760
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: It will
go right down the trash.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.080
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick:
It's up for how long?

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.380
It sounds like--

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.680
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: One month.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.980
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: -- a month.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.280
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: One month.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.580
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Yeah.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.880
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: And remember,
you have thousand and thousand

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.180
of people going to those dining
room, you know, some sneeze,

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:11.240
some do who knows what,
what they do, you know.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.420
You know by the way, did you
know the newest story now

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.590
in California they invented
a whistle for the cow

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.920
when they past wind,
you can listen to that.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.070
I'm not kidding you.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.920
This is your government at work.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.280
So, I came up with a bright
idea maybe we do the same thing

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.660
at the White House when
everybody goes through the line,

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.650 position:56%
we'll just give them a little
whistle, you know, psst, psst, psst.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.230
And then, we'll know who passes gas

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.220
into the dining room,
that's a side story.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.780
But it's true, what I
told you is the fact.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.080
Check it out.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.430
Governor Brown signed
the bill by the way, OK.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.230
It's not a joke.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.170
But that's where we
are now and, you know,

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.240
there's no other problem,
I guess, to tackle.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.280
We tackle the wind that the cow
are passing in the field, OK.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.710
Very good, very good.

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:04.760
Now, the thing that-- I will
come back to reality now.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:11.170
The gingerbread book has a lot of
new technique in it that you need

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.980
to check out like we came up
with a gingerbread veneer.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:20.910
Like let's say, if you have to do
like a tower something that curve,

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:25.080 position:56%
it's very difficult to bake
without cracking or anything a piece

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.750
of gingerbread that will
be just perfect looking

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.210
like a tower or rounded area.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.510
So I--

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.810
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: You're
talking about this book, chef?

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.110
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yes.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:36.410
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Yeah.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:37.710
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: I really was--

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.170
This is the year I did
the huge castle during the

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.950
Clinton administration.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.160
There were several tower and
I really said, you know what,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.080
those towers how are we
going to make them really,

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.700
really looking like a tower?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.010
Very nice and round and
I tide several technique

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.310
and I couldn't do it at all.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:06.080 position:56%
So then I realize, I said, you know,
"If I get a piece of gingerbread--

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.140
" kindly find me the
goddamn tower will you?

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.440
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: OK.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.740
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Thank you.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.360
So, I don't have much patience.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.580
Patience doesn't come
in big supply for me.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:20.850
The-- So, I realize that if I would
bake the gingerbread particularly

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.930
fully but not drying it and then

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:33.220
after with a bandsaw cutting some
very thin pieces then you can bend

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.720
them anyway you want and let them
dry and then paint your chocolate

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.850
in the back and there you have.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.760
Again, you haven't cheated,
it's still good food all over,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.810
it's still nice and
it look beautifully.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.390
Oh, thank you very much.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.690
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Your welcome.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:48.990
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier:
Thank for your help.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.290
No. That's not a tower.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.210
That's the Washington
Monument you're giving me.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.400
[ Laughter ]

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.430
So, just to say, so
that really came up.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.980
And then, remember, the White
House those balcony, you know,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.790
the half round of the balcony.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.710
That was another thing
that was fairly difficult

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.820
to make it look just perfect.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.920
And that veneer really,
was the answer to that

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.930
by using the gingerbread while it's
still plywood, was cut to a band--

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:17.470
you need a bandsaw for that.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.770
You need a bandsaw.

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.270
And-- Sorry, I can't
get up because I'm tied

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:22.810
up to the seat here, you know.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.110
Thank you.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.410
Thank you.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.710
So, there you go.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.710
This was the castle that we did
at the White House this year.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.200
And you can see several
towers, round towers.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:36.040
And that's how we made those towers
by using the gingerbread veneers.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.350
OK. So, there it is in this book.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:43.020
And there are other thing in
the book that was really a first

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:48.270
that we applied this year
for that gingerbread book.

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:50.390
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: And when
you two were working together,

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.690
did somebody do all the royal
icing and somebody does the baking?

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.020 position:56%
Or how do you sort of break up the--

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Whoever has time.

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.300
Somebody need a job,
some has the time.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.770
OK, that is the next step,
that's what we're going to do.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:06.380
And whatever we don't care
who has time for what, right?

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.680
We don't--

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.980
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: That is when it's
crunch time, there was a hint--

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.280
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick:
Crunch time, I like that.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.580
Crunch time, good.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.880
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: And
the right place and--

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.180
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: You
know, he's just-- we've--

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:15.480
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Are you making
them in your own home kitchens

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.610 position:56%
when you have to do them for events?

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.140
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: We usually will
go to a larger over to be able to--

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.500
because 300 pounds of gingerbread
is many full size sheets

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.800
of gingerbread.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.360 position:56%
The thing I wanted to say chef,
about ideas and so, but instead of--

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.210
we said that there's no word
or whatever or whatever.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:36.450
Go to the inside of the houses,
the structural elements are just

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.190
like in this building
but they're gingerbread.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.120
So, for example, if we need
an I-beam for strength,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.930
we make it out of gingerbread.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.950 position:56%
And just like plywood is strong by
gluing thin layers of wood together,

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.410
we do it with gingerbread.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.850
And that's how we do it.

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.410
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yes.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.130
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: And Chuck,
are you working from photos?

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.430
Have you gotten to see this--

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.320
does it help for you to
see anything in person?

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.200
And for their likenesses too, do
they sit for you for the book?

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.500
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: Well,
they didn't sit for me

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.200
but I had some wonderful
photographs.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.340
And of course I know them.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.640
So--

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.940
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: They look--

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.910
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: And the last time
we were together, we actually--

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:18.160
we had a picture taken
and that was very helpful.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.830
And so, that's how I
came up with their--

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.700
painting their portraits
for the cover of the book.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.880
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: And you're
working in sort of what size?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.390
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: I'm working
sort of same scale as the book.

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.510
Very, very fine work.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:40.320
Very, you know, thin, special
paintbrushes, and my medium is--

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.110
I mix acrylic with
latex paint actually.

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.570
And that gets-- I can-- that
way, I can get an opaque look

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.290
or I can also have it very
washed in water color.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.470
There's of course a lot of strong
color in this because it is,

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.150
you know, it's decorated with
candies and it is a holiday.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.650
So, you know, I got to work with--

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:08.610
as oppose to some of my more
traditional architectural paintings

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.880
and some other work,
this was really fun

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.840
because it was really
bright and strong.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.050
And like both chefs said, it's
just looking at all the photographs

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.100
of gingerbread houses, they've
created other gingerbread houses

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.630
and then just being very familiar
with Christmas candies and so,

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.700
you know, I just used
my imagination.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.650
And I didn't copy one of
their houses, you know,

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.680
we created a new one
just for the book.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.770
Yeah. With elements, yeah, coming
from all of their past designs.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:45.540
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Mark, did you
have something you wanted to add?

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You know, the
thing that just crosses my mind is

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:52.210 position:56%
that I suspect that most of you have
done something with gingerbread,

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.130
but it's the concept that Chuck has
talked about chef has talked about.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.330
If you haven't done a
gingerbread house with a child,

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.530
do it, and don't control it.

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:07.710
I do a lot of gingerbread houses
with schools, first graders,

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:10.020
second graders, kindergartners.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.530
They have fully functioning
minds and I go in ahead of time

00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.310
because we know we're going
to make a gingerbread house

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.360
but I don't tell them what it is.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.310
And I simply say, "What
are we going to do?"

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.020
Huddle. Talk, talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.870
So, out of the blue, two years
ago, it's going to be a castle.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.020
Now, I don't know what Disney
movie they were watching,

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.390
I don't know what book they
were reading, but, you know,

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.260
when they said castle,
you know what I said.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.470
"What's a castle look like?"

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.130
Up to the board, pens, you
know, whatever, whatever.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.740
And then, gives you chance to
take it back, see if it'll come

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.230
out in gingerbread, see if
it'll come out in marzipan.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.010
Back to them, help them put it
together, they have great ownership

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.920
in it and they really
love what they produced.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.220
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So,
I guess you're not a fan

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.200
of those kits that
are everywhere now?

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.350
I mean, even for Halloween,
it's gotten really big,

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:03.010
the whole gingerbread house
thing to put them together.

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.050
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You know, I
mean, they don't come decorate it,

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.860
you got to figure out what
you're going to do with them.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.500
So, it's a start.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.800
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: And--

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.100
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Those
kits are great by the way.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.400
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Yeah.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.060
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: I use
it as a house for my cat.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.100
[ Laughter ]

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.910
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: So,
cats eat gingerbread?

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.210
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: They do.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:25.440
They do. There's a picture of Socks
here on the book eating the real--

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.920
the big gingerbread house.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: I remember Socks.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.520
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yes.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.820
He's in the book, there's
a picture there.

00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.120
Yes.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.990
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: In addition
to the recipe for gingerbread,

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:36.590
you can make a couple big
sheets and they really worked it

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.490
down to a very simple equation.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.930 position:56%
There's a couple of holiday
cut-out cookies and those snowballs,

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.290
you know, they're called lots

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:44.710
of different things
in different cuisines.

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.010
I love them.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.920
They've got nuts and nut flour
in them and they're covered in,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.220
you know, powdered sugar.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.140
That those are also
recipes that you can find

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.730
in this booklet within
the pop-up book.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.980
And they'll be singing
them at 2:30 in line 2.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.850
I forgot to mention that earlier,
so knock that out of the way.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.150
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: Hey, Bonnie.

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:06.450
I forgot to mention.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:07.750
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Yeah.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.140
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: With-- In the
book, we also have a scratch

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.550
and sniff gingerbread pad.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.850
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: That's great.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:13.150
Scratch and sniff.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.600
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: So,
very excited about that.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.220
So, you get, you know,

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.710
you can really immerse
yourself, all your senses.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.010
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Yeah.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:22.360
Much better than those perfume
samples they're used to, so.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.660
&gt;&gt; Chuck Fischer: Yes.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.960
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick:
I think pretty soon,

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.260
we're going to open
it up to questions.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.890
So, if you want to
line up, don't be shy.

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:35.620 position:56%
In the mean time, in terms of people
getting started doing their own

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:40.610
at home, you've got the
masters, the experts right here.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.880
So, what would be like the key
thing you would tell people

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.180
to do it at home?

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.220
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Well, start
with a small project, first of all.

00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.520
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Should they sort

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.140
of do a small one before they
work up to the holiday thing?

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.440
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yeah.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.740
Definitely.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.040
Small project and don't
be too ambitious, OK.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.180
I know people, they see a picture,
oh, that would be beautiful.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.480
Let's do it.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:34:59.780
No, slow down there, you know.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.080
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You don't
have to do a whole house.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.380
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yeah.

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.680
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You
can do a facade.

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.980
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yeah.

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You can
do a shadow box, you know.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.770
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Start with that
and then you can grow every year.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:13.470
It's fun to-- every Christmas
time to improve your design

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:18.370
from the year before
and brining new thing,

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.250
new twist into the
house and all that.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.550
That's very exciting.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:26.360
I mean, bringing the children into
that process is really fantastic.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.720
It's the best thing you can
do with the family, you know.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.930
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: I would
imagine you guys have both judged

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.850
gingerbread competition,
what's the sort

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:36.620
of craziest thing you've
seen made out of gingerbread?

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.310
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier:
Well, those competition,

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:43.500
a lot of the time include
too many fake stuff in it.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.240
And for me to be a judge of
that, it's very difficult

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.900
because that's not
the way I do thing.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.870
I don't care what it is I do.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:53.740
I like to have real food.

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.560
Use real food, you know.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.400
And when somebody bring in
something made out of gingerbread

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.450
with pearl hanging out and stuff.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:02.810
I say, "No, wait a minute.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.500
Get those pearl out of here.

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.160
OK. We don't want that.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.460
We don't want-- ."

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.380
If you're going to make
pearl, make them out of sugar.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.680
That's it.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.980
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: OK.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.280
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: It
may be very complicated,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.580
that sound very difficult.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.090
But actually, we are food people.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.640
You want to make out a pearl, then
get into that kind of business,

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.090
which is another line of work here.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:24.610
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: OK.

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:28.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. I don't-- I guess it's on.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.710
A question for either chef,
when you're baking gingerbread

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.280
for the gingerbread
house or anything,

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.880
do you ever have flops and--
or even making pastries for--

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.070
when you're doing pastries

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.280
for the White House dinners you
have flops and what happens?

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.180
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: You
always have flops.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:48.480
You always have flops.

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:54.440
I taught for several years,
chef taught for several years.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.290
In the avocational side of a
pastry, it was very interesting,

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:00.620
people were drawn to taking classes

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:04.140
because of the implied
precision of pastry.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.920
Pastry recipes are very detailed
in terms of a quarter of teaspoon

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.670
of this and seven minutes of
that and so forth and so on.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.960
That's not the way the world works.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.440
Chickens don't lay
the same size eggs,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.430
and I don't care who's
oven you have,

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.460
it bakes differently, you know.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:24.780
So, you just have to sort of-- with
us, you just sort of have to figure

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.850 position:56%
out how your oven is baking that day

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:28.940
or just make adjustments
and work with it.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.240
Yes.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.720
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier:
Well, I never had flops.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.840
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Of course not.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.500
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: I've
been trying for 50 years

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:39.320
and it's a curse ladies
and gentlemen.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.620
I just can't.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: No, but
he's renamed a lot of things.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.170
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier:
It's just a curse.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.210
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: That
wasn't soufflÃ©, it's--

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.880
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: But you know, my
philosophy on that is very simple.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.210
And you should try it, it works.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.200
Don't try it with children
when they're all

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.610
around you but it does work.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.500
When you want to bake a cake or
something, I know you're going

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.310
to be nervous, very nervous.

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.670
You-- What you do, you get yourself
the best bottle of wine you have

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.790
in the house and you open
it and you have a glass.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.150
And then you do your baking.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.870
And then, if all else fail,
you finish the bottle.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.630
After a bottle of wine,
everything looks good.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.870 position:56%
Even your spouse start to look good.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:23.740
So, do it, it works.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.040
Trust me, it works.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: And
you get a bourbon.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.840
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Go ahead.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.360
&gt;&gt; When you're working for a
young first family, the Obamas

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:35.900
or the Clintons maybe,
do you create an edible

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.650
or a decorative smaller gingerbread
house for the private quarters?

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:43.910
And second question, do any of the
children, the Obama girls, Chelsea,

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.620
ever worked with you in the kitchen

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.000
or observe you making the
gingerbread house or anybody

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.620
in the first family help
you, Michelle maybe?

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.920
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Yes.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.600
Well, yeah, may occasion,
that's how it's done.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.620
Depending on the age
of the children.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.490
I remember for Amy Carter,
we always did a second house

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:02.440
that she would have in her bedroom
just for herself and all that.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.740
She loved that.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.720
But then, some of the
children, when I was there,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:10.250
who were past their age,
so, we didn't do it.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.630
OK. Children from the
family, like Chelsea,

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:18.210
you mentioned Chelsea Clinton, she
was just in her age getting ready

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.350
to go to college, you know,
university and everything

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.700
and she did come to the
pastry shop to learn how

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.880
to bake and make some dessert.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.600
She brought even a
couple friend with her.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.260
And she was a lot of fun.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.560
As a matter of fact, I was really
amazed to see how much she knew

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.640
because there were some finished
product on the table and stuff,

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.900
and she called them all by
name and knew what they were

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.200
and knew what they were made of.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.410
And I said, "Wow," you know, I was
very impressed for a young girl

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.880
that age that she would
know that much.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:56.130
And a lot of them, at french
term, like frangipane and brioche

00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:59.570 position:56%
and how many young people really
know that in this country, you know,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.850 position:56%
unless you've been really affiliated
with some baking or doing something.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.330
&gt;&gt; So maybe Hilary
was baking cookies?

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.650
[ Laughter ]

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:08.950
Maybe.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.520
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier:
Maybe, I will never tell.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.340
&gt;&gt; OK. Thank you.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.640
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: But the--

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.700
We always wanted also
Chelsea to do the dessert

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.000
for the family that night.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.170
It will be a pie or
something fairly simple

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.330
and something she can use
while she will be in college.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.290
And that night, she could
will out whatever she did

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:32.580 position:56%
and tell her parents and whoever was
there at the time, grandma, grandpa

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.780
and then say, "Listen, I did that
for your dinner tonight," you know,

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:38.710
and she was very proud of that.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.010
&gt;&gt; That's really nice.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.310
Thank you.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:42.610
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: OK.

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.910
&gt;&gt; Chef Mesnier, I
loved your memoir.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.160
And my question is, what
did the Carters have

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.630
as their 70th anniversary cake?

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:50.930
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: The-- Yeah.

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:54.200
That was-- Chef Mark
was part of that too.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.810
The reason I wanted to
get involved with that--

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.510
first of all, they
called me for that.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:04.650
And I was very excited but I
said, you know, "I need to see

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:05.950
if Mark is going to be part of it,"

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:10.160
because those project can be
very consuming and, you know.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.980
And I'm not-- I've been in the
kitchen for 60 something years.

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.020
So, you get the rest of
the story and I'm kind

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:20.030
of getting tired a little
bit sooner than I use to.

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.550
So, I need all the help I can get.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:28.090
And then, so, we decided on making
a carrot cake because that was one

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.520
of their famous cake and Mark
has a fabulous recipe for that

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.740
with a nice-- a very good icing.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.240
What was the icing Mark?

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.910
Remember? That was the
cream cheese and butter--

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.500
light butter cream,
Italian butter cream.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.180
And then we-- The decoration

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.920
of the cake was a miniature
white chocolate--

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.640
White House chocolate house

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.340
because there'd be another
White House of course.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.510
And then, all the other decoration

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:56.360
around the cake was
the flower from--

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.120
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Magnolia.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.040
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: Magnolia made
of gum paste, magnolia flower

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.040
which [inaudible] and all that.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.340
And then, a nice little plaque,

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.870
happy 70th anniversary
President and Mrs. Carter.

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:15.350
And a very, very-- We're
very touched that we came

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:17.690
to their function for that.

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.350
That was in Annapolis.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:25.700
And they-- I was amazed to see,
also, how fantastic they were.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.000
I mean--

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.120
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: 90 years
old, first on the dance floor.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.900
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: First
on the dance floor.

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.630
And you know, 10 good minutes.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.920
I said, "You know,
that's an inspiration,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.250
there's no doubt," you know.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.270
So, it was a beautiful event, very,
very nice and we were very glad

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.570
and proud to be part of it.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.870
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: That's great.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.170
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: Very nice people.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.470
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Anybody else?

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:52.250 position:56%
I know we're coming up against the
end here, but, you know, it's funny.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.300
Speaking of the dessert thing
and the White House, chef,

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:59.160
I had to ask you, from the previous
book, you had said something like,

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:01.690
in Washington you had never
encountered so many people

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:04.870
who would pass up a slice of
chocolate cake or crÃ¨me brulee.

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.930
They were interested in
low fat, low whatever,

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.690
you know, has that changed?

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.580
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: You
know, this is the--

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:20.130
the calorie thing in dessert
is a soul subject sometimes.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:22.110
And it's a subject that people--

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:29.260
you know, I have a hard time
telling people that, yes,

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.500
there are some low calorie dessert
that are still done with butter

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.200
and cream and all that stuff.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.470
People have a problem
understanding that.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.290
And I'm going to explain that
and if someone don't understand,

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:45.900
they can go get my book "Dessert
University", it tells you all

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.680
about the low calorie
dessert in this book.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.910
You can eat dessert everyday.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:56.880
I mean, look, remember Mrs. Regan?

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.190
Remember when she came
to the White House?

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.830
How slim she was?

00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.260
When she went back home,
she was just as slim.

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:09.930
Mrs. Regan was one of the first
lady that never skip dessert.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:12.160
OK. Never, ever, ever.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.720
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Let's
hear it for dessert.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.360
&gt;&gt; Roland Mesnier: But, but,

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.820
there was a certain style
of dessert I gave her.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.670
I understand very quickly
what she wanted.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.630
She wanted dessert to be very
tiny first of all, a couple spoon.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.260
She wanted them extremely pretty.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.560
Mrs. Regan hated what
she called gray food.

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:38.700
If you gave her a plate
where everything looked gray

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.990
and dark, get that out of here.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.450
She wanted happy dessert.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.790
But whatever was on the
plate better be food.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:51.280
And don't use fresh
flower please, not for her.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.810
OK. Fresh flower, she would
say, belong in the vase

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.660
in the middle of the table.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.980
And she was right.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.410
She was right.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:02.580
If the pastry chef cannot
make his own decoration,

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.330
then he has no business
being a pasty chef.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.680
That's my-- That's what
I'm saying here, OK.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.930
Do you understand where
I'm coming from here?

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:13.610
Everything-- And I can show you at
home, I have thousands of picture

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.650
that never been published.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:20.640 position:56%
Thousands of picture of luncheon for
Mrs. Regan, luncheon for Mrs. Bush,

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.530
this and that for ladies and so on.

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:26.500
And you can see what I served
them to the length I want

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:32.890
to trade decoration for them, but
all made out whatever pastry, OK.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.960
So, she wanted that,
that was her dessert.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:40.040
Couple little spoon, very
tasty, very colorful.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.470
And if he didn't like it-- you
heard about it, let me tell you.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:48.140
Because Mrs. Regan was a little bit
like me, she spoke her own mind.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.870
So, we went along very well
by the way because of that.

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:56.360
But yes, you can have
low calorie dessert.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.560
Dessert that are good for you.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.360
Now, what most people have a
problem understanding is not what's

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:09.360
in the recipe that count,
it's how you work with it.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.060
I will give you a simple example.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:16.140
You all know about vanilla sauce
or custard sauce, you know,

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.500
that sauce that you get
with dessert sometimes.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:24.500 position:56%
Now, that sauce, first of all, when
you get it should be nice and thick.

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.450
Not because you put cornstarch
in it, not because you put butter

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:31.520
in it, not because you
put heavy cream in it,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.540
because of the technique
that you use to do it.

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.560
I can make you a vanilla sauce
using [inaudible] and milk

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.240
and that sauce will
look like it was made

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.180
with whipped cream,
with heavy cream.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:48.900
This is the technique I use.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.450
That's what most people do
not understand still today.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.700
Everybody think that it has to
be this and that, cornstarch.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.560
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:00.860
This thing don't exist.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.480
I don't use stuff like that.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.420
And you can look through the
book, you get all the explanation.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.890
And this is a good subject to
talk about because everybody wants

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:16.210
to loose weight but still
want to enjoy a great dessert.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.330
And there's no reason
why you cannot do that.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.260
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: Chef Mark, you
had something you want to add?

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:24.020
&gt;&gt; Mark Ramsdell: No, I-- No,
I was fascinated with his--

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.020
[ Laughter ]

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.420
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Benwick: You're
a good foil, I would say.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.720
All right.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.020
We've got to warp it up.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.010
Thank you very much Chuck Fischer,
Chefs Mesnier and Ramsdell.

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.970
[ Applause ]

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.230
And thank you very much audience.
