&gt;&gt;Male #1: Uh. Hello and welcome. And before
we get started, please remember to turn off

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.040
all pagers, cell phones, blackberries, smart
phones, android devices, and legacy Apple

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
products.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040
[Laughing]

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.330
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Bike Snob's a blogger/cyclists,
racer/commuter, as satirist/cultural observer,

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
and an online researcher finding the silliest
posters on Craig's list and slashing their

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.039
proverbial tires. His new book

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.460
helps us realize just how ludicrous we can
all be about cycling and just how ludicrously

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.010
cool cycling can be. From the history of old
timey cycling in his hometown of New York,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.510
to poking fun of all the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.120
various characters that perch themselves atop
bicycles, to straight out tips on how to ride

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.320
and how to thrive, the book is a homage to
the sport Bike Snob obviously loves. Since

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.429
we're here at at Google, I thought we take
a quick look at US Web search trends for the

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.659
term "bike snob" in 2010. While still not
as popular as terms like Lance Armstrong,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.039
fixed gear, or even Lone Wolf...

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.280
[audience roaring laughter]

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.570
&gt;&gt;Male #1: ..."Bike Snob" does produce more
queries, uh, then Tour of California winner,

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.110
Michael Rogers; runner up, Leipheimer; or
even Nashbar coupons. This spring, web-search

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.150
traffic doubled when "Bike Snob" revealed
his true identity, Eben Weiss. Handily surpassing

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.370
queries for local cyclist/entrepreneur and
champion of cycling clothing as business casual,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.370
Sergey Brin.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.370
[audience laughing]

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.830
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Mr. Weiss is here today to talk
about his new book "Bike Snob." Following

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.180
the talk there will be a Q&amp;A session. Please
remember to use the microphone when you're

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.930
asking questions for the benefit of the remote
video audiences, and this is being recorded

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.410
on YouTube. Our local book retailer Books
Inc., I believe has still got some books to

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.890
sell back there, and Mr. Weiss will be sticking
around to sign them. So please, join me in

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.521
welcoming Eben Weiss a.k.a. Bike Snob.

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:53.030
[audience applause]

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.801
&gt;&gt;Eben Weiss: Hi. Thank you very much for
ah, for coming. It's great to be here at at

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.801
Yahoo...

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:02.801
[audience laughing]

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:07.550
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Um. Is this Yahoo or is that later?
Google, even better. It's great to be here

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.079
at Google, thank you very much. Um. Google
in a lot of ways in many, many ways made what

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.099
I'm doing possible now

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.730
which is ah, you know, riding this blog every
day, which is a great pleasure in my life,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.659
uh, people seem to enjoy it. It's made it
possible me to to write a book and have it

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.629
published. It sent me on a tour

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.159
uh, all over the country or at least the cool,
trendy parts of the country. They don't send

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.959
me to the regular parts. They're sending me
on like the "Burrito Belt." Kind of the hipster

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:44.840
belt. But it's absolutely great and I-I-I-
seriously thank you for that. Having said

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.670
that, um, I've-I've dreamed of this moment
for some time because, um, while I-I do use

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:06.999
and I publish my blog using Blogger, um, and
uh, well April of 2009 you actually featured

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:13.919
me as a Blog of Note which was flattering,
which was nice for me. Uh. Right between Inside

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.840
the Loop and Moments of Perfect Clarity, I
don't know what those blogs are. I don't know

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.169
if any of them have been here, but here I
am. Um. And it was a nice moment, but then

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:30.359
a month later, I was-I should add that I was
I was monetizing with your Ad

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:39.059
Sense. Uh, but a month later I got this on
my Gmail, another fine Google product, that,

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:47.190
uh, what does it say? That you needed to terminate
my Ad Sense, because I'm-I'm-to protect the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.340
interests of both our advertisers and our
other Ad Sense publishers. So I-I guess I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.360
don't know why this was, and then I appealed
it. And this appeal was denied. So I-I I'm

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.199
kind of, I don't mean this to be, I'm-I nobody's
laughing. It's kind of funny. But I was kind

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.829
of reeling at the time, and I was wanting
to talk to people. I actually, I used to work

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.820
around the corner from, ah, 111 8th Ave in
New York which is where your New York brethren

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.440
and sisteren or [laughing]

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440
[audience laughing]

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.850
&gt;&gt;Weiss: They wouldn't let me in I tried to
kind of barnstorm, I tried to do the Michael

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.220
Moore thing, and they weren't having it. You've
got good security, you guys. You should feel

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.950
safe at work, but ah, they wouldn't let me
in. So I've been wondering all this time what

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.510
happened? I can't figure it out. I don't have
Ad Sense. Sometimes you invite me to do other

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.200
programs, I'm like well, that sounds

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.200
lovely I would like to do this program, but
you need an Ad Sense program to do it or membership

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.690
or whatever you call it. And I can't I've
been sort of locked out. Yet here I am talking

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.060
to you. And it's in interesting kind of thing
there and the only thing I can think of, I'm

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:00.570
sure there's a simple explanation that I did
wrong was like two days before you terminated

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.920
it, I did post this picture.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.040
[Picture out of frame, cannot see]

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.600
[audience laughing loudly]

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.590
Weiss: But like first of all it was very much
in context, and it was making a really sophisticated

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.420
point about our culture and the about media
and all that stuff. And second of all, as

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.420
you can see, it's

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:25.980
censored. When I-I when I put anything racy
on the blog I make sure to sepia tone it,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.670
because you know anything like, like from
the Victorian era like, even if they're naked,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.960
that's not offensive.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.770
Because after a certain point the statute
of limitations on nudity ends, you know. It's

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.861
fine. So I do that and then just for good
measure, Larry King-I always put Larry King

00:05:42.861 --> 00:05:45.200
over anything. So there was

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.930
that. I don't know if this was a picture that
kind of made me a Google pariah...

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.930
[audience laughing]

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.960
&gt;&gt;Weiss: And caused you to lock me out. But
I don't know, its food for thought for you

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.490
guys. I would love to kind of smooth this
over may be perhaps monetize you-monetize

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.850
with you again in the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.850
future.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.850
[audience laughing]

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.980
Weiss: Uh, you know, I think we can make this
work ethic we can salvage this I think working

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.710
together we can do this I'm just putting it
out there. So, okay but ah, you know and I

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.940
feel like I started off

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.900
on the wrong foot with you guys now and it's
awkward, but you know, let's let bygones be

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.390
bygones. Just gimme my account back. The money
that was in it, there was money in it, yo-

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.390
money there's

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.730
like, there was like hundreds of dollars in
there. Maybe one and a half hundred.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.730
[audience laughing]

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:34.500
Weiss: So. Okay anyway. So having done that,
having gotten that, cleared the air. Uh, this

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.300
is the slide show proper. And what I've done
with the slideshow is, if you're familiar

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.300
with my blog and you're

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.370
not just here 'cause you're cutting out of
work, umm, my blog I make fun of a lot of

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.910
people on the blog. You know, I poke fun at
everybody, and I do that not to offend anybody.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.690
I'm making fun of myself as

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.680
much as anybody else but I do it so we all
can laugh. But with the blog anonymously for

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.922
a long time and that's unfair you know it
doesn't let people get you back. So what I

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:02.922
wanted to do with the

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.750
slide show is give people the opportunity
to you know lay myself bare and let you laugh

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.510
at me as I've laughed at all of you. So that's
the slideshow, and I should add that my tour

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:14.510
and all of this is

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.940
brought to you by a company called Knog. Knog
is a manufacturer of cycling accessories and

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.580
lights among those lights are what are called
the Hipster Cysts. I don't know if anybody,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.580
I call them

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.740
Hipster Cysts. They are called Knog frogs;
they're little lights you put on your bike.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.260
That's my, I've put many Knogs on a bike there
so you can see what they are. So I want to

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.090
thank Knog for making this

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:43.180
possible. This is Michael Elliott from Knog
eating a chicken leg. That's-that's the inventor

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.280
of the Knog Hipster Cyst. So there you go.
Ah, okay.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:55.240
So this is me, early on, this is my first
real bicycle. Non-big wheel, non-tricycle,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.780
non-whatever. With the training wheels, uh
this is uh from the 1970s and that's how people

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.510
dressed in the 1970s.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.510
[audience laughing]

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.350
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Uhhh, and I had the streamers and
the whole thing. Then I got a little older

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:14.580
and I got my first BMX bike which was this
Schwinn Scrambler which came with Skyway tough

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.990
wheel two-mag

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.680
wheels which were really cool wheels at the
time. And that kind of got me into loving

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:27.300
BMX. This is still the 70s. Ah, this is Bayswater,
Far Rockaway in ah New York. If anybody knows

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.380
it. Um, that

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.440
that's where I lived at the time. And again,
I should say that these clothes are very trendy

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.400
now. This was how people dressed in the 70s
just normally. This is the clothing that was

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.400
available to us at

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.520
the time. Like the ringer tee. I think it
was the Nashville T-shirt I was wearing. You

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.360
would just wear things like that. It wasn't
a statement. It wasn't a whole thing. Now

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.150
that shirt in that size, an adult

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.140
would wear and pay like $200 for it.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.140
[audience laughing]

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.740
&gt;&gt;Weiss: its not-It wasn't like that. It was
a simpler time. All right. Next stage in my

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:07.300
evolution as a as a cyclist. Then I stepped
up to the uh, the Haro uh-uh bike, the Haro

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.670
BMX. I don't know if

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:15.940
anybody was into BMX back in the day as they
say. But Haros were pretty nice bikes, and

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:21.570
uh that's my brother Holden it down in the
background in the soccer jersey. Between the-you

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.570
didn't step to

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:28.700
us look at us you know and ah-uh, the socks,
it was normal to wear socks at knee-high height

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.840
like that. Regular thing to do. It was how
people wore their socks. They didn't, they

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.090
hadn't invented short

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:42.760
stocks yet. LeTigre, LeTigre tennis shirt.
Again very ironically trendy. I think there's

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.730
a band called LeTigre, no? Yes, in Williamsburg
or something? Back then, it was only a shirt

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.210
and it was just what you

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:58.190
wore. And ah valve, ah dice, valve-caps, that
was my first customization. I had the uh the

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.550
O.D.Y. White-mushroom grips, and the ah doughnuts,
which protected sort of the inside of your

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.550
hand. Very

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.550
important accessory uh, uh, still hadn't taken
off the reflectors though. It's a little embarrassing.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.550
[audience laughing]

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.570
Weiss: Okay, so then you get a little older,
you know, your body chemistry changes, and

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:22.750
I entered into kind of a sullen phase in my
life. And during this sullen phase, this is

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.110
how I looked, and I would

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:29.970
skulk around in doorways as you do, just kind
ah. Well, you did, you just kind of dress

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:33.640
a certain way, one at a certain face and you'd
find a cool doorway and you can lean in it,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640
and you'd be

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.050
you'd be kind of sullen. And that's a good
look for doing that. This look however, is

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.839
not a good look at the beach where it goes
horribly, horribly awry. Where the salt air

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.580
just enters the hair and it

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.770
just goes BAM! And it's-it's you know, not
a good look for the beach. Um.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.290
Then, then I started racing and all of that
stuff. So this is what I look like when I

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:04.650
was a lowly Cat 5 just starting to race, hadn't
discovered the bib shorts yet. I was still

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.940
wearing the half shorts.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:14.770
Ahhh, I was way too into having a Cannondale.
A Cannondale jersey and water bottle and bike.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.080
But that's the beginning, that's when I started
racing. It's before I kind of you know, before

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.080
you get

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.400
into team, and you have a kit and the whole
thing. And you think you're cool. But pasty

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:29.660
white legs, just been shaved, umm, and then
that my brother's 200 SX in the background

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.660
there. That's for sale

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.790
if anybody's interested.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:32.790
[audience laughing]

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.600
&gt;&gt;Weiss: I got that out of the parking lot,
uh, I'll take $200 for it. Uh, that that car

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.890
is on the scrap heap now. I'm sure that was
a while ago. Ahh, right that's my newborn

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.650
son. How did that get in there?

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.600
I don't know? He's three weeks old.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600
[audience clapping]

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.411
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Thank you. To Elliott... that's just
a gratuitous baby insertion shot. Thank you

00:11:55.411 --> 00:11:56.411
for that.

00:11:56.411 --> 00:12:02.120
Okay now I'd like to take a little detour...ummm
cycling in New York City. I write a lot about

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.270
cycling in New York City. Um, I don't know
how many of you have cycled in New York City.

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.500
I don't know where most of you guys live.
I mean I-I-I love

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.950
coming out here and riding even in the city
even in San Francisco I think it's very pleasant

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:19.870
place to ride. It's pretty chill. Um, ah.
New York is getting better and better but

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.870
it's pretty bad.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.420
So this um, I wrote an article in Outside
magazine a while ago about Portland. And in

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.800
it, I mentioned, this was last fall, I mentioned
just before leaving for Portland I got hit

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.089
by a car, uh, from behind. I

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:37.200
was just riding along, JRA, as they say in
the bike shops, and somebody just kind of

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.690
hit me from behind. And this is the woman
who hit me from behind and that's her maroon

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.220
Buick and this is the

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:51.360
picture I took as I just after I collected
myself off the pavement bloodied and limping

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.589
and I was like a limping towards her like
a like a zombie. You know, all scraped up

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:58.090
and she stood there just kind of

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.770
with her hands behind her back as you can
see just kind of curiously looking at this

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:10.060
bloodied, Lycra-clad guy kind of just limping
towards her, um, and ah that's her. And her

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.800
name and address are as

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800
follows.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800
[audience roaring laughter]

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.210
&gt;&gt;Weiss: So if you have anything that you'd
like to say, if you want to send her pizzas,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.890
you get bored on Friday night, if you have
any decaying organic matter you're not going

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:23.890
to composts, although

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:30.020
I'm sure all of you composts everything, but
anything smelly or horrific you want to send

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.140
her, please do. I couldn't find her number,
but I did I did use your your popular search

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.610
engine, um, to try to

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:45.000
learn more about her. And it turns out that
she shares a name with a Playmate of some

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
note.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[audience laughing]

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.390
&gt;&gt;Weiss: So, I didn't get hit by that Crystal
Harris; I got hit by this Crystal Harris.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:59.070
So after she hit me and after I dragged myself
over to her and she kind of- oh and I said,

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.070
"What happened? What did

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.290
you do there?" She just said, she said, "I
thought I could get around you." And that

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.520
was it. She thought she could get around me,
but she couldn't. And so there I was kind

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.520
of propped up against the

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.620
wall of a car wash waiting for the police
to come. And she was just highlighting something.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.990
She was just sitting there highlighting. I
don't know what it was. Umm, so that's it.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.230
So that was my view for

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.300
like a half hour before the cops came, and
lawyers would stop and try to solicit my business.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.320
&gt;&gt;Audience member: Oh my god!

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.510
&gt;&gt;Weiss: cat some guy in a really slick suit
stopped his Escalade and was like a you know,

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:35.060
"You may need a lawyer for this." I was like,
just keep keep rolling, keep going. I could've

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060
been looking at that

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.450
Crystal Harris for a half hour while I was
bleeding, but I was looking at this Crystal

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:47.330
Harris for a half hour while bleeding. So
that's just another day of cycling, in New

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:48.680
York City.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.810
So back to the blog, I used to write the blog
anonymously. This is an actual, this is how

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.330
I worked; I worked in the dark I was that
scared. Then I revealed myself, lights on

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.680
there I was laid bare. I

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.550
worked in the bathroom by the way. Umm. And
not everybody liked it when I when I became

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:11.080
unanonymous or whatever you call it. Like
I like, you know how the Internet is people

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.290
like the kind of flame

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.900
you and complain and say your sellout and
a shark jumper and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.990
So like typical chatter and this is Twitter
so you have to read from the bottom. So I'd

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.090
say this like, "Man this Bike

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:27.850
Snob guy is one self-promoting crazy Jew every
effing post more effing blah."

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.880
Then he could bet he reworked it. Then he's
like, "Man this Bike Snob guy is one self-promoting

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:37.170
mother-effer every effing post more effing
blah." Then he went from Jew to mother-effer

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.170
for some

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.050
reason. Then he recanted the whole thing right
there at the end. That came out really wrong.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.300
I'm sorry about that.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.300
[audience laughing loudly]

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:51.899
&gt;&gt;Weiss: I don't know, I don't know. But you
know it hasn't all been ah, ah insults and

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:57.530
complaints. I've had some, I've-I've-I've
had some, I'm very happy that people have

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.000
enjoyed the book and the blog

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.529
and have been very supportive. Uh, even people
in the world of cycling. Even, and you know

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:09.350
even ah former, even Tour de France Winners
have, have come out and supported me. One

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.350
in particular

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:14.300
really famous, Tour de France winner. I'm
sure all you know who he is...

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.430
[audience laughing]

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:22.710
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Good to have him in my corner. You
want a guy like Floyd in your corner. That's

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.450
him that's Photoshop by the way, that's not
real. That was a reader that sent me that.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.720
And by the way, Floyd,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:34.029
and I don't know how many of you saw-caught
him at his Google appearance, but he was here.

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:40.019
Did anyone see Floyd when he was here? Yep,
Floyd was here. So you know, that's kind of,

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.019
I watched

00:16:41.019 --> 00:16:44.959
that the other day as was like, that's kind
of funny. He really kind of laid it on there.

00:16:44.959 --> 00:16:47.240
&gt;&gt;Male from Audience: If you want a copy of
his book, I think I have one.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.490
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yes please, I would love one. Uh,
there you go. That's it that's my presentation

00:16:52.490 --> 00:17:04.130
thank you. Uh, ah golf claps all around. Okay,
thanks. Now um, ah, ah, if anyone has the

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.130
questions I would be

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.660
happy to answer them, and if anybody just
kind of wants to insult me, I'd be happy to

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.820
stand here and take it. Or anything in between.
Questions? Concerns? Yes.

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.329
&gt;&gt;Male #2: You're going to have to repeat
the question for me. Did you find it stressful

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:21.420
at all keeping yourself anonymous? Were you
afraid of getting found out, and how did that

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.959
impact you?

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:29.670
&gt;&gt;Weiss: ah, was I afraid of like repercussions
when I became an anonymous or...

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.500
&gt;&gt;Male #2: When you were anonymous comment
how paranoid were you about being anonymous?

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.960
&gt;&gt;Weiss: oh, I eh I wasn't really. How paranoid
was I about this staying anonymous when I

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:45.900
was anonymous? I don't know I was pretty,
I was pretty tight about it like I never really

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.900
told people only told

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.670
people close to me. Um, I just wanted to stay
anonymous, and um, but after a while it felt

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:57.620
kind of like ah, it felt gimmicky. And people
were finding out anyway, and then, then you

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.050
just kind of you

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:03.870
know, it would be embarrassing to be like
still anonymous now and thinking people think

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:08.450
you're anonymous and they see you. It's like
being naked and thinking nobody sees you.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.330
So, so, I dispensed with

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:16.880
it. Uh, any anything else? Yes, in the spinney-beanie
hat.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.740
&gt;&gt;Male #3: [inaudible]

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.840
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Oh, can you, I'm sorry, can you can
you speak into the microphone so that this

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.371
could be recorded for eternity in the annals
of YouTube another fine Google product.

00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:39.860
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Do you own…
[sound of hand tapping on microphone]

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.511
any bikes that can do bar spins?

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:48.540
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Ah, do I own any bar-spinnable bikes?
No, I don't think any of my bikes are bar-spinnable.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.480
Uh, if bar spins aren't familiar that's where
you kind of ride, you do like a wheelie and

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
you spin your

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.590
handle bars around. For some reason the youth
of America is just absolutely thrilled by

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.560
this. Ah, no, because they all have cables,
they all have brake cables on them so they

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.809
can't spin around. No, no

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:13.400
I'm thinking of getting one though. Anything
else? Questions? I'm taking, taking this as

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.020
a sign that my presentation was very thorough.

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.200
[audience laughing]

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.870
&gt;&gt;Weiss: No questions? Floyd's stories from
when he was here? No que-

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.090
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Are you doping?

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:29.022
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Am I doping?
[laughing]

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:33.470
Don't I,I-I-I, Don't I seem like I'm doping?
I'm on Adderall and cough medicine right now,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.860
I don't know what's happening. Ahhh. Yes.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:40.040
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Can you tell us what your favorite
kind of bike is?

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:47.420
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Favorite kind of bike. Uhhhh. It
depends on what I'm doing, I just like um,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:51.640
it depends on what I'm doing. My favorite
kind of riding is ah, well one of the things,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.550
I should say the reason I wrote the book,
uh and the book, uh, is a little different

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:02.140
from the blog and that I try to make it as
funny as the blog, uh but I also try to make

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:08.570
it a little more ah endearing maybe is the
right word. The kind of thing that sort of

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.730
explains why I love cycling instead of just
making fun of it, why I love this. Why I think

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.130
cycling's a great thing, and why it's brought
me a lot of a lot of joy and happiness and

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.740
all of that stuff and, and

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:22.360
that's because the thing that's great about
riding a bike is that you can have a lot of

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.110
fun doing it, you can do it purely recreationally,
you know you can race or you can do your long

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:27.110
rides on the

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.951
weekend but you can use it totally practically.
But you can enjoy that practical use you know

00:20:31.951 --> 00:20:35.480
you can enjoy your commute. You can sort of
weave it into your day. There is not a lot

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.650
of things you can

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:41.419
do that with. You know, so that's what I like
about it. So my favorites kind of bike, it

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:47.030
really depends. I love I have just a beat
up city bike that I use to get around town,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.970
and I love that bike. You know

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:55.490
I just love a bike that's completely useful
and absolutely not precious and that you can,

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:02.020
that just does its job. And ah um ah but you
know I love road bikes, mountain bikes, cycler-cross

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.140
bikes, ah all of it. Just not

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:10.110
recumbent those things scare me. Yes hi.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.760
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I'm curious about your blog as
a blog. You mention you had written for Outside

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.360
before. Is that before the blog? And when
you started the blog did you have the plan

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.360
to sort of keep it up at

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.980
the level you have or did it kind of grow?

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.330
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Ahh, no all the writing like for
Outside and I write a column for Bicycling

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.710
Magazine and I do some other writing like
that and this book, all of that came out of

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:35.270
the blog. So, um, and when I started the blog

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:39.961
I had absolutely no kind of grand design or
plan or anything like that. I wasn't even

00:21:39.961 --> 00:21:44.720
much of a blog reader. I just kind of, I've
always been a writer and I've always been

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.010
kind of in the publishing scene or

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:52.360
world or whatever you want to call it, but
I just I just started playing around with

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:57.040
blogger and started posting and just decided
to it every day, and I was really thrilled

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.970
and happy that people kept on.

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.850
So no, absolutely no plan or forethought really
or anything like that. Just really fortuitous.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:09.559
Questions or are you trying to slip out unseen.
Ah, yes.

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:14.870
&gt;&gt;Male #7: So, so, how many bike do you own
and how many bikes is too many? Like general

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:15.870
guidance.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.870
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Ahh, I own, I think I own six bikes.
So when you ride a lot and if you, I race

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.520
as well. I mean you know, you say you race
and some people think you're serious, good

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.059
rider and I'm not. When you

00:22:27.059 --> 00:22:30.510
race you wind up having a lot of bikes for
different kinds of races. So I think I have

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:35.520
six, but it sort of fluctuates. you sell bikes
to get new ones. So, I think I have six. I

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.821
think too many bikes is just if you

00:22:37.821 --> 00:22:42.309
have that bike you don't ever ride. You know
if you have that bike it's just kind of sitting

00:22:42.309 --> 00:22:45.970
around there and not getting used you have
too many bikes. But you know if you have 20

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:46.970
bikes and you ride

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.700
them all the time it's fine. You could have
one you could have 50. Yes.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:57.251
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Can you kind of describe how much
commitment it takes to keep bikesnob working?

00:22:57.251 --> 00:23:01.483
Like, how many hours a day? Or how much time
is involves?

00:23:01.483 --> 00:23:08.040
&gt;&gt;Weiss: How much commitment it takes? Um,
it definitely takes a lot of commitments because

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:17.740
when I started the blog I was working a full-time
job at a literary agency, and I

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:23.230
was dedicated. I published every day, every
weekday and I was very committed to that.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.870
As soon as I realized I had an audience, I
was very, very, very, very grateful for that

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:29.870
and I was determined to

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.820
keep my audience, my readers whatever you
want to call them, something every day and,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.170
and no matter what the costs. So it took a
lot of commitment because when you have a

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.170
full-time job and

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.490
you're writing a blog in the morning and sometimes
writing it on the company time or really most

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:48.960
of the time. You know, like your posting under
heavy fire. I get bosses yelling at me. I'm

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:49.960
going to get

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.880
this, if I get fired during the course of
posting this I'm fine with that. Because really

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:01.610
once I, once the blogs started going out with
committed 100%. So fire me, do whatever, I'm

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.240
going to do it. My

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:13.919
publisher could only send me to so many places.
My publisher and Knog. I'm a first-time author

00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:20.190
of a book about cycling so it's not like.
I'm lucky and grateful that my publisher was

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:21.490
able to send me to

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:30.650
any cities. No, seriously and and LA, I would
love to go LA to visit, and I plan to one

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:35.970
of these days and actually you read more and
more about LA, and how it's how much cycling

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:36.970
stuff is going on

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:43.860
there, and um, it's seriously something I
want to go experience. But unfortunately,

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.940
they were not on the tour.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:53.070
&gt;&gt;Male #9: So, actually have two questions.
Firstly, the best post you ever wrote was

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.860
the one where you described the little things
look for in people's bikes to see if they're

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.860
serious or not.
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.590
&gt;&gt;Male #9: --Like whether their sticker is
over the tire lines on the valve stem and

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.590
that kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.770
&gt;&gt;Male #9: --One notable omission was you
didn't describe looking for the ferrules on

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.480
the end of cables which I was

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.820
surprised that you missed. I always look for
that. I wanted to see if there's any other

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.549
things that you thought of since then. And
then the second question what's your least

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:12.790
favorite and most favorite

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.340
maintenance task on a bike?

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.809
My favorite and least favorite... I'll start
with that one. My favorite and least favorite

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:22.809
maintenance task, I think my least favorite
maintenance task on a bike is like anything

00:25:22.809 --> 00:25:23.809
involving the

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:29.110
drive train and cleaning there of or chain
removal and all of that especially because

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.370
I tend to neglect that stuff to begin with
so. If I have to touch my drive train, it's

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.919
like I was paddling around in

00:25:35.919 --> 00:25:41.419
the Gulf. It's like I'm and covered in black.
It's not good so I hate that.

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:47.660
I really really enjoy, I'm not very good at
it, ah but I really like building wheels.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:53.270
Like, I could build wheels all day long. Bad,
misshapen out- of-true wheels, but wheels.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.860
It's really it's like it's like knitting.

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.860
[audience laughing]

00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.500
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah. In terms of other nitpicky,
stuff on bikes that I notice like I don't

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.160
know there's so many things. The ferrules,
sometimes you don't use the ferrules. I don't

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.640
want to get into a whole ferrules

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.940
thing here, but sometimes you don't use the
ferrules. Fig.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:20.299
&gt;Fig: Thank you for being here. At first,
I think I was introduced to your blog with

00:26:20.299 --> 00:26:28.400
two posts which are incredible. First was
your bicycling editor's choice where you use

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.980
such colorful language as, "...

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:35.440
descends like a squirrel, a greased squirrel
in a luge and accelerates like a particle

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.950
in a particle accelerator, which itself is
itself a particle in a giant particle accelerator."

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:41.950
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.970
&gt;&gt;Fig: Bicycling magazines should actually
get you to write their um bike reviews. Anyways,

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:53.250
um, are there any posts that you enjoyed particularly
writing? Some it seems like you're really

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.289
inspired and completely

00:26:55.289 --> 00:26:57.380
on fire. Are there any that you remember just
loving like the "World's Greatest Madone".

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.460
Oh, my God, it was...

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.460
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:06.160
&gt;&gt;Fig: I went and showed my bike shop friends
and oh, man they get huge kicks out of it.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.330
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Thank you very much first of all,
it's hard it's hard to think of one, you know,

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:14.030
I mean obviously some are better than others.
And, and, that you know, they are just not

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.080
all going to be good,

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.790
but I-at least there's something everyday.
But, um, and that bicycling one is a favorite

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:28.590
of mine because I really had fun writing that
and that was definitely a moment and writing

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.590
the blog where I

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:34.929
know that post got forwarded around the lot
and I know it brought a new a lot of new readers

00:27:34.929 --> 00:27:40.100
to the to the blog and so, so it was fun to
write and it was great to see people enjoy

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.240
it. And people from

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.490
Bicycling saw it and liked it, and I think
it was after that that Bicycling first, like

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.130
in the very early days of my blog they did
a little profile of me. I think that is how

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:51.990
I got on their radar.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:57.590
Oh, another post that comes to mind is a post
I wrote about Michael Ball. The guy who was

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:02.789
the owner of Rock Racing which was kind of
like, they were like a wrestling team but

00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:03.850
for cycling. They were

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:10.530
like lots. He also owns a jeans company. Those
kinds of jeans with lots of wrinkles and stuff.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:17.120
Really expensive jeans. I wrote a post about
Michael, like from Michael Ball's perspective

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120
where he

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.840
like drew a wheel on a napkin and how he was
going to make this wheel. Its describing blog

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.410
posts is not the most amusing thing.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:26.410
[audience laughing]

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:27.540
&gt;&gt;Weiss: But that post I was very fond as
well.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.990
&gt;&gt;Fig: I'll have to hunt that one down.

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.990
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.620
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Two things: First of all, of an
LA native um, I'd like to warn you that most

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.260
people who see people on bikes look at them
funny and ask where's the engine?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.050
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Right.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.170
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Um, may not be the best, most
friendly city. Probably not nearly as bad

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:55.620
as New York, but um, and I am completely forgetting
the second thing that I would like to ask

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.620
you.
Laughing

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.620
[audience laughing]

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.570
&gt;&gt;Weiss: With regard to the, oh did you did
you remember? Or I was going to...

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:02.900
&gt;&gt;Male #10: I'll go to the back of the line
and ask whenever everyone is done.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.700
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Okay, with regard to the thing about
L.A. From where I'm sitting which is not in

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.210
L.A. I see more and more people and its younger
people obviously but a really like taking

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:13.210
pride in the fact that

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:17.700
they're are riding bikes and there's a real
emerging kind of commuting thing. Or at least

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:23.169
there appears to be in here from people in
LA all time say more and more people are riding

00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:24.280
and it's exploding and I

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:29.870
have to come there. So now, you're from L.A.
and I'm not, but I don't know maybe the last

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:37.320
few years it's gotten better or not. What's
her name? Anne Hathaway hit that guy on his

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.820
fixed gear a few

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.809
months ago. Do you remember that? It was unfortunate.
[audience laughing]

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:51.530
&gt;&gt;Male #10: the other thing that I was going
to ask was you may have seen in the blue conveyances

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.350
around the Google campuses. Would you care
to the critique them?

00:29:54.350 --> 00:30:00.090
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Ahh, no, I mean you know, I know
you have your whimsical colored bikes that

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:05.429
you kind of hop around and jump on and off.
It looks great. It makes sense. Yeah, everything

00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:06.429
is very cutesy

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:13.460
colored around here. so it's like M&amp;M land
is very nice, it's charming. It's wonderful.

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:19.880
It's cool that you got bikes around here.
You should use Penny-farthings though. They're

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.740
more sustainable too. They

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.390
don't use chains and lubricants.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:31.440
&gt;&gt;Male #11: So for your personal bikes, what's
your most favorite thing to customize. Some

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.350
people might handlebars some people prefer
shifters, wheels what's the part of your bikes

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.450
that you get most

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.460
obsessed with.

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:45.970
&gt;&gt;Weiss: I don't customized bikes. I-I am
very very ah, ah, kind of minimalist in that

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.950
since when it comes to bikes. I really enjoy
putting them together and putting in doing

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:51.890
the work on them like I said I

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:58.360
liked building wheels, collecting all that
kind of stuff. I don't do anything on the

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.660
bikes just how to make them look a certain
way. I don't get really excited about the

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:06.670
way the bike looks particularly. You

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:12.429
know I want it to look, I don't want it to
have all those weird colors like a Google

00:31:12.429 --> 00:31:18.880
bike or something. But I just like it to be
kind of no-nonsense but I enjoy bike the process

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.130
I enjoy like is the wheels.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:26.520
It's fun to wrap art tape. You feel good when
you knew when you do a nice job, when everything

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.420
looks tidy. I'm tidy, except for the drive
train which is filthy.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.919
&gt;&gt;Male #11: And so second question would be
one of the things, I like your posts, and

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:36.669
if I don't have a chance to read it, I always
go out and look at the images. Ah, could you

00:31:36.669 --> 00:31:39.530
comment on maybe three

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.090
or four the most favorite images you've ever
posted.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:48.090
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Most definitely the Lone Wolf image
is, a lot of people it has resonated with

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:53.330
a lot of people and again describing blog
posts is not the most entertaining thing ever.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.590
I'll wish I had a slide of him,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:32:02.419
but he's kind of a character in LA by the
way who rides around on a on a on a on a fared

00:32:02.419 --> 00:32:09.660
mountain bike thing with like 18 bottles of
water kind of coming off the seat posts. He's

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.230
very is a compelling

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:16.730
character, the Lone Wolf. There's a something
called the world's greatest Madone. Which

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:22.090
is a Trek bicycle. It's like a full on race
bike with carbon wheels but the guy kind of

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.570
flap bars and a rack on it. And

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:30.090
turned it in- it's like $9,000 townie bike
so it's insane. So that by that was a great

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:36.330
picture. But those are two pictures that people
have sent me. That came from people. I another

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:37.330
one of the great

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.190
things about writing the blog is that you
hear from people all the time and people send

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:42.980
you great pictures like that. So, those of
the standout moments and of course the woman

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.580
with the turtle. That I

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:47.529
showed earlier. But that got me a little hot
water.

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:53.240
&gt;&gt;Female #1: so living in San Francisco, biker's
rights are obviously a huge issue and ends

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.690
by month your article in Outside magazine
I thought it was awesome. But along the stream

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.380
sort of wanted to

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:08.520
get your take on your travels what cities
you've seen that had some of the better improvements

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.804
or some of the better bike, more bikable improvements.

00:33:11.804 --> 00:33:19.110
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Better, cycling experiences? Every
time I've come to this area to Northern California

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:24.970
I absolutely love it I really like this area
and um I'm arriving in San Francisco is a

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.400
real pleasure and riding up

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:32.870
over the bridge and around there it's great
ah. And going to Portland as well. Portland

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:38.630
was ah, just in terms of riding and you know
all the hype is about Portland being so bike

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.350
friendly but a lot of it's

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.970
legitimate and that it's very, very easy to
ride your bike there in the city for transportation.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:49.990
Yet you can duck out in five minutes out of
downtown you're in Forest Park and, and on

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.990
unpaved roads

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.800
through the ferns or whatever kind of plants
they are. Portland's a great place to ride,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:02.260
it's great. But you know New York's great
too. It's a lot better than people think.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:07.091
&gt;&gt;Male #12: So about how much e-mail to you
give every day in response to blog.

00:34:07.091 --> 00:34:13.589
&gt;&gt;Weiss: It's hard to quantify. I don't count
it exactly. It's, it's, it's I mean it's not

00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:19.169
like stupendous, but it's more than I can
really take in. You know, unfortunately there's

00:34:19.169 --> 00:34:22.710
a lot of stuff uh, I don't get to

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:31.270
read because it's a lot of e-mail lets them
I get some good e-mails with business proposals

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:36.070
that I'm always sure to respond to. The Nigerian
ones and all that. Those are always welcome

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.070
and have done

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.879
well for myself with those, but ah, yeah,
a decent amount.

00:34:40.879 --> 00:34:46.450
&gt;&gt;Male #12: And second question in the book
you say when a when you're angry to melt cheese

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:49.980
with your eyes I was wondering what kind of
cheese are we talking about? Are we talking

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.900
about a cheddar or we talking about like a
wheel--

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:56.010
&gt;&gt;Weiss: now I could melt melt pecorino, I
could melt pecorino. I melted the whole wheel

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.270
of cheese when you guys canceled my Ad Sense.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.970
[audience laughing]

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:07.250
&gt;&gt;Weiss: and I grated some cheese, too. Yes.
Hi.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:15.360
&gt;&gt;Male #13: I was just curious was that your
first kid that we saw? And so have you, what

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.760
you think, what are your thoughts on kids
on bikes or riding with babies on bikes? What

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.480
kind of bikes would

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.290
you modify to attach the baby to?

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:29.200
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Oh yeah, a means to be a while before
he you know next, their necks don't work so

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.680
you can't even think about it. Although I
know somebody claims that he used to carry

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680
his baby in his

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.960
messenger bag. But I'm not doing that so I
don't know. Uh this Surly, the company Surly

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.720
lent me one of their big dummy cargo bikes.
And if ah, I intend to give it back to them

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.070
until they make me. But

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:51.711
that would be a good baby bike when he's old
enough and can keep his head up. You know

00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:56.070
that seat on the back there and do the whole
thing, yeah.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:04.470
&gt;&gt;Male #14: You don't seem to be a real big
fan of charity cycling events, ah at least

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.950
that's what I've gathered from the blog, and
ah, I was hoping maybe you could just speak

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:09.930
to that a little bit. One of the

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.580
ah on the one hand you could say it brings
a lot of people into cycling and wouldn't

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.670
do it unless it was a friend or race down
to LA or something but you seem to have kind

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.920
of the opposite view.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:28.760
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Oh no, I haven't no, big fan of charity
rides. If I make fun of charity rides on my

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.310
blog it's usually because you have the person
on the charity ride who thinks it's a race

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:35.070
and takes it really

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.540
seriously and is at the front. So that's when
I'm making fun of it. To people that come

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.040
to come at it who like you said, it brings
a lot of people to cycling it introduces us

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:46.040
to get to them. And then you have

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.200
people like that. And then you have the guy
who's got the full-on carbon bike and he's

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.940
got the kit on that he's got the bushy, hairy
legs and like he's gonna throw-down at the

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.710
charity ride. That's what I'm making

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:05.320
fun of you know. The guy who's not that hasn't-
you want to be competitive? Step it up. [laughing]

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.820
&gt;&gt;Male # 13: Ok, thanks.

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.250
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Speaking of hairy legs—

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.561
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Male #14: and I want to talk about that

00:37:14.561 --> 00:37:20.300
for a minute. So is it, I have hairy legs.
Is there anything I can do to offset the discrimination

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.350
from that or am I only making it worse?

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.350
&gt;&gt;Weiss: You could shave your legs.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.589
[audience laughing]

00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:29.530
&gt;&gt;Weiss: No, I don't know. I just threw that
hairy-legged reference in there I think it's

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:35.480
weirder to shave your legs. I mean it's kind
of silly thing to do. No, where that hair

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.480
with pride.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.550
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Do you think it looks worse to
have everything together except the legs?

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.180
Like maybe if you toned it down it may actually
look better?

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.520
&gt;&gt;Weiss: To tone what down? The rest of the
wardrobe?

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.650
&gt;&gt;Male #14: You have the rest of the kit and
the bike and you've got everything but you've

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.500
got the hairy legs. Is that better or is it
better to--

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.710
&gt;&gt;Weiss: I don't want to get too into the
hair that like if you have crazy wild, pelty

00:37:53.710 --> 00:38:02.280
hair and then you wear a kit, sometimes it's
just you know. It's a jarring contrasts. You

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.170
know you get the kind of Lycra and then poof.
[audience laughter]

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:16.880
So then you might, you know, but you otherwise
a little hair is fine. You know, hair is hair.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.820
Any other questions hair or not hair related...
going once... going twice... and what?

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.099
&gt;&gt;Audience member: [inaudible]

00:38:25.099 --> 00:38:29.961
&gt;&gt;Weiss: [laughing] And that's it.

00:38:29.961 --> 00:38:33.460
[applause]

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:40.460
&gt;&gt;Weiss: Ok.
