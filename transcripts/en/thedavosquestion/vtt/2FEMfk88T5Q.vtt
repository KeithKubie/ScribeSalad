00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; I think it's a difficult question to answer
yes or no.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.290
I think that um, the question is more about
 -- it's not necessarily

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.490
about whether a specific country or specific
solution will be found to

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.400
pull the world out of it's global economic
crisis.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.430
I think the question is more about identifying
an area or a theme.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.200
We're involved a lot in renewable energy and
energy efficiency projects

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.330
in China.
And I think that there is an awful a lot of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.719
opportunity for growth in
the commercial components of transfer of technology

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.880
and I think that if
we can inspire technology transfer and then

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.350
have the correlation -- the
correlative effects much growth involved in

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.570
the overseas countries
where the energy or the technologies is actually

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.070
being developed, as
well as the growth of the technology production

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.210
in China, and I think
that if we can grow that, then it will help

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.609
to pull the world out of
it's economic crisis.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.679
So I think there's been lots of discussion
about a green revolution and

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.949
a green revolution is not just about saving
the environment, it's also

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.940
about economic opportunity.
And I hope, I very much hope, that the world

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.760
begins to see that and
people and particularly countries and commercial

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.380
industry begins to
take advantage of it.
