00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:01.930
You did it New Horizons!

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.060
It took 9 and a half years but you made it
all the way to Pluto!

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.379
No, wait, where are you going???

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:14.039
Hey explorers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.779
NASA’s New Horizons space probe passed Pluto
in July of 2015 and with that, completed its

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.119
primary objective.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.740
So now what?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.140
Well you’ve got a 700 million dollar space
probe that still works and it’s whizzing

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
through an area of our solar system we don’t
know much about called the Kuiper belt.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.119
Might as well do some bonus science while
it’s there right?

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.540
And that’s exactly the plan.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.120
New Horizons will fly by a Kuiper Belt Object
named 2014 MU69 to study the ancient space

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.930
rock in more detail than would ever be possible
from Earth.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.039
It could teach us more about the Kuiper Belt,
or the origins of our solar system.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.690
But we’ll have to wait a little bit for
the groundbreaking data, as New Horizons won’t

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.309
reach it until January 2019, a full 13 years
after the probe was launched.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.420
But this long lifespan is pretty run of the
mill for NASA spacecraft.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.040
In fact, they’ve repeatedly launched probes
that have worked for more than a decade.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.410
The pioneer missions had extremely long life.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.330
Pioneer 6 was launched in 1965 and it’s
possibly still working.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.050
We haven’t tried to contact it since December
of 2000, just waking it up briefly to wish

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.910
it a happy 35th birthday.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.040
Pioneer 10 lasted 30 years before contact
was ultimately lost in 2003.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.520
It was still sending signals from the edge
of the solar system 6 years after its planned

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.320
mission end, and technically it could still
be useful to humanity.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.300
Pioneer 10 and 11 were the first probes to
escape the solar system, so they have on board

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.840
the famous map to earth and depictions of
the human form in case they were picked up

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.950
by intelligent life.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.140
That’s right, given our first chance to
contact aliens we sent them nudes and directions

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.140
to our house.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.870
Good to see nothing’s changed.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.000
NASA’s longest lasting missions are Voyagers
1 and 2.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.750
Voyager 1 is farther away but Voyager 2 was
actually launched first, almost 39 years ago.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.390
The reason these spacecraft can outlive their
expected mission time is because they’re

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.900
over engineered, rigorously planned, and sometimes
a little lucky.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.850
Pioneer 6 was equipped with a backup transmitter
that came in handy when the first failed after

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520
30 years of use.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.070
New Horizons can check out Kuiper Belt objects
because it was launched with extra fuel on

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.070
board.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.240
The target selected was ultimately chosen
because it would use the least amount of fuel

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.240
to get there.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.680
The paths the Voyager probes took were narrowed
down from 10,000 possible trajectories.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.129
That is the definition of rigorously planned.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.070
And we can still hear back from them because
advancements in receiver technology let us

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.909
pick up their transmissions, even though they’re
a billionth of a billionth of a watt by the

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:21.909
time they reach us.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.069
For the Voyager spacecraft one of the hardest
challenges to overcome now is the fact that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.629
most of the original engineers are retired,
or even deceased.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.709
The probes have outlived their creators, and
still NASA expects them to work for another

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:34.709
decade

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.319
And it’s not just space probes that are
outlasting expectations.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.599
The Mars rovers are doing surprisingly well.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.489
Opportunity, which landed on mars 12 years
ago, is still on the Red Planet grinding up

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.719
rocks for science.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:49.249
The plucky solar powered bot has stayed alive
almost 48 times the length of its warranty

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.040
thanks to smart placement that kept it in
the sun during winter.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.569
See, these NASA guys are smart!

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.079
It’s sister rover, Spirit, perished when
it got stuck in soft soil in 2009 and a shadow

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.189
crept over it.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.319
So to recap, is dead, and they’re making
the most of Opportunity.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.620
NASA is great at squeezing as much life out
of their missions as possible.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.920
They even come up with clever ways to learn
things from a mission’s death.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.859
To learn why NASA would intentionally crash
a satellite into the moon, check out Trace’s

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:31.829
video here,

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.689
Of course all these probes are unmanned, but
one day maybe they won’t be.

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.120
Could you make it 40 years alone in space
if it meant taking humanity to a new frontier?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.329
