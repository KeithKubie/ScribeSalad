obstacles to contracting and how they

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:43.420
obstacles to contracting and how they
 

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.820
obstacles to contracting and how they

of problems in buying stuff okay you
 

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.130
of problems in buying stuff okay you
know one of them is the ignorant buyer

to this problem or you can create what's
 

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.750
to this problem or you can create what's
called a mission contract a very large

general contract and as you learn what

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:42.670
general contract and as you learn what
 

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.330
general contract and as you learn what
you need you write specific task orders

you need you write specific task orders
 

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.970
you need you write specific task orders
against the contract or you can try a

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:47.980
against the contract or you can try a
 

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.820

may be a few competing projects to learn

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:53.380
may be a few competing projects to learn
 

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.080
may be a few competing projects to learn
to try to figure out what do we need to

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:55.090
to try to figure out what do we need to
 

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.100
to try to figure out what do we need to
buy here okay so those are ways around

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:58.110
buy here okay so those are ways around
 

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:03.510
buy here okay so those are ways around
that particular problem sometimes you

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:03.520
that particular problem sometimes you
 

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.520
that particular problem sometimes you
have cumbersome contracting procedures

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:05.530
have cumbersome contracting procedures
 

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.680
have cumbersome contracting procedures
where it takes a long time to buy

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:07.690
where it takes a long time to buy
 

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.990
where it takes a long time to buy
something and so sometimes what you have

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000
something and so sometimes what you have
 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.870
something and so sometimes what you have
to do is use an existing contract and

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880
to do is use an existing contract and
 

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.380
to do is use an existing contract and
try to squeeze your purchase into that

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:15.390
try to squeeze your purchase into that
 

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.730
try to squeeze your purchase into that
of course I'm what you could do is work

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:17.740
of course I'm what you could do is work
 

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.069
of course I'm what you could do is work
to streamline the procedure

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079
to streamline the procedure
 

00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:21.659
to streamline the procedure
try to figure out a more effective way

00:13:21.659 --> 00:13:21.669
try to figure out a more effective way
 

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:24.629
try to figure out a more effective way
to buy but very often you find it even

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639
to buy but very often you find it even
 

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:28.579
to buy but very often you find it even
buying something can be very difficult

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:28.589
buying something can be very difficult
 

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:31.049
buying something can be very difficult
sometimes you find that you put

00:13:31.049 --> 00:13:31.059
sometimes you find that you put
 

00:13:31.059 --> 00:13:33.139
sometimes you find that you put
something out for bid and nobody bids

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:33.149
something out for bid and nobody bids
 

00:13:33.149 --> 00:13:38.489
something out for bid and nobody bids
okay or only one company bids and if

00:13:38.489 --> 00:13:38.499
okay or only one company bids and if
 

00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:40.169
okay or only one company bids and if
only one company bids then you've got a

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:40.179
only one company bids then you've got a
 

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:42.899
only one company bids then you've got a
monopoly situation and that may tell you

00:13:42.899 --> 00:13:42.909
monopoly situation and that may tell you
 

00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:45.269
monopoly situation and that may tell you
that this particular service should not

00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279
that this particular service should not
 

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:48.359
that this particular service should not
be contracted out because there aren't

00:13:48.359 --> 00:13:48.369
be contracted out because there aren't
 

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.969
be contracted out because there aren't
enough bidders for you to really get a

00:13:50.969 --> 00:13:50.979
enough bidders for you to really get a
 

00:13:50.979 --> 00:13:53.459
enough bidders for you to really get a
good price there is no competition it's

00:13:53.459 --> 00:13:53.469
good price there is no competition it's
 

00:13:53.469 --> 00:13:56.009
good price there is no competition it's
too specialized and maybe you need to

00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:56.019
too specialized and maybe you need to
 

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:58.319
too specialized and maybe you need to
figure out a different way of getting

00:13:58.319 --> 00:13:58.329
figure out a different way of getting
 

00:13:58.329 --> 00:14:00.419
figure out a different way of getting
that service provided maybe you have to

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:00.429
that service provided maybe you have to
 

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:02.279
that service provided maybe you have to
develop your own capacity in house

00:14:02.279 --> 00:14:02.289
develop your own capacity in house
 

00:14:02.289 --> 00:14:04.529
develop your own capacity in house
because you really can't buy it and

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:04.539
because you really can't buy it and
 

00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:06.959
because you really can't buy it and
you'll often see that with new

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:06.969
you'll often see that with new
 

00:14:06.969 --> 00:14:08.939
you'll often see that with new
technologies where there isn't anybody

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:08.949
technologies where there isn't anybody
 

00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:11.249

available to do that a lot of the issues

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:11.259
available to do that a lot of the issues
 

00:14:11.259 --> 00:14:13.589
available to do that a lot of the issues
around a green building and solar

00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:13.599
around a green building and solar
 

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:16.679
around a green building and solar
technology is a shortage of installers

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:16.689
technology is a shortage of installers

technology is a shortage of installers
of people that know how to do that work

00:14:18.539 --> 00:14:18.549
of people that know how to do that work
 

00:14:18.549 --> 00:14:20.549
of people that know how to do that work
and so sometimes if you need it you

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:20.559
and so sometimes if you need it you
 

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.769
and so sometimes if you need it you
actually have to send somebody to school

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:22.779
actually have to send somebody to school
 

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.619
actually have to send somebody to school
to figure out how to make it happen

00:14:24.619 --> 00:14:24.629
to figure out how to make it happen
 

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.239
to figure out how to make it happen
another obstacle is poor communication

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:27.249
another obstacle is poor communication

contractor is performing or not so you
 

00:24:17.919 --> 00:24:20.279
contractor is performing or not so you
have to specify this in the contract you
