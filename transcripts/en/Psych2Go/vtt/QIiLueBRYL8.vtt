00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
As the main characters writing our own stories,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.680
we often feel like we're heroes combating everyday life events.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.200
But one wrong turn or move and you can end up as the villain.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.080
Sometimes we can repeat hurtful behavior without meaning to. It doesn't mean you're a bad person, just human.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.320
But self-awareness helps you get better.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.280
Feeling like the mean spider bit you?

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.660
Here are seven surprising signs you're becoming toxic.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.620
One: You can't seem to maintain relationships.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.220
Ever wonder why your relationships always end up in the dumps?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.980
It might have to do with toxic partners, or it might have to do with you.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.260
Toxic relationships aren't always necessarily manipulative, controlling, and abusive.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.360
Sometimes they stem from over-analysis.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.880
Studies show that individuals with low self-esteem are more likely to expect rejection from their partner,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.740
and avoid telling their partner how they truly feel.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.380
In this case, self-fulfilling prophecies win.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.080
The more afraid you are that the relationship will fail, the more likely it will.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.200
Two: You can't fully trust your friends and you drain them out.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.600
Do you feel like you have more enemies than friends, or worse, are your friends just enemies in disguise?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.380
Behavioral scientist Clarissa Silva says,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.520
We are supposed to be a better version of ourselves in our relationships, and support each other's goals,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.480
but when you're too busy making everything a competition...

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.040
No one wants to keep up with that attitude.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.920
Instead, Silva states, You'll begin to drain people out rather than energizing them.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
On top of that, with your obsession on surpassing them,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.540
you'll forget to provide the emotional support that your friends need.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.580
Three: You apologize once in a blue moon.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.300
Psychologists Abigail Brenner says that toxic people often claim the victim card,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.000
meaning that they seldom ever take accountability for their own actions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.160
When you have a hard time swallowing your pride and apologizing, this can truly sabotage your relationships.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.880
In fact, researchers discovered that there are many benefits to the art of apologizing,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.100
such as stress relief and rekindling friendships.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.700
When you don't say you're sorry, you miss out on understanding how you might have hurt someone.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.460
It isn't too late now to say sorry.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.580
Four: Drama follows you everywhere.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.040
Do you have a habit of breaking promises or leaving others hanging?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.080
Consistency is important, but when it isn't, serious consequences follow.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.520
According to psychologist Perpetua Neo,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.460
bringing drama to the table, such as spreading rumors and starting fights, is a big red flag you're becoming toxic.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.220
Is telling a grandiose story really more important than your friend's feelings?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.800
Five: You're addicted to social media.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
This is different from tuning in to the Psych-2-Go channel to watch our new uploads.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.060
Who doesn't appreciate many likes on Facebook and Instagram?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.780
But when your self-image becomes a bigger priority than staying present,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.800
that can lead to a bigger problem.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:00.120
Dr. Sadie Letterelder says that letting technology get the best of you can make you accidentally be the toxic one in your relationship.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.860
When you rely on an audience for validation, you also rely on social media for ego boosts.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.320
This may cause others to resent you for having your eyes glued to your phone, rather than on them.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.900
Six: You talk about people behind their backs.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.160
High school drama sucks. And if you constantly talk about people behind their backs,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.940
it'll feel like you never left, even when you graduated.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.400
You might think you're avoiding conflict when you complain on the down-low,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.480
but passive-aggressive behavior becomes a gateway to becoming toxic.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.180
When you can't openly share your opinions with others in a healthy fashion,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.300
it only hurts them in the long run.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.360
Even if you never meant to cause harm in the first place, people always have a way of finding out the truth.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.680
Seven: You shut others out when their opinions differ from yours.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.980
Dr. Brenner says that being judgmental is a common characteristic toxic people possess.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.820
When you dominate the conversation and shut others out for having different thoughts,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.900
you end up marginalizing them.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.500
Not acknowledging another side of the argument doesn't make you right.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.860
It just makes you close-minded.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.460
Do you admit that you're becoming toxic, or knows someone who relates to these signs?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.960
