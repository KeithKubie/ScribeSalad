- [Mark] I first got interested in lice
many years ago when my now 25-year-old son

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.800
was in elementary school and he came home
with one of those fliers saying that one

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.730
of the kids in his class had genital lice
and what sorts of things parents should be

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.830
on the lookout for. Also included was a
flier with a bunch of what I refer to as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.100
fun facts about human lice that I didn't
know about. These includes the facts that

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.090
our lice only parasitize humans. They
don't live on cats or dogs or your other

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.470
pets. You don't have to worry about
picking it up from them or transferring

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.460
them to your pets. In other words, this
means they're obligate parasite of humans.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.310
They can only live on human hosts.
Secondly, they can't survive more than

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.410
about 24 hours away from the human body.
That means they can't take up residence in

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.410
your bedding or your clothing or except,
you know, be infected from that source. I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.900
thought, well if this is true, then what
that means is that the spread of lice

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.160
around the world must have been
accomplished by the spread of humans

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.310
around the world. And since human
migrations is something that I'm

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.170
interested in, that maybe by studying
lice, we can learn something more about

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.980
human migrations. Then, a few years later
when I actually had time to start looking

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.720
into this in more detail, I found out that
was actually potentially even more

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.540
interesting because us humans, we like to
think about what and look into what makes

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.440
us special, what makes us different from
other creatures. One of the things that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.800
makes us unique, as far as I know, in the
animal world, is that we were the only

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.730
species parasitized by three different
types of lice. Lice are ubiquitous. All

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.600
mammals have lice, birds have lice, fish
have lice, but we alone have three

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.950
different types of lice. Two of these,
that I'll talk about, start out, and then

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.960
mention the third one later, are the head
louse, pediculus capitis, and the body

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.070
louse, pediculus humanus, or sometimes
also classified as a subspecies of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.400
pediculus capitis. As you can see,
morphologically, they look quite similar.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.450
What actually differentiates them is their
ecology. The head louse, as the name

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.680
suggests, lives and feeds exclusively on
the human scalp. Body louse feeds on the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.620
body but actually lives in the clothing
and lays its eggs in clothing. Now you ask

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.600
yourself, how would this difference come
about? Why would we have two different

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.320
kinds of lice that do these two different
things? The answer that seems to make the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.190
most sense is that this ecological
difference between head and body louse

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.750
probably arose when clothing became
important in human evolution. Then, it

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.470
became available as a new niche, a new
ecological niche that lice can move into

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.260
and start exploiting and start adapting
to. It evolved to become body lice. If

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.130
that's true, if you buy that, what we can
do is use a molecular clock approach and

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.050
we can date the origin of body lice, the
divergence between head and body lice. By

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.700
inference, that tells us when clothing
became important in human evolution. Will

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.140
we need to do the molecular clock? Well
the molecular clock is a long-standing

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.410
idea in evolutionary genetics and it goes
back to the idea that the rate of

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.520
evolution, the rate of change of DNA
sequences is approximately constant over

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.060
time. This idea is supported by a good
deal of observation. You take pairs of

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.360
species where you have some idea when they
diverge from fossil to bio-geographic

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.190
evidence, you measure the amount of DNA
divergence between them and you plot that,

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.320
and you see very strong and astonishingly
close correlation between how much

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.840
divergence there is in DNA sequences and
how long ago those two species last shared

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.350
a common ancestor. It's also supported by
theory, but I'll skip over the gory

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.350
details of that. So what do we need in
order to use a molecular clock approach?

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.590
Well, we need a calibration point. We need
to know how fast the clock is ticking. We

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.570
need to know what is the rate of change in
our DNA sequences. What we did, in order

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.860
to do this, is we assume that when
chimpanzees and humans diverged, chimps

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.190
being the the closest living relative of
humans, so did their lice.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.890
The idea that when hosts diverge, their
parasites also diverge is this

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.800
co-evolution between host and parasites. A
long standing observation biology. There

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.540
are certainly many exceptions to it, but
by and large, it is the rule. When host

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.960
speciate so do their spare parasites. We
therefore, can get an idea of how fast the

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.400
clock is ticking, if we can take
chimpanzee lice, compare them to human

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.200
lice, measure their DNA differentiation,
and we assume that differentiation

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.340
occurred about six million years ago.
Well, that then gives us our calibration,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.070
that tells us how fast the clock is
ticking. In addition to do this work, we

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.830
need our lice samples. We got head lice
and body lice from all different sources

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.360
around the world. Not everyone was pleased
to hear from us and sometimes, we got

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.780
rather indignant responses about how dare
we suggest they might have lice at their

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.930
facility. But nonetheless, we got a good
worldwide sample of lice. We also got

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.310
chimpanzee lice, pediculus schaeffi from
the chimp sanctuary in Uganda. What is

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.320
also very important, since we have no clue
as to what these things are actually

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.950
supposed to look like, we had a local
expert examine them and confirm that the

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.400
identifications are indeed correct. Then,
what we did was we obtained DNA sequences

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.270
from these lice. We obtained two
mitochondrial DNA gene sequences which

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.740
gave the same results when analyzed
separately so we combine them, analyze

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.240
them together. Also, just to make sure
that there wasn't something strange about

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.600
the mitochondrial DNA, we obtained and
analyzed sequences of two nuclear genes.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.340
Then, we did a couple of sanity checks to
make sure that the results we were

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.070
getting, they're corresponding to what we
might expect. One who things we looked at

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:51.070
was a genetic diversity in the African
lice versus the non-African lice. What you

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.610
can see is that all of these genes have
different amounts of diversity which is

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.300
what we always observe because the amount
of diversity in a gene is a reflection of

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.540
the functional constraints on that gene,
but what we also see is that for each

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.910
gene, there's more diversity in the
African lice than in the non-African lice.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.270
Greater diversity implies that's where the
source is, that's where the origin is

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.640
because you had the most time, you
accumulate the most diversity. That's good

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.990
because what this indicates is that
greater diversity in African lice implies

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.610
an African origin of human lice. And since
that's where we think humans arose, that's

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.520
a good sanity check. The other check we
did on this is to compare the head lice

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.900
and the body lice. Again, you can see for
each of these three genes more diversity

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.710
in the head lice than in the body lice.
That fits with the scenario I told you

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:44.270
about that body lice are more recent in
origin than the head lice. They've had

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.430
less time to accumulate diversity. Now we
can do a phylogenetic analysis, putting

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.950
together all of these lice sequences using
the chimpanzee louse as an outgroup. The

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.160
Hs are the head lice, the Bs are the body
lice, the numbers in parenthesis are the

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.720
numbers of individual lice that had that
particular sequence. When we apply the

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.040
molecular clock approach, we see that the
clay here that contains all of the body

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.400
lice sequences as well as some of the head
lice sequences has an age of about 70,000

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.990
years ago, give or take, a few tens of
thousands of years. What we can also see

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.180
in this tree is that there is a particular
clay there which contains all of the body

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.520
lice as well as some of the head lice
sequences which has lots and lots of

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.680
little short branches. And that's a
signature of a population expansion. But

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.490
we also see in this analysis is evidence
for a population expansion occurring in

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:42.260
lice around this time. The conclusion we
came up with, from the study, is that body

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.080
lice arose about 70,000 years ago, which
then implies that that's when clothing

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.970
became important in human evolution,
provided the niche for the body lice to

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.780
start diverging. Now, how does this
compare to archaeological evidence

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.450
concerning the origin of clothing? Well,
clothing itself doesn't fossilize, so what

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.050
we have to do is rely on indirect
evidence.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:07.790
If we look at the indirect evidence, stone
tools and bone tools, that would be

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.940
unequivocally associated with clothing;
things, like needles for example. Those

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.060
are on the order of about 40,000 years old
at the most. Now, there are certainly

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.640
other tools around like scrapers that
potentially could have been used to

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.670
prepare hides for clothing by scraping
them off, but they also could be used for

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.950
other purposes. We don't really know for
sure what all they were being used for.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:33.210
The overall conclusion is if we look at
the archaeological evidence, it does not

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.120
contradict a fairly recent origin of
clothing, only about on the order of

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.330
70,000 years ago or so. To summarize the
results of this study, we see that body

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.770
lice originated from head lice, again
70,000 years ago or so. We see that

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.260
there's also population expansion that
occurred in lice at right around this

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.740
time. While this is all very speculative,
what is very tempting to try to relate

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.410
this to is the expansion of modern humans
out of Africa which is been dating

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.870
directly in DNA evidence in humans to be
between 50 and 100 thousand years ago.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.290
Both suggest that perhaps is when humans
expanded out of Africa, began growing in

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:13.980
size, developed clothing and that this
clothing became available as a niche for

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:21.720
the origin of the body lice. What about
Neanderthals? Whenever you work with

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.000
modern humans, sooner or later, someone
will ask you, “Well what about

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.640
Neanderthals?” What does this tell us
about Neanderthals and other archaic

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.140
humans? Did they have clothing? Well, this
is what we think are the evolutionary

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.370
relationships of modern humans and
neanderthals. They shared a common

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:42.980
ancestor 600,000 years ago, give or take a
few tens of thousands of years. Clothing,

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.880
if we believe the lice results, originated
sometime here around the dispersion of

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:52.200
modern humans out of Africa. This would
suggest one of two possibilities for

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.250
Neanderthals. Either they did not have
clothing, or if they did have clothing

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.000
they invented it independently of modern
humans.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.550
In other words, they did not inherit
clothing from a common ancestor of

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:11.500
Neanderthals and modern humans. Now,
there's nothing in what we can infer from

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.820
the cognitive abilities of Neanderthals,
based on the archaeological record and so

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.330
forth, that would suggest that they were
just too stupid to come up with the idea

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.270
of clothing, right? Certainly, quite
feasible, they would have come up with the

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:28.500
idea of clothing on their own, invented it
independently from modern humans. It

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.260
certainly is the case that if you look at
reconstruction of Neanderthals, they're

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:40.040
almost always shown in having clothing.
Something like this. There's another

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.900
potential view about what Neanderthals
were like. Maybe, they were more like

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.350
this. Now, this is a pretty terrible
reconstruction of a Neanderthal from most

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:53.390
perspectives, but I show it here because
it shows neanderthals as having body hair,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:58.370
as having retained their body hair. That
brings up the question, “Well when did we

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.010
actually lose body hair during our
evolutionary history?” We have no clue

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.050
about that from fossil evidence, and
modern genetics so far has not been able

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.160
to come up with that answer. When did we
lose body hair? If we lost body hair

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.350
recently maybe Neanderthals still had body
hair. Maybe then, therefore, when they

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.010
moved out of Africa into the colder
climates, they didn't need clothing

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.230
because they already their body hair.
There's lots of other mammals that moved

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.600
out of Africa at the same time. They
didn't invent clothing. They got along

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.300
perfectly well without. That brings up the
question, when did we lose our body hair?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.440
A potential answer from that comes from
the third type of lice that we have.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:40.680
That's this lovely creature here. This is
a public louse. Pubic lice, as the name

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.190
suggests, they live and feed exclusively
in the pubic region. As I've already told

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.900
you, the head lice live and feed
exclusively on the scalp. Now, you ask

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.210
yourself, how would this difference come
about between these two different types of

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:59.210
lice. The answer that seems to make sense
is that at one time we had body hair, we

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.330
had hair all over us, we had one type of
lice then we lost body hair so that we

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.390
only have hair in the pubic region and in
the head region. Now, we have a barrier

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:14.040
that the lice can't cross. We have
geographic isolation, we get classic

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:19.070
allopatric speciation, and now we have our
two types of lice.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.390
Well, again, if you buy that, then we can
use the molecular clock approach and ask,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.300
“When did the difference between public
and head lice occur?” and date that

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.380
divergence. That might tell us something
about when humans, then lost their body

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:38.120
hair. Now, that all sounds very nice and
neat, however, it's not quite that simple.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.050
Life is never that simple. Here's the view
of lice evolution that I just told you

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:46.280
about. Going back as far as the gorilla
lineage. Gorilla lineage branched off

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.780
before the chimpanzee and the human
lineages. If we start with the gorilla

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.860
lineage, we have a common ancestor,
gorillas, chimps, and humans. The gorilla

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.560
lineage branches off that leads to the
evolution of gorilla louse. Chimp lineage

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.510
branches off, that leads to the
differentiation of chimp lice and the

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:08.430
origin of all human lice. We then have
loss of body hair, that leads to the

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:13.050
origin of the pubic louse and finally, we
have clothing and that leads to the origin

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:17.530
of the body louse separate from the head
louse. That looks all very reasonable,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:23.060
however, the complication is that the
taxonomy, classical taxonomy, of lice does

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:30.360
not agree with this. The classical
taxonomy looks at things this way. Body

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.630
louse, in the genus pediculus as I told
you, as is the head louse, as is the

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:39.470
chimpanzee louse, but the pubic louse is
put into a different genus by the

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:48.070
taxonomists, the genus phthirus. That is
the same genus as the gorilla louse. I

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:54.170
will refrain from any speculation as to
how humans might have gotten pubic lice

00:15:54.170 --> 00:16:00.330
from gorillas, but one possibility is that
the taxonomy based on morphology is wrong.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:05.180
There are many examples we know where
taxonomy based on morphology differs from

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.560
that based on the DNA.
Clearly, what we need is DNA evidence to

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.630
see what's going on here and we also need
DNA from gorilla lice to see what's going

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:19.290
on here. David Reed's group at Florida did
just that and found out that lo and

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.280
behold, the taxonomy is recorded by the
DNA. You get the same picture from the

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:29.950
DNA. When did this divergence between
human public lice and gorilla lice occur?

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:36.230
About 3.3 million years ago. If you
believe that this colonization, this

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:42.010
transfer, from gorillas to humans would
have occurred only after humans would have

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.040
lost their body hair, which I think is
probably the most reasonable scenario,

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.590
then that would suggest that body hair
loss occurred relatively early on in human

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.600
evolution, not too long after the
divergence from the chimp lineage which

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.450
fits with some other ideas that people
have had about loss of body hair. It would

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:10.490
appear that our ancestors do have some
explaining to do with this. To conclude,

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.180
genetic analyses of head and body lice do
indicate that clothing became important

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.300
somewhere around 70,000 years ago, seems
to coincide with the expansion of modern

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:22.240
humans out of Africa, maybe had something
to do with that expansion. Genetic

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.690
analyses of pubic lice suggest our
ancestors had lost their body hair by

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.060
roughly 3, 3.3 million years ago, not so
long after the divergence from

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.740
chimpanzees, so it was relatively early
on. On with the acknowledgments, I

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.300
especially want to single out Ralf
Kittler, Manfred Kayser, the two people in

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.070
my group who did the work we've done on
lice, and all these other people for

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.410
contributing samples not necessarily their
own lice samples of course. And the Max

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.414
Planck Society for funding all of our
work. Thank you for your attention.
