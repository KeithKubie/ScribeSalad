00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.468
We showed this picture already, right?

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:07.960
This is a picture of the tracking
of Andrew Black's daughter.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.824
And, the first question
is what is the state?

00:00:10.824 --> 00:00:11.850
All right.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.210
And the state, or
the object that was to be tracked,

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.270
was a hand initialized
contour of the head.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.920
On the left here you see
a bunch of contours.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.880
Okay?
In fact,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.930
there's even one that's up here,
all right?

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.980
Those contours are the contours
represented by each or

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.060
many of the particles,
the top particles, right?

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.350
And so, for example, you can
actually talk about the mean state

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.460
as being the sort of
average of the particles.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.690
But that doesn't really
tell you what it is.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.520
What do mean, you know,
the state of a contour?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.480
Well, in fact, what they did is they,
they drew a contour, and they said,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.020
because that's not a parameter,
that's a shape.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.240
And they said,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.260
let's represent the state of that
contour by an affine deformation, okay?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.500
Remember affine?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.930
Affine is, it's a three point
to three point mapping,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.420
takes how many parameters?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.770
It's six parameters, okay?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.132
Translation, rotation, scale, and sheer,
depending upon how you count those,

00:01:11.132 --> 00:01:14.370
I mean, it's six and
you can sort of divide them up any way.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.050
So the idea is that each particle
represents a six dimensional vector.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.870
So, by the way, that means our particles
are living in a six dimensional space,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.800
and the bigger the,
the number of dimensions

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.200
the more particles you need to
sort of fill up that space,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.670
in fact it doesn't grow so
nicely, does it, right?

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.660
I mean, if I go from two dimensions
to three dimensions right,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.630
if I had a 100 particles before, if I
wanted to have the same density I would

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.465
now need a 1,000 particles, all right?

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:44.100
I goes ec, it grows exponentially in
terms of the number of dimensions.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.210
So for affine we're going to need six.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.030
And as I said,
each of the particles represents that.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.820
Here by the way is one of the videos.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.150
And one of the questions you might ask
is, well where do you get the dynamics?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.630
&gt;&gt; Where do you get the dynamics?

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.450
&gt;&gt; Well,
there are a couple of things you can do.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.550
The easiest thing to do is to cheat.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.200
All right?

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.060
So the reason we're using dynamics here
is that the girl is jumping up and

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.100
down in front of a cluttered background.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.690
So to keep track of where her head is,
is kind of a difficult tracking problem,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.620
that's why we're doing all
this work to begin with,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.750
that's why we're using particles.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.520
But when would tracking be easy?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.200
How about if she was jumping around
in front of a green screen, or

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.170
a white background, okay?

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.314
Or in fact, even easier, suppose you
put her in a totally black turtle neck

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:37.882
sweater, and you put her in front of
a black screen, kind of like that thing.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:40.691
By the way, Megan doesn't let me wear
black shirts because I'll disappear.

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:45.492
But the point of my disappearing is all
you would see would be my floating head,

00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:49.445
which would be kind of creepy,
but it would very easy tracking.

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:53.405
So you could have somebody jump
around with their floating head,

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:57.210
track it very easily, and
measure the dynamics.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.960
So one way of getting dynamics
is to sort of cheat and

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.780
get it from an easier system.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.210
And I think for a bunch of
the stuff they do in cassation,

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.810
that's what they did.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.480
They had an easier problem.
