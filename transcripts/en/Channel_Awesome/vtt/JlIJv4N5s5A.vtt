*Intro Music*

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.580
So when going over the list for this year's Disneycember,

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.140
I knew I had to drop one of these two movies to make room: Smart House or Princess Protection.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.300
I asked people on my Facebook, who grew up with these movies, which one they wanted to see.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.260
Thinking they would say Princess Protection. Because hey, it's Disney and princesses,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.720
that's just kind of their thing. But overwhelmingly, everyone said Smart House. Not just picking that one,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.700
but praising that one, like it was actually a legitimately good film.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.360
So I popped it in, take a look… And yeah, it actually kind of is.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.880
I mean, okay. It's corny, has bad effects and it's clearly aiming for kids.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.960
But I found myself legitimately entertained by what was going on, and even laughing quite a bit.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.720
The story centers around a family, who… Big shock: just lost their mother recently.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.000
The son has put it upon himself to take care of the household,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.720
and has decided to enter a contest to win a Smart House.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.540
A home where everything is taken care of everything is taken care of by [a] computer.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.500
They, of course, win and find that the house is actually quite perfect. Apart from a glitch, here or there,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.620
it actually seems to do everything for them and seems quite pleasant. But when those glitches do happen,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.100
they have to call the inventor; who it turns out is sparking a bit of a romance with the dad. The son doesn't like this,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.900
as he's still getting over the loss of his mother. So he decides to program into the computer, named Pat,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.160
that she should be more motherly, hoping the father won't see the necessity of dating.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.740
The computer not only complies, but overtime it gets ovsessive.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.120
It looks up all the motherly things, that mothers are supposed to do, and does them times ten.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.260
She's strict, but also playful. It forces good morals, but doesn't always practice them when looking after her kids,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.040
and yeah… Starts to see the family as her family, when everybody realizes Pat might be going too far,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.160
she suddenly turns herself into human form; a hologram projection, that decides it's too dangerous outside.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.980
And so she decides to hold the family hostage!

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.980
It's as crazy as it sounds, but in all the best ways.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.600
The writing in this movie, at least when it comes to the dialogue,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.160
it's not necessarily the best, but they've got good actors and a good director, to really bring it to life.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.300
They can make unfunny lines seem legitimately humorous,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.860
and take non-emotional scenes, and make them actually kind-of tearjerkers.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.060
The family is not a rotten family,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.460
they don't just throw insults at each other all the time like on a sitcom.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.180
They actually get along pretty well, and they're likable, and they have distinct identities.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.960
And again, I think a lot of that comes from the acting and the directing.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.540
The son, for example, in any other movie would be seen as unrealistic or strange.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.180
Why would he be obsessing over keeping the house clean and tidy, and such?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.520
But the movie and the performances do a great job showing that

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.720
it really is because he can't fill the void of his missing mother.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.960
He sees that when his father wants to date somebody else, it's betraying his mother.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.220
That's some heavy material for a Disney film to take on.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.260
But by god, they take it on and they do it seriously.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.440
It isn't just the Full House routine, where you know, oh:

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.920
'This is where you hear the serious moment and you tune out and they just say those catchphrases.'

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.740
No, they really talk about it,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.680
and you really listen. Speaking of Full House:

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.500
All of these characters and jokes could so easily fall into that category:

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.120
Being too corny and too nice.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.880
But there is enough conflict in their everyday lives,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.200
and of course with the computer and the missing mother, so it never really feels ungenuine.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.720
Katey Sagal as Pat is a perfect choice. Every time she talks, it's funny.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.260
It's a great evolution going from that robotic voice, that could be hilariously obnoxious,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.940
*Robotic Voice:* "Certainly, Angie."

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.540
"Here, boy. Good Dog."

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.180
"Not to worry, Nick; my database was prepared by a team of nutritionists"

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.420
to a gradually changing tone of her being this overly obsessed, even insane mother.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.560
*Somewhat Human Voice:* "Does it hurt like the dickens, baby?"

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.820
"Nobody goes after my boy and gets away unpunished."

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.760
And when she finally takes on human form,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.900
it's even better. Look at that evil smile. That's both funny and terrifying.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.300
It's interesting that this movie was directed by LeVar Burton, Geordi from Star Trek,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.180
this, honestly makes too much sense; not only did he act on Star Trek, but he directed several episodes.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.680
And if you watch Star Trek, you know that a lot of it centers around sci-fi technology,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.040
which often ties into the problems and conflicts that are happening on the ship.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.180
Say: A family coming to grips with the loss of a family member,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.700
while the technology in their lives has created a conflict that ties into that struggle.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.780
This guy has had years of watching and directing stories like this, and he does it wonderfully here.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.440
The only problems I really have, are nitpicks,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.820
like there's a scene where Pat wants to torment a bully,

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.980
in my opinion, it could have been a lot meaner and a lot funnier.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.720
There's also a scene where Pat gives a loving look to the boy at the end,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.320
even though it's clearly the same look that was done before, and was meant to be evil that time.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.620
Little things like that, can kind of get in the way along with some of the corny effects.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.160
But, honestly the story, the characters and the acting really pull it through;

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.720
I feel like everything that can and should be done with a kids film, about a smart house, is done in Smart House.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.920
It's a movie kids can watch for the zaniness,

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.080
but adults can also get a few laughs and even some dramatic moments out of it too.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.940
Not mayor ones, but, just done well enough.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.600
The best way to put it: Smart House is a smart flick.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.500
