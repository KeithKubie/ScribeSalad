00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.350
By just using rays of light, this new 3D printer
“sculpts” objects all at once, making

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.940
it one of the first designs of its kind.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.671
This latest method coming from UC Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore National Lab

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:15.671
is called Computed Axial Lithography, or CAL for short.

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.130
It uses a newer technique called volumetric
printing.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.730
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Volumetric printing is a category
of additive manufacturing, where all points

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.579
inside the 3D objects are materialized or
created pretty much

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:36.980
Simultaneously, as opposed to building up
the geometry, layer by layer, which is how

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.859
virtually every other existing additive manufacturing
process works today.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.770
So CAL is printing smooth complex geometries
like those found in the statue The Thinker;

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.269
there are no symmetrical sides and no hard
“staircase” looking edges, which is totally

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:52.269
novel!

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.700
Another promising feature of this device is
called “overprinting” which is when they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.510
can take objects and print around them.Like
taking the metal component of a screwdriver

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.109
and printing the handle.

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.479
This is a technique that our additive manufacturing
printers today, have trouble accomplishing.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.390
You see, even other liquid printers, like
those that use Stereolithography, are not

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.130
considered volumetric.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.270
Although Stereolithography printers also use
a bath of resin, they’re still printing

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.259
objects layer by layer, slowing pulling the
object out and selectivity curing sections

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.810
with a light in a process called photopolymerization.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.450
Researchers for CAL eliminated this long process.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.390
Since CAL can print within minutes and is
special since it can print all at once too,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.430
and it’s still a very new technology.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.620
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Computed axial lithography,
you mean?

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:44.140
The merging of the relative rotation to build
up.a 3D intensity dose with fabrication.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.070
This is the first demonstration of that approach.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.579
The original proof of principle was done in
2017 by a big collaboration between the Lawrence

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.270
Livermore National Lab, MIT, UC Berkeley, and University
of Rochester.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.159
They used three intersecting stationary beams,
and at the points they intersected, the intensity

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.420
of light was high enough to cause the resin
to solidify.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.310
But this early project was limited by simple
shapes.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.700
So Hayden and the team wanted to create something
with some versatility and curves.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.860
HAYDEN TAYLOR: The principle of the CT scan,
the computed tomography scan, came to mind.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.129
We thought, "Well, let's just reverse that
to create objects instead of measuring them.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.090
By calculating what an image would look like
from many different angles, researchers put

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.360
the resulting images into a DLP, or “digital
light processing” projector.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.140
(Sounds fancy, but it’s really just an ordinary
digital projector from a store.)

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.060
From there they pointed the projector at a
light-sensitive resin.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.390
HAYDEN TAYLOR: And so, as that volume of material
rotates quite steadily, the pattern that is

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.840
being projected into the volume is changing
there are rays of light that are controlled

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.530
in the brightness, and as they shined through,
photons are getting absorbed out of that beam

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.410
at a particular rate.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.750
When that amount of absorbed light energy
goes above a certain threshold value, the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.159
resin will become solid and then the part
is formed.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.730
So a key part of this whole process is this
resin.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.900
It’s a synthetic material called gelatin
methacrylate hydrogel and it’s made of a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.860
few components; liquid polymers (which have
acrylate at the ends), photoinitiators (which

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.849
are molecules that react to photons), and
oxygen.

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.239
The researchers keep the gel at room temperature
so the oxygen can evenly distribute.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.620
But when a light is shined into the material,
the molecules within the photoinitiators become

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.610
reactive and a few things can happen.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.250
HAYDEN TAYLOR: First, they could interact
with the oxygen and become what is called

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.250
quenched.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.209
So, the reactive molecule stops being reactive
and is basically dead.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.209
When I say that there's a threshold for light,
it's really the presence of the oxygen that

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.420
creates this sharp threshold.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.420
You've got to consume the oxygen before you
could do the solidification.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.750
This threshold process is extremely important
because technically, those rays of light are

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.340
going through the entire resin, even the parts
you don’t have to solidify.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.450
The acrylate in the polymers goes through
what’s called polymerization, which is when

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.290
resin molecules link together in chains to
make a solid plastic.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.860
And within a few minutes, the researchers
have a solid small structure like that of

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.860
The Thinker.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.170
The resin is a flexible material to work with
because it’s cheap, malleable, and reusable.#

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.320
We can possibly customize sports equipment,
tools, lenses, or even prosthetic devices.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.830
But to go beyond the centimeter scale the
researchers are at now, they need to evaluate

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.520
the resin formula.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.580
AND what about biocompatibility?

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.280
HAYDEN TAYLOR: Wow, that is a really excellent
question, and actually, the subject of our

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.360
ongoing research.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.600
We know that other research groups have successfully
used gelatin methacrylate in conjunction with

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.920
cells in vitro.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.690
That's a huge positive sign for us.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.040
So while this is the latest and breaking research,
it’s probably only going to get better from

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.040
here on out.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.670
