00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.330
I am a visualization scientist.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.440
I basically try to come up with ways of explaining
complex science stories through the visuals,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.561
and developing artwork and illustrations that
actually can help explain the science story

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:16.940
to people.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.929
For decades, popular culture and shows like
Star Trek inspired a generation of scientists

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.160
by envisioning what space might look like.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.529
But wait, what does space actually look like?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.079
Heart nebulas, celestial collisions, a bird's
eye view of the Milky Way, astronomers are

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.760
charting the outer reaches of the cosmos and
bringing back jaw dropping images from telescopes

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.440
like Hubble and its infrared cousin, Spitzer.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.181
If you look down at the bottom of that Milky
Way image, you’ll see these two words: artist

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:48.859
concept.

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.660
This sweeping image of the Orion Nebula, actually
looks like this.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.170
And the Trappist-1 star system, the latest
discovery of seven potentially habitable exoplanets

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.339
that made national headlines is really only
a box of grey and white pixels.

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.510
You see, space art is part of NASA and it
has been since before we went to the moon.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.970
You may remember our host Amy explored this
in a previous episode.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.650
It inspired us to track down the scientist
behind some of NASA’s most fascinating images.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.370
Most space imagery begin with data - very,
very complex data.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.520
And transforming these numbers and graphs
into an image that captures the public’s

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.040
imagination requires a delicate balance between
science and art.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.420
And that is where Robert comes in.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.510
As an astronomer and an artist, Robert isn’t
editing images so much as he’s making an

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.490
artistic hypothesis grounded in facts, so
we can visualize what’s really happening

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.540
up there.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.130
And for objects we haven’t even seen yet,
like Trappist-1, the artist rendition is a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.170
meticulous process.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.630
Once a result shows up, the first thing I'll
do is get a copy of the paper and look over

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.630
it.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.700
I just want to understand what is actually
being presented as purely science.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.670
Then usually the next step is to contact the
scientists involved in the research directly,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.680
and discuss with them how we might go about
illustrating their results.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.660
The first day that I saw the data plot of
the light curve from the Trappist 1 Star,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.450
my jaw dropped, it was just a forest of deeps
dips in the light curve, and we knew there

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.670
was a whole flurry of activity.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.640
This data doesn’t look like much to the
untrained eye, but the depth of the dip reveals

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.280
the size of the planet.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.580
And by studying tiny blips of light as the
planets pass the star, otherwise known as

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.080
the transit method, astronomers can tell that
the exoplanets orbit close to its star.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.840
All of this information is critical so Robert
can paint the right picture.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.250
You can actually figure out how big the planet
is, what its surface temperature would be,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.250
because of that proximity.This is a really
tight close-in solar system, so that became

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.330
an exciting angle that we wanted to take into
the graphics as well.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.950
This is nothing like our own solar system.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.130
To tell a big story like Trappist-1, Robert
takes the scientific limitations seriously,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.280
because the wrong color could be very misleading.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.790
Rendering an exo-planet with a bright green
continents, would be crossing a line for us.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.160
We don't want to say, hey we found life on
this planet and showing green really would

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160
communicate that.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.240
It’s enough to show some evidence of water.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.750
A lot of times, we've made special efforts
to make the water not look super appealing,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.490
not like this tropical deep blue appearance.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.420
You would think that complete accuracy would
be the goal when doing astronomical illustrations,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.910
but that isn’t always the case.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.810
The primary goal is communication and understanding.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.790
Communicating space discoveries with art has
a long and storied history.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.240
One of the fathers of modern space art was
the famed Chesley Bonestell, a designer and

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
illustrator.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.261
In the 1950s, he created an image of Saturn's
moon Titan before Neil Armstrong took his

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.840
first steps on the lunar surface.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.000
Carl Sagan once famously said of Chesley,
“ I didn’t know what other worlds looked

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.160
like until I saw Bonestell’s paintings.”

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.790
His work was so widely acclaimed that his
illustrations accompanied articles written

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.420
by German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun,
which ultimately inspired the American space

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.420
program.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.290
Disney: Many of the things that seem impossible
now will become realities tomorrow.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.229
Having a visual response to technical triumphs
was something NASA latched onto early on.

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.099
For over 50 years, NASA worked closely with
artists and creative leaders, like Walt Disney

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.090
and Norman Rockwell, to help shape the stories
of spaceflight.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.180
It’s the same legacy today, just with more
advanced scientific understanding and better

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.780
tools to imagine what far off worlds might
look like if we could visit them.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.190
We want to take a lot of care to make sure
that we don’t oversell parts of the story

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.949
that isn’t actually part of the story.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.689
There are people who just look and think,
oh NASA’s photographed a planet and they

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:49.140
don’t understand that actually that was
a piece of art.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.009
On the other hand, if we don’t do that,
and don’t put a piece of compelling artwork,

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.770
then people may never even look at the story
anyway.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.639
We’re putting as much science as we can,
of what we know today, and I like to think

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.550
that in 50 years when people come back and
look at the various pictures of exoplanets

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.229
after maybe we actually finally know what
they look like, they might wink and smile

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.189
to each other, oh that’s so funny, they
thought there was water on that one -- But

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.330
also appreciate this is a historical record
of how our understanding of these planets

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.650
has changed over time.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.000
Turns out, 50 years later was an overestimate.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.849
So much of what we thought we knew about Trappist-1
just changed.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.849
Which means Robert had to get back to the
drawing board and quickly re-do the artwork

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.629
for these exoplanets.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:42.839
Robert described the changes during a Facebook
live event, and for him, density was a game

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:44.139
changer.

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.419
For astronomers we literally know of thousands
of exoplanets but these are the only seven

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.879
that we have the precise measurements of the
mass, and from that the density.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.430
And density for astronomers is incredibly
important because that’s the first step

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.919
to deciding what they’re actually made of.

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.159
Knowing the densities changed our understanding
of what the Trappist-1 planets looked like.

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:12.000
For instance, back in 2017, scientists thought
planet d was rocky.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.050
But turns out, it has the lowest density of
the seven, and it’s actually a water world.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.550
And for planet e, Robert and his team thought
it was a watery planet, but it’s actually

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.900
super rocky and has the same density as Earth!

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.869
Meaning, Planet e is the most earth-like planet
we know yet.

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:36.540
We’re a long way away from sending a spacecraft
to Trappist-1, without warp drive of course.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:45.409
So for now, the artwork will continue to stand
as our best guess.
