00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.300
This problem can be solved by
setting up an algebraic proportion.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.570
The diet claims that you can
lose ten pounds in seven days.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.460
This can be expressed as a rate like
this, ten pounds over seven days.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.160
You can also write a rate for the amount
of weight that you want to lose,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.810
even though we don't have
the number of days yet.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.980
We'll use 25 as the numerator and
set the number of days equal to X.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.240
So we have two rates here, we can use
a proportion to solve this problem now.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.729
An algebraic proportion has two rates or

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.720
ratios in fraction forms
that equal to each other.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.290
So I have moved things
around a little bit and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.570
set these two rates equal to each other.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.241
So for this problem,
ten over seven is equal to 25 over x.

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:50.573
Notice that I have placed the pounds
in the numerator of both rates and

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:53.350
the days in the denominator for
both rates.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.660
It is important when setting up
a proportion that you place the same

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660
units in the numerator and
the denominator.
