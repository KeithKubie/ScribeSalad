00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.975
Well, last time we had seen
that when you write this

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:14.975
electron configuration,
that that electron

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:20.926
configuration is a shorthand way
of writing the wave functions

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:26.097
for the electrons in a
multi-electron atom within this

00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:33.585
one electron wave approximation.
But we also noted that at most

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:40.159
we gave, or we assigned a
hydrogen-like wave function to

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.940
two electrons.
And we noted that that was

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.513
because of something you already
knew about called spin.

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:57.609
And spin, we saw last time,
was a quantum mechanical

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.952
phenomenon.
Spin is the intrinsic angular

00:01:02.952 --> 00:01:06.312
momentum, built into the
particle.

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:12.218
And we saw that that spin is
designated by a fourth quantum

00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:16.087
number.
That fourth quantum number here

00:01:16.087 --> 00:01:21.178
is m sub s,
and it had two allowed values,

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:28.000
and those allowed values were
one half and minus one half.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.867
And we said that those two
allowed values or those two

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:38.739
states represented a spin up and
a spin down.

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:44.496
Two different polarities,
in a sense, of this quantum

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:48.150
mechanical phenomenon called
spin.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.132
How was spin actually
experimentally observed?

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:59.000
Well, really thanks to these
two gentlemen.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.765
Here is Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit.
These were very young

00:02:03.765 --> 00:02:07.522
scientists.
I think post-docs at the time.

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:12.929
And what they were doing was
looking at the emission spectra

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:16.137
from sodium atoms.
And this is 1925,

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:20.536
and so they knew enough,
already, to know at what

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:25.026
frequency they should expect to
see some emission.

00:02:25.026 --> 00:02:29.425
And so they looked at the
emission, dispersed it,

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:35.332
looked at that frequency.
And instead of seeing emission

00:02:35.332 --> 00:02:39.064
at that particular frequency
where they expected,

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:43.495
they saw, so if this is the
expected, what they really saw

00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:47.927
was some emission at a little
bit lower frequency and some

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:51.115
emission at a little bit higher
frequency.

00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:55.391
Not much but a little bit lower
and a little bit higher.

00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:58.812
And in spectroscopy,
this kind of emission is

00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:04.922
actually called the doublet.
Well, they were quite excited

00:03:04.922 --> 00:03:11.271
about it, and thought much about
the reason why there might be a

00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.798
doublet.
And they reasoned that they

00:03:14.798 --> 00:03:20.643
could explain that doublet if
the electron were existing in

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:24.775
one of two states,
one of two spin states.

00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:30.909
This was revolutionary.
And so they took their results

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:36.242
excitedly to the resident
established scientist that was

00:03:36.242 --> 00:03:42.060
closest, who was Wolfgang Pauli.
And Wolfgang Pauli was not a

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.684
nice man, but they told Wolfgang
Pauli about what they saw.

00:03:47.684 --> 00:03:52.242
And Wolfgang said,
rubbish, you publish that and

00:03:52.242 --> 00:03:56.121
you will destroy your scientific
careers.

00:03:56.121 --> 00:04:00.000
And so they left,
dejectedly.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.450
No sooner had the door shut,
than Wolfgang sat down and

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.065
wrote a paper on the presence of
a fourth quantum number,

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.280
m sub s.
One of the travesties,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.000
really, in the history of
science.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.791
That is well known now.
But it really did take,

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.087
though, Dirac,
another three years later,

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:25.796
to actually show where this m
sub s came from,

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:30.000
this fourth quantum number came
from.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.870
He had to use the relativistic
SchrÃ¶dinger equation,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.595
which we didn't look at.
He solved that.

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:43.657
And when he solved that,
out drops this fourth quantum

00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:47.955
number, m sub s.
But Pauli did make a

00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:51.679
contribution.
He worked on this problem,

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:57.505
and worked on the theoretical
basis of it, and in the end came

00:04:57.505 --> 00:05:04.000
out with something called the
Pauli exclusion principle.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.755
And the Pauli exclusion
principle, here,

00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:12.859
simply says that no two
electrons in the same atom can

00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:18.059
have the same electron wave
function and the same spin.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:23.837
Or another way to state that,
is that no two electrons in the

00:05:23.837 --> 00:05:30.000
same atom can have the same set
of four quantum numbers.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.967
For example,
in our electron configuration

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:38.322
here for neon,
we've got two electrons in this

00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:41.903
1s state.
Well, this electron here has

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:46.354
the quantum numbers (1,0,0,1/2).
This electron,

00:05:46.354 --> 00:05:50.709
also in that 1s state,
has the quantum numbers

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:54.483
(1,0,0,-1/2) .
So the n, l and m quantum

00:05:54.483 --> 00:06:00.000
numbers are the same for these
two electrons.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.063
But what is different is the
spin quantum number.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:08.042
One is one half and the other
is minus one half,

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:12.359
according to the Pauli
exclusion principle that says

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:17.693
you cannot have two electrons in
the same atom with the same set

00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:20.825
of four quantum numbers.
And likewise,

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:23.957
for example,
this electron right here,

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:26.497
quantum numbers (2,1,-1,
+1/2).

00:06:26.497 --> 00:06:29.798
But this electron,
quantum numbers (2 1,

00:06:29.798 --> 00:06:34.500
-1, -1/2).
No two electrons have the same

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.000
set of four quantum numbers.
So that's why when we were

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.750
actually writing this electron
configurations,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.833
which is the shorthand
representation for the wave

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:51.166
functions in the one-electron
approximation for these

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:55.333
multi-electron atoms,
that's why we didn't give the

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.166
ten electrons in neon,
for example,

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:04.000
we didn't all give that a 1s
hydrogen-like wave function.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.110
Okay.
Now, what we want to do is we

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.958
want to take a look at what the
wave functions for the

00:07:11.958 --> 00:07:16.807
individual electrons in a
multi-electron atom actually

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:19.094
look like.
And to do that,

00:07:19.094 --> 00:07:24.309
we're going to look at the
radial probability distribution

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:30.072
function, because that tells us
a little bit about what the wave

00:07:30.072 --> 00:07:36.025
functions look like.
Because the radial probability

00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:40.161
distribution function,
as a function of r,

00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:46.213
is the probability of finding
the electron a distance between

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:50.046
r and r plus dr.
That's what the radial

00:07:50.046 --> 00:07:54.282
probability distribution
function tells us.

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:59.829
And so what I did here is to
plot the radial probability

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:05.579
distribution function for each
one of the electrons in the

00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:10.037
argon atom.
Each one of the electrons in

00:08:10.037 --> 00:08:12.876
the different states for the
argon atom.

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:17.098
And the first thing that I want
you to notice is that these

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:21.610
radial probability distribution
functions for each one of these

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:26.050
electrons look very similar in
shape to the radial probability

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.000
distribution functions for the
electron in a hydrogen atom.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.557
In fact, they have the same
shape.

00:08:33.557 --> 00:08:38.052
If you look here at the 1s wave
function, which is in green

00:08:38.052 --> 00:08:41.850
here, you see it starts out as
zero, as all radial

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.174
probabilities do.
It increases,

00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:46.887
goes to a maximum,
and then drops of

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:50.375
exponentially.
That's exactly what the 1s wave

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:54.870
function did in a hydrogen atom.
If you look at the 2s wave

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.822
function, it starts out at zero,
it goes to maximum,

00:08:58.822 --> 00:09:04.117
and then there is a node.
There is a node right here.

00:09:04.117 --> 00:09:08.196
And then it goes to another
maximum and exponentially

00:09:08.196 --> 00:09:11.176
decays.
That's exactly what the 2s wave

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:14.392
function looked like in the
hydrogen atom.

00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:18.941
For the multi-electron atoms,
these wave functions have the

00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:23.254
same basic shape and they have
the same nodal structure.

00:09:23.254 --> 00:09:26.470
They have the same number of
radial nodes,

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.784
same number of angular nodes.
The big difference between

00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:35.333
these wave functions and the
hydrogen atom is the distances

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:39.104
from the nucleus.
For example,

00:09:39.104 --> 00:09:44.259
if you look at the 1s radial
probability distribution for

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:49.782
argon, you find that that most
probable value of r is a tenth

00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:54.569
of an a nought,
a tenth of a Bohr radius.

00:09:54.569 --> 00:10:00.000
What was it for a hydrogen atom
in the ground state?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.501
a nought, right?
So this 1s electron here is ten

00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:07.183
times closer,
on the average,

00:10:07.183 --> 00:10:12.354
in to the nucleus than the
electron in a hydrogen atom.

00:10:12.354 --> 00:10:17.047
And the same is the case for
the 2s wave function,

00:10:17.047 --> 00:10:21.070
2p, 3s, 3p.
It's all a lot closer in if you

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:26.816
compared those actual values.
And the reason it is is because

00:10:26.816 --> 00:10:31.892
of the Coulomb attraction
between the electron and the

00:10:31.892 --> 00:10:35.704
nucleus.
As you go to argon,

00:10:35.704 --> 00:10:41.265
which has now a plus 18 times e
charge on the nucleus,

00:10:41.265 --> 00:10:44.764
that's a greater attractive
interaction.

00:10:44.764 --> 00:10:50.325
The Coulomb interaction is the
charge on the electron times the

00:10:50.325 --> 00:10:54.720
charge on the nucleus.
It is that greater electron

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.295
attraction that pulls the
electrons in closer to the

00:10:59.295 --> 00:11:03.398
nucleus.
That is why that 1s electron,

00:11:03.398 --> 00:11:08.360
the most probable value of r is
at a tenth of a nought

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.255
instead of 1 a nought.

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:12.000
Yes?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.757
Well, they don't collapse,
in a sense.

00:11:21.757 --> 00:11:24.440
They don't collapse into the
nucleus.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.838
Certainly, the probability of
finding the electron closer to

00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:33.103
the nucleus is greater.
But it is true that as you get

00:11:33.103 --> 00:11:36.329
larger and larger atoms,
you have more and more

00:11:36.329 --> 00:11:38.994
electrons.
And so they do generally get

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:41.449
bigger.
And we will see that when we

00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:45.727
actually look at the size and
look at the trends in the radius

00:11:45.727 --> 00:11:48.742
as we go across and down the
periodic table.

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:52.109
We will look at that a little
bit more in detail,

00:11:52.109 --> 00:11:55.124
and we will see that,
in general, if you add

00:11:55.124 --> 00:11:59.311
electrons they get bigger.
Because you do,

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:04.557
in fact, have more electrons,
and you put them in these outer

00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.879
shells.
But if you just do a one-on-one

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:12.513
comparison of 1s to 1s in
hydrogen, this is closer in,

00:12:12.513 --> 00:12:15.661
this is closer in,
this is closer in.

00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:17.060
Make sense?
Okay.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.644
But now also,
since I have this diagram up

00:12:20.644 --> 00:12:24.754
here on the board,
I want to just convey an idea

00:12:24.754 --> 00:12:30.000
that you, I think,
are already familiar with.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.805
And that is this idea of
shells.

00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:38.236
When you say a shell you think
of well, the n equals 3 shell,

00:12:38.236 --> 00:12:42.037
the n equals 2 shell,
the n equals 1 shell,

00:12:42.037 --> 00:12:44.662
right?
But the word shell also

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.649
connotes some spatial
information.

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:52.988
And you can see that spatial
information here in this radial

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:55.975
probability distribution
function.

00:12:55.975 --> 00:13:01.225
What I want to point out is
that the most probable value of

00:13:01.225 --> 00:13:05.931
r for the n equals 3 shell,
well, those most probable

00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:11.000
values aren't identical for 3p
and 3s.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.055
But they are very similar.
They are similar compared to

00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:19.335
the most probable value for any
electron in the n equals 2

00:13:19.335 --> 00:13:22.039
shell.
And those are similar than the

00:13:22.039 --> 00:13:25.944
most probable value for the
electron in the 1s shell.

00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:30.000
So here, you can see that
spatial information.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.467
You can see that,
on the average,

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:37.248
the n equals 3 shell is further
out from the nucleus than the n

00:13:37.248 --> 00:13:40.409
equals 2 shell,
than the n equals 1 shell.

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:45.267
I just wanted to illustrate the
concept of shells because we had

00:13:45.267 --> 00:13:49.354
that radial probability
distribution function up here.

00:13:49.354 --> 00:13:51.821
And it shows you,
kind of nicely,

00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.831
how those shells are indeed
separated in space on the

00:13:55.831 --> 00:13:58.144
average.
And that is important,

00:13:58.144 --> 00:14:02.000
as we're going to see in a
moment.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.870
Okay, so that's a quick
description of what the wave

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:12.219
functions look like for the
electrons in a multi-electron

00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:15.657
atom.
They have the similar structure

00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:19.000
as the hydrogen atom wave
functions.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.157
They're just all closer in
because of the charge on the

00:14:24.157 --> 00:14:27.882
nucleus.
But now what we've got to do is

00:14:27.882 --> 00:14:33.707
have to look at the energies of
the different states for these

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:38.101
electrons.
So we looked at the wave

00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:41.690
functions.
And now we've got to talk about

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:45.016
the energies.
Here is that energy level

00:14:45.016 --> 00:14:50.006
diagram for the hydrogen atom
that we drew a few days ago.

00:14:50.006 --> 00:14:54.734
You see that the n equals 1
state here, which is the 1s

00:14:54.734 --> 00:14:59.548
state, is lowest in energy.
The n equals 2 state here is

00:14:59.548 --> 00:15:03.012
higher in energy.
n equals 3.

00:15:03.012 --> 00:15:06.693
n equals 4.
And you see that we have four

00:15:06.693 --> 00:15:12.214
degenerate states at n equals 2.
That, is the 2s state is the

00:15:12.214 --> 00:15:15.159
same energy as all the 2p
states.

00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:19.392
And at n equals 3,
we have 9 degenerate states.

00:15:19.392 --> 00:15:23.901
And at n equals 4,
we've got 16 degenerate states.

00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:28.779
But in a multi-electron atom,
that means starting with

00:15:28.779 --> 00:15:34.478
helium, things change.
And the first big change is

00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:39.619
that all of these energies here
are lower compared to the

00:15:39.619 --> 00:15:43.567
hydrogen atom.
The energy of the 1s state is

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:46.963
lower than it is in the hydrogen
atom.

00:15:46.963 --> 00:15:51.003
The 2s state is lower.
The 2p state is lower.

00:15:51.003 --> 00:15:55.042
The 3s state is lower.
All of them are lower.

00:15:55.042 --> 00:15:58.072
Why do you think that is the
case?

00:15:58.072 --> 00:16:00.688
Anybody?
Pardon?

00:16:00.688 --> 00:16:05.701
It's closer to the nucleus.
Yeah, it's closer to the

00:16:05.701 --> 00:16:10.616
nucleus because the Coulomb
interaction is greater.

00:16:10.616 --> 00:16:16.613
So that Coulomb attraction is
greater, that energy is greater,

00:16:16.613 --> 00:16:21.430
the binding energy is greater.
It's more negative,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:27.132
the same reason as the wave
functions were in closer to the

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:31.377
nucleus.
So these energies are lower

00:16:31.377 --> 00:16:36.045
because of that larger
attraction because that nucleus

00:16:36.045 --> 00:16:40.536
has a greater charge on it,
greater positive charge.

00:16:40.536 --> 00:16:45.732
But the other thing that you
see is that the 2s state has no

00:16:45.732 --> 00:16:49.079
longer the same energy as the 2p
state.

00:16:49.079 --> 00:16:53.835
The 2s state is no longer
degenerate with the 2p state.

00:16:53.835 --> 00:17:00.000
And the 3s state is no longer
degenerate with the 3p state.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.796
And the 3p state is no longer
degenerate with the 3d state

00:17:05.796 --> 00:17:11.898
like it is in a hydrogen atom.
How are we going to understand

00:17:11.898 --> 00:17:15.355
that?
Why is this degeneracy broken

00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:18.915
or lifted as it is sometimes
called?

00:17:18.915 --> 00:17:25.118
Well, to explain that what I am
going to have to do here is to

00:17:25.118 --> 00:17:30.000
talk about a concept called
shielding.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.041
And shielding then is what
creates what we call an

00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:39.877
effective charge that we're
going to talk about.

00:17:39.877 --> 00:17:43.787
Now, to do so I want to point
out this.

00:17:43.787 --> 00:17:48.418
That all of these binding
energies right here,

00:17:48.418 --> 00:17:54.694
these binding energies e sub 
n, but now it's e sub nl.

00:17:54.694 --> 00:17:58.295
It depends on the angular

00:17:58.295 --> 00:18:04.627
momentum quantum number.
Those binding energies are

00:18:04.627 --> 00:18:10.689
minus the ionization energy of
the electron in that nl state.

00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:14.731
That's the physical
significance of that.

00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:20.996
But what we're going to do here
is that we're going to set that

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:26.958
binding energy equal to this,
this effective Z squared R sub

00:18:26.958 --> 00:18:34.371
H n squared.
And now, I'm going to switch to

00:18:34.371 --> 00:18:40.244
the board, and we will talk
about that a little bit and

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:46.879
explain this effective charge
and the shielding so that we can

00:18:46.879 --> 00:18:53.078
understand why the 2s state is
lower in energy than the 2p

00:18:53.078 --> 00:18:56.450
state.
I just said these states,

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.779
e sub nl,
physically significant is that

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:07.000
they are minus the ionization
energy.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.777
And I'm going to approximate
that binding energy as a

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:19.666
hydrogen atom binding energy in
the sense that I'm going to set

00:19:19.666 --> 00:19:24.555
that equal to that Rydberg
constant, r sub H,

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:29.000
over n squared,
and this is minus.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.904
But out here I'm going to put a
Z.

00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:38.938
This Z is not going to be the
charge on the nucleus,

00:19:38.938 --> 00:19:45.683
but rather it's going to be
something called the effective

00:19:45.683 --> 00:19:47.694
charge.
So Z(eff).

00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:54.320
And it's going to depend on
both n and l quantum numbers.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.000
This I'm calling the effective
charge.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.264
And what I'm going to do
eventually here is to use the

00:20:05.264 --> 00:20:10.629
experimentally measured
ionization energies to back out

00:20:10.629 --> 00:20:16.490
an effective charge for each
electron in each n sub l state.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:22.251
That's what I'm going to do.
But now what is this effective

00:20:22.251 --> 00:20:25.827
charge?
Well, suppose I take a helium

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:33.409
atom and we have a nucleus here.
And the charge on that nucleus

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:36.250
is plus 2.
And, of course,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.681
helium has two electrons.
And so I have,

00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:47.045
say, an electron number one
over here and I have electron

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:52.954
number two over here.
But the bottom line is that for

00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:59.772
this electron one right over
here, this electron one does not

00:20:59.772 --> 00:21:05.000
experience the full nuclear
charge.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.971
Why?
Because, on the average,

00:21:07.971 --> 00:21:13.702
there's another electron in
between it and the nucleus.

00:21:13.702 --> 00:21:20.175
And so the nuclear charge that
is experienced by this electron

00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:26.330
is actually lower than the full
nuclear charge because this

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:31.000
electron here is negatively
charged.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.468
And it, in effect,
cancels part of this positive

00:21:35.468 --> 00:21:40.222
charge on the nucleus.
And so this electron doesn't

00:21:40.222 --> 00:21:43.455
experience the full nuclear
charge.

00:21:43.455 --> 00:21:48.495
It experiences something
smaller than the full nuclear

00:21:48.495 --> 00:21:50.681
charge.
And that charge,

00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:55.340
at something smaller than the
full nuclear charge,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.000
is that we call the effective
charge.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.873
How are we going to determine
that effective charge?

00:22:03.873 --> 00:22:08.430
Well, we're going to use some
experimental measurements to do

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.860
that.
We are going to look up the

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.278
ionization energies,
or measure the ionization

00:22:14.278 --> 00:22:17.240
energies.
And we'll see how we do that a

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.582
little bit later,
but you can guess how we do

00:22:20.582 --> 00:22:23.316
that.
We're going to look them up and

00:22:23.316 --> 00:22:26.658
we're going to back out the
effective charge.

00:22:26.658 --> 00:22:33.231
So let's do that for helium.
If you go and you look up the

00:22:33.231 --> 00:22:39.360
ionization energy for a helium
atom, you find that it is

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:43.929
3.94x10^-18 joules.
What I can do is I can

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:49.278
rearrange that equation for the
effective charge,

00:22:49.278 --> 00:22:52.175
Zeff.
And it is n equals 1,

00:22:52.175 --> 00:22:56.299
l equals 0.
And that will be n squared

00:22:56.299 --> 00:23:02.985
times that ionization energy
over R sub H all to the one half

00:23:02.985 --> 00:23:10.073
The ionization energy,

00:23:10.073 --> 00:23:15.540
when we talk about ionization
energy, it's usually from the

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.594
ground state,
so n is going to be equal to 1

00:23:19.594 --> 00:23:22.704
here.
The ionization energy I just

00:23:22.704 --> 00:23:28.266
said was 3.94x10^-18 joules.
Rydberg's constant in joules is

00:23:28.266 --> 00:23:33.251
2.180x10^-18 joules.
If I solve that I find the

00:23:33.251 --> 00:23:37.407
effective charge is 
1.34 plus.

00:23:37.407 --> 00:23:41.304
So the charge on the helium
nucleus is plus 2,

00:23:41.304 --> 00:23:46.500
but the effective charge for
those electrons in the helium is

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.664
less than that.
It's 1.34.

00:23:48.664 --> 00:23:51.695
Why?
Because on the average there is

00:23:51.695 --> 00:23:56.631
another electron in between that
electron and the nucleus.

00:23:56.631 --> 00:24:02.000
And so the full nuclear charge
isn't experienced.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.217
That is the effective charge.
Now this effective charge and

00:24:09.217 --> 00:24:16.062
the physical concept here of
shielding, that's what's so

00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:23.528
important in why the energy of
the 2s state is lower than the

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:30.000
energy of the 2p state.
So the energy of 2s --

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.730
An electron in the 2s state is
more strongly bound than in the

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.299
2p state.
That energy is lower than the

00:24:39.299 --> 00:24:42.118
2p state.
Why is that the case?

00:24:42.118 --> 00:24:45.593
Well, let's think of the
lithium atom.

00:24:45.593 --> 00:24:51.042
You know that the electron
configuration of lithium is 1s 2

00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:55.551
2s 1.
The electron configuration of

00:24:55.551 --> 00:25:01.000
lithium is not 1s 2 2p 1, 
right?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.188
Because that's a higher energy.
But why?

00:25:05.188 --> 00:25:11.740
Well, to answer that we've got
to look at a radial probability

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:16.788
distribution again.
And I'm going to draw it for

00:25:16.788 --> 00:25:21.514
the 2s state.
So here it is for the 2s state.

00:25:21.514 --> 00:25:25.918
And I'm going to draw it for
the 2p state.

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:33.091
Here it is for the 2p state.
So this is 2p and this is 2s.

00:25:33.091 --> 00:25:37.781
Now, we have to do a thought
experiment here.

00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:42.578
And that is this.
If you look at the 2s radial

00:25:42.578 --> 00:25:48.548
probability distribution
function there is a part of this

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:54.624
distribution function that is
really close to the nucleus.

00:25:54.624 --> 00:26:00.380
And, for the sake of this
argument, let me say that for

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.390
this part of the radial
probability distribution

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:12.000
function, the effective nuclear
charge is plus 3.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.565
Now, that is,
of course, not the case.

00:26:14.565 --> 00:26:18.656
But bear with me for a moment.
We're saying for this part of

00:26:18.656 --> 00:26:21.916
the radial probability
distribution function the

00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:25.521
effective charge is plus 3.
Well, that is the nuclear

00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:27.948
charge.
But we're saying it is close

00:26:27.948 --> 00:26:31.000
enough.
We'll just call it plus 3.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.640
However, for this part of the
radial probability distribution

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:42.841
function here for the 2s,
we're going to say the

00:26:42.841 --> 00:26:48.486
effective charge Z(eff) is plus
1e and plus 3e here.

00:26:48.486 --> 00:26:52.249
Why?
Well, because in lithium there

00:26:52.249 --> 00:26:59.000
are these 1s electrons that are
really close in here.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.753
And we're going to say that
those 2s electrons screen

00:27:03.753 --> 00:27:09.238
completely the nuclear charge.
So you've got a Z equal plus 3

00:27:09.238 --> 00:27:14.631
and you've got two electrons
here, electron one and electron

00:27:14.631 --> 00:27:19.659
two, and you've got this
electron number three out here.

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:24.138
Since this is a minus one and
this is a minus one,

00:27:24.138 --> 00:27:29.531
the effective charge here for
this way out electron is going

00:27:29.531 --> 00:27:34.144
to be plus one.
But now what about the 2p

00:27:34.144 --> 00:27:38.004
state, if we had an electron in
that 2p state?

00:27:38.004 --> 00:27:43.237
Well, what you can see is that
because the most probable value

00:27:43.237 --> 00:27:48.642
of r of the 2p state is in about
the same place as it is for the

00:27:48.642 --> 00:27:51.644
2s state, it's not exactly the
same.

00:27:51.644 --> 00:27:56.448
It's actually a little closer
in, but it's about the same

00:27:56.448 --> 00:27:59.536
place.
We're going to say that for an

00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:04.340
electron in the 2p state,
the effective nuclear charge is

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.476
going to be one.
But now, in order to calculate

00:28:09.476 --> 00:28:13.520
or think about the total
effective nuclear charge,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:18.307
what we're going to have to do
is to average that effective

00:28:18.307 --> 00:28:21.857
charge over these probability
distributions.

00:28:21.857 --> 00:28:26.231
So if the 2s probability
distribution has a part of it

00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:31.101
where the effective charge is
plus 3 and part of it where it

00:28:31.101 --> 00:28:34.868
is plus 1 --
If I average over that,

00:28:34.868 --> 00:28:39.336
well, the effective charge is
going to be, I don't know,

00:28:39.336 --> 00:28:43.316
plus 2 or something.
But for the 2p wave function,

00:28:43.316 --> 00:28:48.271
where the effective charge is
all plus 1, it doesn't have this

00:28:48.271 --> 00:28:53.064
lobe that is really close to the
nucleus where the effective

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:56.882
charge is large.
Well, that effective charge for

00:28:56.882 --> 00:29:02.000
the 2p is going to be smaller
than it is for the 2s.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.065
On the average here,
the effective charge Zeff,

00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:15.054
for the 2s is going to be
greater than Zeff for the 2p

00:29:15.054 --> 00:29:20.197
electron.
Since that effective charge is

00:29:20.197 --> 00:29:25.736
greater, well,
we showed right up here that

00:29:25.736 --> 00:29:32.197
the binding energy,
therefore, is going to be more

00:29:32.197 --> 00:29:38.000
negative because that Z is
larger.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.907
And so that's why the 2s state
is lower in energy than the 2p

00:29:43.907 --> 00:29:48.141
and so on and so forth.
3p is lower than 3d,

00:29:48.141 --> 00:29:49.618
etc.
Make sense?

00:29:49.618 --> 00:29:55.624
It's because of this phenomena
of shielding and because the 2s

00:29:55.624 --> 00:30:01.236
wave function always has this
probability of the electrons

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:06.356
being really close to the
nucleus where the effective

00:30:06.356 --> 00:30:12.280
nuclear charge is larger.
If you average the nuclear

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.877
charge over the probability
distributions,

00:30:15.877 --> 00:30:21.228
well, the effective charge for
that 2s wave function is always

00:30:21.228 --> 00:30:25.087
going to be larger than the 2p
wave function.

00:30:25.087 --> 00:30:30.000
Therefore, the 2s is lower in
energy than the 3p.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Okay.
That is an important point.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Now --

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.916
How do we actually write the
electron configurations for all

00:30:56.916 --> 00:31:00.000
of the atoms in the periodic
table?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.493
Well, I think that you already
know that we use something

00:31:05.493 --> 00:31:11.281
called the Aufbau principle.
And the Aufbau principle is the

00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:16.382
building up principle.
And what that says is that you

00:31:16.382 --> 00:31:21.680
make a list here of the states
and you order the states

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.272
according to their energy,
the lowest energy at the bottom

00:31:27.272 --> 00:31:33.267
here and then keep on going.
And we will talk about the

00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:36.405
energies of these states in a
moment.

00:31:36.405 --> 00:31:41.114
But then, in order to write the
electron configuration,

00:31:41.114 --> 00:31:45.299
you start putting in electrons
into these states,

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:50.008
one electron at a time,
starting with the lowest energy

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:51.926
state.
So for hydrogen,

00:31:51.926 --> 00:31:55.588
well, that left electron
configurations 1s.

00:31:55.588 --> 00:31:59.686
For helium, well,
that electron configuration is

00:31:59.686 --> 00:32:05.318
going to be 1s squared.
But you already know that we

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:09.624
have to put in that second
electron obeying the Pauli

00:32:09.624 --> 00:32:13.847
exclusion principle.
So we're going to fill up these

00:32:13.847 --> 00:32:18.070
states, one electron at a time,
lowest energy first.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:22.292
And then keep going to the next
higher energy level.

00:32:22.292 --> 00:32:26.515
And we're going to do so
heeding the Pauli exclusion

00:32:26.515 --> 00:32:30.523
principle as we go.
So that's helium.

00:32:30.523 --> 00:32:33.840
Here's lithium.
Now we've got lithium.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.128
We're going to do beryllium.
Well, we have to heed the Pauli

00:32:39.128 --> 00:32:43.521
exclusion principle.
That electron has to have the

00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:48.540
opposite spin of this electron.
And now we come to the 2p

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.588
state.
We put an electron in the 2p

00:32:51.588 --> 00:32:54.456
state here.
So we're at nitrogen.

00:32:54.456 --> 00:32:58.669
And it doesn't matter whether
you put it in 2px,

00:32:58.669 --> 00:33:03.689
2py or 2pz.
Because they have all the same

00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:06.647
energy.
But now we have got to add

00:33:06.647 --> 00:33:10.770
another electron.
We have got to get to carbon.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:16.058
And when we get to carbon here
we're going to have to follow

00:33:16.058 --> 00:33:19.375
something else called the Hund's
rule.

00:33:19.375 --> 00:33:22.422
And Hund's rule says the
following.

00:33:22.422 --> 00:33:27.980
It says that when electrons are
added to the states of the same

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:33.000
energy, which is what we've got
right here.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.956
A single electron enters each
state before a second one enters

00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:46.114
any state and the electrons,
the spins remain parallel.

00:33:46.114 --> 00:33:50.219
So where do we put carbon's
electron?

00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:54.780
Do we put it here?
No, because we violate

00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:02.534
something called Hund's rule.
It means that we have to put it

00:34:02.534 --> 00:34:06.980
in 2py or 2pz.
But do we put it in here?

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.260
No.
It's upside down.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:14.846
According to Hund's rule,
the spins have to remain

00:34:14.846 --> 00:34:21.345
parallel in order to have the
lowest energy configuration.

00:34:21.345 --> 00:34:27.843
And so we've got to put it in
here and with the spin being

00:34:27.843 --> 00:34:34.000
parallel to the spin of the
other electron.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.273
So now we get to oxygen.
And we put the electron,

00:34:38.273 --> 00:34:41.479
again, in one of the other 2p
states.

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:46.020
The spin has to be parallel.
And then we keep going.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:50.116
Now we can start to double up
on the 2p states.

00:34:50.116 --> 00:34:53.321
That electron goes in the other
spin.

00:34:53.321 --> 00:34:56.082
That one goes in the other
spin.

00:34:56.082 --> 00:35:00.000
That one goes in the other
spin.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Now we're finished with the 2p
states.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.135
And now we're going to put the
electron in 3s state.

00:35:07.135 --> 00:35:10.621
And the next one.
Now we're ready for the 3p

00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:14.108
states again.
So the first one goes into one

00:35:14.108 --> 00:35:18.000
of the 3p states,
the second one goes into one of

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.972
the other 3p states and the
spins remain parallel.

00:35:21.972 --> 00:35:27.000
And we keep going.
So that's the Aufbau principle.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.498
That's how you write the
electron configurations here

00:35:32.498 --> 00:35:37.468
then for all of the atoms in the
periodic table,

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:42.861
heeding those two rules.
Let's take a look at this a

00:35:42.861 --> 00:35:48.359
little more in detail.
We're going to start here just

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:53.752
looking at the third period,
or the third row in the

00:35:53.752 --> 00:35:58.193
periodic table.
So we're starting here with

00:35:58.193 --> 00:36:05.100
sodium and going across.
And here is the electron

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:12.205
configuration of sodium.
And you see I put two electrons

00:36:12.205 --> 00:36:16.081
in 2px, two in 2py,
two in 2pz.

00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:23.832
Well, if I'm just writing it
like this, I don't mind that you

00:36:23.832 --> 00:36:29.000
just write them as 2p 6.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.090
Because you cannot really tell
the difference here anyway.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.032
So you can just write it as 2p
6.

00:36:36.032 --> 00:36:40.337
Now, just a few reminders of
things that you probably already

00:36:40.337 --> 00:36:42.275
know.
And that is that these

00:36:42.275 --> 00:36:45.074
electrons, 1s,
2s and the 2p 6,

00:36:45.074 --> 00:36:48.733
there are four electrons.
They make up the inner gas

00:36:48.733 --> 00:36:51.747
configuration.
So electrons that make up an

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:55.335
inner gas configuration we call
our core electrons.

00:36:55.335 --> 00:37:00.000
And this inner gas
configuration is that of neon.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.609
And so, actually,
if you were to write the sodium

00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:10.370
electron configuration it's fine
to just write it as neon and

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:14.211
then with a 3s 1
next to it.

00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:18.341
The 3s 1,
of course, is the valence

00:37:18.341 --> 00:37:21.798
electron.
Valence electrons are those

00:37:21.798 --> 00:37:26.503
electrons that are beyond the
closest electron gas

00:37:26.503 --> 00:37:32.386
configuration.
So if we went across this third

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:37.302
row, we would just fill up then
the 3p states.

00:37:37.302 --> 00:37:41.235
And then we get to the
configuration,

00:37:41.235 --> 00:37:45.714
the inner gas configuration
here of argon.

00:37:45.714 --> 00:37:52.596
Let's look at the fourth period
here starting with potassium and

00:37:52.596 --> 00:37:56.252
going across.
For potassium,

00:37:56.252 --> 00:38:01.707
the electron configuration is
that of argon plus one electron.

00:38:01.707 --> 00:38:06.357
And now, what I want you to
notice is that that extra

00:38:06.357 --> 00:38:09.219
electron went into this 4s
state.

00:38:09.219 --> 00:38:11.991
It did not go into the 3d
state.

00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:17.447
It turns out for potassium that
the 4s state is actually lower

00:38:17.447 --> 00:38:22.008
in energy than the 3d state.
The same thing here for

00:38:22.008 --> 00:38:28.000
calcium, the next electron,
it goes into the 4s state.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.129
So the configuration is argon
4s 2.

00:38:32.129 --> 00:38:34.940
It's not argon 3d 2.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:40.211
4s is lower in energy than 3d.
I will show you a pneumonic in

00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:43.023
a moment to try to remember
that.

00:38:43.023 --> 00:38:45.746
Next scandium,
another electron.

00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:49.260
Well, now the 3d states start
filling up.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:54.268
4s 2 3d 1.
Titanium 4s 2 3d 2.

00:38:54.268 --> 00:38:57.431
Vanadium 4s 2 3d 3.

00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:02.000
Chromium, we have a problem.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.018
Chromium, we've got an
exception here.

00:39:05.018 --> 00:39:09.912
You might expect it to be 4s 2
3d 4 because

00:39:09.912 --> 00:39:12.685
we're just filling up the d
states.

00:39:12.685 --> 00:39:15.296
It turns out that's not the
case.

00:39:15.296 --> 00:39:19.864
It turns out that the chromium
configuration is 4s 1 3d 5.

00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:23.045
How do you know this?

00:39:23.045 --> 00:39:26.797
You don't know this.
There was no way to really

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:31.397
predict this.
This is an experimental

00:39:31.397 --> 00:39:35.359
observation.
It turns out that having a

00:39:35.359 --> 00:39:40.988
half-filled 4s shell and a
half-filled 3d shell is more

00:39:40.988 --> 00:39:47.347
stable than having a filled 4s
shell and four electrons in the

00:39:47.347 --> 00:39:50.579
3d states.
This is an exception.

00:39:50.579 --> 00:39:54.436
This is an exception you have
to know.

00:39:54.436 --> 00:39:56.000
Yes?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.024
I am going to say that in a
moment.

00:40:04.024 --> 00:40:07.404
It is an exception also for
molybdenum.

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:11.941
And we'll talk about it.
It is not the exception for

00:40:11.941 --> 00:40:16.300
tungsten or below.
So as we continue to go across,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.392
manganese, now we're going back
to our pattern.

00:40:20.392 --> 00:40:25.107
4s 2 3d 5.
Iron 4s 2 3d 6.

00:40:25.107 --> 00:40:28.131
Cobalt 4s 2 3d 7.

00:40:28.131 --> 00:40:32.605
Nickel 4s 2 3d 8.

00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:35.789
And here we've got another

00:40:35.789 --> 00:40:40.131
exception, copper.
Copper, if you followed our

00:40:40.131 --> 00:40:45.824
pattern, you might expect to be
4s 2 3d 9.

00:40:45.824 --> 00:40:49.298
It's not.
It is 4s 1 3d 10

00:40:49.298 --> 00:40:52.771
Again, it turns out that the

00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:58.754
overall atom is more stable if
that 4s state is half filled and

00:40:58.754 --> 00:41:05.545
the 3d state is totally filled.
Would you be able to predict

00:41:05.545 --> 00:41:08.818
that?
No, you're not going to be able

00:41:08.818 --> 00:41:12.363
to predict that.
This is an experimental

00:41:12.363 --> 00:41:17.818
observation and this is another
exception that you do have to

00:41:17.818 --> 00:41:19.272
know.
Next, zinc.

00:41:19.272 --> 00:41:22.545
Well, we're back to our pattern
here.

00:41:22.545 --> 00:41:27.000
This is 4s 2 3d 10.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.146
And then once the 3d 10
states are filled,

00:41:32.146 --> 00:41:37.798
or the 3d states are filled,
then we start filling the 4p

00:41:37.798 --> 00:41:42.238
states as we go across here,
this fourth row.

00:41:42.238 --> 00:41:47.183
And we get to the krypton inner
gas configuration.

00:41:47.183 --> 00:41:53.036
And these all follow a pattern.
Just fill the 4p states up.

00:41:53.036 --> 00:42:00.000
So chromium and copper are two
exceptions you have to know.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.842
Now, what happens as we go
across the fifth period here,

00:42:05.842 --> 00:42:10.091
right here?
We're starting with rubidium.

00:42:10.091 --> 00:42:14.446
Well, again,
the electron goes into the 5s

00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:19.864
state and not the 4d state.
5s is lower than the 4d.

00:42:19.864 --> 00:42:24.857
And for strontium,
the electron goes into the 5s

00:42:24.857 --> 00:42:32.281
state, not into the 4d state.
So you fill up those 5s states

00:42:32.281 --> 00:42:37.312
before you start filling up the
4d states here.

00:42:37.312 --> 00:42:42.781
And just like copper and
chromium are exceptions in

00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:47.921
filling the 3d states,
molybdenum and silver are

00:42:47.921 --> 00:42:51.750
exceptions in filling the 4d
states.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.015
These four exceptions,
chromium, copper,

00:42:56.015 --> 00:43:02.031
molybdenum and silver are
exceptions that you do have to

00:43:02.031 --> 00:43:06.613
know.
Along this fifth period here

00:43:06.613 --> 00:43:11.559
there are other exceptions.
I don't expect you to know

00:43:11.559 --> 00:43:16.599
that, but there are four
exceptions that you do need to

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:18.000
know.
Yes?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.609
Right.
I actually don't care which way

00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:39.121
you write the electron
configuration.

00:43:39.121 --> 00:43:44.975
I will care if I specifically
ask you which state is lower in

00:43:44.975 --> 00:43:48.097
energy.
But if you just write it,

00:43:48.097 --> 00:43:51.804
I actually don't care how you
write it.

00:43:51.804 --> 00:43:52.780
Okay?
Okay.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:44:00.000
Now, how do you remember what
the ordering is of these states?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.389
The energy ordering.
Well, here's a pneumonic for

00:44:05.389 --> 00:44:09.207
you.
Maybe you've seen this before.

00:44:09.207 --> 00:44:14.035
I'm going to start out writing
1s like this,

00:44:14.035 --> 00:44:20.547
and then I'm going to write
right underneath it 2s and then

00:44:20.547 --> 00:44:24.701
over one 2p, then 3s,
3p, 3d, then 4s,

00:44:24.701 --> 00:44:28.968
4p, 4d, 4f and then 5s,
5p, 5d, 5f, 6s,

00:44:28.968 --> 00:44:34.879
6p, 6d, 7s, 7p.
And that's all that's going to

00:44:34.879 --> 00:44:39.486
be important right now.
And now how do I use this

00:44:39.486 --> 00:44:43.229
pattern to generate the energy
ordering?

00:44:43.229 --> 00:44:46.012
Well, of course,
1s is lowest.

00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:50.619
But now I'm going to draw
diagonals through this.

00:44:50.619 --> 00:44:53.402
So, for example,
1s is lowest.

00:44:53.402 --> 00:44:57.529
And then the next higher energy
state is 2s.

00:44:57.529 --> 00:45:03.000
And then the next higher energy
state is 2p.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.662
And that state after that,
that's higher in energy is 3s.

00:45:08.662 --> 00:45:14.224
And then I draw another
diagonal so that the next higher

00:45:14.224 --> 00:45:19.786
energy state is 3p and 4s.
And draw another diagonal 3d,

00:45:19.786 --> 00:45:23.022
4p, 5s.
Draw another diagonal 4d,

00:45:23.022 --> 00:45:25.752
5p, 6s.
Another diagonal 4f,

00:45:25.752 --> 00:45:30.000
5d, 6p, 7s and another
diagonal.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.063
So that's how you remember the
relative energy ordering of

00:45:36.063 --> 00:45:40.744
these states.
You should be able to write the

00:45:40.744 --> 00:45:46.808
electron configuration of all
atoms in the periodic table,

00:45:46.808 --> 00:45:52.872
including the four exceptions.
There are other exceptions,

00:45:52.872 --> 00:45:56.808
but I won't expect you to write
those.

00:45:56.808 --> 00:46:02.659
Now, I have to tell you about
something that is a little

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:07.717
confusing.
And that is when we write down

00:46:07.717 --> 00:46:10.797
the electron configuration of
ions.

00:46:10.797 --> 00:46:15.871
What I'm about to say has
nothing to or doesn't change in

00:46:15.871 --> 00:46:20.763
any way what I just told you
about writing the electron

00:46:20.763 --> 00:46:25.745
configuration of neutrals,
but it does have something to

00:46:25.745 --> 00:46:31.000
do in writing the configuration
of positive ions.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.966
And here is the story.
If I actually look at the

00:46:35.966 --> 00:46:42.094
energies of the individual 4s
states and 3d states as we go

00:46:42.094 --> 00:46:46.426
across the fourth row,
potassium, calcium,

00:46:46.426 --> 00:46:50.758
scandium, titanium,
well, the 4s states in

00:46:50.758 --> 00:46:56.464
potassium and calcium are
actually lower in energy than

00:46:56.464 --> 00:47:00.087
the 3d states.
And, indeed,

00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:05.073
when we wrote the electron
configuration of the neutral,

00:47:05.073 --> 00:47:09.695
we put that electron,
that extra electron making the

00:47:09.695 --> 00:47:14.681
potassium in the 4s state and
that extra electron in the

00:47:14.681 --> 00:47:19.757
calcium making a 4s state.
But it turns out that right at

00:47:19.757 --> 00:47:22.929
this element,
scandium, Z equals 21,

00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:28.277
the energy of that 3d state
drops below the energy of the 4s

00:47:28.277 --> 00:47:32.537
state.
Does that have a consequence

00:47:32.537 --> 00:47:37.794
for how you write the electron
configuration of scandium or

00:47:37.794 --> 00:47:40.060
titanium, for example?
No.

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:45.498
The electron configuration for
titanium is still what I said,

00:47:45.498 --> 00:47:48.580
argon, 4s 2 3d 2.

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.836
The fact that this 3d state is
now lower in energy does not

00:47:53.836 --> 00:48:00.000
effect writing the electron
configuration of the neutral.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.416
Now, you might ask if the 3d
states here of titanium are

00:48:04.416 --> 00:48:08.109
lower in energy,
why don't the 4s hop over into

00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:10.518
the 3d?
They don't because this

00:48:10.518 --> 00:48:13.970
configuration,
again, minimizes the electron

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:17.102
repulsion.
If you put all four electrons

00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:22.080
in the 3d state there would be a
greater electron repulsion and

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.934
then the overall energy would
actually be higher.

00:48:25.934 --> 00:48:30.671
What I'm plotting here is just
the energy of 3d and just the

00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:35.366
energy of 4s.
But when you're looking at the

00:48:35.366 --> 00:48:40.099
electron configuration of an
ion, you have to look at all the

00:48:40.099 --> 00:48:42.938
interactions and all of the
energies.

00:48:42.938 --> 00:48:46.251
So for the neutral,
it's still what I said.

00:48:46.251 --> 00:48:50.905
However, now if I form an ion,
if I take titanium and I make

00:48:50.905 --> 00:48:54.297
titanium 2 plus,
you know the electrons that

00:48:54.297 --> 00:48:57.452
come out?
The electrons that come out are

00:48:57.452 --> 00:49:01.791
the electrons in the 4s state
because they're the higher

00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:06.139
energy state.
And so the electron

00:49:06.139 --> 00:49:12.445
configuration of titanium is the
argon 3d 2.

00:49:12.445 --> 00:49:16.162
That is important.
And, similarly,

00:49:16.162 --> 00:49:19.765
for that fifth row,
for rubidium,

00:49:19.765 --> 00:49:26.297
strontium 5s is lower than 4d.
But right here at yttrium 4d

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:31.700
drops below 5s.
That does not effect the

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:36.651
configuration that we wrote for
the neutrals.

00:49:36.651 --> 00:49:40.139
So, for example,
here is silver.

00:49:40.139 --> 00:49:44.190
It's a 5s 1 4d 10.

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:49.703
But if we make a silver ion,
silver plus,

00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:56.004
it's that 5s electron that
leaves because it's the higher

00:49:56.004 --> 00:50:00.842
energy electron.
And so the configuration is

00:50:00.842 --> 00:50:04.555
krypton 4d 10.
Okay.

00:50:04.555 --> 00:50:05.755
See you on Friday.
