has a huge advertising revenue and so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
has a huge advertising revenue and so
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.389

projects that have bigger impact and
 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.170
projects that have bigger impact and
societal impact kind of get ignored also

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
societal impact kind of get ignored also
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.889

will go away a lot of the things that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
will go away a lot of the things that
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830

were reaping the benefit of today was

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
were reaping the benefit of today was
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.540
were reaping the benefit of today was
because of the basic scientific research

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
because of the basic scientific research
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240
because of the basic scientific research
that we funded in the 60s and 70s and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
that we funded in the 60s and 70s and
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.500
that we funded in the 60s and 70s and
80s so if we stop

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510
80s so if we stop
 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.699
80s so if we stop
doing that kind of funding by the

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709
doing that kind of funding by the
 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.160
doing that kind of funding by the
government after a while it we just

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
government after a while it we just
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.949
government after a while it we just
won't have anything to build on top of

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
won't have anything to build on top of
 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.660
won't have anything to build on top of
we'll just be advertising and to each

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
we'll just be advertising and to each
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.490
we'll just be advertising and to each
other and and connecting with each other

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

social media and that's that's it and
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.949
social media and that's that's it and
that's not what we want to end out so

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959
that's not what we want to end out so
 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.289
that's not what we want to end out so
there is a role for government in terms

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299
there is a role for government in terms
 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.420
there is a role for government in terms
of promoting scientific research for

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
of promoting scientific research for
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.699
of promoting scientific research for
both the sake of scientists and also for

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709
both the sake of scientists and also for
 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.440
both the sake of scientists and also for
commercializing those the scientific

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
commercializing those the scientific
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.300
commercializing those the scientific
research government is the this is the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310
research government is the this is the
 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.770
research government is the this is the
only entity that can take a slightly

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780
only entity that can take a slightly
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.550
only entity that can take a slightly
longer point of view in terms of these

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
longer point of view in terms of these
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.800
longer point of view in terms of these
developments but I think it's it's good

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810
developments but I think it's it's good
 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.280
developments but I think it's it's good
for for that to happen because sometimes

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
for for that to happen because sometimes
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.199
for for that to happen because sometimes
good ideas need a little bit of funding

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209
good ideas need a little bit of funding
 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.530
good ideas need a little bit of funding
before they can become bigger ideas

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
before they can become bigger ideas
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:02.500
