ROMAN NURIK: Hi.

00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm Roman, and I helped design
and develop the Google I/O 2014

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.340
Android app.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.880
In this video, I'll dive into
how we use the new material

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.480
design approach to
build a visually

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.110
striking, consistent,
and adaptive Android app

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.230
for this year's conference.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.400
So what exactly is
material design?

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.020
At first glance, it may just
seem like a new visual design

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.810
language full of bright
colors and subtle shadows.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.910
But it's really
much more than that.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880
It's a system that we
pioneered that informs

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.320
all of our visual interaction
and motion design decisions

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.400
across mobile, desktop,
wearables, and beyond.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.540
Now every year at
Google I/O, our team

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.580
spends several whole months
working on the conference app.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.370
We do this for two reasons.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.200
First, it's obviously
a great companion

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.600
for the developers attending
the event and those tuning

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.670
in at home.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.770
Second, and arguably
more importantly,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.000
it serves as a reference
app for Android design

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.640
and development best practices.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.280
Now, this year's app uses
material design and features

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.150
of the L developer preview to
present content in a rational,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.880
consistent, adaptive,
and beautiful way.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.400
Let's take a look at some of
the decisions and outcomes that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.790
informed the app's design.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.170
In material design,
surfaces and shadows

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.810
play an important
role in conveying

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.860
the structure of your app.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.550
The material design
spec outlines a set

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.370
of layout principles that
help guide decisions like

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.590
where shadows should appear and
what is drawn on each surface.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.580
For example, here's
our first iteration

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.970
of tabs in the My
Schedule screen.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.720
It was problematic for
a number of reasons.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.910
The single shadow
below the action bar

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.910
conveys that there are
two sheets of paper,

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.450
one for the action
bar and another

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.450
for the tabs and
schedule contents.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.110
The problem is that the
bottom sheet is too complex.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.980
The ink that represents
the contents of a surface

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.410
should be pretty simple.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.240
Here, ink is doing too much
work, painting not only

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.670
text and icons but borders
and background colors.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.010
The result is visual noise.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.110
Our final iteration
was much stronger,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.310
creating a clear separation
between chrome and content,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.050
and letting the ink
focus on painting

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.000
only the important stuff--
things like text, icons,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.170
and accent strips.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.870
Another area where surfaces
played a role in our design

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.147
thinking was the detail screen.

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:12.730
In our first release,
as you scrolled,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.720
the top banner cross-faded
between the session image

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.550
and the session color.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.200
Our concern though
was that this design

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.990
bent the physics of
material design too far.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.300
It's as if the text
was sliding along

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.270
a surface whose
transparency changed

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.280
throughout the animation.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.490
A better approach, which
we introduced in an update

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.670
to the app on June 25, was
to create a shorter surface

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.490
below the image onto which
the title text was printed.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.490
This surface had a
more stable opacity.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.520
Before scrolling, the surface
is adjacent to the one

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.250
containing the body text,
forming what we call a scene.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.930
And as you scroll, this surface
and the floating action button

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.840
attached to it rises
above the body text,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.220
allowing the text to
scroll beneath it.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.770
This aligns better
with the physics

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.370
in the world of material design.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.970
And the end result is a more
coherent visual interaction

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.090
and motion story for our users.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.920
Now, another key principle
of material design

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.490
is that interfaces should be
bold, graphic, and intentional,

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.050
and that the foundational
elements of print design

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.070
should guide visual treatments.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.250
Color plays a huge role
in making that happen.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.660
In material design, UI
color palettes generally

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.310
consist of one primary
and one accent color.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.880
Large color fields like
the action bar background,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.330
for example, take on the 500
shade of the primary color,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.630
while smaller areas
like the status bar

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.270
can use a darker shade,
like the 700 value.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.020
The accent color is used more
subtly throughout the app

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.150
to call attention
to key elements.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.890
The resulting juxtaposition
of a tamer primary color

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.520
and a brighter accent
color gives the app

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.180
a bold, colorful look
without overwhelming

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.700
the app's actual content.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.230
In the I/O app,
we actually chose

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.550
to use two accent colors
used in various situations.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.290
Most accents were pink 500,
while the more conservative

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.670
light blue 500 was a better
fit for the Add to Schedule

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.570
button, which was often
adjacent to session colors.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.410
And speaking of session colors,
we color the detail screen

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.050
based on the session topic.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.570
For example, Android
sessions are green.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.940
This gives the screen that
bold and intentional look.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.990
And when choosing
our topic colors,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.680
we used a material
design color palette

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.330
which contained dozens
of great color options.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.530
We also needed to make sure
that each color contrasted

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.110
well enough with the floating
action button and session

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.060
images.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.370
Here's our test graphic that
let us visualize this contrast.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.250
Finally, we ensured
that topic colors

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.790
had a consistent brightness.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.680
Desaturating our test file
when choosing the colors

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.540
helped in that process.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.750
Now another foundational
element of print design

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.390
that's important in
successful material design

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.280
is layout, and
more specifically,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.390
margins and what
we call keylines.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.090
Now from previous
years of the I/O app,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.740
we'd already been
accustomed to using

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.840
a 4 dp grid for sizing things.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.780
For example, our buttons and
list items were 48 dps tall.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.420
However, the guidance on
keylines for material design

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.900
was new to us.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.730
After we started adhering to
the spec and, in particular,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.600
aligning titles and other
texts to that 72 dp keyline,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.630
we immediately felt that
clean, print-like rhythm

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.180
in our screens.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.980
Adhering to the keyline
allowed for very fast scanning

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.880
of UI text and information
on our screens.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.910
Gestalt principles for the win.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.730
Now while we're on
the subject of layout,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.580
remember that material design
applies across many device

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.550
types.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.450
It's right there
in the principles.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.400
A single underlying
design system

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.680
organizes interactions in space.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.100
Each device reflects
a different view

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.070
of the same underlying system.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.500
Now luckily, the spec
offers some great solutions

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.990
for designing across
multiple screen sizes.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.200
For example, many of the
screens in the I/O app

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.740
represent collections
of sessions.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.370
For these situations, the system
offers a number of containers,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.480
like lists, grids, and cards.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.910
Each of these can be used
across different screen sizes

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.170
to represent
collections of data.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.750
We originally
thought to use cards

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.970
to represent session items.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.930
It's a pretty natural choice.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.200
But in some cases, we
wanted to conserve space

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.120
by overlaying text and images.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.950
This simpler, more
homogeneous presentation

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.140
was less appropriate for cards.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.960
The card shadows
in corners would

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.750
hinder the scanability
in this context.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.030
We thought a grid would
be a better choice here.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.050
With grids, we could vary
the number of columns

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.620
based on available screen width.

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.020
And each grid tile could take
on different aspect ratios.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.975
The resulting presentation
was very flexible

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:44.420
and worked great, not
only on phones but also

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.580
7-inch and 10-inch tablets.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.720
Finally, there is a crucial
element that ties everything

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.519
together, and that's motion.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:54.810
While a big part of the motion
story of material design

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.380
is in transitions
between screens,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.430
apps can truly
delight users when

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.977
motion is used in ways
beyond the obvious.

00:07:01.977 --> 00:07:04.060
Let's take a look at some
of the delightful motion

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.380
we introduced in the app.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.510
First, touch feedback ripples.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.500
They're super, super satisfying.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.590
They're also built in as soon
as you switch to the material

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.000
theme in L. But we
wanted to make sure

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.960
that they looked really
good on any background.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.650
So we customized ripple
colors for many elements

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.390
to ensure the ripples were
visible but still subtle,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.280
regardless of the background.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.360
We also used both the
bounded and unbounded styles

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.550
where appropriate.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.150
But my personal favorite
detail hands down in the app

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.220
is the floating button
that adds or removes

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.050
a session to your schedule.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.930
On touch, a little ink ripple
reveals a new background color,

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:47.230
and the plus symbol spins and
transforms into a check mark.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.810
Finally, while it's a bit hard
to tell in this animation,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.280
if you press and
hold the button,

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.175
its shadow grows,
almost like the button

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:55.600
is lifting up to
meet your finger.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.160
The end result is
you end up pressing

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.221
the button a few times just to
see its delightful tricks again

00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:00.720
and again.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.130
I do it many times a day.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.570
So those were some of
the design decisions

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.320
we made for the I/O
2014 Android app.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.160
Material design
influenced everything,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.930
including surfaces, shadows,
color, layout, and motion

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.000
in the app.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.870
Overall, the system
played a huge role

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.850
in helping us create a visually
striking, consistent, and

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.230
adaptive Android app
for the conference.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.475
Now make sure to check
the material design spec

00:08:25.475 --> 00:08:28.680
at google.com/design for more
on this new design approach

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.120
and how it can help
you improve your apps.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.610
And if you're an
Android developer,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.750
check out the code for
the I/O app on Github

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.590
to see how the design is
implemented both for Android L

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.090
and for earlier versions.

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.640
Thanks.
