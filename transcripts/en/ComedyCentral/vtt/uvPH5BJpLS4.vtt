00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.075
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELCOME TO "THE
REPORT"!

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.244
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, IN HERE, OUT

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:14.248
THERE, ALL AROUND THE WORLD,
NATION, HUGE SHOW TONIGHT!

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.785
I AM EITHER VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE
EMMYS OR WONDERING WHY I WENT.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:24.458
(LAUGHTER)
EITHER WAY, I CANNOT WAIT TO

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.027
FIND OUT HOW I AM SO HUNG OVER.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.863
OH, EXCUSE ME, HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:33.433
MY STOUFFER FROZEN DINNER IS
READY!

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:35.035
AND, OH, KIDS! THERE'S NOTHING I
ENJOY MORE

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:43.243
THAN EATING A NICE, HOT
STOUFFER'S FAMILY-SIZE LASAGNA.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:45.546
I MAY NOT BE A WHOLE FAMILY, BUT

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.183
AFTER THIS, I WILL FEEL LIKE
I'VE GOT A BABY IN ME!

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.620
(LAUGHTER)
AND THE REASON I'M STOUFFIN' MY

00:00:53.654 --> 00:01:00.460
FACE IS THIS COMPANY HAILS FROM
THE 78th INSTALLMENT OF MY

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:01.662
434 PART SERIES, BETTER KNOW A
DISTRICT. TONIGHT, OHIO'S 11TH,

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.065
THE FIGHTING 11TH!

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:09.837
OHIO'S 11th, INCLUDES THE CITY
OF CLEVELAND, FOUNDED BY GENERAL

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.072
MOSES CLEVELAND IN 1796.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.643
AS OF 1800 THE CITY'S
POPULATION CONSISTED OF ONLY

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:21.081
THREE MEN -- A SOCIOLOGICAL
CONDITION KNOWN TODAY AS

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.951
NORTH DAKOTA.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:27.454
IN 1879, CLEVELAND BECAME THE
WORLD'S FIRST CITY TO BE LIGHTED

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.655
ELECTRICALLY.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.357
RESIDENTS WERE PROUD OF THE
ACHIEVEMENT, THOUGH DISAPPOINTED

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.759
TO SEE MORE OF CLEVELAND.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.130
(LAUGHTER)
THE 11th IS HOME TO THE MIGHTY

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:45.973
CUHAHOGA RIVER, ONCE SO
POLLUTED, IT SPURRED THE


00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.174
CREATION OF THE EPA AFTER
CATCHING ON FIRE 13 TIMES.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:49.843
AFTER THE FIRST 12 FIRES THEY
REALIZED THEY SHOULDN'T TRY TO

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:52.246
PUT THEM OUT WITH RIVER WATER.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:55.449
IN 1935, THE DISTRICT WAS THE
FIRST PLACE OF ALCOHOLICS

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.820
ANONYMOUS FOUNDED BY BILL WILSON
AND DR. BOB SMITH.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:00.554
OH, SHOOT!

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.156
FOUNDED BY TWO GUYS.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.624
SORRY.

00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:08.362
(LAUGHTER)
OKAY.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:11.365
OHIO'S 11th IS THE HOME OF THE
CAVALIERS, THE BROWNS AND THE

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:16.537
CLEVELAND INDIANS, A TEAM SO BAD
THAT THEY ARE IN LAST PLACE AT

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.437
OFFENDING NATIVE AMERICANS.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.341
(LAUGHTER)
THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:25.479
IN CLEVELAND ATTRACTS HUNDREDS
OF THOUSANDS OF TOURISTS TO THE

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:26.580
11th EACH YEAR.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:33.086
THIS YEAR THE HALL INDUCTED
'70s ROCK BAND KISS WHOSE

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:38.158
FRONT MAN GENE SIMMONS IS THE
ONLY THING MORE POLLUTED

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.326
THAN THE CUYAHOGA RIVER.

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.663
AND WHO HAS THE CLEVELAND ROCKS
TO REPRESENT THE DISTRICT?

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:46.166
IT'S NONE OTHER THAN
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA FUDGE THE

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.502
HEAD OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK
CAUCUS.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.971
I SAT DOWN WITH REPRESENTATIVE
FUDGE IN HER WASHINGTON OFFICE.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.774
CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:54.341
&gt;&gt; MY PLEASURE.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.976
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.047
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TELL ME ABOUT THE
FIGHTING 11th.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.184
&gt;&gt; THE 11th, THOUGH MY OPINION
IS PROBABLY BIASED, IS THE BEST

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:05.319
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.255
WE HAVE THE BEST ORCHESTRA, THE
BEST HEALTHCARE WITH THE

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:10.224
CLEVELAND CLINIC, UNIVERSITY
HOSPITALS AND --

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:12.059
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LeBRON, AM
I RIGHT?

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:14.061
UP TOP?

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:14.561
&gt;&gt; LeBRON.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:15.562
&gt;&gt; Stephen: UP TOP?

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:17.598
YOU MUST BE EXCITED HE'S
RETURNING TO CLEVELAND.

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:18.832
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:21.568
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU MUST BE PRETTY
EXCITED WHEN ANYONE IS RETURNING

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.736
TO CLEVELAND.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.472
&gt;&gt; I AM EXCITED HE'S COMING BACK
TO CLEVELAND, ABSOLUTELY.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.175
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOUR DISTRICT IS
HOME TO MICELI DAIRY PRODUCTS

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:34.248
AND YOU ALSO HOST AN ANNUAL
LEMONADE STAND DAY

00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:36.683
AND YOU WERE BORN
IN YOUR DISTRICT?

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:37.818
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:39.186
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT ACCURATE TO
SAY MILK, MILK, LEMONADE,

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:43.624
AROUND THE CORNER FUDGE IS MADE?

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:50.397
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; I GUESS, YES.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.268
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THAT PHRASE CAME FROM

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:57.171
CLEVELAND IS KNOWN FOR ITS
FANTASTIC HEALTHCARE.

00:03:57.204 --> 00:03:58.338
&gt;&gt; CORRECT.

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:02.576
THE CLEVELAND CLINIC IS THE
SITE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST FACE

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:03.043
TRANSPLANT.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:04.044
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:10.784
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DO I KNOW YOU
ARE MARTHA FUDGE?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:12.152
PERHAPS SOMEONE STOLE YOUR FACE,
PUT IT ON THEIR BODY AND

00:04:12.186 --> 00:04:13.153
IS NOW HERE TO REPRESENT
THEMSELVES AS MARTHA FUDGE

00:04:13.187 --> 00:04:15.088
THE CLEVELAND CLINIC HAS MADE
THAT A REALITY

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:16.957
&gt;&gt; I'VE HAD THIS FACE A LONG
TIME.

00:04:17.057 --> 00:04:17.824
A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ME.

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:19.893
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LET ME ASK YOUR
OPINION.

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.061
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.565
&gt;&gt; Stephen: DO YOU THINK I
SHOULD JUST GET A FRESHEN UP

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:25.632
OR GET A WHOLE TEAR-DOWN AND
HAVE A NEW ONE PUT ON.

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:26.700
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU LOOK FINE.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:28.669
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M THINKING JUST
A LITTLE, LIKE THIS.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:32.940
JUST, HI! I'VE JUST BEEN
SLEEPING A LOT.

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:33.941
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:34.208
&gt;&gt; Stephen: REALLY?

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.509
YES.

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:36.677
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.312
LET'S MOVE ON TO ANOTHER
SUBJECT.

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:43.483
WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT CHILDREN
FROM EL SALVADOR AND GUATAMALA

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:46.453
AND HONDURAS WHO ARE COMING TO
OUR SOUTHERN BORDER IN DROVES?

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.755
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE
LAW AND THE LAW SAYS THAT WE

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.092
HAVE TO GIVE THEM A DUE PROCESS
HEARING AND DETERMINE IF, IN

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.661
FACT, THEY SHOULD BE SENT BACK
OR IF THEY CAN STAY IN THIS

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:55.762
COUNTRY.

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:59.433
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE LAW ALSO SAYS
TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:00.200
&gt;&gt; IT DOES AND WE DO.

00:05:00.234 --> 00:05:01.568
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW SO?

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:04.471
THEY'RE GETTING ACROSS, TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF THESE KIDS, IF THEY

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.372
ARE KIDS.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:09.176
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THEY ARE
CHILDREN.

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.312
GUATEMALAIANS ARE VERY WONDERFUL
BUT VERY SMALL PEOPLE

00:05:12.346 --> 00:05:14.781
(LAUGHTER)
ANY ONE OF THEM COULD BE ADULTS

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:17.050
WEARING A KID'S SUIT.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.087
&gt;&gt; WE PUT LAWS IN PLACE FOR A
REASON.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.290
THE 2008 LAW SIGNED BY PRESIDENT
GEORGE BUSH NEEDS TO BE

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.424
ENFORCED.

00:05:24.458 --> 00:05:27.094
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU FOUGHT FOR
IMMIGRATION REFORM TO INCLUDE

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.061
IMMIGRANTS FROM AFRICA.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.796
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.165
WE TRIED THAT FOR 300 YEARS AND
IT WAS TERRIBLE FOR BOTH SIDES

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.234
TO BRING ALL THOSE IMMIGRANTS
OVER HERE

00:05:34.268 --> 00:05:37.371
(LAUGHTER)
LED TO A HUGE PROBLEM.

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:44.211
LED TO A WAR.

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.846
&gt;&gt; IT WAS OVER SLAVERY.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.982
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE SAYING THE
WAR WASN'T OVER SLAVERY.

00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:49.483
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:50.651
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT WAS?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:52.419
BUT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY
BECAUSE PEOPLE FROM AFRICA WERE

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.489
TRYING TO COME ACROSS OUR
BORDERS AS IMMIGRANTS.

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:57.624
WE WERE BROUGHT HERE AGAINST OUR
OWN WILL.

00:05:57.658 --> 00:05:59.927
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, HISTORY WILL
BE THE JUDGE.

00:06:00.027 --> 00:06:03.931
(LAUGHTER)
SPEAKING OF PEOPLE OF COLOR.

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.669
JOHN BOEHNER.

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.137
YOU HELD HANDS WITH MITCH
MCCONNELL AND JOHN BOEHNER

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.139
AND SANG WE SHALL OVERCOME
RIGHT? TO COMMEMORATE THE

00:06:12.172 --> 00:06:19.313
1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT

00:06:19.346 --> 00:06:20.080
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:21.515
&gt;&gt; Stephen: RACISM IS OVER,
RIGHT?

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:22.683
&gt;&gt; NO, IT IS NOT.

00:06:22.716 --> 00:06:28.055
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW COULD YOU HAVE
DONE THAT IF THERE WAS STILL

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:28.889
RACISM?

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:30.324
&gt;&gt; IT SAYS WE SHALL, AT SOME
POINT WE WILL.

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.193
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ♪♪ WE HAVE OVERCOME.
♪♪

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:34.194

&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:45.672
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
AT THE MOST EGREGIOUS PART OF

00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:52.279
RACISM, JIM CROW ERA, '50s,
'60s, IS THERE ANY PART OF IT

00:06:52.312 --> 00:06:53.413
THAT YOU MISS?

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:54.181
&gt;&gt; NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:57.584
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY. MAY I?

00:06:57.618 --> 00:07:00.220
THE DRINKING FOUNTAINS.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:05.125
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DON'T
THINK THERE SHOULD BE WHITE OR

00:07:05.158 --> 00:07:07.427
BLACK DRINKING FOUNTAINS.

00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:09.129
ANYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRINK
FROM ANY THEY WANT.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:10.364
BUT THERE WERE TWICE AS MANY
DRINKING FOUNTAINS

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:14.835
IT WAS JUST MORE CONVENIENT, YOU
KNOW.

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.905
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK DRINKING
FOUNTAINS ARE THE MOST SANITARY

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:18.906
THING ANYWAY.

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:19.540
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOUR BIGGEST
PROBLEM WITH THOSE

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:20.941
IS THAT THEY'RE UNSANITARY?

00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:21.808
&gt;&gt; NO, MY BIGGEST PROBLEM IS
THAT THERE WERE

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.043
WHITE FOUNTAINS
AND BLACK FOUNTAINS.

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:27.314
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO USE EITHER ONE, WHY IS IT A

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:28.182
PROBLEM?

00:07:28.215 --> 00:07:31.552
&gt;&gt; IT RESTRICTED MOVEMENT IN OUR
NATION.

00:07:31.585 --> 00:07:32.753
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I AGREE. YOU AND I
ARE

00:07:32.786 --> 00:07:36.089
SINGING THE SAME TUNE HERE,
ALTHOUGH WITH DIFFERENT LYRICS.

00:07:36.123 --> 00:07:39.259
(LAUGHTER)
CLEVELAND IS THE HOME TO THE

00:07:39.293 --> 00:07:40.527
ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. CAN
YOU GET ME IN?

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:41.261
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:43.063
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I HAVE TWO
GRAMMIES.

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.264
I HAD A BAND IN THE '80s
CALLED STEPHEN AND THE COLBERTS.

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:48.735
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE SONG "I'M
