00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.900
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.200
&gt;&gt; Manuel Roig-Franzia:
Mark's current book is called

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.160
"Havana: A Subtropical Delirium."

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.710
I think you'll find it
a very interesting book.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.490
He takes you to some places in
Havana in this really magical

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.020
and very special city that
I think you would not get

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.360
if you were just reading the
headlines about Cuba today.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.280
He takes you to the cemetery
where people go to pray

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.620
for their pregnant wives,
because a corpse had been found

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.160 position:56%
with the child in the mother's arms.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.260
And he takes you into the kitchens

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.500
where people are making these
incredible Cuban dishes.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.250
And I loved the recipe but said,
"Kill the chicken with the machete.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.750
Chop up the chicken
with the same machete."

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.350
With that, I introduce
Mark Kurlansky.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.150
Please give him a big hand.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.340
[ Applause ]

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.780
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Thank you.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.380
A pleasure to be here.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.090
You know, these days if you
travel around the world,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.830
Washington DC has a reputation for
kind of ignorance and backwardness.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.480
But here we are, writers
and readers together,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.250
showing that there's
another Washington

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.510
and there's another America.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.830
This book came about because the
publisher Bloomsbury was doing a

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.050
series where they asked
different writers to write

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.620
about a city that they loved.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.950
A small, somewhat personal book.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.260
Somebody did Paris and somebody did
Florence and somebody did Prague.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.170
And then they said, "Oh, why don't
we get Kurlansky to to do Havana?"

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.700
And there is a certain
amount of logic to this.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.270
I've been going to Havana fairly
regularly since the early 1980s.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.140
But also, I am a guy you should
get to write about the city.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.070
You know, it's like
I'm not a naturalist.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.370
I'm an urbanist.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.670
I love cities.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.020
And I love the Caribbean.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.480
I've written four or five books
books about the Caribbean.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.440
I'm losing track, but
a bunch of books.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.260
And Havana is the great
Caribbean city.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:52.410
This was an opportunity for me
but it's a somewhat personal book

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.490
and a small book in
the traditional style.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:05.470
In my tradition, it also goes on
to talk about culture and food

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.980 position:56%
and all things I keep talking about.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.790 position:56%
The subtitle, "A Tropical
Delirium," it's a quote from a quote

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.970
from a Cuban novelist,
Emilio Estevez,

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:32.860
a book called "Los Palacios
Distantes," in which he wrote

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.840
of Havana, "This subtropical
delirium under the sun by the edge

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.370
of a beautiful bay,
diabolically beautiful,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.620
open to the perilous waters
of the Gulf of Mexico,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.390
swarming with sharks
and lost souls."

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.190
That's about as great a description
of Havana as I've ever heard.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.410
My own description of
Havana is that it's

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:08.070
like an unshaven man
wearing a tattered tuxedo.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.090
Havana is very tattered nowadays.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.140
People blame it on the
revolution, you know,

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.360
in a sort of compulsive way will
accept that charge and say, "Well,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.470
it's the fault of the embargo.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.120
We couldn't get any paint."

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.440
But the choice is that Havana has
always been somewhat tattered.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.690
If you go back and look
at Walker Evans photos

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.320
from the 30s, it looks tattered.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.540
And in literature the 19th
and even 18th century,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.870
they describe how tattered
and crumbling it is.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.930
What happens with Havana is
that there's a neighborhood

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.710
where everybody wants to live.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.800
Originally it was what we now call
[Foreign Language], Old Havana.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.660
Some wealthy people built big
mansions and then new styles

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.550 position:56%
of architecture come and wealthy
people want to have a different kind

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.400
of house and more space, so
they moved out beyond the wall

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.510
to the Prado, and then they moved

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.300
to [Foreign Language],
and then on to Miramar.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.680
As they move on, these big fabulous
homes are kind of abandoned.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.920
And the thing about the tropics
is that it eats buildings.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.180
If you do not repair them
constantly, they fall apart.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.410
So the buildings that
they are taking care of,

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.810
for instance Hemingway's house,
they are repairing almost nonstop.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:49.160
So buildings that get left
behind are really falling apart

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.240
and that's the look of Havana.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.780
It's a hot place, that you
can go in January or February

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.990
and it will be 70 degrees,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.880
maybe even a little cooler,
which is very pleasant.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.140
But I always tell people,
"Don't go then,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.240
because you're not really
experiencing Havana."

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.440
You want to be in Havana,
it's got to be really hot

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.470
and you've got to be sweating.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.790
Havana is all about sweat.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.110
Everybody sweats, you know.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.740
In this country, you don't sweat.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.660 position:56%
In Miami, which has pretty much the
same climate, nobody sweats in Miami

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.600
because nobody is out
of air conditioning

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.520
for more than 30 seconds.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.830
But in Havana, it's part of life.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.720
You read almost any piece
of literature from Havana,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.380
and they describe people sweating.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.480
Sweating was the original
classlessness, you know.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.510
Everybody sweats.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.800
In [Inaudible] great novel,
[Foreign Language],"The Chase,"

00:06:50.800 --> 00:07:00.010 position:56%
there's this description of women in
the opera wearing furs and sweating.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:10.280
People are outside and
they are walking around.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.520
Habaneros, if they go to Miami then
they go to Little Havana in Miami

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.050
and expect to find something like
Havana, they come back, they say,

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.890
"Oh, Little Havana, that
was nothing like Havana.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.570
There was nobody on the street."

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.950
Guillermo Cabrera Infante,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.370
who was probably the funniest
writer Cuba ever produced,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.310
has a scene in his book
about Havana in the 1950s.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.270
Three guys are walking down
the street and he says,

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.660
"And you know they were Habaneros
because they were walking

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.960
down the middle of a street."

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.890
Sidewalks are narrow and crumbling

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.820
and everybody just works
through the streets.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.950
They walk in the traffic.

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.970
Walking and sweating is
the life and have been up.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.890
My first trip to Havana
was in the early 1980s,

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.540
and I was a newspaper
correspondent in Mexico City.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.080
And the Cuban ambassador
to Mexico invited a bunch

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.190 position:56%
of correspondents to come to Havana.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.150
He was a very affable
man whose nickname

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.760
for me was Emohito [phonetic].

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.460
I have no idea why.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.840
So a bunch of us correspondents
were going to Havana,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.700 position:56%
and we were in the press room at the
US Embassy waiting for a briefing

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.170 position:56%
from the ambassador, and we were all
talking about this upcoming trip.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.950
And the CIA guy came in.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.130
He said, "You're Americans,
you can't go to Havana."

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.050
And we informed him that we could

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:44.230
because we were correspondents
and we were going.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.110
So right there is going to
be a great trip, you know,

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.090
because there's nothing
greater than going somewhere

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.110
after the CIA tells you you can't.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:59.250
And that Havana, very
different from Havana today,

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.140
was subsidized by the Soviet union.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.770
And it was an experimental
society where everything was new

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.830
and everything was an experiment.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.280
One of the great advantages

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.310
of not being a democracy is you
do something, if it doesn't work,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.680
you say, "Whoops, well, now
we're going to do this instead."

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.070
And they were just trying
out all sorts of things.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.620
They changed wedding vows.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.550
You were at your wedding,
the groom vowed to do a share

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.860
of the housework, and
all these things.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:36.350
And they put us up at Havana Libre,
which used to be the Havana Hilton

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.300
and was the newest hotel in Havana.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.120
Still probably the
newest hotel in Havana.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.160
It opened just shortly
before the revolution.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.840
Sort of a sterile high-rise
building.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.450
The phones are all
tapped, so that's why they

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.980
like to put the journalists
in there.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.610
They were very proud of this.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.660
They had all these agents
that hung out in the lobby.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.030
And you'd be on the phone and you
make an appointment with somebody

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.530
for lunch, and then
you go downstairs

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.220
to leave the hotel to go to lunch.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.080
And this guy would come up
to you and he'd say, "Oh,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.870
so you're meeting so-and
so at the Floradita?

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.170
That's great."

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.730
They wanted you to know
that they were listening.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.700
It wasn't a problem.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.970
That Havana was such
a different world.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.670
There were very few
restaurants, very few hotels.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.420
And very few Americans.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:35.970
Being an American in Havana was
oddly okay, in spite of the fact

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.580
that our government was
trying to starve them.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.230
Nobody seemed to have any
bad feelings about Americans.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.200
They still don't.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.070
I can't explain that, except that
it's famously a characteristic

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.230
of Habaneros, that they just
love foreigners of all kinds.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:57.810
So this book is not
really a history book.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:03.900
The Indian historian
[Inaudible] once said that

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.430
"History is the rear-view mirror
that is the crystal ball."

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:15.100 position:56%
So if you really want to understand
Havana and you want to get some idea

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.770
of what might be happening
in the future,

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.450
you have to look at the history.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.470
And one of the things that's really
characteristic of Havana history is

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.770
that there's always been change.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.460
I mean, people talk about
how there's change now,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.870
but the change that's
going on in Havana

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.620
and Cuba now are minor compared
to the changes that went

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.430
on in the early 1990s after the
collapse of the Soviet Union,

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.170
which of course in turn were also
minor compared to the changes

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.130
that went on in the 1960s when the
revolution was getting started.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.450
And you can go back and back,
and there's always these changes.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:56.230
Havana was founded three times,
different places all called Havana.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.090
The first one was on the southern
coast in the malarial swamp

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:05.950
and everybody was getting sick.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.850
The southern coast is a mistake.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.550 position:56%
This happens in Caribbean countries.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.160
They want to put a city
on the southern coast

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.490
because it's the Caribbean.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:16.640
It's a calm, very beautiful water.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.220
But the rougher Atlantic side is
actually where you want to be,

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.230
because then you have direct access

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.400
to North America and
Mexico and Europe.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.700
It's in the shipping line.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.580
If you're on the southern
side, you have to go

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.540
through a treacherous
passage between islands get

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.870
out into the shipping lines.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:42.710
So this malarial swamp where they
were living called Havana happened

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.540
to be on the thinnest
part of the island.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.310
So it was a very short move
to get to the north coast

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.580
where they found another
malarial swamp to settle in.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.500
And then somebody realized
that it's not good to live

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.020
in malarial swamps in the tropics.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:02.390
And there was this place not
far away that had high ground

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.820
and an incredible deep water
port with a narrow opening,

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.260
so it was very sheltered.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:17.660
And so they moved there and that
became the Havana that we know now.

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:23.120
So the Spanish took
everything he stole from Mexico

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.010
and they dropped it off in
Havana to move it on to Spain.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.200
And every pirate in
the Caribbean knew

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.050
that all this loot was
lying around in Havana.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.890
So Havana was constantly raided
by pirates and by everybody

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:44.550
and was burned to the ground
several times and often looted.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.450
This is the way of life in Havana.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.920
The streets were very narrow
because it was more defendable

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:58.300
and they were just always
braced for the next attack.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.930
The final attack, 1762,
the British attacked.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.590
The British government
had their own reasons.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.230
They just wanted to hold
Havana so they could trade it

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.350
for something else,
Florida actually,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.410
which some people have said was
a mistake but it's our good.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:27.960
So the commander of the British
forces inspired his troops

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.670
by saying, "Come on
lads, let's attack Havana

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.900
and we'll all be rich as Jews."

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.650
And they were.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.040
They got absolutely nothing.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:47.510
There was no loot lying around,
and the British soon left.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:52.430
The Spanish then sealed
off the harbor with chains,

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.780
built a wall around the city,

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:59.030
and at nighttime they
would put out with chains.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.440 position:56%
They would lock all the gates to
the city and they would fire cannons

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.590
to let you know that Havana
was sealed in for the night.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.640
Isn't it interesting that
they still fire those cannons.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.060
I mean, the chains are gone, the
walls gone, the gates are gone.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.090
But there's still that
psychological thing

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:20.030 position:56%
in the tradition letting people know
that you're sealed in for the night.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:30.010
Foreigners go to Havana and they
see this beautiful blue ocean

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.130
with a purple stripe
that is the Gulfstream,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.110
which is why Hemingway moved there.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.590
And they think, "Oh,
this is beautiful.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.890
This is wonderful.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:42.190
What a great setting."

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.550
Habaneros hate the sea.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.420
They have a dread of the sea.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:55.220
The most famous Havana writer José
Marti wrote [inaudible] fear I hate

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.650
the sea.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.080
The reason they hate the sea
is because of the bad things

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.230 position:56%
that are going to come from the sea.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:11.570
Habaneros are always ready prepared
for invasion, even matchbooks

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.740
which of course like everything
else are made by the government,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.140
and the matchbooks say on
it "Ready for Defense."

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.800
Charles Makowski, the
American writer,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.170
once wrote that the definition
of a paranoid was a man

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:31.590
in possession of all the facts.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.260
When you look at the history
of Cuba and you look at Havana

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.820
and why Havana is so different
from the rest of Cuba,

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.890
the distinct characters,
social characteristics of Cuba,

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:49.830
you have to look at slavery.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.550
Cuba has the longest
history of slavery

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:56.940
of any place in the Americas.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.940
The barbarism of it
is beyond imagination.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.680
It was the first slaving country
in the Americas in the beginning

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:14.940
of the 1500s, and slavery
remained in Cuba until 1886.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.830
It was so recent that when I first
went to Cuba, I would meet people

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:24.870
who knew your grandparents
who were African-born slaves.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.430
So it's something we
haven't gotten over,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:34.070
but it's even more
recent for Cubans.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:40.050
There was a division in
Cuba which remained --

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:44.310
there was this one
side, the slavers.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.770
The people ask sometimes why
Cuba stayed a Spanish colony

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.900
so much longer than anywhere
else in the Americas.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.320
The reason is that the landowning
slaveowning oligarchy wanted the

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.230
Spanish so that the Spanish
army could protect them

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.660
from slave uprisings.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:12.940
So you had the wealthy
pro-slave side, pro-Spanish,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:18.720 position:56%
and you had the people who wanted
independence who were abolitionists.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.890 position:56%
And this was the complete breakdown.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.470
And it remained till
the Cuban revolution,

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:30.780
the Castro '59 revolution
when Castro took power.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.310
The first people to
leave Cuba and turn

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.710
against the revolution were the
descendents of the landowners

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.830
who had been pro- Spanish
and had had slaves.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:48.640
The early and the long-standing
enthusiasts

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.990
of the revolution were
people who had come

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:56.420 position:56%
from the the abolitionist
pro-independent anti-Spanish people,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:03.470
including, of course,
people of color.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.390
Which is why non-Cuban people
in Miami don't understand

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:11.040 position:56%
that Cuba is largely a black country

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.510
because all the Cubans
in Miami are white.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:20.610
What made Havana very different
from the rest of Cuba is

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:25.840
that it was the largest
free black population.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.010
And the reason for that was that in
Spanish law, a slave had the right

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.760
to buy his or her freedom.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.710
But of course, there's a catch, and
that is that if you were a slave

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.270
at a sugar plantation, you
don't have any opportunity

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.510
to earn money to buy your freedom.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.430
But if you were a slave
in a household in Havana,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.420
there were various things you
could do on the streets of Havana,

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.430
including prostitution or selling
something or all kinds of things

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.810
that many earned money
and bought their freedom.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.480
So there was this large
free population.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.120
There was also a large
mixed population,

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:10.330 position:56%
especially because slaveowners would
have relations with their slaves,

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:16.040
and the mixed children
were automatically free.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:23.360 position:56%
But these free blacks and mixed did
not have the status of white people.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.220
They were not allowed to
be called senor or senora.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.030
They were not allowed
in certain restaurants,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.300
certain seats in the
theater, certain jobs.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:39.100
There were people in between who
were struggling for position.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:47.970
And among these people were women
of mixed blood called mulattas,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:53.760
and mulatta is still very much a
part of Cuban culture and the ideas

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:58.040
that mulattas are beautiful
sexual creatures.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.580
This is all profoundly
based on racism and sexism,

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.720
and it was about these
women struggling

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.210
for some kind of a standing.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.410
If you had a relationship
with a wealthy white person,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.340
that would improve your status.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:18.060
And so, there was this
reputation and it endures,

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.430
this idea that mulattas are
incredible sexual figures.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.880
A lot of things endure.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:32.530
There's a novel, "Cecelia
Valdez," which is the central novel

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.460
of Havana literature the same
way Don Quixote is in Spain

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.830
or Les Miserables to Paris
or some of Dickens to London.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:47.540 position:56%
By a writer named Cirilo Villaverde,
who actually like José Marti,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.580
lived most of his life
in New York in exile.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:22:01.220
And it's the story of the
unfair tragic life of a mulatta,

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.580
and the book is dedicated
to the women of Cuba.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.040
And it's incredible to read

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.450
because it has great
detailed descriptions of life.

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.750
You know, if you want to see life

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:18.240
in 19th-century Havana,
just read this book.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.590 position:56%
Havana, more than anywhere else in
Cuba, is a place of African culture.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:31.670
The most practiced religion
in Havana is Santeria

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.720
which is basically the religion

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.000
of the Urobas [phonetic]
of West Africa, Nigeria.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.150
And you know, revolutions
are kind of like --

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.130
you ever play this game with
your kids, opposite day?

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.130
That's what revolutions are like.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.710
It's opposite day.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:57.310
Before the revolution,
Santeria was outlawed,

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.030
and the Catholic Church
was the established church.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.250
So the revolution was
anti-Catholic Church,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.170
and so everybody wanted
to be a Santero.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:15.340 position:56%
The religion, back when it was
outlawed, was hidden in Catholicism,

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:21.560
so all the African spirits
are hidden in Catholic saints.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:29.860
So [Inaudible] who heals the sick,
is represented as St. Lazarus.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.680
And there is a Catholic
Church shrine to Saint Lazarus

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.800 position:56%
on the outskirts of Havana, and once
a year everybody makes pilgrimages

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.960
there, and the few
Catholic clergy left

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.840
in Havana say, "Oh, look at this.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.770
People still really
care about Catholicism."

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.810
But most of the people who are
going there are going there

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:54.240
for Babalú Ayé, which yes,
is the Desi Arnez song.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:59.990
The Desi Arnez song is
about the Santeria spirit.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:08.220
Music, of course, is of African
roots and the main tradition

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:13.710
of Havana music is a song which
was not first created in Havana

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.720
but it took over Havana,
and it was also outlawed

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.040
but has remained deep
in the culture.

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.300
An anthropologist in Havana
once told me that if you look

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:28.590
at Habaneros sort of idly
tapping their fingers,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.970
you'll see that they're
always beating

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.400
out song, which is a great idea.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.880
So every time somebody is tapping
out their fingers, I try to listen,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.280
but I've never really gotten it.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.630
What I have noticed is that you
hear music everywhere in Havana,

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.130
partly because there's no windows.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.650
There's rod-iron gratings and no
glass so that breezes can blow

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.930
through and everybody has music in
their homes in addition to the fact

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.850
that there's live music in all
of the bars and restaurants.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.250
So as you walk down
the street in Havana,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.090
you're just hearing music
after music after music.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.410
And when the music is sung, which
is quite often, you watch people.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.660
There's a peculiar saunter
of Habaneros, and yes,

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.820
it's exactly to the rhythm of song.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:20.200
Somebody became famous in
the rest of the world in 1928

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.090
when a singer named Rita
Montaner sang the song called

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.380
"El Manisero, the Peanut Vendor."

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:32.950 position:56%
There used to be lots of street
vendors in Havana and this is a song

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.060
to the street vendor and
it's about buy your peanuts,

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.040
these peanuts are delicious.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.770
You can go on YouTube
and you can get a film

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.620
of Rita Montaner singing
"El Manisero."

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.390
It's extraordinary.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.690
She's in this state of
ecstasy, what I call my book

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.830
"delirium" about the peanut vendor.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.780
Of course, this being Cuba,
everybody insists, "Ah yeah,

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.940 position:56%
well it's not really about peanuts."

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:05.160
I don't know, but catch the film.

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.600
It's tremendous.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.450
People in Havana have a
particular way of talking.

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:14.710
They don't speak Spanish
like anywhere else,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.980
and that is also an
African influence.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:25.490
It's kind of like words are very
hot and they have to spit them

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.260
out of their mouth
as fast as possible.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:31.880
They drop a lot of
syllables and they drop a lot

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.310 position:56%
of phonemes, especially S's and R's.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.970
There's no S's and R's, which seems
to be an African characteristic.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.200
In Haitian Creole, there's
no S's or R's either.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:49.140
So people from Havana always
called me Guillanki [phonetic],

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.660
which I think is kind of nice.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.300
"Hey, Guillanki."

00:26:55.300 --> 00:27:04.630
They have this way of speaking,
this S and R-less way of speaking.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.010
When the S is gone, they
replace it with an aspiration.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:16.370
So mas o menos, which means more
or less, in Havana is maco meno.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:22.670
Although I am fluent in Spanish,
it always takes me about a day

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.850
in Havana to start understanding
what people are saying.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.970
But Fidel Castro was not
from Havana, and he spoke --

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.730
and also he was a lawyer
-- he spoke very clearly

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:35.470
and was easy to understand.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.420
All the journalists loved
the way Fidel Castro spoke.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.140
They is , "God, I wish everybody
in Havana spoke like Fidel.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:47.760
I can understand him."

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:53.540
Another essential of Havana and
of Cuba in general is baseball.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:56.170
In Cuban baseball,
there's no trading players,

00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:02.080
so everybody plays their entire
career for their hometown,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.350
which means that Havana
has the best teams

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:10.320
because they can draw
from 2 million people.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:17.520
And some of these teams are
drawn from 50,000 people.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.170
So you have people like
[Inaudible] who plays for the Mets.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:26.990
Said he didn't leave Cuba
for political reasons.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:35.090
He left it for an opportunity in
baseball, because if he stayed

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.740
in Cuba, he would have been playing

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.490
for his small town,
but never one forever.

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.790
So what does he do?

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:46.950
He goes to the Mets.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:57.170
In Cuban ballparks, the only
snack they serve as Cuban coffee

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:01.830 position:56%
in these incredible pieces of paper
that they fold into an espresso cup.

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:09.570
And near the fifth inning, they go
out and serve coffee to the umpires

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.850
that they've been cursing
for the past five innings.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.570
That is a much better system
than in the rest of Cuba

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:21.820
where they only serve lollipops.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.570
Have you ever tried
to curse somebody

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.200 position:56%
out while you're sucking a lollipop?

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:30.900
It's just not effective.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.490
But the thing to understand
about Cuban baseball players

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.460 position:56%
in this country is how they come
here and at first they're not really

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.930 position:56%
as good as they were supposed to be.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.760
You've got to remember that this
guy is playing for the first time

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.920
in his life in a ballpark
where he doesn't know anybody.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.770
Even when they do an
away game in Cuba,

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.740
everybody from the hometown
piles into these trucks and buses

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.000
and goes to wherever the game is.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.360
So now they are in this
place with huge stands

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.060
and nothing but strangers.

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.020
A strange thing happened to me.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.290
I was approached some years
ago by Gourmet Magazine.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.840
In the early 90s, they
wanted me to go to Cuba

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:17.740 position:56%
and do an article gourmet, and this
was at a time after the Soviets left

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.860
when Cuba was really
struggling to have enough food.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.890
And I said "Yeah, this really isn't
a good time to write about food."

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.990
And they said, "Oh no, you
don't have to write about food.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.060
Write about whatever you like."

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.830
I said, "Well, I like baseball."

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.620
They said, "Okay, great.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:35.080
Go and write about baseball."

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.950
So I spent two weeks in Havana
doing nothing but going to one

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.770
or two baseball games
everyday all over the island.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.880
And when I was staying in Havana,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:50.270
I stayed at a hotel called
La Parque Central which is,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:54.070
of course, by the Parque Central.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:59.260
And I picked this spot
because it's a spot

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.140
in the Parque Central
called the esquina caliente,

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:09.000
and esquina caliente an
expression for third-base.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
It means the hot corner because
third base here at 90 feet

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.920
from home plate, you've
got to make decisions fast.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.800 position:56%
But this esquine caliente is a place

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.710
where baseball fans gather
every morning to argue

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.410
about the games the night before.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.330
So I thought I'd go
and I'd listen to them.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.030 position:56%
There is no way I would participate.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.680
If you didn't understand
Spanish,you would think

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.930
that this was some
violent political argument.

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.820
But it's just baseball.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.590
It's Havana delirium.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:41.370
So I was staying at the Parque
Central and I was out one day

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.000
to see an Industriales game, and
Industriales is a Havana club.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.870
It's the most winning
club in Cuban baseball.

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.430
And I'm walking through the lobby
and the porter comes up to me.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:58.460 position:56%
He says, "I've got a woman for you."

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.160
I said, "No, no.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.310
I've got to get going."

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.170
And he says, "But she's a mulatta."

00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:09.320
And this is an interesting thing,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.950
because in Havana syllables are
never carefully enunciated except

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.640
for those three -- mulatta.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.990
And I look over in the corner

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.050
and there's this woman
blowing me kisses.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:26.600
I said to the guy, "No, sorry,
I got to go to a baseball game."

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.650
And he says -- his whole
tone of voice says "Really?

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.190
Who's playing?"

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:35.600
I said it's the Industriales,
they're playing Santiago.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.620
Industriales and Santiago
is a little bit

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:39.910
like the Yankees and the Red Sox.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:44.000
He says, "Who's starting
for Industriales?"

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.280
I said Rene [Inaudible].

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.870
He said, "Oh, he's not so good."

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:53.130
The woman in the corner
isn't blowing kisses anymore.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.070
She's getting more and more
angry while the guy goes

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.140
through the entire Santiago lineup,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.160
explaining how [Inaudible] should
pitch to each of these hitters.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:09.020
By the end, he was almost
ready to quit his job

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.050
and go to the ballgame with me.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:13.350
That's Havana.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.150
Thank you very much.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:24.380
[ Applause ]

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.680
We have a few minutes left.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.690
I'd love to take some questions
if anyone wants to ask anything.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:38.140
I can't really see you
but there's microphones.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.460
So if you want to ask a question --

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:45.030
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.900 position:56%
When you're studying the culture, it
sounds like you know it very well,

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:53.040
how do you overcome any
obstacles, either through language,

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.250
restrictions on place,
where you can go,

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.940
or maybe people telling you
something you may not believe is

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:04.070
true, or restrictions on access to
places you just can't go in Cuba.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:06.970
How do you get to a point,
which sounds like you have,

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.490
where you know what
you're talking about

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:13.510
and you really believe what you've
seen and heard you can confirm it,

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.170
you're comfortable with it?

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Well,
language is kind of essential.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.810
I've been speaking
Spanish since I was a kid.

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:27.390
I originally learned
from Puerto Ricans.

00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:29.450
And you know, some
things you can't --

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.440
you have to operate differently
in different countries.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.830
Cuba isn't a country where you
can get everything confirmed

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.130
by the Cuban government.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.640
It's also a country where you can't
work without the Cuban government.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.160
They get very uneasy if
you're talking to people

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.630
without them knowing about it.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.060
Baseball in particular, you
know, this one of these things

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:51.640
where you wouldn't think about it,

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.850
but talking to baseball
players makes them very nervous

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:58.180
because there's major-league
scouts that are going around trying

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:00.040
to talk these guys into defecting.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.440 position:56%
So, you know, who's this guy really?

00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:09.470
You just have to learn to
work with these difficulties.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.270
I mean, it's a little
difficult in Cuba.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.180
Listen, it's more difficult
in Mexico

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.440
because the Mexican government is
just really difficult to work with.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.490 position:56%
It's just part of the game you play.

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:24.760
You learn how to play it.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.800
It's sometimes frustrating.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.630
Yeah, there are places you
can't go, though not too many.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:38.260 position:56%
Not too many, and most of the places
you can't go aren't places I'm

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.350
particularly interested in
anyway, because I really don't care

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.050
that much about military bases.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.070
So you just learn to deal with it.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.370
Yeah?

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.450
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:56.180
You might be the guy who has a one
word title, but you're also a guy

00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:03.320
who really tends to focus on these
grand global transnational sort

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.620
of stories.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:09.200
So I was curious how
it felt to change that

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:15.500
and to really limit your scope a
little bit, and also how you feel

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.420
like your background as more

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.310
of a global transnational
historian has helped you

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:26.050
in limiting that scope to Havana?

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky:
Well, it felt great.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:34.430
All my books aren't
on global things.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:38.050
I've done other books that were,
you know, very narrowly focused,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.050
and I've done fiction
books on particular places.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:46.690
I've done all kinds of
things, but I enjoyed very much

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:49.900
when this was proposed to me, the
idea of just focusing on Havana.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.920
I mean, I didn't even
want to do Cuba.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.780
I just wanted to do Havana.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:58.800
That was something that I enjoyed.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.230
I supposed it took some discipline

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:04.190 position:56%
because the reason I do these global
books is I kind of think like that

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.990 position:56%
and everything just keeps expanding.

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.880
Fortunately, this was
a fairly short book

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.300
so I could stop it before
it got out to the world,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.150
and just keep it focused on Havana.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.450
Yeah?

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:19.550
&gt;&gt; Can I ask you about
a different book?

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:20.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Okay.

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.150
&gt;&gt; Since we are at a
Library of Congress event,

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:28.070
I wonder if you could talk about
how you got the idea for "Food

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:31.550
of a Younger Land" and what it
was like to work with the LOC

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.730
to have access to those records?

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.760
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Well, this
would be the place to ask me that.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.810
Yeah, "Food of the Younger Land"
was a book that I did entirely

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.150
in the Library of Congress

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:47.880
from an archive there
of WPA writings on food.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.550
It was a very pleasant experience
to just go to the Library

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:59.810
of Congress every day and put on
my little gloves, get these files

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:04.630
and look through these old onion
skin carbon copies of stuff

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:10.640
that people had written
in the 1930s.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.880
I just tremendously enjoyed it.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.240
I mean, the Library of Congress --

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.500
I'm not saying this because
we're here, but we are here --

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.110
is a great place to work.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.190
They are all set up for people like
me who want to do things like that.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.490
&gt;&gt; A question over here.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.440
First of all, thank you so much.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.100
I was just in Havana in June and it
has filled in a lot of gaps for me.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.740
I'm curious how you have seen the
hopes of the Cuban people change

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:37.660
over the decades that
you've been there?

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.880
The hopes of the people,
so the hopes

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.930
and dreams of the Cuban people.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:43.230
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: The hopes --

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:44.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:50.610
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Well, you know,
at the time of the revolution,

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.790
young people, and not
just young people,

00:38:55.790 --> 00:39:00.270
people were very excited
about the revolution.

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:04.060
Getting rid of their -- it was
almost like trying to get rid

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.080
of their entire history, pushing
out all of the Spanish stuff

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.370
and the slave stuff and
all the burdens of history

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:13.660
and creating this new society.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.270
It felt very exciting, you know.

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.010
As I said, it felt like
this experimental society

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:21.420
where you would try
all of these things.

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:23.210
But it was based on a bargain.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:28.300
The bargain was, the Cuban
government said you're not going

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.760
to get rich.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.300
You are to abandon
materialism and just contribute

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.760
to your society in any way you can.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.970
And in exchange for that,
we will look after you.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.270
We'll give you your housing.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:40.570
We'll give you your food.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.870
We'll give you your education.

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:44.220
We'll give you your healthcare.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.790
And that worked reasonably well

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.760
until the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.210
Then suddenly, there
wasn't enough money.

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.800
What the government was providing
wasn't enough for people.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.750
The government started allowing
people to do other things,

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.970
like open their own restaurants.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:06.870
And as soon as you open that window
of capitalism of making money

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.580
for yourself, suddenly you know,
like doctors are complaining

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.230
that they aren't getting
paid enough.

00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:13.840
They never used to
complain about that.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.510
The government made them doctors

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.790
and this was their
social responsibility.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.480
That whole thing kind
of fell apart as soon

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.970
as you opened this
window of capitalism.

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:27.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:29.290
This is really amazing.

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.730
I'm looking forward
to reading your book,

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.100
having read some of your others.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.580
I had a chance to live in the
Caribbean for quite a while.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.670
And while I was there, got
introduced to the music style

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.220
of the Nueva Trova, which was
very popular after the revolution,

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:44.120
and Silvio Rodriguez and people
like that talking about places

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:49.390
like Playa Giron and really
emphasizing the cultural identity

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.690
of the people.

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:57.950
And I was just curious
to know how evoking

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:01.440
that passion has really moved
forward in terms of the importance

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.780
of that style of music, that
style of culture in modern Cuba,

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:07.980 position:56%
especially in light of the political
changes that are occurring.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky: Yeah.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.580
Well, it's still very much around.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:13.790
And those concerts are still
tremendously popular and,

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:18.200
by the way, cost almost
nothing to go to.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.140
It remains a strong tradition and
a lot of those singers from back

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.700
in the 60s are still singing.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.100
Also [inaudible] and
all sorts of things.

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.890
Cuba doesn't seem to
lose music forms.

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.980
It just keeps adding to them.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:45.410
I'm facing this sign that says
"Wrap it up" in large red letters.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.550
So I'm sorry I can't -- Well,
do you have a quick question?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.280
&gt;&gt; I was going to say, since
you were a food writer,

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:57.360
I'd like to hear something
about the food of Havana.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Kurlansky:
That's a quick question?

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:06.700
Well, you know, food in
Cuba is Cuban history,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.470
so it's a little bit Spanish
and it's a little bit African

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.190
and sometimes it's a
little bit of Indian in it.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.510
And there's a bunch
of American in it.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:23.480 position:56%
It's a mixture of all those cultures
that have passed through Havana.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.780
I think that's it.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.580
Thank you.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:35.430
[ Applause ]

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to be
signing books somewhere.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.640
I have no idea where,
but you probably know.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.940
So see you there.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:48.860
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
