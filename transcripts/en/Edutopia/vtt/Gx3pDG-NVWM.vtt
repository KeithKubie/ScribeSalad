00:00:11.056 --> 00:00:11.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the University

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.366
of Maryland's Human
Computer Interaction Lab,

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:17.156
design teams meet twice
a week at four PM

00:00:17.356 --> 00:00:19.766
to devise new technologies
for young people.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:23.946
And half the designers are
kids ages seven through eleven.

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:24.606
&gt;&gt;Dana: How much do you need?

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.456
&gt;&gt;Two popsicle sticks,
yeah, that's good.

00:00:26.486 --> 00:00:28.986
&gt;&gt;Where there's a clock
and it tells you the time

00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:30.106
of the other place so you--

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:31.856
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: The kids
are our design partners.

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.776
We work with them in an equal
partnership where they're helping us

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:36.656
to design technology for children.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:39.296
&gt;&gt;There could be like a place
where could like click on that,

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:43.226
and then like send them like
the money to the website.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.456
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: So we have
a give a gift section.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:45.096
&gt;&gt;That's cool.

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:45.966
I like that.

00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:49.426
&gt;&gt;They absolutely have as many
good ideas as the big people do.

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:51.956
The children are experts
in being children

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.576
and even though we were all children
once, we weren't children in 2009.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.716
The children oftentimes
have ideas that surprise us.

00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:00.926
They'll open up avenues
we hadn't thought about.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.976
&gt;&gt;We'll need to make that adjustable
so we can see through both of them.

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:04.126
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.356
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: And it's really
a process of idea elaboration,

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:09.016
where the kids might come out
with an idea, an adult comes

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.916
out with an idea, and we find
that working together, we go back

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.896
and forth and end up with these
great big ideas that are much bigger

00:01:14.896 --> 00:01:16.856
and better than we could've
ever made on our own.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.186
&gt;&gt;What do think about this keyboard?

00:01:18.326 --> 00:01:20.106
Can you type an actually
sentence on it?

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:20.576
&gt;&gt;Dana: It's way too small.

00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:22.316
&gt;&gt;What do you think
would be ideal for you?

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:23.726
&gt;&gt;Dana: Slide it out.

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:24.696
&gt;&gt;All right, try this one.

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:27.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Members of the kids
team design group are recruited

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:29.796
from local Maryland
elementary schools.

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:30.736
&gt;&gt;Dana: Oh, cool.

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:34.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They help design kid
friendly gadgets and websites

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.316
for clients that include
Fortune five hundred companies

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:41.076
and nonprofit organizations.

00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.766
&gt;&gt;We work with mostly is
National Park Service a lot.

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:48.746
&gt;&gt;Some of their games on their
website are sorta cheesy,

00:01:50.086 --> 00:01:53.906
so we are the people who
like fix it up and stuff.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:57.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today's challenge is to
evaluate and improve upon the website

00:01:57.506 --> 00:02:01.266
of a nonprofit organization
called People in Need.

00:02:01.456 --> 00:02:06.546
&gt;&gt;Allison: This is a project
about connecting people from here

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:10.626
that have resources to
people in need in Haiti.

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:13.616
&gt;&gt;How many people know
where Haiti is?

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:16.106
&gt;&gt;But why Haiti?

00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:17.476
&gt;&gt;Allison: Why Haiti?

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:22.086
&gt;&gt;Dana: So these are all
different people in need in Haiti.

00:02:22.546 --> 00:02:24.796
And so you can click on
one of these families.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:26.576
It says, "Learn more.

00:02:27.026 --> 00:02:27.906
Help this family.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.726
&gt;&gt;Dana's partnership with Judeline."

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:33.276
So I can read you her letter.

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:37.706
It says, "The pleasure is
mine to drop you a line."

00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:39.756
&gt;&gt;Allison: Does she
actually speak in English?

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:41.236
&gt;&gt;Dana: No, she speaks in Creole.

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:46.736
&gt;&gt;I type them and then people in
Haiti translate it into Creole.

00:02:47.056 --> 00:02:50.036
&gt;&gt;I thought they didn't
have electricity in Haiti.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:50.916
&gt;&gt;Yeah, they don't have electricity.

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:53.456
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: Corresponding with her
how you back and forth like that,

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.676
that's kinda the way it's
set up for you to do it.

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:55.936
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:56.056 --> 00:02:59.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After an initial
discussion, the brainstorming begins

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:02.206
in earnest as the group breaks
into small design teams.

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:03.256
&gt;&gt;All right, go for it.

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:05.806
&gt;&gt;Nadia and Sasha are right.

00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:08.116
&gt;&gt;Allison: Actually,
the favorite of all

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:11.266
of our children is what the
kids call bags of stuff,

00:03:11.336 --> 00:03:13.736
but the adults call
low tech prototyping.

00:03:13.836 --> 00:03:16.966
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: Now what do
we need the microphone for?

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:21.626
&gt;&gt;You can also do like a video chat.

00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:25.066
&gt;&gt;Allison: So a kid might have an
idea, and then you may say, "Yeah,

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:26.746
that's a really great
idea, but you know,

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:29.126
if we make it green,
then we could do this."

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:31.586
And then I might say, "Hey,
if it's green, polka dotted

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:33.296
and furry, can you imagine?"

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.496
and we go from there.

00:03:34.496 --> 00:03:37.846
And you're not sure whose idea it
was eventually, but it's amazing.

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:39.196
&gt;&gt;So we have to present and show.

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:39.363
&gt;&gt;Oh.

00:03:39.846 --> 00:03:43.216
&gt;&gt;Share, 'cause everybody wants
to see what everybody else built.

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:44.456
&gt;&gt;Mona Leigh: There are places

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:46.426
where people design partner
with children in school.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.106
However, we find that in schools, a
lot of times, kids are predisposed

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:52.566
to be a part of that
adult child power dynamic,

00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:54.916
that kind of always
exists in a school

00:03:55.006 --> 00:03:57.016
in American culture, for good reason.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:58.666
You know, you have one
teacher and twenty students.

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:00.896
So when you go into
schools a lotta times,

00:04:00.926 --> 00:04:03.726
you find that the power dynamic
will carry over and the kids aren't

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:04.586
as free with their ideas.

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:07.916
&gt;&gt;And when it goes to her,
it would be all translated

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:13.796
into whatever language they speak.

00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:18.206
&gt;&gt;Allison: Once each of the groups
has their low tech prototypes,

00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:23.006
we come back together and we take
a look at each of the prototypes.

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:24.866
Each of the groups
presents their ideas.

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:27.156
&gt;&gt;It's like an iPod.

00:04:27.756 --> 00:04:28.476
You press play.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:29.836
It's supposed to be right there.

00:04:30.686 --> 00:04:37.926
&gt;&gt;And this is a map of
where your partner lives.

00:04:37.926 --> 00:04:40.906
&gt;&gt;Wow, so you wanna do it
totally on mobile phones?

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:41.576
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:43.026
&gt;&gt;Allison: Okay.

00:04:43.026 --> 00:04:46.306
&gt;&gt;And then the leader will be
writing what we call the big ideas,

00:04:46.306 --> 00:04:50.626
and those big ideas, again, is almost
a frequency analysis of the kinds

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:54.496
of ideas that are coming
out of an existing session.

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:55.276
And it's very exciting.

00:04:55.516 --> 00:04:58.136
&gt;&gt;You come up with some
wonderful design directions.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:04:59.046
&gt;&gt;Dana: -- it popped up like that.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:02.396
&gt;&gt;This is if you wanna make
a video to your partner,

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:06.366
you can just put the
camera on your computer

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:08.416
and then you can do the video.

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:12.126
&gt;&gt;So streamlining the
video taking process.

00:05:12.126 --> 00:05:13.306
&gt;&gt;Allison: Good work.

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:13.946
&gt;&gt;All right [applause].

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:17.356
&gt;&gt;Allison: Okay.

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.666
Well done, folks.

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:25.066
Thank you very much.

00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:44.156
