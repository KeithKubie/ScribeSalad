00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.320
I work on the Chrome team.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.670
I work as a Developer Advocate
on the Polymer project.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.030
So we're going to be talking
about Web Components, which is

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.050
a totally cool, new technology
that the Chrome team's been

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.860
working on for a long,
long time.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.920
Super stoked about it.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.100
Super cool to spread
it with developers.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.950
I want to learn about how
developers are building modern

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.740
web apps and teach them these
new practices using Web

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.400
Components.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.870
I want to know about how they
architect apps, how we can

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.190
bring that back into the
standards process, feed the

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.520
engineering team here at Google,
work with them very

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.020
closely on that sort of thing,
and have this really awesome

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.570
type feedback loop.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.660
And bring that back to the
Chrome team, we can build that

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.690
in the standards process and
have everyone then benefit in

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.890
the web community from adding
these APIs to the platform.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.530
Hey, guys.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.630
My name's Eric Bidelman.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.110
I'm a Chrome Developer
Advocate.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.950
We're going to be talking about
Web Components, going to

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.660
be talking about a little
bit of Polymer.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.350
It's really exciting times
for web development.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.310
You can build components,
define new tags in HTML.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.550
It's going to make your life
entirely more productive than

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.560
you ever, ever thought
imaginable.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.810
See you guys there.
