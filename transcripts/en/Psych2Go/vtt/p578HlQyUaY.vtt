00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.260
Have you been crushing on someone, but wondering if it's becoming something more?

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:16.260
Emotions can be messy and hard to decipher when all we hear is our loud heartbeats, or feel giant butterflies in our stomach.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.860
The upside is that as we grow older and gain more relationship experience, the answer becomes more clear.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.660
Here are five differences between crushing on and falling in love with someone.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.260
1. A crush develops fast, while love grows over time

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.420
When you first develop a crush on someone, it can feel fun, flirty and exciting.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.240
It's a lot like dancing with a flame, but it doesn't last forever.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420
Love, on the other hand, takes time to grow.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.040
It demands patience, understanding and hard work.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.800
When we crush on someone, it's the loud adrenaline rush that pounds on our chest.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.660
Love, however, allows us to find inner peace within ourselves.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.060
It's a lot quieter, subtle even, and can sneak up on us when we least expect it.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.260
2. A crush forms from the basics, while love thrives from deep connections

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.020
Have you ever liked someone because they shared the same interests as you?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.660
A crush forms from basic information like that.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.660
Maybe the two of you had the same favorite color, or you can quote an entire movie together from beginning to end.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.260
But that's not necessarily love.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.640
Love isn't afraid to dive in the deep.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.260
It asks us to be vulnerable and go past the small talk, hobbies, and picture perfect Kodak moments.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.720
It's sharing secrets, and sometimes, it means confronting the past and mending together.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280
3. A crush might feel insecure while love stems from trust

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.660
Crushing on someone can leave you feeling insecure when you compare yourself to others, but love is built on the foundation of trust.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.640
When you love someone, you feel at ease with them, you're neither possessive nor jealous.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.480
Love teaches us to let go of our fears, whereas crushing on someone allows them to linger.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.080
4. A crush feels new while love feels familiar

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.500
When you crush on someone, it often feels fresh and young.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.860
But as you get to know someone better, love forms, making enter rooms that feel familiar.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.060
It's like being with your best friend, someone who knows you inside and out, perhaps better than you may know yourself.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.620
When you're crushing on someone, you're too shy to even make it past the welcome mat.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.260
5. A crush is reckless while love is mature

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.080
Ever had a crush on someone that made you scratch your head years later?

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.020
Crushes can be confusing, reckless, and inconsistent.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.660
Love isn't so easily discarded though.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.460
When love begins, so does maturity.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.060
You'll learn how to be vulnerable, how to compromise, and how to grow with someone.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.880
It's more than just a feeling but a life changing experience.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.080
