00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.670
in the previous video you've already

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680
in the previous video you've already
 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.280
in the previous video you've already
seen all the basic building blocks of

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
seen all the basic building blocks of
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.130
seen all the basic building blocks of
the inception Network in this video

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140
the inception Network in this video
 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.680
the inception Network in this video
let's see how you can put these building

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690
let's see how you can put these building
 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.480
let's see how you can put these building
blocks together to build your own

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
blocks together to build your own
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.720
blocks together to build your own
inception network so the inception

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
inception network so the inception
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.960
inception network so the inception
module takes as input the activation or

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
module takes as input the activation or
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.390
module takes as input the activation or
the output from some previous layer so

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
the output from some previous layer so
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.010
the output from some previous layer so
let's say for the sake of argument this

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020
let's say for the sake of argument this
 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.109
let's say for the sake of argument this
is 28 by 28 by 192 same as our previous

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119
is 28 by 28 by 192 same as our previous
 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.230
is 28 by 28 by 192 same as our previous
video the example we work through in

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
video the example we work through in
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.860
video the example we work through in
Jeff was the 1 by 1 followed by five by

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
Jeff was the 1 by 1 followed by five by
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.940
Jeff was the 1 by 1 followed by five by
five they are so maybe the one by one

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
five they are so maybe the one by one
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.440
five they are so maybe the one by one
has 16 channels and then the 5 by 5 will

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
has 16 channels and then the 5 by 5 will
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.389
has 16 channels and then the 5 by 5 will
output a 28 by 28 by let's say 32

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
output a 28 by 28 by let's say 32
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.930
output a 28 by 28 by let's say 32
channels and this was the example we

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
channels and this was the example we
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910
channels and this was the example we
were through on the last slide of the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
were through on the last slide of the
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.479
were through on the last slide of the
previous video then to save computation

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
previous video then to save computation
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.529
previous video then to save computation
on your 3x3 convolution you can also do

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
on your 3x3 convolution you can also do
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.930
on your 3x3 convolution you can also do
the same here and then the 3 by 3

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
the same here and then the 3 by 3
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.670
the same here and then the 3 by 3
outputs 28 by 28 by 128 and then maybe

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
outputs 28 by 28 by 128 and then maybe
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.580
outputs 28 by 28 by 128 and then maybe
you want to consider a 1 by 1

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590
you want to consider a 1 by 1
 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.780
you want to consider a 1 by 1
convolution as well there's no need to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
convolution as well there's no need to
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.420
convolution as well there's no need to
do a 1 by 1 comma followed by another 1

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
do a 1 by 1 comma followed by another 1
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760
do a 1 by 1 comma followed by another 1
by 1 4 comma so that's just one step

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
by 1 4 comma so that's just one step
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.530
by 1 4 comma so that's just one step
here and let's say this outputs 28 by 28

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540
here and let's say this outputs 28 by 28
 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:31.310
here and let's say this outputs 28 by 28
by 64 and then finally is the pooling

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
by 64 and then finally is the pooling
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.030
by 64 and then finally is the pooling
layer so here I'm going to do something

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
layer so here I'm going to do something
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.130
layer so here I'm going to do something
funny in order together to concatenate

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
funny in order together to concatenate
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.800
funny in order together to concatenate
all of these outputs at the end we are

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
all of these outputs at the end we are
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.670
all of these outputs at the end we are
going to use a same type of having for

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
going to use a same type of having for
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950
going to use a same type of having for
pooling so that the output height and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
pooling so that the output height and
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.740
pooling so that the output height and
width is still 28 by 28 so we can

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
width is still 28 by 28 so we can
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.460
width is still 28 by 28 so we can
concatenate it with these other outputs

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
concatenate it with these other outputs
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.460
concatenate it with these other outputs
but notice that if you do max pooling

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
but notice that if you do max pooling
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.760
but notice that if you do max pooling
even with same padding 3 by 3 filter is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
even with same padding 3 by 3 filter is
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.109
even with same padding 3 by 3 filter is
rather 1 the output here will be 28 by

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
rather 1 the output here will be 28 by
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.040
rather 1 the output here will be 28 by
28 by 192 it will have the same number

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
28 by 192 it will have the same number
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.090
28 by 192 it will have the same number
of channels on the same def as the input

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100
of channels on the same def as the input
 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.420
of channels on the same def as the input
that we have here so this seems like is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
that we have here so this seems like is
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.880
that we have here so this seems like is
has a lot of channels so what we're

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
has a lot of channels so what we're
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.460
has a lot of channels so what we're
going to do is actually add one more one

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
going to do is actually add one more one
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.910
going to do is actually add one more one
by one con flare to then do what we saw

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920
by one con flare to then do what we saw
 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.420
by one con flare to then do what we saw
in the one by one convolutional video to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430
in the one by one convolutional video to
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.970
in the one by one convolutional video to
shrink the number of channels so as to

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
shrink the number of channels so as to
 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.200
shrink the number of channels so as to
get this down to twenty by twenty eight

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210
get this down to twenty by twenty eight
 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.420
get this down to twenty by twenty eight
by let's say thirty two and the way you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
by let's say thirty two and the way you
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.190
by let's say thirty two and the way you
do that is you use thirty two filters of

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200
do that is you use thirty two filters of
 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.430
do that is you use thirty two filters of
dimension one by one by one ninety two

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440
dimension one by one by one ninety two
 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.770
dimension one by one by one ninety two
so that's why the output dimension has a

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
so that's why the output dimension has a
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.260
so that's why the output dimension has a
number channels shrunk down to thirty

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270
number channels shrunk down to thirty
 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.199
number channels shrunk down to thirty
two so then you don't end up with the

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209
two so then you don't end up with the
 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.780
two so then you don't end up with the
pooling layer taking up all the channels

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
pooling layer taking up all the channels
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.620
pooling layer taking up all the channels
in the final output and finally you take

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630
in the final output and finally you take
 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.440
in the final output and finally you take
these all of these blocks and you do

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450
these all of these blocks and you do
 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.960
these all of these blocks and you do
channel concatenation just concatenate

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
channel concatenation just concatenate
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.210
channel concatenation just concatenate
across this 64 plus 128 plus 32 plus 32

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
across this 64 plus 128 plus 32 plus 32
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.390
across this 64 plus 128 plus 32 plus 32
and this if you had it up this gives you

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400
and this if you had it up this gives you
 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.520
and this if you had it up this gives you
a 28 by 28 by two five six dimensional

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
a 28 by 28 by two five six dimensional
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.790
a 28 by 28 by two five six dimensional
output ranch and from cadiz just you

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
output ranch and from cadiz just you
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.670
output ranch and from cadiz just you
know this concatenating the blocks that

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
know this concatenating the blocks that
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.000
know this concatenating the blocks that
we saw in the previous video so this is

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
we saw in the previous video so this is
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.020
we saw in the previous video so this is
one inception module and what the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030
one inception module and what the
 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360
one inception module and what the
inception network does is more or less

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370
inception network does is more or less
 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.650
inception network does is more or less
put a lot of these modules together

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660
put a lot of these modules together
 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.330
put a lot of these modules together
here's a picture of the inception

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340
here's a picture of the inception
 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.210
here's a picture of the inception
network taken from the paper by Zebedee

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220
network taken from the paper by Zebedee
 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.340
network taken from the paper by Zebedee
at all and you notice a lot of repeated

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350
at all and you notice a lot of repeated
 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.530
at all and you notice a lot of repeated
blocks in this maybe this picture looks

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540
blocks in this maybe this picture looks
 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.330
blocks in this maybe this picture looks
really complicated we've looked at one

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340
really complicated we've looked at one
 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.610
really complicated we've looked at one
of the blocks there that block is

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
of the blocks there that block is
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.940
of the blocks there that block is
basically the inception module that you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950
basically the inception module that you
 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.090
basically the inception module that you
saw on the previous line and subject to

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100
saw on the previous line and subject to
 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.340
saw on the previous line and subject to
little details I won't discuss you know

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350
little details I won't discuss you know
 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.710
little details I won't discuss you know
this is another inception block this is

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
this is another inception block this is
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.940
this is another inception block this is
another inception block there's some

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950
another inception block there's some
 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.510
another inception block there's some
extra max pooling layers here take

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520
extra max pooling layers here take
 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.300
extra max pooling layers here take
the dimension of the height and width

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310
the dimension of the height and width
 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.420
the dimension of the height and width
but that's another inception block and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430
but that's another inception block and
 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.920
but that's another inception block and
then there's another max put here to

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930
then there's another max put here to
 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.999
then there's another max put here to
change the height and width but

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009
change the height and width but
 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.409
change the height and width but
basically there's another inception

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419
basically there's another inception
 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.140
basically there's another inception
block but the inception network is just

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150
block but the inception network is just
 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.399
block but the inception network is just
a lot of these blocks that you've

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409
a lot of these blocks that you've
 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.040
a lot of these blocks that you've
learned about repeated to different

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050
learned about repeated to different
 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.320
learned about repeated to different
positions of the network but so if you

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330
positions of the network but so if you
 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.600
positions of the network but so if you
understand the inception block from the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610
understand the inception block from the
 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.399
understand the inception block from the
previous slide then you understand the

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409
previous slide then you understand the
 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.140
previous slide then you understand the
inception network them it turns out that

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
inception network them it turns out that
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.360
inception network them it turns out that
there's one last detail to the inception

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370
there's one last detail to the inception
 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.950
there's one last detail to the inception
Network if you read the original

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960
Network if you read the original
 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.110
Network if you read the original
research paper which is that there are

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120
research paper which is that there are
 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.450
research paper which is that there are
these additional side branches that I

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460
these additional side branches that I
 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.999
these additional side branches that I
just added so what do they do well the

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:04.009
just added so what do they do well the
 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.800
just added so what do they do well the
last few layers of the network is a

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810
last few layers of the network is a
 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.260
last few layers of the network is a
fully connected layer followed by a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270
fully connected layer followed by a
 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.270
fully connected layer followed by a
softmax layer to try to make a

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280
softmax layer to try to make a
 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.029
softmax layer to try to make a
prediction what these side branches do

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039
prediction what these side branches do
 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.520
prediction what these side branches do
is it takes some hidden layer and it

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530
is it takes some hidden layer and it
 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.379
is it takes some hidden layer and it
tries to use that to make a prediction

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389
tries to use that to make a prediction
 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.399
tries to use that to make a prediction
so this is at your softmax output and so

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409
so this is at your softmax output and so
 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.309
so this is at your softmax output and so
is that and this other side branch again

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319
is that and this other side branch again
 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.439
is that and this other side branch again
takes a hidden layer passes it through

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449
takes a hidden layer passes it through
 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.089
takes a hidden layer passes it through
you know a few layers like a few fully

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099
you know a few layers like a few fully
 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.159
you know a few layers like a few fully
connected layers and then has the

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169
connected layers and then has the
 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.469
connected layers and then has the
softmax try to predict what's the output

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479
softmax try to predict what's the output
 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.790
softmax try to predict what's the output
label and you should think of this as

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800
label and you should think of this as
 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.589
label and you should think of this as
maybe just another detail of the

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599
maybe just another detail of the
 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.019
maybe just another detail of the
inception Network but what it does is it

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029
inception Network but what it does is it
 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.360
inception Network but what it does is it
helps to ensure that the features

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370
helps to ensure that the features
 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.390
helps to ensure that the features
computer even in the hidden units even

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400
computer even in the hidden units even
 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.370
computer even in the hidden units even
at the intermediate layers that they're

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380
at the intermediate layers that they're
 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.350
at the intermediate layers that they're
not too bad for predicting the output

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360
not too bad for predicting the output
 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.170
not too bad for predicting the output
cause of a image and this attempt

effect on the inception Network and how

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560
effect on the inception Network and how
 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.559

maybe this mean will make sense to you

00:06:59.659 --> 00:06:59.669
maybe this mean will make sense to you
 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.409
maybe this mean will make sense to you
but the authors actually cite this meme

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419
but the authors actually cite this meme
 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.919
but the authors actually cite this meme
as motivation for needing to build

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:06.929
as motivation for needing to build
 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:09.589
as motivation for needing to build
deeper neural networks and that's how

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599
deeper neural networks and that's how
 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.029
deeper neural networks and that's how
they came up with the inception

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039
they came up with the inception
 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.879
they came up with the inception
architecture so because it's not often

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889
architecture so because it's not often
 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.369

that research papers get to cite

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:16.379
that research papers get to cite
 

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.999
that research papers get to cite
internet memes in their citations but in

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009
internet memes in their citations but in
 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:21.829

this case I guess it worked out quite

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:21.839
this case I guess it worked out quite
 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:25.519
this case I guess it worked out quite
well so to summarize if you understand

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:25.529
well so to summarize if you understand
 

00:07:25.529 --> 00:07:28.069
well so to summarize if you understand
the inception module then you understand

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:28.079
the inception module then you understand
 

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.409
the inception module then you understand
the inception Network which is largely

the inception module repeated a bunch of
 

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:35.929
the inception module repeated a bunch of
times throughout the network since the

00:07:35.929 --> 00:07:35.939
times throughout the network since the
 

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.819
times throughout the network since the
development of the original inception

well so their research papers on newer

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:46.499
well so their research papers on newer
 

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:49.219
well so their research papers on newer
versions of the inception algorithm and

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:49.229
versions of the inception algorithm and
 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:51.409
versions of the inception algorithm and
you sometimes see people use some of

00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419
you sometimes see people use some of
 

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:53.659
you sometimes see people use some of
these later versions as well in their

00:07:53.659 --> 00:07:53.669
these later versions as well in their
 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:55.999
these later versions as well in their
work like Inception v2 Inception v3

00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:56.009

idea of having skipped connections and

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:02.969
idea of having skipped connections and
 

00:08:02.969 --> 00:08:06.169
idea of having skipped connections and
that sometimes works even better but all

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:06.179
that sometimes works even better but all
 

00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:08.659
that sometimes works even better but all
of these variations are built on the

with the inception module and then
 

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:17.409
with the inception module and then
stacking up a bunch of them together and

stacking up a bunch of them together and
 

00:08:17.419 --> 00:08:19.790
stacking up a bunch of them together and
with these videos you should be able to

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800
with these videos you should be able to
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.979
with these videos you should be able to
read and understand I think the

variations as well so that's it you've

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:30.389
variations as well so that's it you've
 

00:08:30.389 --> 00:08:32.659
