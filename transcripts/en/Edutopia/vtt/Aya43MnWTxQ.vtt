&gt;&gt;Nichole: Literacy has always been
defined by the technology, right?

00:00:04.586 --> 00:00:05.426
Before the printing press,

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:09.176
your ability to orally recite
something meant to be literate.

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:13.586
And so as technology has made things
cheaper, we're now saying, "Well hmm,

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:17.676
is someone literate if they cannot
critique media, take media in,

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.676
if they're only taking
in traditional text?"

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:23.276
So if a sixth grader today, by the
time they graduate from college,

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:26.216
is not fluent, if you will, in
some of these other forms of media,

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:30.196
I would venture to say that they
won't necessarily be considered

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:30.976
as being literate.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.836
The Digital Youth Network was
started over five years ago,

00:00:42.136 --> 00:00:45.816
really out of trying to understand
how we can support youth in learning

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:48.636
to use digital media,
initially for schoolwork.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.246
But the more we thought about it,

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.216
and the more we realized how the
world was changing and evolving,

00:00:53.526 --> 00:00:55.376
we realized we really needed
to help them understand how

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:57.556
to use digital media for
all aspects of their life.

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:03.176
Our population of youth were urban
youth, living in the city of Chicago.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.446
And we couldn't assume that they were
gonna learn how to use technologies

00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:08.516
and media in the way that we
wanted in their home life.

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:12.256
So we had to figure out how to
make it happen within the context

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:15.036
of school or in the space
where kids connect into school.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:18.586
And we realized that so many
efforts around tech integration

00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:21.596
in school have failed, mainly
because the purpose was to try

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:24.726
to get teachers to be the ones who
taught kids how to use technology.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.316
And we just knew that that
couldn't be the way to go.

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:30.506
First, because our kids were
more digitally sophisticated

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:31.076
than teachers.

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:35.096
We've also then, in the last
year, established a partnership

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:37.406
with the Chicago Public
Library to open

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:40.456
up a high school only space called
YOUmedia, which is a space just

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:41.526
for ninth through twelfth graders.

00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:45.116
And in that partnership, the Chicago
Public Library provides the space,

00:01:45.276 --> 00:01:48.006
provides the library, and we
provide the digital mentors,

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:52.806
who collaborate collectively with the
librarians to create opportunities,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.716
learning opportunities,
digital opportunities for youth.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:59.266
We've also created a social
network called Remix Learning,

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:01.966
and that's a platform
that youth use to connect

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.666
to one another twenty-four seven.

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:07.416
So the DYN is an after-school
program, an in school program,

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:09.976
a shared space with YOUmedia, and
is also an online social space.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:16.046
What we initially did is, we asked
teachers to just come and watch

00:02:16.046 --> 00:02:19.136
and to look at their students and to
see their students using technology

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:22.466
in a way that was very different from
how they were using it in a school.

00:02:22.746 --> 00:02:25.626
So they saw their students and
producers and creators of technology.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:27.336
They saw them creating videos.

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:29.956
They saw them creating some
video games, music and songs,

00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.336
and what they saw, which
many of them talked about,

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:35.636
is that they saw students who were
quiet in the school day come alive

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:36.886
in the after-school space.

00:02:39.446 --> 00:02:44.766
&gt;&gt;Student: The thing that drawed me in about
DYN was the studio that was upstairs,

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:47.486
and that's just like a place
that I'd love to be in.

00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:51.376
It's a spot for inspiration really,
and on top of the inspiration,

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:54.756
it's the spot where you have
the tools as well, to again,

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:57.106
like I said earlier, bring
out what you want to,

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.956
what you hear in your head, and
putting it in front of a camera

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.766
or in a beat machine, or on paper.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:04.936
And if you know how to
use it, this is amazing.

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:10.686
&gt;&gt;Nichole: I think we've structured our 
work with students in such a way to try

00:03:10.686 --> 00:03:13.596
to create a cycle where they
are developing the skill sets,

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:16.406
but they're constantly making use
of those skills, in ways that are,

00:03:16.406 --> 00:03:18.276
you know, first personally
beneficial,

00:03:18.276 --> 00:03:20.146
but also beneficial to their society.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.446
We have a trajectory, if
we will, and it's first,

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:26.226
you're just a regular DYN kid

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.116
and you're learning how
to use digital media.

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.886
And if you choose to like
really develop a passion,

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:34.306
to geek out if you will, in one area,
then you can become a junior mentor.

00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:36.786
Because now you've
developed a set of skills

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.866
that we think can be
used to teach others.

00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:41.746
And at that point, there's a set of
responsibilities that come with that.

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:45.116
One is, you're responsible for
working with those who are younger,

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:47.546
and teaching them how to
do what it is that you do.

00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:50.366
But then, you also get more
specialized support in mentoring

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.236
to help take your skill
sets to a different level.

00:03:53.236 --> 00:03:55.836
You get opportunities
to be professional

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.076
and to go record your work.

00:03:57.116 --> 00:04:00.246
And if you really do this
for a couple of years,

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:03.136
and you demonstrate some mastery,
if you will, you can get paid

00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:04.196
to do this particular work.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:08.246
&gt;&gt;Student: I started off as just the
student, but now I'm getting paid

00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:12.076
to do what they do, and that's
how long I've been with it.

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:13.556
And now, I actually
have my own class,

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:15.616
and I used to just be
a part of the class.

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:19.566
And I don't know any teenager
or senior in high school

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:22.396
that has a class full of
students where they get to teach

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:23.696
and create their own curriculum.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:27.616
&gt;&gt;Nichole: I think the ways in which 
most technologies have been brought

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:29.906
into the classroom
in videos and things,

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:31.996
they've come in with
a natural audience.

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:36.456
So I think if you were just doing
the video that only your teacher saw,

00:04:36.456 --> 00:04:37.916
I think eventually you
would get to the point

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.486
that that would be the
same as doing an essay.

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:42.396
But I think because
oftentimes they're brought in,

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:45.086
what you're gonna share with
your classmates, you can take in

00:04:45.086 --> 00:04:46.996
and share it with your
parents or with your friends,

00:04:47.306 --> 00:04:48.806
that that motivates you to do work.

00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:51.306
&gt;&gt;Student: But before his voice box
was completely boxed in,

00:04:51.306 --> 00:04:54.516
he thought to himself, "Why
should I silence myself?"

00:04:54.746 --> 00:04:56.576
&gt;&gt;Nichole: Part of what we've also
been trying to understand is,

00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.096
"Well, does this matter?"

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:00.466
What impact does it have
besides, "Yes, it's good,

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.106
a kid can make a video or a podcast?"

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.906
Does it lead to a set of
portfolio, a set of skill sets

00:05:05.036 --> 00:05:06.616
that can impact their life?

00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:09.826
So we did a three year
ethnography on a group of kids,

00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:11.736
starting from the sixth grade,
in their sixth grade year,

00:05:11.786 --> 00:05:14.316
following them all the way through
the end of their eighth grade year.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.506
And the question really
was, "Okay, so what?

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:17.466
Does this matter?"

00:05:17.856 --> 00:05:20.586
And we needed to compare
them to a group of kids

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:25.276
who we felt were probably
exemplifying what digital natives

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:25.696
should be.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:29.056
And so we chose to compare our kids
to a group of kids in Silicon Valley,

00:05:29.216 --> 00:05:31.886
kids who grew up in environments
where it was just sorta in the water,

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:33.626
the use of digital media.

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:34.996
Their parents work for tech firms.

00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:40.006
And we wanted to see, could we
create an ecology, if you will,

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.896
a cocoon of in school, after
school, online social capital here

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:48.136
in Chicago, where our kids could
begin to look like those kids

00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:50.366
in terms of the digital,
their digital portfolios.

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.736
And so starting at the beginning
of the sixth grade year,

00:05:52.736 --> 00:05:54.676
as one would suspect,
ninety-six percent

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:59.616
of our kids had fewer digital media
experiences, portfolios if you will,

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:00.896
than the kids in Silicon Valley.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:03.296
And every year we tested
it and, you know,

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.606
we looked at where we were going.

00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:07.986
At the end of the sixth grade year,
beginning of seventh grade year,

00:06:08.266 --> 00:06:11.106
I think seventy-six percent of
our kids had more experiences

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:12.836
than the kids in Silicon Valley.

00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:15.176
And at the end of the eighth grade
year, I believe the number is more

00:06:15.176 --> 00:06:17.186
like eighty-six or
eighty-four percent

00:06:17.186 --> 00:06:19.316
of our kids had more,
have more experiences.

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:25.206
Almost any kid that you
look at and you say, "Oh wow,

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:28.036
this is a great user of digital
media," you can trace back.

00:06:28.586 --> 00:06:32.396
There's a parent, there's, you
know, a program, there's something

00:06:32.396 --> 00:06:34.616
that inspired them
and developed them.

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:38.026
And that we need to make sure that
we have those types of programs

00:06:38.026 --> 00:06:43.216
and those people represented
equally throughout all of society.
