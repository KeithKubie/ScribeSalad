00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.039
The Star Wars saga is one of the best-known
in the entire history of cinema, as a fan-favorite

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.610
of every generation – and a brand new trilogy
aiming to bring even more fans into the fold.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.500
But you would be surprised to know just how
many scenes director George Lucas originally

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.070
meant to include in his space epic.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.810
Scenes that could have turned out to be completely
unforgettable, if they hadn’t wound up on

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.890
the cutting room floor.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.570
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Star Wars Movie
Scenes You’ve Never Seen.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.140
Greedo Never Learns

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.480
No Star Wars prequel take more heat than the
Phantom Menace, but fans missed out on one

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.150
original trilogy cameo that was guaranteed
to cause some controversy.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.770
After Anakin wins the podrace, Qui-Gon finds
the boy fighting with a young Rodian who claims

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.770
he cheated.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.180
When the kids are split up, the final reveal
comes - it's no random Rodian, but a young

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.370
Greedo, the same bounty hunter who would learn
the hard way that Han always shoots first...

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.480
Depending on who you ask.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.259
A Proud Smuggler

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.829
The assault on the shield generator station
in Return of the Jedi always seemed a bit

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.899
rushed, and with good reason: the original
version had Han and his team taking out a

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.060
Squad of stormtroopers before being ambushed
and captured.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.719
But the real shame is that audiences never
got to hear what could have been another classic

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.069
Han Solo one liner.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:25.090
When cornered and accused of being "Rebel
Scum," the Corellian smuggler takes genuine

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.369
offense to the term, as only he can.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.959
Tosche Station

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:36.459
No die-hard Star Wars fan will ever forget
the first time Luke mentioned he’d be making

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:42.689
a trip to Tosche station for some all-important
power converters.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.979
But the location was originally going to be
shown when Luke rushed to tell his friends

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.579
about the space battle visible over Tattooine.

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.329
The scene also introduced Luke’s best friend
Biggs Darklighter, long before the two were

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.780
reunited before the attack on the Death Star.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.780
At the time, Biggs was still training to be
an Imperial pilot before defecting to the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.780
Rebellion.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.749
Wampa Troubles

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.929
Freezing cold isn't the only danger on Hoth,
and the Empire Strikes Back opens with Luke

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.179
finding out how much damage a wild Wampa can
really do.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.569
But the massive creatures were originally
going to be shown as a headache for the entire

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.260
Rebel base, with the troops managing to trap
them in a single room in Echo Base.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.780
When the Empire breaks in and the heroes flee,
C-3PO has the bright idea to remove the warning

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.560
sign, leading one trooper into a bloody end.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.010
Apparently, the droid doing something clever,
funny and helpful was deemed too out of character,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.329
and the scene was cut.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.730
Seeds of The Rebellion

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.180
It's not hard to guess why yet another political
subplot was cut out of Revenge of the Sith,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.040
but we would bet most fans would have liked
to see Padme and Bail Organa start to form

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.670
the future Rebel Alliance in the senate's
back rooms.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.540
Especially working with a young Mon Mothma
years before she would lead the resistance

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.510
and brief Luke Skywalker on the Death Star's
weakness.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.180
Considering how many extra subplots *didn't*
get cut, this one seems like a missed opportunity,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.550
and a clever way of linking the prequels and
original trilogy.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.590
Endor’s Fate

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.080
If you've ever wondered why the second Death
Star didn't just blow up Endor's forest moon

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.349
and take out Han Solo and Leia once and for
all, a deleted scene has the answer.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.519
The Emperor actually gave that exact order,
demanding the battlestation destroy the moon

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.390
if its shields were ever sabotaged.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.269
It's hard to know why the scene was taken
out - it would have added a ticking clock

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.950
to the entire Ewok battle, and the Commander's
mixed feelings over killing his own troops

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.189
along with the enemy showed not *every* Imperial
officer was completely evil.

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.459
Luke’s New Lightsaber

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.090
We know what you're thinking: there's no way
that a scene showing Luke as a full-fledged

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.640
Jedi Knight, building his own Lightsaber could
be cut out of Return of the Jedi, right?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.640
Wrong.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.730
Before he sent his droids into Jabba's palace,
Luke's new look was originally going to be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.829
revealed as he put the finishing touches on
his green saber.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.260
The scene makes his plan to smuggle the weapon
through security a bit clearer, but his second

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.210
reveal to Jabba the Hutt was deemed to be
a better one.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.040
We'll let the fans decide that one.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.439
C-3PO Saves The Day

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.530
It's no secret George Lucas strayed into creepy
territory with the implied love between Luke

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.620
and Leia, but eventually played their kiss
in the Empire Strikes Back as a joke, when

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.050
the characters were revealed to be brother
and sister ("he's my brother!" clip from the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.050
end of Jedi).

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.650
But a deleted scene took things much, much
farther.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.000
Not only is the scene a more romantic one,
it shows that both siblings were genuinely

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.650
attracted to each other, and on the verge
of a passionate kiss before C-3PO interrupts.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.250
Some claim the deleted scene is proof Lucas
still hadn't decided the two were twins when

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.160
the movie was filmed, and frankly, that's
the only explanation for this scene that doesn't

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.530
make our skin crawl.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.110
You Only Die Twice

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.790
General Grievous may have gotten more laughs
than screams, but the Jedi-killer's original

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.710
introduction in Episode 3 showed he was no
joke, executing a Jedi named Shaak Ti with

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.720
her own lightsaber.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.890
The lighthearted hand signals between Obi-Wan
and Anakin that followed her death showed

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.360
the scene was a bit too awkward to work, but
Lucas was determined to kill the Jedi on screen.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.360
So determined, he also filmed her death at
the hands of Anakin when he first turned to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.360
the Dark Side - which also wound up on the
cutting room floor.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.160
Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.310
The budding romance between Anakin Skywalker
and Padme in Attack of the Clones wasn't a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.730
hit with every fan, but George Lucas originally
planned to spend even more time on their courtship.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.410
Deleted scenes take the pair to visit Padme's
parents and older sister, who can't help but

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.820
notice the young Jedi's affection.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.421
It’s hard to say this dating drama is really
a fit for the series at all, but in the end,

00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:30.780
the director probably decided introducing
characters who’d never know what happened

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.250
to their grandchildren raised more questions
than it answered.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.540
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.400
