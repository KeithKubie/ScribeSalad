00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.530
- Thank you, Meredith.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.280
I have been waiting
for this introduction,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.990
and it was simply amazing.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.830
Thank you very much.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.780
In a recent survey, I was
asked to describe Radcliffe

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.050
in five words, and this might
look like an easy question

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.140
to answer, but I soon realized
it was quite challenging,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.110
because there are so many
words that come to mind--

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.170
encouragement, support,
diversity, inclusion,

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.060
recognition, inspiration,
motivation, uplift, elevation.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.800
Many of these
universal values align

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.930
with a history that
happened between these walls

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.600
and are reflected in the
mission of the institute.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.960
Radcliffe is intellectually
rigorous, urban in location,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.720
bold in spirit, and
global in outlook.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.930
Radcliffe is about big and
important issues and ideas,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.710
like peace and governance,
health and equity, resources

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.080
and tolerance.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.270
Radcliffe transforms,
enlightens, and empowers.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.700
I would like to
highlight that working

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.410
in this academic
constellation has

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.770
been an immensely intellectually
uplifting, professionally

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.130
rewarding, and personally
transforming experience.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.200
To be an Radcliffe fellow
is both a great honor

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.780
and a privilege, and I
can't express how grateful

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.980
I am to the leadership for
giving me this opportunity

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.800
to be part of this.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.550
I would also like to
take this opportunity

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.860
and highly recommend to
my fellow researchers

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.770
from natural sciences to
apply for this fellowship,

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.650
and to advance professionally
in a supportive stimulating

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.770
and very dynamic setting.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.960
As Meredith mentioned, I
come with a cross-cultural

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.040
experience, and throughout my
two decades of academic career,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.800
I learned to appreciate both
the benefits and challenges

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.958
of culturally and socially
very diverse academic settings.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:50.250
I was born and raised in
Macedonia, a beautiful country

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.670
with a very rich and long
history in southeastern Europe,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.060
but also a place which appears
to be constantly in transition.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.190
I spent half of my
professional career

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.680
in Japan, an academic
environment which

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.170
is in many ways
established and advanced,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.270
but which is also
generally viewed as rather

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.550
rigid and conservative.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.259
I now work for New
York University

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.170
in their portal campus
located in the Emirates, where

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.340
one of the best private
American universities

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.580
has set as its
mission to partake

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.600
in the process of transforming
an authoritarian society

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.230
within a very short
period of time.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.060
I also happen to
be the only chemist

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.650
in this batch of
fellows, and when

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.790
I was thinking about the subject
of this talk, the chemist in me

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.350
was tempted to show you
something like this.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.630
I can lend you a few
slides of this sort

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.320
if you ever suffer from
insomnia to help you with sleep.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.090
But in an attempt to
avoid being technical,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.650
instead I wanted to
take you on a journey

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.470
and tell you about something
all of us can relate to,

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.930
something that also
continues to inspire

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.480
great scientific discoveries.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.900
I asked myself, what is it that
these so different cultures

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.570
that I have experienced
have in common?

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.210
In a recent interview for one
of the scientific journals,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.550
I stated that there
are two things that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.100
inspired me to become
a scientist-- first,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.090
the curiosity.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.860
And second, the nature.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.370
I recognized very early in
life the full worth and beauty

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.350
of nature.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.070
Instead my very
first recollections

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.950
of my early childhood are those
of the beautiful green hills

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.240
of Macedonia, where I was both
curious and inspired about how

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.210
plants and animals
live and survive.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.370
I later discovered
that endorsing

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.080
cognitive
connectedness to nature

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.180
and engaging with
natural beauty is not

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.430
only common for many
cultures, regardless

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.620
of their social and
political milieu,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.660
but at an individual
level, it is also

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.060
thought to be associated
with greater well-being

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.910
and awareness for
environmental conservation.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
And that idea is perhaps
best sublime in this quote

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.860
of John F. Kennedy
that you can find

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.810
on a board in the
Kennedy memorial park

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.060
right here in front of Harvard.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.990
But nature also has a quirky,
unexpected, or just downright

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.430
weird side.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.060
Geckos can climb up walls
and stick to ceilings.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.840
Insects can walk on water,
and some snakes can even fly.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.760
These obscure corners
of the living world

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.850
might sound like an episode
of Ripley's Believe It or Not!

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.920
Yet they happen more often
than we think about them,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.459
and more importantly, they
may hold enormous benefits

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.950
to the humanity.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.260
Over the course of
millennia, plants and animals

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.180
have developed and
perfected mechanisms

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.510
for motion, survival, and
dispersal with astounding

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.880
grace, speed, and versatility.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.590
But how do they do it, and
what can we learn from them?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.170
So in this next slide, you will
see the amazing efficiency,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.100
durability, adaptability,
and self-healing capability

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.550
for which the biological
systems are in doubt.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.350
And these are some of
the main inspirations

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.840
of the material scientist
as structure functionality

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.140
principles.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.560
And if we look back in
time, the living beings

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.020
had a very, very long
time to perfect themselves

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.030
in order to survive.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.240
The age of the Earth is
about 4.5 billion years,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.660
and the earliest undisputed
evidence of life of art

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.750
dates from at least
3.5 billion years ago,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.680
although there is also evidence
that life began much earlier.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.330
The global changes
with processes

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.970
such as plate tectonics
and solar variability

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.660
have occurred over thousands
to millions of years.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.900
On a much smaller scale,
over decades to centuries,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.840
the human activities have
become an important driver

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.020
of the physical climate system
and the biochemical cycles.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.950
To just give you a feel of
how long it took the living

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.070
organisms to evolve to what they
are now, insects such as ants

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.660
have been around since
140 million years ago,

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.360
while the squid have
been on this planet

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.270
since about 100 millions ago.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.590
Our human lineage started only
about two million years ago,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.220
and about 200,000 years ago
our species, the homo sapiens,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.540
emerged.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.010
So you might want
to consider this

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.470
the next time you
step on an ant or have

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.090
your calamari for dinner.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.800
If aliens ever
visited our planet

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.910
and they decided to
communicate with humans,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.090
one of their first
questions would probably be,

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.480
how many distinct lifeforms
does your planet have?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.320
You would be surprised
with the uncertainty

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.010
in our answer, which
illustrates our limited progress

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.930
with this research topic.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.840
In more than 250 years
since the Swedish biologist

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.690
Carl Linnaeus began the
science of taxonomy,

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.070
1.2 million species had been
identified and classified.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.490
It is estimated that it
will take us another 480

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.980
years to complete the job.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.980
However, the Linnaeus system
forms a pyramid-like hierarchy,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.880
which is inverted image of
the taxonomic rank shown here.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.090
The lower the category, the
more entities it contains.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.040
There are more
species than genera,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.100
more genera than families,
more families than orders,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.910
and so on right up to the top
levels, the kingdom and domain.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.800
Recently, a new
method was proposed

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.600
that allows the total
number of species

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.390
to be predicted based on
the consistent scaling

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.920
pattern among the
different levels

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.060
of taxonomic classification--
system, order, genus, species,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:13.530
and so on.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.810
According to the latest
biodiversity estimate

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.830
based on this new
method of prediction,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.070
there are 8.7 million--

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.280
give or take 1.3 million--

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.770
eukaryotic species
on our planet.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.490
This means that a staggering
86% of land species

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.900
and nearly 91% of marine
species remain undiscovered.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.750
With these numbers at hand,
we cannot even begin to answer

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.140
questions such as how much
diversity we can lose while

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.630
still maintaining these
ecosystem services that

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.540
humanity depends on.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.050
So why are the
materials so important?

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.240
Because about everything
you see around

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.600
you is made of materials,
from the concrete walls

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.180
to the intricate parts
of your smartphones,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.420
from the smallest grain of
sand to most complex systems

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.440
like the living organisms.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.280
And we want these materials
to be lighter, thinner,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.930
smarter, better.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.050
We care about how they look
and feel, how long they last,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.510
and how much we need
to pay to use them.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.370
With great enthusiasm
and curiosity,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.290
material scientists
and engineers

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.050
working in the biometric
materials research field

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.130
ask why natural
selection may have

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.040
favored one species over another
or one design over another.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.770
From the labs of
Harvard, here, and MIT

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.450
to the deserts of
rain forests, they

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.679
seek to answer why animals and
plants have adapted and evolved

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:38.100
to disperse and traverse their
environments, taking advantage

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.740
of physical laws and
environmental conditions

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.310
with results that are both
startling and ingenious.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.490
Our desire and ability
to imitate nature

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.910
has also continuously evolved,
and as technology improves,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.540
more difficult challenges
are yet to come.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.280
The humanity changed forever
during the first Industrial

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.200
Revolution, which
began in Britain

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.540
in the late 18th
century with the design

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.120
of an engine in which
burning coal produced

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.280
steam which drove a piston.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.460
The second Industrial Revolution
came in the early 20th century,

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.490
when Henry Ford mastered
the moving assembly line

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.920
and ushered in the age
of mass production.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.500
It witnessed the expansion
of electricity, petroleum,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.760
and steel.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.320
The first two
Industrial Revolutions

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.290
made people richer
and more urban.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.240
Now a third revolution
is underway way.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.120
Manufacturing is going
digital, and a number

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.580
of remarkable technologies
are converging.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.070
Clever softward and
more dexterous robots,

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.400
new processes, a range
of web based services,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.640
and particularly important for
all these developments-- novel

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.770
and better materials.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.320
Living in the area of
emerging hyperconnectivity,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.780
we are on the cusp of the
fourth Industrial Revolution,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.510
or Industry 4.0.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.030
It is quite different than the
three industrial revolutions

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.160
that preceded it,
because it is supposed

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.800
to challenge even
our ideas about what

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.640
it means to be human.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.690
The fourth Industrial Revolution
describes exponential changes

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.230
to the way we live, work,
and relate to one another due

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.880
to adoption of cyber
physical systems,

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.880
the internet of things, and
the internet of systems.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.550
Implementation of smart
technologies in our factories

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.632
and workplaces,
connecting machines

00:10:16.632 --> 00:10:18.090
that will interact
with each other,

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.490
visualize the entire
production chain,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.520
and make decisions
autonomously-- this revolution

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.330
will impact all disciplines,
industries, and economies.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.110
And again, it requires
new, better materials.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.700
In parallel with
these developments,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.290
there have been
efforts to develop

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.960
a global understanding of
the functioning of the earth

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.310
as a system.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.560
The effort necessitated
linking knowledge,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.400
and unifying methodologies, and
conceptual frameworks from both

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.440
the physical and biological
research domains,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.550
and will inevitably result in
a highly integrated science

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.720
and technology realm.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.260
One of the motivations
for this development

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.620
is the growing impact of humans
on the Earth's system and, more

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.380
importantly, the necessity
to provide solutions

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.300
while also
recognizing the impact

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.150
of the relevant social
drivers and their consequences

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:09.790
for the changes
that are occurring.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.670
Materials are derived
from natural resources,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.400
and material
sufficiency has become

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.740
as important as energy
efficiency with efforts

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.530
towards a circular
materialist economy, where

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.470
the materials are
reused and to drawdown

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.380
from the natural resources base.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.770
One of the critical
components in transferring

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:33.580
an idea to application
is that of the design.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.430
The design is the process
of translating an idea

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.920
into detailed information
from which a product can

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.120
be manufactured.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.510
The starting point in
design is a market need,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.450
and the end point is the full
specification of a solution

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.430
that fills the needs.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.620
While many aspects of
the natural principles

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:53.350
are beyond our understanding,
a significant progress

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.680
has been made in elucidating
the underlying principles.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.540
In a highly
interdisciplinary exercise,

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.150
much real scientists
and engineers

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.260
work together to reverse
engineer these principles.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.430
Making biomimetic
materials and systems

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.850
requires not only understanding
of the basic principles,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:13.570
but also modeling,
graphic simulation,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.670
fabrication of the
materials and systems,

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.880
and ultimately physical
implementation of the resulting

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.270
technology.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.220
But let's go back in time.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.490
Perhaps the most famous
story related to biomimetics

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.790
is that of the Swiss
inventor, George de Mestral.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.970
In 1941, de Mestral
was on a hunting trip

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.540
and noticed that both his pants
and his Irish pointers hair

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.930
were covered in the burs
from a burdock plant.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.120
Being curious from
a very early age,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.420
de Mestral decided to study
the burs under microscope,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.130
more out of curiosity
than because

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:49.380
of a business opportunity.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.720
What de Mestral
saw were thousands

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.260
of tiny hooks that
efficiently bound themselves

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.330
to nearly any fabric.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.820
Being inspired by
science, de Mestral

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.920
realized that, if
he could create

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.430
a synthetic form of this fabric,
it would allow for a new way

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.070
to fasten things, a middle
ground between buttons,

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.430
zippers, and simply
sewing stuff together.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:16.230
His idea was to take the
hooks he had seen in the burs

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.690
and combine them with
simple loops of fabric.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.580
The tiny hooks would
catch in the loops,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.770
and things would
just come together.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.490
In 1958, he was granted a
patent for his invention

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.740
for what would later
become known as Velcro.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.040
The principles of operation
of all biomimetic materials

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.220
rely on capturing the
essence of biogenic systems

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.470
in an attempt to emulate
their functionality

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.840
by intentional modulation
of their structure

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.370
and composition.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.260
The hierarchical and
mechanistic traits

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.230
that enable responses
to environmental stimuli

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.320
are central to advancement
of the biomimetic science

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.110
as they inspire the design
of durable artificial

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.790
architectures.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.740
Some of the principles
can be harnessed

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:01.190
to make miniature devices
that can fly like a dragonfly,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.700
adhere to walls like a gecko,
adapt in texture, pattern,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.690
and shape of the
surroundings like octopus,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.920
process complex three
dimensional images

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.210
in real time, recycle power for
operation and locomotion, self

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.530
replicate or self repair, grow
using surrounding resources,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.980
or generate and store energy.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.380
Plants, for instance,
have prevailed and adapted

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.170
to different climates by
continually perfecting

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.140
energy conserving mechanisms
for dispersal that

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.140
utilize spatial temporal
gradients in temperature,

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.140
light, pressure, and humidity.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.480
Some futuristic
applications can also

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.640
be envisaged, such
as those that mimic

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.680
the motility of a tumbleweed.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.500
Sophisticated robotic
tumbleweed-like devices

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.900
could use the wind to
operate on their own

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.070
for years, traversing thousands
of miles of desertscape,

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.380
using only the way
to send information

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.330
on the desert conditions.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.550
Since Mars has its
own wind, which

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.310
you can hear on
this slide, making

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.210
a Rover that has the
structure of a tumbleweed

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.860
is an attractive idea to
design a vehicle which

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:10.310
can travel great distances
with minimal power.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:12.940
As a second example,
this tumbleweed inspired

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.800
prototypical mine detonator
on the last picture

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.910
here is composed almost entirely
of bamboo and biodegradable

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.140
plastics with a skeletal
structure of spiky plungers

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.450
that resembles a giant spherical
tumbleweed from another planet.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.220
Through evolution over
millions of years,

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.210
nature introduced power
efficient solutions

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.390
that use air or air currents.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.660
Mimicking these solutions could
improve our lives and the tools

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.100
we use.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.550
Trees disperse their seeds by
using aerodynamic principles

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.070
to passively travel
with aid of wind,

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:52.010
and these principles
have been used in devices

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.950
from boomerang to gliders,
to helicopter blades,

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.590
to aircrafts, and drones.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:01.400
Maples, like many long
dispersal tree seeds,

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.010
rely on wind, upward
currents, and gusts

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.830
to spread their seeds
over long distances that

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.110
can reach several kilometers.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.910
The wind seed of a
maple, called samara,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.150
autogyrates as it falls.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.570
The spiral motion is insensitive
to the initial conditions

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.810
and is stabled against
wind disturbances.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:23.870
So last spring, I actually
collected some of these seeds

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.820
here in front of
Radcliffe, and I would like

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.320
to show you how this happens.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.720
So these are the seeds,
and if we throw them,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.740
they start to
rotate for a reason.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.080
The interesting point here
is, regardless how do you

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.070
throw them in the air, they
always stabilize their motion

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.480
and go into perfectly
steady descent.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.400
So if you throw them.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.380
So maple seeds
are able to rotate

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.140
because of their
structure, because

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:02.390
of their center of gravity,
which is determined

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.339
by the position
of the heavy nut,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:07.099
is located at the base
of the wing shaped seed.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:10.250
It has been observed that,
despite their small size

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.359
and slow velocities, these seeds
are able to generate with lift,

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:17.329
being able to remain in
the air for longer times

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.520
than other non-rotating seeds.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.160
A main puzzle here
has been to understand

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.109
exactly how the seed settles
into their steady descent.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.500
This stable autorotation
of maple seeds

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.110
or other similar
rotary seeds depends

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.260
on the interplay between their
three dimensional inertial

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.180
and aerodynamic
properties, which

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.000
result in unexpected
high lift forces

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.390
despite their small
size and slow velocity.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.430
The generation of so-called
stable leading edge vortex

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.540
similar to that observed
in hovering insects, bats,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.640
and some birds has
been shown to be

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.820
responsible for such
high lift force.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.400
Robotic models-- seeds
that have been recently

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.010
used to accurately
predict the presence

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.200
of a strong tornado-like
vortex on top

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.790
of the maple seed wings
that elevates the lift

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:11.960
and increases their dispersal
distance from the tree.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.490
So these lessons
learned from the maples

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.690
and other similar seeds
have been already used

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.850
as technology in the design
of unmanned aerial vehicles,

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.800
quadcopters, and drones.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.140
The maple seeds, for
example, were the inspiration

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.150
for a new kind of
flying machine that

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.060
could be useful for military
information gathering.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.000
Lockheed Martin's intelligent
robotics laboratories

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.240
developed an unmanned craft
to replicate the motion.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.850
The device, named
Samarai, has only two

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.620
moving parts and a camera.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.600
It can be controlled
by remote control

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.820
or by an app on a phone.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.340
Planet Earth has been
called the blue planet

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.710
due to the abundant
water on its surface.

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.960
Water is the most
abundant resource

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.290
in the natural
environment, yet about 97%

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.210
of the total water on
earth is sea water.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.720
The fresh water that is
directly available to humans

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.320
makes up only
between 0.4% and 2%,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.460
and comes mainly from frozen
glaciers and polar ice caps,

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.880
liquid groundwater,
or aerial humidity.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.690
In a recent global risks report,
water scarcity has been ranked

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.630
has one of the highest
environmental and societal

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.800
risks.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.830
It is estimated that 2/3
of the world population

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.340
will experience
water stress by 2025.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.040
Approximately one billion
people live without access

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.950
to clean water
resources in rural areas

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.920
of African, Asian, and
Latin American countries,

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.500
turning the issue of water
shortage and scarcity

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.680
into a major global concern.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.480
Using an ensemble
of climate models

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.690
and socioeconomic scenarios,
the World Resources Institute

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.500
predicts that 33 countries
will face extremely high water

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.390
stress by 2040.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.510
The businesses, farms, and
communities in Chile, Estonia,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.350
Namibia, and Botswana could face
especially significant increase

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.320
in water stress by 2040,
and these countries

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.320
will become more vulnerable
to water scarcity

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.750
than they are today.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.740
14 out of 33 most water
stressed countries in 2040

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.240
are in the Middle East.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.500
The region, already the least
water secure in the world,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.070
draws heavily upon groundwater
and desalinated seawater,

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.620
and faces exceptional
water related challenges

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.600
for the foreseeable future.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.670
With regional violence
and political turmoil

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.040
commanding global
attention, the water issue

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.810
may seem a tangential problem.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.940
However, looking into
the future and according

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.220
to the US National
Intelligence Council,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.890
the water scarcity will put
key North African and Middle

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.310
Eastern countries at greater
risk of instability and state

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.450
failure, and will distract them
from foreign policy engagements

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.070
with the US.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.620
I live in the Emirates,
and although this country

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.060
is only about 45 years
old, the main cities here

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.960
are an urban jungle-- are very
similar to other metropolises

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.420
like New York City or Shanghai.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.380
So if you drive only about
10 kilometers from here,

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.200
you will encounter a very
different environment,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.420
the Arabian desert.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.340
And there is no
other place on Earth

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.580
where the contrast between
the urban and the natural

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.760
is so stark.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.920
It is the fourth largest
desert in the world

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.230
and the largest in Asia.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.560
The climate here is hot and
dry, with only about 100

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.720
millimeter rainfall per year.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.810
Miles and miles of
nothing but sand and wind,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.570
yet the desert is
not a deserted place.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.090
In many regions, fog and
dew represent regularly

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.850
occurring phenomena and
have a substantial impact

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.570
on the hydrology and ecology
of the local vegetation.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.700
Over several billion
years of evolution,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.930
the nature has helped desert
organisms evolve and survive

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.480
in an extremely hostile
and arid environment

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.680
by harmonizing the
structure and function,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.890
and by making use
of minimal resources

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.590
to attain maximum performance.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:03.930
Can we learn something from
these amazing creatures?

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.270
Meet the standard scarab beetle.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.850
I think Annie would
love this part.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.070
It thrives in the
Namib, a coastal desert

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.460
in Southern Africa, one of the
most arid habitats on earth.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.150
With less than 13 millimeter
rainfall per year.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.640
The standard scarab beetle
is able to harvest water

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.770
on its bumpy back
by a combination

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.960
of hydrophilic,
or wetable, areas

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.110
on a hydrophobic, or
non-wetable, background.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.940
So what happens is,
early in the morning,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:31.590
when the dew in
which fog settles

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.590
over the dunes, the beetle
climbs the dune peaks

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.460
and positions its body in a way
that facilitates dew formation.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.070
The water condenses on
the wetable regions,

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.200
and once droplets
reach critical size,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.420
they slide down to
non-wetable regions,

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.270
and the beetle slurps up
the water thus formed.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.010
Inspired by nature,
there are now

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.580
extensive efforts being made
to utilize this as a design

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:57.880
principle, and it has been
already successfully replicated

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.640
for fog interception
to provide clean water

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.490
to human settlements
in arid regions.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.760
These technologies rely upon
fog water droplet deposition

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.580
onto nylon mesh
or Teflon fibers.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.710
These materials
allow condensation

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.850
of droplets on their surfaces,
but resist complete wetting.

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.400
Schemes of this kind have
been successfully implemented

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.340
in desolate desert areas
in countries including

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.010
South Africa,
Namibia, and Atacama

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.490
desert in northern Chile.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.770
Several lizard
species and tortoises

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.260
that live in arid areas
use similar principles

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.890
to harvest moisture from
humidity fog, dew, or rain.

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.310
Bodies of lizards, such as
the Australian thorny devil,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.250
Arabian [INAUDIBLE],, and
the Texas horned lizard,

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.650
have independently
developed body surfaces

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.710
that are covered with
honeycomb-like structures that

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:52.710
render the surface super, super
wetable, super hydrophilic,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.160
and increase the condensation
of air humidity by about 100%.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.340
The water spreads and is
soaked into a capillary system

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.620
in between scales,
which transports

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.650
the water to the mouth,
where it is ingested.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.420
The combination of
super wetability,

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.690
micro ornamentation, and
the semitubular capillaries

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.660
allows for passive or
directed water transport

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.060
for their survival.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.270
Do not mess with these guys,
especially the last one

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.500
on the right.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.450
Indigenous plants found in
arid and semi-arid locations

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.700
readily cope with an
insufficient access

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.960
to fresh water.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.320
Fog episodes occur frequently
in many of these regions

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.480
and help to augment
the water supplies

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.150
for native botanic species
through dew and fog

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.750
collection, as well as
water vapor absorption.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.060
In addition to the adaptive
characteristics that

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.820
minimize the water
loss, some species

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.820
appear to use fog as an
additional water supply

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.720
by using spines that
fulfill multiple functions.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.260
The bunny ear cactus shown here
has an efficient fog collection

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.510
system composed of
well distributed

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.970
clusters of conical spines.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.340
Each spine has three
integrated parts

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.490
that have different surface
structures and different roles

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.330
in the fog collection process.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.880
The fog collection ability
of these and some other cacti

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.060
is believed to be driven by
the gradients in free surface

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:19.110
energy and the so-called
Laplace pressure.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.730
The surface wetting
properties are

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.740
a combination of surface
chemistry and surface

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.660
structures.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.680
Their underlying
benefits are manyfold

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.440
and range from prevention
of settling of pathogens

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.230
to ensuring floating
ability in aquatic plants,

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.190
to facilitating the catching
of prey by carnivorous plants.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.790
In 1997, two German
scientists published the paper

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.740
on the purity of sacred lotus
and described what later became

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.550
known as the lotus effect.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:49.190
If you take a close look at
the surface of a lotus leaf,

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.500
you'll discover a double
layer of textures.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.630
Waxy microscopic
bumps are covered

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:57.890
in nanoscale sized hairs which
strap a thin film of layer.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:00.500
When the rain droplets
touch the Lotus leaves,

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.650
they remain spherical, which
allows the droplets to bounce

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.750
around until they fall
off the leaf, which

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.760
stays dry and clean.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.850
This self-healing effect can be
also found in other species--

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.080
plant species, birds,
and even insects.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.420
This phenomenon has
aroused great interest

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.190
for its potential
for applications

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.910
in self-cleaning materials in
a number of different fields.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:25.850
A deeper knowledge on how these
services attain the property,

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.030
which is now referred to
as superhydrophobicity,

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.340
is key to reproducing
this natural effect

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.270
in glasses for windows,
clothes, and other materials.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.550
A particularly important
application of this effect

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.040
is in preparation of
self-cleaning superhydrophobic

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.520
coatings for solar cells, which
could solve a major problem

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.040
with increased efficiency
of solar cells over time,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.120
especially in arid regions,
which are also endowed

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.933
with highest insulation.

00:26:52.933 --> 00:26:54.600
You will be surprised
to know that there

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.320
are plants out there that do not
even require soil to survive.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.190
Perhaps you're familiar with
the so-called air plants,

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.500
such as the tillandsia,
which are biologically

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.750
referred to as aerophytes.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.970
These peculiar plants
make good house plants

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.760
due to their minimal water
and solar requirements.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.160
They obtain moisture
and nutrients

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.900
from the air and rain.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.520
They usually grow
on other plants,

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.070
but are not parasitic on
them, and some can even

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.530
live on mobile sand dunes.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:24.900
So I did bring some of
these plants for you,

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.090
and you will notice
something that

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.210
is not characteristic
for other plants, which

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:33.120
is the shape of the leaves.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.160
So they have very narrow
leaves shaped like a trough,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:44.280
and this serves for
collection of water.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.272
There you go.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:54.380
So we can possibly learn
something from that

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.690
and make a similar system
that can be efficient water

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.570
collectors, especially based
on the shape of the leaves

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.360
and the surface of these leaves.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.360
Going to the next slide,
nature has devised mechanism

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.030
for active locomotion of
plants, typically observed

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.300
with rapid movements
for prey and defense,

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.820
or with very slow movements
during the growth.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.580
One of the frontiers of the
contemporary material science

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.310
research is the design of
a new advanced activating

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.640
materials which mimic the
motility and are capable

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.750
of fast, reversible, and
controllable mechanical motion

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.620
in response to external
stimuli, such as heat, light,

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.330
magnetic field,
or electric field.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.960
The research efforts
in this field

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.230
are driven by the potentials
for utility of such motion

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:41.290
to perform mechanical work
which could have far reaching

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:44.890
technological implications as
mechanically active elements--

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.380
for example, in the future,
micro and nano robotics, which

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.440
will be soft, organic,
and human-like.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.470
The remarkable ability of
geckos to climb vertical walls

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.620
and ceilings has inspired
philosophers, scientists,

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:59.530
artists, and layman
for over two millennia.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.690
Aristotle noted the
ability of geckos

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:06.190
to run up and down
a tree in any way,

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.830
even with their head downwards.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.440
Geckos use millions
of adhesive hairs

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.950
on their toes to climb
vertical surfaces at speeds

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.660
of over 1 meter
per second, which

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.270
is about two miles per hour.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.230
Climbing presents a
significant challenge

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.870
for an adhesive requiring both
strong and firm attachment,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.970
and easy and rapid removal.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:30.100
The attempts to mimic
the gecko toe pads

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.410
is one of the endeavors
of the fascinating field

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.050
of evolutionary
nanotechnology, which

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.870
focuses on developing new
functional and smart materials

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.210
by utilizing design
principles that

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:44.890
have been developed throughout
the evolution in nature.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.505
The impressive adhesive
properties of the geckos toe

00:29:47.505 --> 00:29:50.560
pads have been attributed to
the nature [INAUDIBLE] design

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.590
of hierarchical biological
structures realized

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.020
with fine hairs on the
gecko's feet, which

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.880
results in an
unmatched demonstration

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.750
of the power of adhesion.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.890
Gecko toes are now well studied,
and their sticky properties

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:05.440
have inspired some
incredible technologies,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.110
such as stitch free
ways to seal wounds

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.350
and sticky hand-held paddles
that may help soldiers scale

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.090
walls someday.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.520
The fascination with the
mechanism of adhesion

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.280
has resulted in several
attempts to develop and test

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.070
new synthetic dry adhesive
materials inspired

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.900
by the gecko toe pads.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.170
However, the ultimate goal of
creating a perfect mimic that

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.020
would reach the performance
of natural gecko foot hairs

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.590
has not accomplished yet, which
has even the brought dispute

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.060
over the originally proposed
mechanisms of adhesion.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.030
To disseminate, some
plants have become

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.810
capable of active migration
by reversibly changing

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.820
their shape, and have
developed systems

00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.360
to disperse by creeping,
crawling, ratcheting, buckling,

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.890
and slithering.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.930
Other plants have
developed mechanisms

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.960
for passive motility, where
their seats can snap, buckle,

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.900
or explode to disperse,
or burrow themselves

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.380
in the soil in response to
periodic changes in humidity

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:03.980
or temperature.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.100
Hydroresponsive
plants, for instance,

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.890
utilize fluctuations
in aerial humidity

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:11.680
to enhance seedling
survival and represent

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.930
an alternative approach
to environmental energy

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:16.720
transduction, because the
hydromotility does not

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.030
require light or
heat and is driven

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.870
by slow diffusion controlled
processes that elicit reactions

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.990
on longer timescales.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.880
A multitude of
approaches to realization

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.700
of biomimetic moving
devices has been

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.480
advanced through the design
of single molecules, polymers,

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.620
and composites, where external
stimulation by heat, light,

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:42.860
humidity, or magnetic
or electric fields

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.970
uses structural changes to
drive microscopic motility.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.670
When in arid conditions,
some grass [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.520
commonly undergo torsional
motion for burial.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.010
For example, the [INAUDIBLE]
of grasses such as the needle

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.190
and thread grass are
effective drillers

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.230
that are capable
of self cultivation

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.650
by propelling themselves
into the soil.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:05.900
Resurrection plants,
such as the spike moss,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.350
are famous for their ability
to survive extreme dehydration

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.820
and dessication.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.830
During the dry
season, the branches

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.920
curl inwards, forming
a dead looking ball.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.500
When dehydrated, the
plant can be uprooted

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.520
and become tumbleweed that blows
along the ground with the wind.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.440
When moistened, the
plant is coming out

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.590
of the dormant state induced
by the severe dehydration

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.270
and opens up.

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:32.210
In my lap, we have used
some of these principles

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.970
to prepare materials which
are able to drill and burrow

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:38.450
themselves into the surface in
response to periodic changes

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.830
in humidity.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.710
In the example shown here,
we have prepared the material

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.370
that mimics this behavior and
can open and close reversibly

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:48.660
when it is exposed to water.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.080
It can also feel the
presence of a human

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.900
and can move autonomously
by using only the gradient

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.320
in aerial humidity.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:58.600
Such hydroscopic materials
have the advantage

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.650
of long lasting reversible
activation in absence of light

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.650
and without thermal or
photochemical degradation.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.530
Prospective applications
range from power generators

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:13.330
and smart textiles to
artificial muscles and sensors.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.980
Some of the most
fascinating phenomena

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.050
that have inspired
biomimetic research

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.660
are related to the
ability of living systems

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.720
to use or to generate light.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.380
Light is eternal, but ethereal.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.870
Light does not require
contact, and therefore

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.850
provides means
for remote control

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.790
to biological or
artificial systems.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.810
Light interacting
biological structures

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.770
reflect the uniqueness of
the nature's optical design,

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.720
but they also suggest
broad innovation

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.700
in nature's use of materials
and its manipulation of light.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.980
And if we can just have
the lights dimmed, please.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.990
This is our planet, and
if you look very closely,

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:56.910
you might see a strange blue
glow off the coast of Florida--

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.090
when Florida comes
into the picture.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.860
This bright blue
glow in the ocean

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:05.640
is produced by a subgroup of
algae called dinoflagellates,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.550
which are the main
eukaryotic organisms that

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.159
are capable of
generating cold light.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.210
So that would be somewhere here.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.389
You can see this glow.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:18.630
When their population
are dense, disturbance

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.659
of the water during night causes
bright blue bioluminescent

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.530
displays that have been
reported since at least 500 BC

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.920
and are known to occur globally.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.679
Bioluminescence, the phenomenon
of biological generation

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:35.969
of visible cold light by
the excitation of chemically

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.190
produced excited
states, has been

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.120
documented as the early as
Aristotle's De Anima about 350

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:42.989
BC.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:46.139
It has inspired chemists,
writers, artists, and laymen

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:48.580
for thousands of years.

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.940
It is displayed by a number
of organisms, including

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:54.870
certain species of bacteria,
insects, jellyfish, mushrooms,

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.659
worms, and squid.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.770
There are about 70
biological families

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.880
of lower organisms spanning
over 250 genera which are known

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.070
to display bioluminescence.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.410
Only the family of beetles
known as fireflies,

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:13.410
for example, contains five
genera in about 2,000 species.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:18.110
So in the bioluminescence
world, the core physical process

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.080
of these natural phenomena
is energy of transduction

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.330
by which living
organisms use enzymes

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.000
to convert the chemical
bond energy of ground state

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.790
reactants for electronic
excitation of the reaction

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:29.880
products.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:31.940
The chem excited
products subsequently

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.850
emit light in the visible
region of the spectrum, which

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.510
is used to communicate signals.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.750
The bioluminescence is used
for communication, prey,

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:42.900
or defense.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:46.730
So in the bioluminescence,
there are these creatures,

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.030
such as the sea slugs,
which are the good ones.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.850
And there are the bad ones,
such as these dragon fish,

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:55.980
and, of course, there
are the ugly ones.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.750
And this would be the ugly ones.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.030
The type locality of this
worm, called diplocardia longa,

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.280
is a small town in
Georgia in the US.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.170
Its body fluids and
the sticky slime

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.860
that the worm secretes when
stimulated emit a bluish glow.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:11.780
The nature of the
emitting chemical species,

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.270
however, remains uncertain.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.730
Also, there are the
scary ones, as well.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.480
So this fish, known
as photoblepharon,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:23.340
using luminescent
bacteria under its eyes.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.490
You don't want to meet
this guy in a dark alley,

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.165
but it is scary because it's
very really tiny and harmless.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:38.360
So the bioluminescence has
been utilized and provided

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.200
an irreplaceable analytical
method with precision

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.230
on a picomole range-- this
is 10 to the minus 12--

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.350
and evolved into one of the
first non-invasive methods

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.560
for visualization of cell
and tissue organization.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.080
The bioanalytical techniques
based on bioluminescence

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.660
have become some of the
most versatile and powerful

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.290
analytical tools developed
in the 20th century.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.860
They are nowadays extensively
used for in vivo imaging,

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.740
for monitoring of cell
proliferation, protein folding,

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.770
and secretion, environmental
research, food quality

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.920
control, and protein
and genetic engineering.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.500
The bioanalytical techniques
based on bioluminescence

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.770
are sensitive, reliable,
quantitative, rapid,

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.410
non-invasive, and generally
come with a high signal

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.510
to noise ratio.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.120
However, some of the most
recent biomimetic applications

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:30.230
in material science are focused
on the firefly lanterns, which

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:31.970
help to very
efficiently uncouple

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:35.270
the light from the body and to
deliver strong optical signals

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.400
in sexual communication.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.140
The high transmission
nanostructures

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.150
of the firefly
lantern cuticle have

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.360
become biological inspiration
for highly efficient LED

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.800
illumination.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.980
Such biologically inspired
LED lenses substantially

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.160
increase the light transmission
over a visible range compared

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.370
to conventional
anti-reflection coatings.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.530
One of the most
remarkable consequences

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.590
of the orders and patterns that
are generated spontaneously

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:04.200
is the so-called
structural color.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.970
The description of
these optical effects

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.970
is as old as Robert Hooke's
famous book, Micrographia,

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.700
published in the
17th century, where

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.850
he presents microscopic
images of brilliant feathers

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.010
of peacocks and
ducks, and reports

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.410
that the colors
of their feathers

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.660
are destroyed by
a drop of water.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.680
When a matter is illuminated
with white light, we see color.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.320
Only the reflected light is
of a particular wavelength

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.960
that is detectable by our eyes.

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.570
There are two ways to eliminate
the remaining wavelengths--

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:35.940
by absorption, as is
the case with colored

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.610
materials such as
pigments, dyes, and metals,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.650
where the color is due
to the exchange of energy

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.050
between the light and electrons.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:45.900
In the second case, the light
is reflected, scattered,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.200
and deflected, and it doesn't
reach the eyes because

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.170
of the physical phenomena that
happen on the specific surface

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.030
structures.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.160
In nature, these
colors are enhanced

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.940
by thin film and multi-layer
interference, diffraction

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.575
ratings, light scattering,
or photonic crystals.

00:39:03.575 --> 00:39:04.950
So if you look at
these pictures,

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:07.350
you see the different
structures in the blue region

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:09.450
here than in the green region.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.910
And there is a further
degree of complexity,

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:14.580
because if you zoom
in these structures,

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.390
you will see even tinier
and finer structures

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:24.060
that actually all contribute to
light without any pigmentation.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:26.130
Some insects and
butterfly species

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.650
use similar complex
photonic band gap structures

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:31.410
that prevent propagation
of a band of wavelengths

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.490
through them, and thus cause
very strong color reflections.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.070
In butterflies such as
the blue morpho butterfly,

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:40.530
the visibility of
up to one half mile

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.360
is attributed to
photonic structures

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.690
that are formed by discrete
multiple layers of cuticle

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.040
and air.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.800
The butterflies use light
interacting structures

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.710
on their wing scales
to produce color.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.280
The cuticle on their scales is
composed of transparent kited

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.590
and air layered
structures with size

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.710
from the nanoscale
to the micro scale.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.540
These multi-scale
structures cause

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.880
light that hits the
surface of the wing

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.770
to deflect and interfere.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:09.810
Cross rips that
protrude from the sides

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:13.470
of the ridges on the wing scale
diffract incoming light waves,

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:16.710
causing the waves to spread as
they traveled through spaces

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.600
between the structures.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.540
The varying heights of
the wing scale ridges

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.660
affect the interference such
that the reflected colors

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.350
are uniform when viewed
from a wide range of angles.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.880
The specific color
that's reflected

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.070
depends on the shape
of the structures

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.260
and the distance between them.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.650
This way of manipulating light
results in brilliant iridescent

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.930
colors, which
butterflies rely upon

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:44.700
for camouflage, thermal
regulations, and signaling.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.980
So before I go into the
last part of my talk,

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.380
I would just like
to briefly introduce

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.380
two last examples that come
from faculty who are now here

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.930
at Harvard, where there
is a very active research

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.300
in this biomimetic field.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.240
The first is a sessile
deep water sponge known

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.160
as the Venus flower basket.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.990
It's called Venus
flower basket because it

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.380
has a couple of [INAUDIBLE] that
remain trapped there forever,

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.770
for life.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:10.770
So this is a symbiotic organism.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.260
This impressive structure was
started by Jonah Eisenberg

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.540
here at Harvard, and
all of it is essentially

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.750
made of the fine fibers of
glass with diameter close

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:20.550
to that of a human hair.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:22.920
It could withstand
enormous pressure

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.650
at the seafloor due to
a specific hierarchical

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:27.930
structure, which
embodies reinforcements

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.590
at multiple levels.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:35.330
The second example comes from
the laboratory of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:38.600
It explains how tendrils of
cucumbers and some other plants

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.740
work.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.870
Once it is attached
to a solid surface,

00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.080
the tendril shortens into
a helix, pulling the plant,

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.840
but rather than twisting in
only one direction, which

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.990
is impossible without twisting
the plant on the other hand,

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:52.730
the two halves of
the coil section

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.280
curl up in opposite
directions, separated

00:41:55.280 --> 00:42:00.470
by an uncoiled stretch
so there is no net twist.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.420
In addition to being a
significant component

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.700
of a bio inspired
architectural design,

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.220
a portion of the
biomimetic research

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.710
is proprietary to
specialized national defense

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.320
labs that develop
stealth technologies

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.140
and is not available to public.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.400
The stealth or low
observable technology

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.290
covers a combination
of techniques

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:21.830
that range from aircraft shaped
to special, low observable

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.160
coatings that are used to make
personnel or military objects

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.570
or vehicles less visible or
invisible to radar, infrared,

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:32.540
sonar, and other direct
detection methods.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.280
The very early
stealth technologies

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.230
involved the concept
of camouflage

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.270
for reducing the
visual signature

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.950
by making appearance
of an object

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:42.530
blend into the
visual background.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.260
Increased capability of the
detection and interception

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.080
technologies required
advanced materials

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.050
that either deflect or
absorb electromagnetic waves

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.090
from tracking devices.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.810
For example, central to the
design of the F-35 joint strike

00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:58.820
fighter design is
the application

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:01.820
of composite materials such
as composites of fiber mats

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.050
and polymers to reduce
observability and maintenance

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:08.870
costs while avoiding
applications

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.650
of stealth coatings.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:14.720
Future increases
in human welfare

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.450
will be driven by the increased
understanding and mastery

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.450
of the natural world, and the
materials the scientists are

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.300
posed to expand the
frontiers of human knowledge

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.540
by exploring these secrets,
but that globalization

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.760
has a dark side, too.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.030
We are living in
an urban century,

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.730
and demographic forecasts
indicate that world population

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.370
will reach 9 billion
by 2050, which

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.060
is an increase of 2
billion than at present.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:44.120
Being a phenomenon of physical
and cultural restructuring,

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.880
the globalization will have
complicated and far reaching

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.240
social, aesthetic,
economic, and physical,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.220
and political effects.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.930
Environmental challenges
facing the planet are complex,

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:58.690
and their impact on the natural
world and on human society

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.370
can be catastrophic.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:02.770
Climate change, loss
of natural resources,

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.530
declining biodiversity,
deforestation,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.930
and desertification, changes
in the carbon, nitrogen,

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.610
and phosphorus cycles, sea
level change, and pollution each

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:16.060
pose enormous problems, both
regionally and globally,

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.210
and indicate a dystopian future.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.950
So on this slide,
you can see some

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:25.000
of the species that are already
extinct or close to extinction.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.640
These challenges are
intricately interwoven

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:31.760
with issues of human health,
population, migration, water,

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.570
food, and energy
security, and inevitably

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.730
the potential for conflict.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.400
They require a broad
interdisciplinary approach

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.310
to understand them and
to provide solutions.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.590
Many of these challenges
already have had

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:47.890
or will have direct
impact locally.

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:50.950
Our planet is now in the
midst of the sixth wave

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.980
of mass extinction
of plants and animals

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.650
in the past half billion years.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.320
We are experiencing the
worst state of species

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.740
die offs since the loss of
dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.880
It is estimated that
we are losing species

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.630
1,000 to 10,000 times the
background rate, which

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:13.670
is 1 to 5 species per year.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.990
These slides that I
showed shows only a few

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:20.590
of these species that are
close to extinction or extinct,

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:22.870
and this is only a small
fraction of the species

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.070
that we are aware of.

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.470
There are many more
species, both small and big,

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.020
that we lost forever
without us even

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.290
knowing that they ever existed.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.040
So there are several
questions that I will

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.360
pose at the end of my talk.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.610
Can we reverse this process?

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.770
Can we prevent, slow
down destroying,

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:41.140
or remedy nature while
continuing to increasingly

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.060
explore its resources?

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:47.500
And does humanity really
need a backup planet?

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.970
Thank you.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.920
