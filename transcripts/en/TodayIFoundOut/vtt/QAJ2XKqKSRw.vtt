00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.890
This myth was popularized by an experiment
published in Nature in 1993 by the University

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:04.890
of California at Irvine.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.690
In this study, they had 36 students listen
to 10 minutes of Mozart before taking a spatial

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.159
IQ test.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:21.660
Their claim was that this increased the spatial
IQ score of the students by an average of

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.679
about 8 points, due to increasing performance
in specific types of spatial-temporal tasks.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.980
Specifically, in their study, Rauscher, Shaw,
and Ky, gave participants one of three standard

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.040
tests concerning abstract spatial reasoning.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.800
The subjects were exposed to three listening
conditions: silence, non-Mozart relaxing music,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.210
and a sonata by Mozart.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.730
Using the Stanford-Binet IQ test, they claimed
that listening to Mozart boosted the subjects

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.230
spatial IQ’s temporarily by 8-9 points over
the other two listening conditions.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920
There are a few problems with how this got
spun by the media.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.620
First, the researchers claim was only that
it seemed to increase subject’s abilities

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.900
in certain spatial-temporal tasks.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.960
They never said anything about increasing
ability anywhere else or in a person’s general

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.800
IQ, as their study was only on the effects
of Mozart on spatial-temporal reasoning.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.030
The media of course proceeded to blow these
results out of proportion and say that this

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.620
study showed that listening to Mozart makes
you smarter in general, not just concerning

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.250
spatial tasks.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.820
Yet another problem with the media and company’s
like Baby Genius’s portrayal of this is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.409
that the results only showed an increase in
IQ for about 15 minutes.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.630
There is no research to date that shows listening
to Mozart, or any other music, can boost IQ

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.840
permanently.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.350
Now to the problems with the actual study
itself and their results.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.170
First, they used a very small sample-size
in this study.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.770
That should instantly be the first warning
flag that one should wait for further research

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.479
on this issue before jumping to conclusions
or taking the results as fact.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.450
When you are dealing with small sample-sizes,
filtering out the noise from what is actually

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.869
happening is impossible in most cases.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.740
With that in mind, it turns out, other researchers
have had very little success in replicating

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.460
the original results.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.810
Several research projects have run the exact
same study, using the exact same methods and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.709
implementation of the experiment and found
zero evidence of any “Mozart Effect”.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.409
However, a few others have found some evidence
of a “Mozart Effect”.

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.319
So what’s going on here?

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.189
One team of researchers in 1999, made up of
Chistopher F. Chabris, Kenneth M. Steele et.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:32.090
al., concluded, concerning the mythical Mozart
Effect, that “any cognitive enhancement

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.519
is small and does not reflect any change in
IQ or reasoning ability in general, but instead

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.689
derives entirely from performance on one specific
type of cognitive task and has a simple neuropsychological

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.519
explanation, called ‘enjoyment arousal’.”

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.670
“Enjoyment arousal” simply means that
if you are enjoying yourself, to some extent,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.849
you will perform better at certain tasks you
are given.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.209
On that note, another study showed that listening
to Mozart only boosted performance in spatial-temporal

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.400
tasks in those subjects who enjoy listening
to Mozart, which would explain the seemingly

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.200
random results various research projects have
come up with concerning this issue.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.920
To further demonstrate that the cause was
“enjoyment arousal” and not Mozart, the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.269
researchers read passages from Stephen King
novels to the subjects while they performed

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.519
their tasks.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.599
The subjects who enjoyed Stephen King novels
showed a boost in their ability to perform

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.439
the tasks they were given at the same boost
level as the “Mozart Effect” subjects.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.769
Those who did not enjoy Stephen King novels
showed no boost, similar to those who did

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.099
not enjoy Mozart music.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.090
Further research by William Forde Thompson,
Gabriela Husain, and Glenn Schellenberg, in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.730
2001, also backed up this claim.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.469
In their study, they had subjects rate their
moods and energy levels while doing the specific

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.199
spatial tasks.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:54.560
When listening to upbeat Mozart pieces, many
of the subjects reported their mood and energy

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.700
levels increased.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.480
Those students who reported that increase
also scored better during this time.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.769
They were also then tested with a more depressing
piece of music playing.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.419
Not surprisingly, student’s moods and energy
levels went down and so did their results.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.560
Once the results were calibrated with mood
and energy levels, it was found that it was

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.979
the mood and energy levels, not the music,
that was spurring the increased results.

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.300
Thus, it would seem that the results are entirely
based on whether the subject enjoys Mozart

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.990
or whatever it is they are listening to while
being tested, whether music, or simply someone

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.699
reading a Steven King novel to them.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.620
So in the end, money spent on products like
much of the Baby Genius line, or the like,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.040
by states and parents would be much better
spent on music lessons for kids; there is

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.099
a vast amount of research that conclusively
shows music lessons, particular for kids (the

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.680
younger the better), improves their ability
to concentrate; helps their self-confidence;

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.220
helps their coordination; and seems to boost
their intelligence as well, among other positive

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.479
developmental benefits to the brain.

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.120
Further, the boost is significantly higher
than even the most optimistic of the “Mozart

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.280
Effect” claims.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.139
And best of all, these effects seem to last
for years, some of them for the entire life

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.840
of the individual and the improvements aren’t
subtle.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.000
Indeed, one experiment showed that even just
eight months worth of regular piano lessons

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.669
on preschoolers will increase their spatial
reasoning IQ on average about 50%.

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.590
That’s not even including all the other
benefits; that’s just talking about the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.070
spatial reasoning boost.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.180
Of course, the reason people probably want
the Mozart Effect to be true, over learning

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.030
a musical instrument, is that listening to
Mozart is passive; it takes no work and is

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.569
generally enjoyable to listen to while doing
other things (hence the boost).

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.909
Learning an instrument and to play music is
hard and takes an amazing amount of work.

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.189
But in the end, if you want to maximize yours
or your children’s brain-related potential,

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.270
this particular brand of work has been proven
to pay off in spades.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.270
Bonus Facts:

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.270
Interestingly, a recent study by Dr. Timo
Krings showed that pianists performed no better

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.270
than non-musicians at performing complex finger
movements.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.270
However, when their brains were scanned during
these complex finger movements, it was found

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.270
that the pianists’ brains had significantly
less activity than the non-musicians, implying

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.270
the brains of the pianists were more efficiently
wired for making complex finger movements.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:02.270
It is thought that learning to play music
increases the number of connections within

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.569
neurons in the brain, as well as creates new
pathways throughout the brain.

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.780
Indeed, MRIs of the brains of classically
trained musicians compared to non-musicians

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.189
showed a significantly enlarged nerve-fiber
tract (about 10-15% thicker) between the two

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.780
hemispheres of the brain.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.409
This difference was particularly marked in
the musicians that had begun training before

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:22.719
seven years old.

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:27.419
It is thought this enlarged corpus callosum
improves motor skills and speeds up communication

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.729
between the two hemispheres of the brain.

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.259
Further studies have verified these claims
and also demonstrated an increase in connections

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.860
in the areas of the brain responsible for
emotion and memory.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.759
The idea that listening to Mozart aids the
brain in some way actually goes all the way

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:44.930
back to the 1950s.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:51.020
At that time, Alfred A. Tomatis, an ear, nose,
and throat doctor claimed that playing Mozart

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.319
to certain of his patients drastically aided
in fixing speech and auditory disorders, among

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.550
other things.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.270
In 1991, he published a book on this subject
titled Pourquoi Mozart in which he explained

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.870
he felt that listening to Mozart helped retrain
the ear by providing varying frequencies for

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.090
the ear to perceive.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:21.520
He also felt it promoted healing and aided
in the development of 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.189
the brain.
