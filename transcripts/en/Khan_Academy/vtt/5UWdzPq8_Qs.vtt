00:00:00.216 --> 00:00:01.229
- [Voiceover] So, we want to evaluate the

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.763
definite integral from
negative one to eight

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:05.846
of 12 times the cube root of x dx.

00:00:07.453 --> 00:00:09.102
Let's see, this is going
to be the same thing

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:10.660
as the definite integral from negative one

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.177
to eight of 12 times, the cube root is

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:18.900
the same thing as saying
x to the 1/3 power dx

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.484
and so now, if we want to
take the antiderivative

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.138
of the stuff on the inside,

00:00:23.138 --> 00:00:25.693
we're just going to do
essentially the power rule,

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:28.222
it conduces the power rule of integrals

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.279
or it's the reverse of the
power rule for derivatives,

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.248
where we increase this exponent by one

00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:37.075
and then we divide by
that increased exponent.

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:40.959
So, this is going to
be equal to 12 times x

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:44.316
to the 1/3 plus one.

00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:46.297
Let me do that in another color,

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:47.663
so we can keep track of it.

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:51.209
X to the 1/3 plus one and
then we're going to divide

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:55.634
by 1/3 plus one and so,
what's 1/3 plus one,

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:59.195
well, that's 4/3, 1/3
plus 3/3, that's 4/3.

00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:01.698
So, I could write it this way.

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:05.000
I could write this x to the 4/3 divided by

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.167
4/3 and this is going to be

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.260
and I'm going to evaluate
this at the bounds.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.101
So, I'm going to evaluate this at

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:18.217
and I'll do this in different colors,

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:19.759
I'm going to evaluate it at eight

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.891
and I'm going to evaluate
it at negative one

00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:25.376
and I'm going to subtract
it and evaluate it

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:28.807
at negative one from this
expression evaluated at eight,

00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:31.784
and so what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:33.773
Well, actually, let me
simplify a little bit more.

00:01:33.773 --> 00:01:36.403
What is 12 divided by 4/3?

00:01:36.403 --> 00:01:38.152
So, 12, I'll do it right, well, I'll

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:39.004
do it right over here,

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:43.171
12 over 4/3 is equal to 12 times 3/4,

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:48.694
which will give you as 12/1 times 3/4,

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:51.319
12 divided by four is three,

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.487
so this is going to be equal to nine,

00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.329
3/4 of 12 is nine.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.690
So, this, we could rewrite this,

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.857
we could write this as
nine x to the 4/3 power.

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.049
So, if we evaluate it at eight,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.049
this is going to be nine times eight

00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:14.829
to the 4/3 power and from that,

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.125
we're going to subtract and
evaluate it at negative one.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:23.042
So, this is going to be
nine times negative one

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:25.883
to the 4/3 power.

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:28.512
So, what is eight to the 4/3 power?

00:02:28.512 --> 00:02:29.523
I'll do it over here.

00:02:29.523 --> 00:02:33.571
So, eight to the 4/3 is equal to eight

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.577
to the 1/3 to the fourth power,

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:37.954
these are just exponent properties here.

00:02:37.954 --> 00:02:40.537
Eight to the 1/3, the cube root of eight,

00:02:40.537 --> 00:02:42.948
or eight to the 1/3 power, that's two,

00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:44.540
'cause two to the third power is eight

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.140
and two to the fourth power,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.600
well two to the fourth
power is equal to 16.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.495
So, eight to the 4/3 is 16
and what's a negative one

00:02:52.495 --> 00:02:53.724
to the 4/3?

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:57.652
Well, same idea, negative one to the 4/3

00:02:57.652 --> 00:03:00.321
is equal to negative one, there's several

00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:01.154
way you could do it.

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:02.514
You could say negative one to the fourth

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:03.580
and the cube root of that,

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.071
or the cube root of negative one

00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:07.140
and then raise that to the
fourth power, either way.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.616
So, let's do it the first way.

00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:09.832
Negative one to the fourth and then

00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:11.558
take the cube root of that.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.387
Well, negative one to
the fourth is just one

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:16.074
and then one to the 1/3 power,

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:17.772
well that's just going to be equal to one.

00:03:17.772 --> 00:03:19.944
So, what we have here in blue,

00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:22.078
that's just equal to one.

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:25.911
So, we have nine times
16 minus nine time one,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.997
well, that's just going
to be nine times 15.

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:32.081
We have 16/9 and then we're
going take away a nine,

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.907
so that's going to be nine times 15,

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:35.881
so what is that?

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.130
That is going to be equal to nine times 15

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.213
is 90 plus 45, which is equal to 135,

00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:47.298
135 and we're done.
