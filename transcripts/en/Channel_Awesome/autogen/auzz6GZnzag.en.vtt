through the hat the bone actually like

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540
through the hat the bone actually like
 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.220
through the hat the bone actually like
it that's together through the Hat um

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.230
it that's together through the Hat um
 

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.100

but yeah what an interesting - you know

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:22.110
but yeah what an interesting - you know
 

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.579
but yeah what an interesting - you know
you have the you know Y that map or

and then the circle round of all the

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:29.100
and then the circle round of all the
 

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.039
and then the circle round of all the
symbols ah you know there's always these

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:31.049
symbols ah you know there's always these
 

00:10:31.049 --> 00:10:32.539
symbols ah you know there's always these
symbols that say ok clearly that's

00:10:32.539 --> 00:10:32.549
symbols that say ok clearly that's
 

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:33.530

to be maple and stuff when they put her
 

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:36.470
to be maple and stuff when they put her
in the bubble the symbol that's in there

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480
in the bubble the symbol that's in there
 

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.989
in the bubble the symbol that's in there
is also in there so you're almost

00:10:38.989 --> 00:10:38.999
is also in there so you're almost
 

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:40.519
is also in there so you're almost

wondering if like maybe he has to get
 

00:10:40.529 --> 00:10:42.230
wondering if like maybe he has to get
all of them to complete the circle or

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240
all of them to complete the circle or
 

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.340
all of them to complete the circle or
something like that or may it's just

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.350
something like that or may it's just
 

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.129
something like that or may it's just
coincidence I'm I'm just glad the odd
