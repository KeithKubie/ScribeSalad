This is the first challenge problem, and this is a problem that I don't necessarily expect you to be

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
able to get right with the knowledge you have, but I think it's a pretty interesting problem.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So if you wanted to challenge yourself, go ahead and take a shot. It's completely optional.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I want you to go to a sink or a bathroom or somewhere you have access to a water faucet.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Turn that faucet on. Take a look at the water as it falls down.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll notice that it doesn't look like this as you might expect.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In reality, the water tapers off. It gets thinner and thinner as it falls.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So after it has fallen in the distance y, the initial radius R has reduced to r.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The question here is, can you find a mathematical equation that represents

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the radius of this column of water as a function of y.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There's a couple of key insights to make here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And first is that the water passing through an imaginary hoop does so at a constant rate

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and that is totally confusing if I don't explain it more.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
What I mean is if I drew an imaginary ring here and an imaginary ring here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and let the water pass through both of them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If 1 L of water is passing through this ring every minute,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
then 1 L must be passing through this ring too.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
None of the water is splashing off to the side. It's not building up in the middle.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So it must be the case that the water's flow rate is constant.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can also show that this flow rate well is equal to the velocity of the water through a given ring

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
times the area, the cross-sectional area of the water at that point--so that would be πr².

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Third, we have to assume that the water when it leaves the faucet already has some velocity.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's moving downwards at V₀.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So what I want you to do is to write an equation that the radius of this water is a function of how far

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.000
it's fallen, y, in terms of y is initial velocity and g the acceleration on earth, which is 10 m/s².

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This question won't be graded because it's a challenge question.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But when you get your answer, you should share it with your classmates in the forums

00:01:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and talk about it, and I think this is really an interesting problem.
