00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.849
Ultra Violent Soccer... and 7 other Football
Facts

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:08.149
1) “Soccer” was once a popular name for
Football in Britain in the sport’s earliest

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.149
days.

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:12.540
When the rules for the sport were first being
defined, it was named “Association Football”

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.480
to distinguish it from the other forms of
football commonly played.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.300
Within a year of its inception, this got slurred
down to “Assoccer,” after the common practice

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.810
of adding “-er” to nicknames at the time
in Britain.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
Very shortly after this, “Assoccer” became
“Soccer,” which remained a semi-popular

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.099
nickname for the sport in Britain until about
a half century ago, along with just “Football.”

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.219
The game initially spread throughout the world
primarily known as “Football.”

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.001
However, in countries where other forms of
football already were dominate, the nickname

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.270
“Soccer” was, and in some cases still
is, the preferred name for this reason.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.489
2) Frenchman Just Fontaine holds the record
for most World Cup goals in one tournament

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.091
from 1958 when he scored an astonishing 13
goals.

00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:56.309
For reference, the top scorer in the history
of the World Cup, Brazilian Ronaldo, scored

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
a total of 15 times participating in four
different World Cups.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.630
3) The Earliest Known Soccer Sport was in
1004 B.C. Japan.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.830
There are also many references to similar
sports in 50 B.C.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.370
China, even being played between teams from
China and Japan.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.619
The Romans played several types of football
games, including some that resembled soccer,

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.439
one of which was also included in the Roman
Olympic Games.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:25.000
This particular version featured 27 men a
side and was extremely rough, with it being

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.680
common for most players to require medical
attention after the game.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.979
4) Most of the earliest forms of football
were named thus, not because you kicked a

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.840
ball with your foot, but because they were
played on foot.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.270
Peasants played most of their sports on foot;
aristocrats played many of theirs on horseback.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.469
Thus, games played on foot were called “football,”
whether they had anything to do with kicking

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:45.649
a ball or not.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.700
Indeed, many of the Earliest Forms of Football
involved carrying balls in an attempt to get

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.400
across goal lines passed some opposing team
or individual players.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.869
5) The first and only goalkeeper in history
to win the World Cup Golden Ball (Most Valuable

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.409
Player award) was German goalkeeper Oliver
Kahn during the 2002 FIFA World Cup in which

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.259
Germany made it to the final but was defeated
by Brazil.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.280
6) German legend Lothar Matthaus has played
in five FIFA World Cups (1982, 1986, 1990,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.470
1994, 1998) more than any other outfield player,
and also holds the record for the most World

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.360
Cup matches played by a single player with
25.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.220
He also took part in three consecutive finals
(1982, 1986 and 1990) but only won the last

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.220
one.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.770
7) The Oldest Captain to lead a participating
Football nation to a World Cup triumph was

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.810
the legendary Italian goalkeeper Dino Zoff,
who at the age of 40 led Italy to their 1982

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.640
FIFA World Cup title.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.410
8) Only two World Cup Finals Penalties have
been decided on penalties and coincidentally

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.290
Italy took part in both of them.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.230
In the World Cup of 1994, Brazil beat Italy
in a dramatic penalty shoot-out, while 12

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.090
years later in the World Cup of 2006 Italy
beat France.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.650
In the latter final, one of the greatest Footballers
ever, Frenchman Zinedine Zidane, famously

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.510
head butted Marco Materazzi in the chest,
which led to a red card and the defeat of

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:23.070
France.
