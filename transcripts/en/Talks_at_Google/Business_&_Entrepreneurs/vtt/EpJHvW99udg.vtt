CHALMERS BROWNE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.947
Welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:09.780
I'm Chalmers Browne.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.560
For those of you
who don't know me,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm a business systems analyst
in our Corporate Engineering

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.120
area.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.010
I now work on our
[INAUDIBLE] cloud project,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.680
but for most of my five
plus years here at Google,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.700
I've been working alongside
our People Operations team

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.200
building out systems like
GHire, Perf, and Grow.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.080
Today's event is called
"Hustle x Heart--

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.600
The Silver Lining
of Work Culture."

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.406
And we are honored to be joined
by Claude Silver, VaynerMedia's

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:37.905

[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.120
--VaynerMedia's
inaugural Chief Heart

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.250
officer, a first of its
kind position created

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.000
to scale the company's
people first ethos.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.025
Claude champions
empathy-driven leadership

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:52.710

at VaynerMedia, which is
a Gary Vaynerchuk company.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.880
For those of you who
might not be familiar,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.980
Gary Vaynerchuk is a
serial entrepreneur

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.190

co-founder of VaynerMedia,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.880

clients across the
company's four locations.

And Gary is also the host of a
widely successful "Ask Gary V"

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.391
show on YouTube.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.640
CLAUDE SILVER: I think he
has a really popular channel

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.380
on YouTube.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.440
CHALMERS BROWNE: Yeah.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.900
CLAUDE SILVER: I
think it's now GaryV.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.816
CHALMERS BROWNE: Yeah.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:27.600
Yeah.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.370
Claude's current
role is the capstone

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.210
of a career that spans nearly
20 years at numerous Fortune 50

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.430
companies, including
senior leadership

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.820
posts at J Walter Thompson
and Publicist in London.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.570
Her success in guiding
employee experience,

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.200
client relationships, global
brand strategies, operations,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.870
and management is
driven by an abiding

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.740
passion for creating spaces
in which people can thrive.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.080
Please join me in
welcoming Claude Silver.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.480
CLAUDE SILVER: Thank you.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.388
Thanks.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:58.819
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:59.780
Good to be here.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.440
Really good to be here.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.190
CHALMERS BROWNE: Thank
you for being here.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.030
Quick housekeeping--
please silence all devices.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.790
And we will have some
time for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.540
Since we're recording,
it's very important

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.880
that if you have a question,
please ask it at one

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.880
of the two mics in the aisles.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.190
So for people in the
audience, who might not

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.530
be familiar with
VaynerMedia, what

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.690
would you say is the
company's mission,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.600
and how is that different
from other companies

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.587
in your industry or other
companies in general?

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:30.170
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah,
so we're a full--

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.540
VaynerMedia is a full
service digital agency.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.550
So we're really a
creative shop that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.940
marries both paid media,
creative, and strategy

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.970
in the middle, not unlike
a lot of other agencies

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.550
that you probably
work with for sure.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.120
And Gary would say our mission
is to build the biggest

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.090
human empire of all time.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.820
I'd like to be a part
of that for sure.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.150
But I think the differentiator
for us is that we really

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.770
do put people at the
center, that because we

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.500
are an independently
owned agency,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.490
of course, we want to make sure
that we're paying attention

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.860
to our top and bottom
line and the growth there.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.300
But it is really the people
that fuel all of that,

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.010
and I really--

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.440
I personally think
that the emphasis

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.390
that we put on
people, the emphasis

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.220
that we put on a
culture, the emphasis

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.500
that we even have a
job like mine, which

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.790
is very different than a chief
HR officer, which we'll get to,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.650
I'm sure--

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.880
that in itself sets us apart.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.480
I don't think it makes us
better or holier than thou.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.850
I think it just makes
us very different,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.100
and it is something that
is hard to grok sometimes

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.390
that, yeah, OK, well,
are you just like Droga5?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.500
Are you like Anomaly?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.202
We're different.

00:03:43.202 --> 00:03:44.660
We really beat to
a different drum,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.880
and I think a lot of
that is because of who

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.340
Gary Vaynerchuk is-- an
incredibly fast-moving empath

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.050
that is known for hustle.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.690
But quite frankly, he's got
a heck of a lot of heart.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.870
CHALMERS BROWNE: So the
term, "honey empire,"

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.870
comes up frequently in reference
to Vayner and your role.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.460
Can you explain what that means?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.100
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah, I can.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.770
There's a lot of
different breakdowns,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.917
but I've definitely honed
my verbatim, I think,

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:12.500
at this point.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.166
There's two different
ways I look at it.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.820
So being people first,
that's obviously the honey.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.260
That is taking
care of the people.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.977
That is making sure that if
someone is having a bad day,

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:22.060
we're taking care of them.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.630
If someone got
engaged or married,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.400
we're celebrating that.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.140
It is really the idea of
creating champions from one

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.510
another, the collaboration, the
emphasis on working together

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.740
to create the biggest
honey empire of all time.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.920
The empire, of course, is
much more of a success.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.550
It's much more of the client
success, the personal success,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.980
the agency shop success.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.292
So that is one
way to look at it.

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:53.750
The other way I like to look
at it is something-- actually,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.000
I am going to use
this little easel.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.460
Do you mind?

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.980
CHALMERS BROWNE: Yeah, go ahead.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.240
Please.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.230
CLAUDE SILVER: Hopefully,
I'm writing big enough

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.310
for the camera.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.660
But fundamentally,
if I think about how

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.890
I look at building strong
teams and building teams that

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.410
are sustainable and
they last, I look

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.300
at starting with the connection.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.070
Again, hopefully,
that can be read.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.140
So connection-- as
human beings, we

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.540
are absolutely wired to belong.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.090
We are wired to connect
with one another.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.730
Connection plus trust-- so
once I connect with you,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.480
and I'm kind of
like in it with you,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.697
we start to trust one another.

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:34.530
I might let my guard
down a little bit more.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.196
I might be a little
bit easier with you.

00:05:36.196 --> 00:05:39.830
I might share something
about myself with you.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.010
Plus, empathy-- so I trust now,
but now I'm sharing something.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.010
Maybe I'm sharing about an issue
I'm having on another team,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.610
or maybe I'm sharing something
about something, a family

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.040
issue or a celebration
or something like that.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.260
Connection plus trust
plus empathy, honey,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:08.000
equals accountability,
which also

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.550
is another way to say loyalty.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.520
Longevity-- so we want
our people to be there

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.382
with us for the long haul.

00:06:18.382 --> 00:06:20.840
We want Vayner people to be
with us forever, quite frankly.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.680
Gary will say that.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.430
I want you to work
with me forever.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.589
Accountability,
longevity, resilience--

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.380
who doesn't need
resilience in these times?

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.546
I mean, things are changing.

00:06:31.546 --> 00:06:34.080
I'm sure you already launched
three different products,

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.432
while I've been sitting
here with you today.

00:06:36.432 --> 00:06:39.307
But the world of digital is
changing every single second,

00:06:39.307 --> 00:06:41.390
so you need to be able to
roll with those punches.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.780
And also, Gary is a disruptor.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.200
He's an entrepreneur.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.220
I mean, it is--

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.675
he can say today, by
the time we get back,

00:06:48.675 --> 00:06:49.800
we're not going to do that.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.330
We're going to do this.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.780
And we all have to
pivot very quickly.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.780
So resilience is really
important in our teams

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.780
and our people.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.230
Accountability, longevity,
resilience equals speed.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.640
This is the empire right here.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.010
Speed is our number one KPI.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.100
People first-- here
are the feelings.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.230
Here are all the things that
I care about all day long.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.690
And here's the
empire, the fact of,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.100
how do we get it
across the finish line?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.650
So I hope that
answered the question

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.110
in a very esoteric way.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.930
CHALMERS BROWNE: Yeah, that's
Great So you mentioned--

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.820
I think you probably get
this question all the time.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.810
How is your role as
Chief Heart officer

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.640
different from a traditional
chief HR officer role?

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.000
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah, I
mean I'm not HR at all.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.940
I've never been HR.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.320
In fact, I started in '98
before Google, before Facebook,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.720
as a project manager
in San Francisco,

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.960
and then morphed my
way into the agency

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.310
side on the client-facing
side, and then

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.440
found my home in strategy.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.160
And way, way, way back
when, I was training

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
to be a psychotherapist.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.710
So human development,
human behavior is always

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.630
something that's really,
really fascinated me

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.910
and still does to this day.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.430
That's kind of like
everything for me--

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.870
how we work, why we work,
how we can work better.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.590
And so I've been a strategist
for a very long time, almost

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:13.490
20 years.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.700
And I am not HR.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.520
I'm not-- I'm certainly
now HR, and I'm

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.370
more equipped and more
educated in the science of HR

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.420
and the benefits and
international visas and laws

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.090
and whatnot.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.390
But that's not my job.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.840
We have some incredible HR
people in the crowd right

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.510
now that are on my
team, which is amazing.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:41.179
And they really take care of the
HR factor, the science of it,

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:47.240
the benefits, payroll, 401(k)s,
and really, the reviews,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.730
the review cycle, all
of those things as well.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.200
So my job isn't.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.920
I mean, you would say,
send that to Claude,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.540
because she's head
of HR, but I'm not.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.290
I get to oversee
that which is, and I

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.780
get to co-create with
people that know more

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.970
than I know in terms of HR.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.880
And Gary really
sees himself as HR,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.810
because he's a
people first person.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.860
And so the synergy
that he and I have

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:18.440
in terms of how we feel about
people, our belief in people,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.790
our gut about people is
really what created this role

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.890
and why we call it Heart,
because we actually

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.880
think of HR, which I have no
idea what that really means,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.820
as heart.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.760
In fact, we changed the
name of the department

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.580
when I started to
People and Experience,

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.620
because after all, that's
what we're doing here.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.440
You have a department,
People Ops.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.200
It's very similar.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.240
CHALMERS BROWNE:
Yep very similar.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.730
CLAUDE SILVER: But the idea
of human resources, to me,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.980
is very foreign.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.700
I really-- I don't
get it, but if anyone

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.760
wants to explain those
two terms to me, I'm open.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.530
So people and experience, and
really, I'm not chief of HR.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.245
But again, we've got a great
team that takes care of that.

00:10:01.245 --> 00:10:02.370
CHALMERS BROWNE: Excellent.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.460
So one of the things
you've called yourself

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.480
is an emphatic
truth-teller, when

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.530
you were describing what it
was that Gary needed to sort

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.370
of scale what he did
for the organization

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.950
as the organization expanded.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.070
What's the hardest truth
you've had to tell,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.157
or at least the hardest
one you can share with us?

00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:24.990
CLAUDE SILVER: Sure.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.200
It's empathic.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.877
Empathic.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:30.210
I think someone once called
me an empathic truth-teller.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.209
CHALMERS BROWNE: Oh, OK.

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:32.870
Maybe I misheard that.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.400
CLAUDE SILVER:
Maybe it's emphatic.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.940
I'm sure.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:42.800
Hopefully, it's enthusiastic,
but you know, it's hard.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.540
It is a challenge,
I think, sometimes

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.820
to confront someone with
something they may not

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.890
see about themselves.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.740
It's hard as another
human being to take

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.590
that step, that bold
step forward as just

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.530
another learner in the world and
to think that I see something

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.330
that they don't see.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.810
By no means, am I-- you know,
I'm not a psychotherapist.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.260
I'm not a physician.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.340
So it's really difficult
to get up the gumption

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.750
and want to shine a mirror
in front of someone.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.000
And I think that's a difficult
thing that we all have.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.380
However, when we give feedback,
and when we share something

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.320
with another person, it's
really an act of caring.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.290
So when I don't do that,
I'm really withholding--

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.480
quite frankly, I'm
manipulating someone's growth

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.860
and development.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.240
And the way I go about it is,
hopefully, with as much grace,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.520
tact, and generosity of
spirit as I possibly can.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.540
But that is something
that I think is--

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.556
you just have to step wisely
into those shoes, cautiously,

00:11:49.556 --> 00:11:50.930
of course, because
you never know

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:52.880
how someone's going to react.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.770
But if you go into
that truth, again,

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.790
with empathy and with
humility-- my god--

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.030
then I think the door can
open to so much possibility.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.810
And that's what it's all about--

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.310
possibility.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.809
CHALMERS BROWNE:
Is there an example

00:12:08.809 --> 00:12:12.019
that you can think of,
where telling that truth--

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:13.685
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah,
there's an example.

00:12:13.685 --> 00:12:15.050
I mean, when did I get here?

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.370
So I think an hour
ago, I was in a room

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.930
with a very senior
account holder, account--

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.080
our client service person.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.650
And this person was telling
me that he has been exploring

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.210
his team for the
last three months,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.835
and these are the
three buckets that he

00:12:33.835 --> 00:12:36.890
thinks are wrong with his team.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.360
So he's probably my age.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.091
He's in his 40s, and maybe
he knows more about life

00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:42.590
than I do.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:43.500
I have no idea.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.305
But he and I have had many
conversations over the past,

00:12:47.305 --> 00:12:48.680
I would say, eight
or nine months

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.400
about these issues in his
team, and only today, he's

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.020
bringing them to me.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.720
So what I did say to him
is, with all due respect,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.970
I really believe that
you've been protecting

00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.400
your team this entire time.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.710
There's no need to
protect your team,

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:05.510
and these three
buckets that you just

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.360
shared with us should have been
shared with me nine months ago,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.250
because we could have fixed it.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.620
We didn't need to go through
all the rigmarole and all

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.484
the people issues and all the
hardship and all the missed

00:13:16.484 --> 00:13:17.900
deadlines and all
of those things,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.410
if we just could get truth.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.470
So that's probably the
most recent conversation,

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.690
and he took it as
well as can be.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.790
We'll see what happens
when I get back to work.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:34.400
But again, you go into
it with as much grace

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.880
and just generosity.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.346
I want to help him.

00:13:40.346 --> 00:13:41.720
CHALMERS BROWNE:
So your role was

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.080
created to help preserve
Vayner's culture,

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.820
while it grows rapidly.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.980
We know a little bit
about that here at Google.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.890
What are the elements
of Vayner's culture

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.790
that you most fear losing as you
continue to expand and scale?

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.540
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah,
so yeah, this role

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.890
was created to scale Gary.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.110
And he says to scale the
unscalable, which I think

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.740
is a phenomenal way to say it.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.721
I mean, how do we scale culture?

00:14:09.721 --> 00:14:10.720
That's the big question.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.761
It's a question I get all
the time and a question

00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:15.830
I'm sure you guys get at almost
80,000 people and wanting

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.220
to maintain Google
across the world.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.780
So our culture is really built
on a few different values

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.300
that I can say, over the
last eight and 1/2 years,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.300
are pretty tried and true.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:33.440
Empathy, which I will
call heart, speed,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:39.480
which I would call hustle,
hustle and heart, possibility--

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.870
we work for an entrepreneur, and
everything really is possible.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.290
There is a yes all the
time, until there isn't.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:49.860
But it takes a very long time
to get to the no, if ever.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.420
Positivity-- I mean Gary
overindexes as an optimist.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.500
I'm probably very
close behind him.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.520
And winning,
competitiveness-- and those

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.790
are things I believe
are still in our DNA,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.520
absolutely, over
eight and 1/2 years.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.900
But those are things
that we need to continue

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.700
to stoke the fire on.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.940
So for example, let's take the
conversation that I just had.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.980
That conversation
was out of line

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.020
and out of touch
with our culture,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.270
because the winning
was misguided.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.820
The wanting to win
was cased in fear.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.260
That's not one of our values.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.350
It's not how we use
and foster our culture.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:35.210
And that's just talking
to one individual.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.340
Where is that-- is
that spread anywhere?

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.304
I mean, so the most
important thing

00:15:40.304 --> 00:15:41.720
that I'm doing
every single day is

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.170
I'm talking to a lot of people.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.170
Quite frankly, I'm listening
to a lot of people,

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.440
and I'm just collecting
data, collecting information,

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.700
I'm holding space to see what
happens, to see what comes out.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.390
And as I'm speaking to
people and collecting data,

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.010
I'm looking for patterns.

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.800
And I'm looking to hear if
I hear a similarity on one

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.162
certain team or if I hear a
similarity on a department,

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:06.620
even though the department
might be in a different country.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.540
It might have legs in
a different culture--

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.900
different company--
sorry, different country.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.790
And so as I hear
these patterns, that's

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.690
where we start to deploy
more people that are what I

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.520
like to call culture carriers.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.420
By no means is their
title culture carrier,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.110
although they should put
it in their signature.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.989
These are people that really
get a sense of the water

00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:29.530
that we're drinking
every single day.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.350
It's not Kool-Aid.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.220
It's water.

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.030
It's pure.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.430
It's real.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.820
And so in every office, and
certainly in our offices here

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.370
in New York, which
we have two, I

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:45.950
can depend on and rely
on using and asking

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.780
that person or that
person or that person

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.920
to go take that person for a
walk or for a cup of coffee,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.680
or go have a little mini town
hall with those eight people,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.200
who are just kind of crusty.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.290
So that is something that is--

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.220
it's like a 24/7 job.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.990
It's an absolute 24/7 job, which
meeting with people one on one,

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.060
having hangouts with
people, going to--

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.640
I'll start a big
round of office visits

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.901
next week in different
countries and different cities.

00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:15.859
And so making sure that
we have that high touch

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:16.817
at every single moment.

00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:19.606
Obviously, Gary is doing
the same exact thing.

00:17:19.606 --> 00:17:21.230
He might be doing
five-minute meetings.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.329
He might be doing
a lot of texting,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:29.300
but we try to cover as much
ground as we possibly can,

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.560
and ensuring that the
culture is still being fed

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:39.385
and watered so that we can have
new sprouts every single day.

00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:41.894
I talk in metaphors
a lot, but that's

00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.560
what it looks like
to me, quite frankly.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.120
It's 800 people now--

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:45.620
what?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.447
I think 805 people, I
think, and that's a lot.

00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:50.780
That's just a lot of heartbeats.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.300
It's a lot of mouths to
feed, and certainly don't

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.072
need to explain that to Google.

00:17:57.072 --> 00:17:59.030
So we've got we've got
a lot of learning to do,

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.690
but I do think that we've
implemented some really good

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:06.980
tried and tested abilities now.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.600
CHALMERS BROWNE: In
the run-up to 800,

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.360
are there things that
you feel like you sort

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.720
of lost irretrievably
or things that

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.150
just couldn't survive from the
smaller scale to the larger

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.741
scale?

00:18:20.741 --> 00:18:22.490
CLAUDE SILVER: I don't
think we lost them.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.500
I think we lost sight of
them, and then got them back.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.600
That's what I think.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.260
So in terms of growing,
growing, growing,

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.180
that's just-- for example,
the talent team that's here.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.650
I mean, there was
a period of time,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.260
and there's only
about five of them

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.590
in all different countries.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.364
In New York, we've got
three, three or four.

00:18:41.364 --> 00:18:43.780
But there was a time that they
were hiring hand over fist.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.630
I mean we couldn't bring
enough bodies into the offices

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.740
and into our world.

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:52.300
And what we lost
sight of was training,

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.070
and what we lost sight
of was the orientation.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.910
And what we ended up doing
is throwing them into a fire

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.830
without giving them
a sense of what's

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.780
in our DNA, what's in our
bloodstream and our water.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.960
And there were moments, I would
say, in the last 18 months,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.150
two years that you
could feel the ground

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:18.262
start to not tremble, but just
start to shake a little bit,

00:19:18.262 --> 00:19:20.720
or the wheels on the bus just
start to rattle a little bit,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.460
a little harder than I like.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.180
I like a lot of speed,
but it was a little much.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.250
And in those moments,
that's something

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.040
that I talked to Gary about, I'm
going to talk to my team about,

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.690
and we have to kind of do a
full court press in that moment.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:35.106
There's some things
that we're not

00:19:35.106 --> 00:19:38.430
going to be able to retrofit
and change, but going forward,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.880
we know how important
it is to orient.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.790
We have a week-long
orientation--

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.450
and how important it is for
that employee to really,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:51.630
really connect to get a sense
of belonging, tried and true.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:53.300
We want them here.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.000
We've gone through three rounds
of interviewing, maybe four.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.830
And so when they
come in, we already

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.531
have this incredible
sense of belief in them,

00:20:00.531 --> 00:20:02.030
and it takes an
employee, obviously,

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.730
a longer time to
believe in the org.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.130
But in those cases, where
we got lost a little bit.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.209
And so anyway,
we've retrofitted.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.750
CHALMERS BROWNE:
And are there things

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.110
that you find that you can
do at scale that you couldn't

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.240
do when you were smaller?

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.950
CLAUDE SILVER: That,
I actually believe

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.109
in terms of going back
in time a little bit.

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:23.900
Back in time's not the
right way to say it,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.310
because we can't
go back in time.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.640
But we can certainly go back
and have that conversation

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.020
with that swath of people
that we may have missed.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.840
We moved to-- we opened up
our first international office

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.930
about 15 months ago in
London, and in doing so,

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:42.860
we sent out ex-pats
to open up the office.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.500
One of the things we
learned very quickly is--

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:49.030
and I worked in London for a
significant amount of time.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.740
So it's something I
knew, but as an ex-pat,

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.200
it's different with
different glasses on.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.780
It's so important to get
locals in your office

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.540
and get locals in
your office fast.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.700
Otherwise, it really is like the
American invasion in many ways,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.127
and that's not going to work.

00:21:05.127 --> 00:21:06.960
That's not going to
work in another country,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.650
but it's certainly not going
to work when you are a local,

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.080
and you walk in, and
there's eight ex-pats,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.100
and they're telling
you what to do.

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:18.110
So those are things that we've
had to look at and reverse

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.850
engineer as we go forward.

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.340
CHALMERS BROWNE: So
we're just finishing up

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.860
our performance management
and compensation cycle.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.440
Every company has them
in some form or another.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.470
But those processes--
performance management,

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.660
compensation planning--

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.680
they're often seen as sort
of being directly at odds

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.090
with the effort to create
psychological safety, a culture

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:45.050
of trust.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.560
How do you handle performance
evaluation and rewards

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.852
without undermining
the honey empire?

00:21:51.852 --> 00:21:53.060
CLAUDE SILVER: It's so tough.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.770
I mean this crew in front
of me that's on my team--

00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.140
they're the ones that take a
little bit of the bruising,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.710
because there is such a
juxtaposition between we

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:04.230
love you.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.540
We believe in you, We want you.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.350
You have a home.

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.570
We want you here forever.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.710
Here's 6%.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:14.390
Or you just got all fives on
a review, on a review form,

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.770
because we just got out
of our cycle as well.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.940
But you're not getting
promoted, but here's 10%.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.600
These are really
hard conversations.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.400
I don't have the answer,
other than so much high touch.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.580
And that means spending
time with that employee,

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.260
going back to that
employee, letting

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.080
them know we work for them,
working with their manager,

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:37.590
seeing how we can--

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:42.920
if we're not able to give
them the salary increase

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.440
that they were so hoping
for, and it is 6%,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.289
or it is 8%, making sure that
what's in their review in terms

00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:50.330
of their training and
development or their growth

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.850
plans, we are hitting
immediately or as soon

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.370
as we possibly can.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.300
That's one way I think
that we can surround

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.920
that person or that
cohort with as much heart,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.050
as much honey as
we possibly can.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.630
Spending time with Gary is
always going to be a benefit,

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:08.250
and it's weird to kind of
dangle that in front sometimes.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:11.840
But it is so
incredibly helpful when

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:18.470
you get that time with Gary, and
he's able to, in his own words,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:21.020
really, really hone
you into the vision,

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.189
because the vision is--
the vision's amazing.

00:23:24.189 --> 00:23:25.730
The vision of what
we're doing, we're

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.730
building an agency so that
at some point in time,

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.930
we can buy brands and own
them and create the marketing

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.430
and awareness for them--

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.600
that's awesome.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.740
There's not a lot of
agencies that are doing that.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.490
But it is something we need
to spend a lot of time with

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.370
and a lot of not coddling and
not pampering, but just, again,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:47.870
high touch.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.420
I say that phrase a
lot, but it is really

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:57.300
what we do, from a
resident on up to an SVP.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.130
CHALMERS BROWNE: And sort of in
line with that, as Chief Heart

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.420
officer, how do you go about
helping someone when they're

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.240
not succeeding in their role?

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.740
CLAUDE SILVER: So when they're
not succeeding in their role,

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.690
we do as much of
a 360 as we can,

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.990
first and foremost, to find
out, is that really true?

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.840
Or is that just that one
person or that one manager from

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.390
the top down that's like,
blah-blah-blah-blah,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.920
because that's not fair.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.520
So we really try to look
at it in a holistic manner

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.340
and get as much 360
as we possibly can.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.620
We put people on
performance plans--

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.990
30-day, 60-day,
sometimes 90-day.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.860
In London, we will extend
that notice period--

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.380
we will extend that
90-day trial period,

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.840
if we need to, for
another three months.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.400
We want people to be successful.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.140
Again, we've invested
so much time,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.830
as you do, too, in recruiting,
finding that right talent,

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.360
bringing them in, orienting.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.570
I, mean it costs a
lot of money, also.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.930
Talk about the empire.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.210
You know, it's-- so when
you lose an employee,

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.570
it costs almost double, triple
to get that next employee in.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:04.760
So making sure that we're
giving them very specific,

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.680
clear ways in which to
improve is-- that's our job--

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:13.620
actionable, measurable
ways to improve.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.459
Otherwise, that's not fair.

00:25:16.459 --> 00:25:18.000
So we spend a lot
of time doing that.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.500
We don't have a lot of
people on performance plans.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.810
I don't know if that's
a good or a bad thing.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:27.260
Maybe we're not looking deep
enough, but for the most part,

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.810
I think coming out of this
review cycle right now,

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.880
I can say that it's a
very low percentage,

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.920
and we're doing our best to get
people to get the Cs up to a B,

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.556
and to get the Bs up to an A.

00:25:39.556 --> 00:25:41.930
One of the things that we do
have that I'm super proud of

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.580
is we have this alumni program.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.330
So if someone-- if we
have a C that we know

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.367
will be an A somewhere
else, or if we

00:25:49.367 --> 00:25:51.200
have someone that it's
just not working out,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.610
we're just not the right
culture, for example,

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.540
or we just move too fast,
we will do our very best,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.760
as we let them go, to
find their next interview,

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.490
to find their next role.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.240
And so we can do that based
on Gary's network, of course,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.216
and based on the enormous
amount of job requests

00:26:10.216 --> 00:26:12.340
he's getting in every single
day, like, hey, do you

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.335
have a-- hey, do you have a?

00:26:14.335 --> 00:26:16.510
And so we'll do our best
to do the networking,

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.530
and then set them up with
that first interview.

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:23.650
CHALMERS BROWNE: So
one of the things

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:28.130
that I think we've
noted in our culture

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:34.960
and that we're struggling with
is, how do you make a manager?

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.680
How do you take somebody
who's a tremendous performer

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.630
as an individual contributor,
and either determine

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.430
that they should or
shouldn't be a manager,

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.210
and then make sure they have
the manager skill sets, which

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.250
are actually, generally,
very different

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:53.230
from the skill
sets that made them

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.870
successful as an
individual contributor?

00:26:55.870 --> 00:27:00.580
What's your approach
to making managers?

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.130
CLAUDE SILVER: So we
are in the process

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:04.420
of figuring out that training.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.880
I'll tell you--

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.992
I should say, not
unsimilar to many agencies,

00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:14.200
you get promoted, and you
just rise through a ladder,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.720
and you just get
maybe, like, a higher

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.100
salary and more responsibility.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.820
But there isn't a lot of
manager training in agencies,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.110
probably due to the
nature of our work,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.407
that it's incredibly fast.

00:27:25.407 --> 00:27:26.740
We're in the service of clients.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.520
We have an output.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.620
Thank you very much,
so forth, and so on,

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.870
and you keep on going
on and on and on.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:35.710
Management training is something
we kicked off in January

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.160
in different forms, and that
included our presentation

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:40.660
training.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.840
That included Radical
Candor feedback training.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.850
That is now including
facilitation training,

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:53.470
but we are still figuring
out, what is the right--

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.150
what is a VaynerMedia manager,
recognizing that we want

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.980
everyone to have uniqueness?

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.990
And how do we go about
having that training?

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.970
How do we go about,
is it one on one?

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.380
I mean, obviously,
experiential is the way to do--

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.854
I believe that we learn
faster when we experience it.

00:28:12.854 --> 00:28:14.520
We either teach it,
or we experience it.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.260
So we're developing
those things right now.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.770
And I absolutely wish
I had a magic wand,

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:22.420
and we could make
that happen faster.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:27.190
But spending time with people
and really figuring out

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.650
what makes them beat,
what makes them tick,

00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.420
kind of helping
them figure out kind

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.000
of their own human
behavior so that they

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.210
can be that much more
tuned in to others I think

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:39.480
is the key there.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.950
CHALMERS BROWNE: All right.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.440
I have a couple more questions,
but I want to take a minute

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.650
and just see if there are
questions in the audience

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.876
that--

00:28:49.876 --> 00:28:50.375
yeah.

00:28:54.949 --> 00:28:55.490
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.240
CLAUDE SILVER: Hi.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:02.900
AUDIENCE: Something that is so
important, yet hard to manage

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.300
for a lot of people that
I know that you've done,

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.660
having worked with you
before really well,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.740
is one, found your passion,
and then, secondly,

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.940
found a way to get there.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.512
I would just love-- and I know
you mentor a lot of people

00:29:18.512 --> 00:29:19.220
in that way, too.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.805
I'd love to hear
your perspective

00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:27.080
on that, tips and tricks
of how you kind of found

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.700
this and navigated
your way [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.170
CLAUDE SILVER: Thanks, Carrie.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:34.870
Carrie and I have worked
with each other about 13

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:40.580
or 15 years ago, so thanks
for being the first question.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:43.570
So I love doing coaching,
and I love mentoring.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.060
And throughout my
years, whether or not I

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.890
was at this company
or that agency

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.170
or running my own
surfing company,

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.770
I've picked up a lot of positive
psychology tips and tricks

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.480
along the way and life coaching
and executive coaching tools.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.910
And I do a lot of coaching.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.350
I call them white
board sessions.

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.520
Some people might call
them north star sessions.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.820
But what I find is most
important with all people

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.040
and all human beings
is making sure

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.230
that, at some point
in our existence,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.390
we were able to define
and touch our purpose.

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.790
Our passion and our purpose
could be very different.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:23.380
One of my passions
is snowboarding,

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.820
but my purpose has nothing
to do with snowboarding.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.300
So there's a difference there.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.940
So I take people through
values exercises.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:35.871
I really like people
to be big in the room.

00:30:35.871 --> 00:30:38.120
That's something I say a
lot, so when they're with me,

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.320
and they're in one of these
45-minute, hour long sessions,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.570
what I say to them is, like,
it's just us in the room,

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:44.260
so be big.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.830
Like, tell me, really, what is
the value you bring to teams?

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.669
No one's listening--
just you and me.

00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:51.960
Then I'll look at their values.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.710
Sometimes I even ask
them what they wanted

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.794
to be when they were kids.

00:30:54.794 --> 00:30:56.584
What did they want to
be when they grew up?

00:30:56.584 --> 00:30:59.274
Because I think when we go
back to the origin of time,

00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.940
and we were just
innocent, and we wanted

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.280
to be an astronaut or a
film director or whatnot,

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.530
there's a lot of truth in that.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.270
And sometimes there's
still threads.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.770
There's still like
a red thread that

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.640
runs through from when you were
a kid to when you're an adult.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:15.360
I really ask people to--

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.990
it's a funny, little
corny question,

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.260
but to think about, in their
most innocent of times,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.030
brushing their teeth
in the morning.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.520
Just who are they?

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.990
Where's their resonance?

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.527
Are they mad?

00:31:29.527 --> 00:31:32.110
Are they-- like, when you wake
up in the morning, who are you?

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.220
What type of person are you?

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.020
And then I sew all
of that together,

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:39.020
and hopefully, we land on a
guiding principle or a mission

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.350
statement, something that
they are really proud of,

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.255
and they can own.

00:31:43.255 --> 00:31:45.380
And they put-- like I say,
put that in your wallet,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.936
or put that on your laptop,
because it's unique to each

00:31:49.936 --> 00:31:50.810
and every individual.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:53.650
And I really think that
once, if we're successful--

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.450
and this might take three
sessions with them--

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:58.310
they go back to their
desk, and they can use

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:59.720
some of that with other people.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.260
I mean that's how I'm scaling
myself, quite frankly.

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.690
Aside from the
team, if I'm having

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.970
this incredible interaction
with another human being,

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.880
that they're going
back to their desk,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.700
their team, their
cohort, and they're

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.730
able to sprinkle
their own magic dust.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:23.460
And that way, the good
vibes just keep on going.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.560
But that's what I do.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.000
I just spend a lot of time
doing a lot of coaching

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.570
and just creating
space for people

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.526
to just be whomever they want.

00:32:32.526 --> 00:32:36.290
At VaynerMedia-- and I wouldn't
doubt at Google as well-- we're

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.670
teaching a lot more than just
fundamental skills of how

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.870
to use Ad Manager or how to be
an incredible client service

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.250
person, I mean as life skills.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.070
So yes, you can teach empathy.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.219
Someone has to be interested
and open to learning.

00:32:52.219 --> 00:32:54.510
You can teach self-awareness
and those types of things.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.620
So I think that's what
juices me every single day,

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.600
that I don't have to just--

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.290
I'm not just talking
about how to get

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.830
this bottle into more hands.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.120
I'm talking about,
why would you even

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.391
be interested in getting
this bottle into more hands?

00:33:11.391 --> 00:33:13.140
CHALMERS BROWNE: We
have another question.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.681
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:13.681 --> 00:33:15.560
Thanks for being here.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.100
I had an opportunity to see Gary
speak the first time like two

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.710
weeks ago at a
conference, and as you all

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:26.150
know, who probably work for him,
he has the energy and ability

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.100
to kind of mic drop
on the whole room

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.070
and make people kind of
silence after, be like,

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.810
I want to be part
of what he's doing.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:37.160
Or it's so just engaging.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.530
So my question is kind of
on the recruiting process.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.080
Do you guys find that a
lot of your applicants

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.420
come from Gary V lovers, who
just are a huge fan of him

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.580
and want to work for
him, or maybe even

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.720
some of the recruiters in
the room who work at Vayner?

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.890
Like, what is your
guys' process?

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.670
Do you reach out?

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.850
Do you have a bunch of
people like that, who apply?

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.070
I can only imagine,
after hearing him speak.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.090
So just wanted to know kind
of what the recruiting process

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.740
looks like.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:07.130
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah, cool.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.719
Keep me honest, team.

00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:13.520
But he's absolutely
in-- he's contagious.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:17.256
I mean that energy and the mic
drop and the realism of him

00:34:17.256 --> 00:34:19.130
is like something you
just want to be around,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.838
because there's not
many people out there

00:34:20.838 --> 00:34:24.640
like him, at least that are--

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:28.070
that you see their content every
single day in every single way.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.620
So I would say it's split.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:35.429
We hire for skill set fit
and a culture addition.

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.920
If you went into
Gary's inbox right now,

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.197
you would see, I'm sure,
probably 300 people

00:34:40.197 --> 00:34:42.030
that are like, I will
work for you for free.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.405
And that might
have just happened

00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:44.570
in the last eight hours.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.400
By the time we get
to 8:00 tonight,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.800
there might be
another 150 that just

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.989
want to work for us
for free, which is--

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.290
that is amazing.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.880
That is, like,
incredible and an honor.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.100
Are those people
the right skill set?

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.820
I don't know.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.070
And that's where we have to
start calling through some

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:03.140
of those CVs, if we get.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.260
Now, we have specific
recruiters that

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.620
are looking at just media, video
production, account, project

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.620
management, and whatnot.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.280
Every now and then, we'll
get sent one of these people,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.610
two of these people, or hey,
the owner of the New York Jets

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:20.240
has a son.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:20.990
Here you go.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.370
So we have to look through
those incredibly carefully.

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.110
Of course, we'll give someone
an at bat at an interview.

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.370
That's for sure.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:34.010
If they are a student,
we'll hopefully

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.690
get them into our
internship program,

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.790
which is in the summer.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.540
If they are just coming
out of university,

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.610
maybe we can get them
in as a resident.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.930
Again, the skills are
super, super important.

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.920
Because we move so
fast, it's not charity.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.450
As Gary would say--

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:48.950
he says it a lot--
he's just like, I

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.247
mean, what are we doing here?

00:35:50.247 --> 00:35:51.080
Like, we're working.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.600
We're here to work.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:57.230
We are here to hustle and to
be the biggest human agency

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.520
in the face of the earth.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.600
But we really need to take our
time and go through those CVs,

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.449
and that takes a lot of time.

00:36:04.449 --> 00:36:06.990
And then we have to make sure
that we're interviewing really,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.630
really carefully.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:11.660
Otherwise we could just
get a lot of Gary fanatics

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.940
and maybe not a lot
of the specific work

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.660
that we need to get done.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:22.002
But it's always fun to see those
emails come in, a lot of fun.

00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:23.210
CHALMERS BROWNE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.459
AUDIENCE: Hi, [INAUDIBLE],,
I have a question for you.

00:36:25.459 --> 00:36:28.623
As VaynerMedia focuses on
building a honey empire or more

00:36:28.623 --> 00:36:32.560
of the work environment that has
more heart involved in getting

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.770
more comfortable and
connected with your employees

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.010
to make them more
productive, and as you know,

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.970
Google completely sets
itself in that way as well.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:41.990
And work cultural is
huge, and diversity

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.004
is very important for us.

00:36:44.004 --> 00:36:47.620
for the benefit of our
team and employees.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:52.330
Can you talk about a time,
where you using your approach

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.935
towards connecting with your
employees that have made them

00:36:55.935 --> 00:36:57.690
more productive,
and so you can say,

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.100
yes, this is something
more scalable?

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.400
And do you implore other
companies or other agencies,

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:08.639
for that matter, to come
employ that approach as well?

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:09.430
CLAUDE SILVER: Yes.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.000
Let's see.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.810
If I'm tracking correctly,
what I think you're asking

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:17.740
is a little bit of
the training that we

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.490
do with our employees that
are basically kind of geared

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:25.070
a little bit towards their
performance and their success.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.474
So the honey in the
empire portion--

00:37:27.474 --> 00:37:29.140
maybe looking at this
or looking at what

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.710
I was talking about
in the beginning,

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.740
which was putting people first.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.500
And if you really, really hone
in and deploy as much empathy

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.910
and care and TLC and generosity
and giving to employees,

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:41.230
that the output is--

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:46.160
I mean you just get
tenfold more of the output.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.680
So we do a lot of--

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:51.385
we spend time doing a
lot of small town halls

00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:55.840
the size of this room, town
halls, where I will just take--

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.855
I will field questions that
come at me about our culture

00:37:58.855 --> 00:38:01.810
or about changes or
more transparency.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.030
I'll do that, because
I fundamentally

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.130
believe we need
more communication

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.450
throughout the agency.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.000
And I should say, I started
at the agency as an SVP

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.800
on the client side.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.240
And so I can fully remember for
those 18 months I was there,

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.724
I was thinking, gosh, we
need more communication

00:38:18.724 --> 00:38:19.390
from leadership.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.140
We need more communication
from leadership.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:22.640
And now that I'm
in leadership, it's

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.500
something that I think
about all the time.

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:27.690
How can we increase
our transparency?

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.440
How can we make sure
that we're delivering

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.870
on the promise of
the honey empire?

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.200
How can we make sure that
we're delivering that growth

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.070
and development that
we also promised?

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.992
So spending time with people
is super, super important.

00:38:41.992 --> 00:38:42.950
I've already said that.

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:49.120
But making sure that I'm
coming in-- it's funny.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:52.520
So much of what I do, it
comes so naturally to me.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:56.255
And that's the great thing,
because I'm living my purpose,

00:38:56.255 --> 00:38:57.130
to Carrie's question.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.160
I'm able to-- my
purpose is to facilitate

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.422
growth and change and people
and companies and teams,

00:39:04.422 --> 00:39:06.130
and be a team builder,
and be of service.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.740
And I'm able to do
that every single day.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.200
But I realize not everyone
is able to do that.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.990
So me showing that--

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.910
I think it's really
important that everyone

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.620
knows that I work for them.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.430
No one-- there's absolutely
no one that works for me.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.290
And I will give
whatever I possibly

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.120
can to help someone
over that finish line

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.186
or help someone from the 10-yard
line to the 30-yard line.

00:39:29.186 --> 00:39:31.310
And that takes a lot of
time and energy and effort,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.240
but I think that's the
wonderful thing about being

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.100
in a company,
especially run by Gary,

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:37.840
where he wants to buy
the New York Jets.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.420
And so we function as a
team in many, many ways

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.900
and making sure that we're
deploying, to your point,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:48.250
deploying as much of that
honey in the empire internally.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:51.879
And hopefully, there's a trickle
down effect in other companies.

00:39:51.879 --> 00:39:53.420
AUDIENCE: Can I just
ask a follow-up?

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:53.690
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.856
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:39:54.856 --> 00:39:55.840
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah.

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.580
AUDIENCE: How do you scale that?

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.480
Do you go back afterwards,
and are you able to scale

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.550
that dynamic to
say, this actually

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:06.940
works, and it's actually making
our employees more productive?

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.930
How do you scale that?

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.140
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.130
The scaling question is such
a great question for us,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.480
I think at this size,
at the 800 mark,

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.830
because as I look
out on the landscape,

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.930
it's not anything I'm going
to be able to do alone.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.710
And it's something that
my team can certainly do,

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:31.300
but they're going to need extra
reinforcements very, very soon,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.060
because we can't be in every
place at every single time.

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.990
And in order to track back and
see how that employee or that

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:42.396
cohort of people
is-- if there are--

00:40:42.396 --> 00:40:45.532
if their needle has moved
since we last trained with them

00:40:45.532 --> 00:40:46.990
or we last spent
time with them, it

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.281
takes a lot of time and energy.

00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:50.770
And it takes away
from something else

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.800
that we're doing that might
be extremely pressing.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.880
So it's really leaning
on the culture carriers

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.920
that we've built
right now to kind

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.010
of be the finger on the pulse
for me when I can't be there,

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:07.240
or for Gary, and making
sure that we can track back,

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.100
and there is
something to measure.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.130
But growth is something
that we can feel.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.440
I mean, you can see
it in the water.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.157
You can feel it.

00:41:15.157 --> 00:41:17.740
You can certainly feel it when
you're with someone, especially

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.930
because we have people
that stay with us

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.150
the longevity for a long time.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.610
So you can see how
they've ebbed and flown

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.730
throughout their
tenureship at VaynerMedia.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.850
And we really use them,
quite frankly, to help

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.580
other people grow
and to make sure

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:39.460
that we are going back and
tying up any loose ends

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.230
that we may have missed.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:46.270
So it's really a human--
it's really human effort.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.780
I mean, thank god for Google and
Google Docs and Google Forms,

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.590
because that's what we rely on.

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:56.470
It's human effort,
and at some point,

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.650
we're starting to systematize
much more now that we've

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.440
past the 700 people mark.

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.819
Thanks for the question.

00:42:04.819 --> 00:42:06.610
CHALMERS BROWNE: Oh,
we do have a question.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.310
So I want to zoom a
little about on a point

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.680
the previous questioner asked
around diversity and inclusion

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.860
in two dimensions.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:20.080
So one is, especially on the
creative side of the agency

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.090
business, diversity has been--

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.945
is, I would argue,
a massive problem

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:28.626
in this part of the industry.

00:42:28.626 --> 00:42:31.150
We're then-- LGBT,
people of color

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:35.020
are dramatically
underrepresented

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.790
in every creative agency and
every creative department

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.010
inside companies.

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:43.680
So I'm wondering if you could
talk about your point of view

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.090
on how you acquire that talent.

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.800
Do you have a specific
lens for that or not?

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.290
And then, something
that I think is

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:54.745
very personal to
a lot of Googlers

00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:58.270
is also, how, once
those people come in,

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.760
they do feel that sense
of connection, trust,

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.650
and empathy so that they
do feel included and want

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:05.260
to build that sense of loyalty?

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:07.260
CLAUDE SILVER: Yeah, thank
you for the question.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.160
That's actually one that
I love digging into,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.360
because as you said, we're
all trying to figure it out.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.560
Mapping the macro to the
micro, mapping a macrocosm

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:20.230
to the microcosm is
much more difficult

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.050
than I would have
ever known, as I'm now

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.270
looking at it from the
top down and, also,

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.560
just being on the floor.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.950
Diversity and inclusivity
is-- and they are

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:32.840
different things, of course.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:37.400
It's one thing to have a diverse
employee, a NEST, if you will.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.550
But then to deploy inclusivity
in the belonging is, I think--

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:45.170
that's almost more challenging.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.910
So one of the things that
is extremely important to us

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.686
is creating a safe space, where
people feel that they can bring

00:43:51.686 --> 00:43:52.810
their whole selves to work.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.800
And that means physical safety
and psychological safety,

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.872
absolutely, bar none.

00:43:57.872 --> 00:43:59.330
We were talking
about this earlier.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.070
It's like literally on
my head every single day.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.690
When people, when new--

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.970
let's start with the
candidate experience.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.640
When you are a candidate,
and you walk in,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.260
and if you are a
person of color,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.440
and you aren't seeing any other
people of color, that is--

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.840
that cannot feel good.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.280
There's just no way.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.790
If you are female, and you are
being interviewed by males,

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.810
there's no way that
feels good either.

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:26.815
So that's just even talking
about like a white female

00:44:26.815 --> 00:44:29.000
of privilege.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.310
So making sure that we have as
much diversity in our offices

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.577
is really, really fundamentally
the most important thing

00:44:39.577 --> 00:44:40.910
that we can do every single day.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:43.030
And that means hiring for--

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.410
like hiring the best person.

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.035
Of course, we're
going to hire the best

00:44:46.035 --> 00:44:47.290
person that comes our way.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.050
Skill set, culture addition--

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.620
I like this idea of making
sure or trying to make sure

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.290
that our values with that
candidate and that candidate

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:57.340
are in the same zip code.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.360
It's something I
was just sharing

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.800
with the team the other day.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.720
I don't expect your
value and my value

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.730
to be completely
apples to apples,

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.850
but I would like
them to be similar.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.400
That, I think-- the value
piece of it, I think,

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.695
does open up the--

00:45:12.695 --> 00:45:15.460
it gives us a little bit more
of an ability to widen our net

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:20.650
or cast a wider net, when we are
looking for those candidates.

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:22.210
Back to creating a
safe space, where

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.730
people feel like they can bring
their whole selves to work--

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.104
if you are a person
of color, you

00:45:26.104 --> 00:45:27.530
want to see more
people of color.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.606
If you are LGBTQ,
you want to know

00:45:29.606 --> 00:45:30.730
that we have a PRIDE group.

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.100
If you have a learning
disability, or you're dyslexic,

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.230
like myself, you
want to know that we

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.960
have tools that you can use.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.790
If you have a
physical handicap, you

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:44.290
want to be recognized for that,
not as an other and an outlier,

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:47.690
but that we can embrace
you and take care of that.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:52.870
So the 3% Conference is going
on right now up the street,

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.240
and one of the things I
love about what they've

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.430
done there is they've
called attention

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.240
to the fact that
diversity is so few

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.910
and far between in
creative agencies.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:09.610
The idea of finding that other,
especially in senior level

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.640
creative positions,
is really challenging.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.970
It's really challenging for us.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.303
I'm happy to say, I don't have--

00:46:15.303 --> 00:46:19.090
we actually don't have stats
on multicultural diversity,

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.670
because people can opt
out of that question.

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:27.030
So what makes me happy is
when I walk across the floor,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.220
and I can see just difference.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.870
And I don't mean
difference with an X.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.370
I mean difference
with a capital D,

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:35.880
because this room is different.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.310
It's something that is just
so incredibly important.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:39.864
I can't even stress it enough.

00:46:39.864 --> 00:46:41.280
It's like I don't
want to even say

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.260
it's my favorite
question to answer,

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.650
because I don't have the answer.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:49.890
But it's my favorite thing to
kind of chew on altogether,

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:54.710
and does that mean we need to
lean in on the four Ds more?

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.620
I mean, there's pockets in this
city and pockets in Chattanooga

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:00.450
and pockets in schools
that we can lean on

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:02.009
to get different talent.

00:47:02.009 --> 00:47:04.050
It's something we certainly
do with our residents

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.790
and our internship
to really make

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.850
sure we're casting that
wide net and able to mirror

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:12.850
the macrocosm of this world.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.780
And it's something we haven't
we haven't solved for yet.

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.870
It is a work in
progress, but something

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.979
that is so near and
dear to what I'm doing.

00:47:21.979 --> 00:47:23.770
Back to Gary, like,
what are we doing here?

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:29.220
Like, we have to make sure
that we are finding talent

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.700
that represents this world.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.300
And one of the things
I'm proud of back at work

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.680
is that we have squads.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.330
We used to call them
tribes, in fact,

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:42.120
and we took away that
word, "tribes," because

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.860
of the cultural sensitivity.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.110
But we have squads, and
I like to use the word,

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.330
"cohorts," quite a bit.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.240
And there's a squad that
is called the Amigos Squad.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.750
And they founded each other.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:53.740
They found each other.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.980
They founded this group,
first and foremost,

00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.400
to be able to market
to Latinas and Latinos

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.440
and the Hispanic culture.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.990
And now, they've really--

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.830
it's an inclusive--
it's an open door group,

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.371
and it's an inclusive
group, but it's

00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:09.150
one that keeps me very,
very honest about what

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.240
we're doing, about
diversity and inclusivity.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.040
And so I'm happy we
have that-- in, still,

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.210
a startup, quite frankly.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:24.090
So thank you for the question,
and I'm open to any ideas

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:27.170
to chomp on for
how we solve this.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:29.742
Yeah, thank you.

00:48:29.742 --> 00:48:32.150
You can tell I'm
passionate about that.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.290
Come on.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:38.520
CHALMERS BROWNE: So if
you're successful in making

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.760
your workplace a place
where people feel included,

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.820
feel at home, what's your
approach to work-life balance?

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.950
How do you make sure that--

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.010
is there a danger of
tipping that too far,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:54.120
where some people might fail
to build or maintain their life

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:55.930
outside of work?

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:58.740
CLAUDE SILVER: So the
sarcastic me says to you,

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.380
is there such a thing
as work-life balance?

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.250
I mean, sarcastic
and slightly true.

00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:06.060
What I do is--

00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.680
by no means is it 24/7, but
I'm working quite a bit.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.630
And I'm OK with that,
because I've chosen this job.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:19.110
I've actually turned
over this idea

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.850
of work-life balance
for the moment,

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.719
and I look at energy management.

00:49:22.719 --> 00:49:24.510
And that's kind of the
term that I look at,

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:29.620
and I try to share a lot
more of with our employees.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:33.510
We have 80% millennials, so
that right there in itself is--

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.560
and we're an agency.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.670
So that is as
cutthroat as it gets.

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.189
I mean, you are
beholden to a client,

00:49:40.189 --> 00:49:41.730
and that means you've
got to get that

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.771
out when you said you were
going to get that out,

00:49:43.771 --> 00:49:45.600
unless you're going
to answer the phone

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.730
tomorrow with a
client breathing down

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.890
your neck, which happens also.

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:52.740
But this idea of
energy management

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.620
is something that makes
more sense to me today,

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.940
rather than work-life balance,
unfortunately, or fortunately.

00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.730
Energy management is
really being aware

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:07.850
of how you're feeling,
where your anxiety level is.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:08.790
Are you at Code Red?

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:10.165
Because if you're
at Code Red, we

00:50:10.165 --> 00:50:12.360
need to figure out
how to get to pink

00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.030
or how to get to an orange.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.810
Setting up little milestones
across your day to,

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:21.621
then, celebrate, take
a break, so you're

00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:22.870
going to work for 10 minutes--

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:25.590
I'm sorry-- you're going to
work for two hours on this one

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:27.756
project that you're working
on, this one spreadsheet

00:50:27.756 --> 00:50:29.610
or this one deliverable.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:32.805
You're going to get to a
stopping point, where you know

00:50:32.805 --> 00:50:35.400
you can get up, take a breath,
and you can go check Instagram

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.067
for 10 minutes.

00:50:36.067 --> 00:50:37.650
You can go out and
walk the High Line.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:38.941
You can go for a cup of coffee.

00:50:38.941 --> 00:50:40.179
You can go out to lunch.

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:42.720
Those are things, I think going
back to my project management

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.553
roots, I think are
really, really important.

00:50:44.553 --> 00:50:48.170
I think if I'm looking at
a Gantt chart of my day

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.010
and where my energy
tips and falls

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.170
and after lunch and
whatnot, just being super,

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:57.420
super aware of how
I'm feeling inside

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:00.000
and how an employee
is feeling inside

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.950
and how that's
manifesting, whether or not

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:04.980
that's manifesting physically,
and maybe someone's grinding

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.050
their teeth or
getting really upset,

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:10.350
or how that's just
manifesting inside

00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:13.620
with not feeling good
enough about yourself

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.962
and feeling
extremely competitive

00:51:15.962 --> 00:51:16.920
with that other person.

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.320
Or gosh, you heard that
person's getting 10k more,

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.360
and you're doing the same job.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:26.880
So managing one's energy is
super important right now.

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.910
Yes, having work-life
balance is like a dream.

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:33.450
I think that if any of us
can go back in time and clock

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.030
in and clock out, as
some of our parents dead,

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:39.000
or work that eight-hour day
with a half an hour lunch

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.700
break, as some
people do in Europe,

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:46.800
quite frankly, that
is kind of utopic.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.230
And there are places to do that.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.820
I can't tell you
that agency life

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.120
is that place right
now, and maybe

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.880
as we see more remote working--

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:57.980
you do that really well.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.187
I mean Google does
extremely well.

00:52:01.187 --> 00:52:03.270
But agencies are funny,
because for the most part,

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:07.830
you're in roles that you need
to be present on a floor for.

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:11.230
You need to be able to look
across that desk and say, hey,

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.080
will you look at my
deck for a second?

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:15.570
There's such a collaborative
yin and yang there.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:22.840
So work-life balance is
something that I'm aware of,

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.920
I wish I had that answer
to, but time management

00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.800
is where I'm really
trying to get more people

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.560
to focus on, and be
aware of just how they're

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.300
feeling in any given
moment and when

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.100
they can just take a time out.

00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:37.390
Timeouts really,
really, really help,

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.390
and we all deserve timeouts.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:43.112
Like, what are we doing here?

00:52:43.112 --> 00:52:44.070
CHALMERS BROWNE: Great.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:45.360
Well, thank you so
much for coming.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.020
CLAUDE SILVER:
Thank you very much.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:46.530
CHALMERS BROWNE: We're at time.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.024
Let's have a hand for Claude.

00:52:48.024 --> 00:52:48.940
CLAUDE SILVER: Thanks.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.890
