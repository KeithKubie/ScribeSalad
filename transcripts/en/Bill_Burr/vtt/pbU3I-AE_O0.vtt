1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.520
Like a boss.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.530
<v 1>Oh really?
Quickly.
I didn't even get a chance to talk about it.</v>

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.310
Do you guys watch that 60 minutes thing last night of that fucking jerk off?

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.320
Who's written out?
Alex Rodriguez,
the Henry Hill of that thing.

5
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.700
<v 0>Once Alex Rodriguez was fully under your protocol,</v>

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
what were the various banned substances that he was taking?

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.520
Testosterone,

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.060
insulin growth factor one human growth hormone and some different forms of

9
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:38.334
peptides.

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.610
<v 1>All right,
I'm pulling up Paul Versey.
That dude,
I call it.
I called it.</v>

11
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.870
We're all going to be on Roids by the end of our lives.

12
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.450
<v 2>Yes,
she could snuff</v>

13
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.210
[inaudible].
Wow.

14
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.470
<v 1>Okay.
And I'm going to tell you why.</v>

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.610
Because the same reason why you saw that sexy scare scrubs,

16
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.790
scarecrow walk into the fucking stage coming down there looking like a sexy

17
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.893
scare crow.

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
The same reason why they got all these diet pills and all this fucking grow your

19
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:18.480
hair back.
Shit,
cause no one wants to be old and decrepit.
All right?

20
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.920
They're already given the shit out.

21
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.940
That synergetics is fucking HGH as far as I can tell.

22
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.370
<v 2>It is leading edge medical science that could make you look and feel younger,</v>

23
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.540
a lot younger.
My Libido was like,
I was 18.

24
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.950
So the desire is there
constantly.

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.350
<v 1>Um,
which is basically I researched,
I said synergetics</v>

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.380
uh,
scandal.
That's what I searched.
So of course negative shit came up about them.

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.320
Um,
we're all going to be on it.
It's the same way.

28
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.540
Marijuana is gradually becoming legal.
That's what's going to happen with,
with,

29
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.490
with steroids.
Guaran fucking tee.

30
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.800
<v 1>You know what's the coolest part of the story was they said a rod texted this</v>

32
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.420
Guy Tony,
whatever the fuck his name was and John [inaudible].

33
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.000
He said,
hey,
I got a big day tomorrow.
What do you got?
So we gave them the stuff.

34
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.010
The next day he wrote had like two doubles and a single or something like that.

35
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.950
And the 60 minute guy goes,
Ooh,

36
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.490
what did you think after you sent him your products and saw the results and he

37
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:27.180
was going like,
he basically said

38
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.960
that,
yeah,
we,
we got the formula down.

39
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.230
<v 0>She had a great game.
He doubled.
He scored twice.</v>

40
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
What did his performance tell you about what you had told him to take?

41
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.800
That we,
we had the right protocol.

42
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.620
<v 1>You have the formula down and he goes,
yeah.
It was like,</v>

43
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.090
it was like shooting fish in a barrel.

44
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.830
So these guys are so advanced in this illegal shit.

45
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm telling you,
they're going to get it to the point where it just like weed,

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.200
you can smoke it through like a breathalyzer where all it is is just basically

47
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.480
the mist of THC.
Whatever the fuck that stuff is that gets you high,

48
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.620
they're going to get that with,
with steroids.
All right?

49
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:15.370
And you're going to be 80 years old walking around feeling like you can put your

50
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:19.790
fucking fist through the Goddamn wall.
It's going to be great.

51
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.990
All right.
And all of this,

52
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.990
this witch hunt on these a rod guys and all these guys that went to jail and all

53
00:03:26.991 --> 00:03:29.090
that type of shit that people are going to look back and be like,
well,

54
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:32.810
what was the problem?
That's,
that's my prediction.

55
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.330
Provided an asteroid doesn't hit us first.
Um,

56
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.930
<v 2>[inaudible] comfortable.</v>

57
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.053
[inaudible] now,
Mr

58
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.970
[inaudible]
little
bit.
