that is dead trigger now other games
 

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:40.860
that is dead trigger now other games
that we are playing now this game is not

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:40.870
that we are playing now this game is not
 

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.080
that we are playing now this game is not
on the main screen here because it was

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:43.090
on the main screen here because it was
 

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.530
on the main screen here because it was
already installed but this mine yes so

does no I'm gonna take this out of the
 

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.140
does no I'm gonna take this out of the
other thing here okay um okay radiant

defense is every year or two there comes
 

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.060
defense is every year or two there comes
a game that I have to finish I almost

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.070
a game that I have to finish I almost
 

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.360
a game that I have to finish I almost
never finish a game and in this

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.370
never finish a game and in this
 

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.300
never finish a game and in this
particular case it was radiant defect

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:06.310
particular case it was radiant defect
 

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.860
particular case it was radiant defect
you know the last there's a lot to come

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
you know the last there's a lot to come
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.480
you know the last there's a lot to come
out I have finally finished already

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:09.490
out I have finally finished already
 

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.240
out I have finally finished already
started every level nice uh so I love

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.250
started every level nice uh so I love
 

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.500
started every level nice uh so I love
tower defense games i think tower

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:13.510
tower defense games i think tower
 

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.720
tower defense games i think tower
defense games are great mmm this one in

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:15.730
defense games are great mmm this one in
 

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.670
defense games are great mmm this one in
particular really really caught my eye

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680
particular really really caught my eye
 

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.330
particular really really caught my eye
so it was free to download um before you

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:21.340
so it was free to download um before you
 

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.200
so it was free to download um before you
are going to it i think you've

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:22.210
are going to it i think you've
 

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.000
are going to it i think you've
disconnected the hdmi cable oh what Oh

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.010
disconnected the hdmi cable oh what Oh
 

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.820
disconnected the hdmi cable oh what Oh
how's that that's but I'm wonderful okay

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:26.830
how's that that's but I'm wonderful okay
 

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.410
how's that that's but I'm wonderful okay
very cautious with these mini hdmi

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:28.420
very cautious with these mini hdmi
 

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.730
very cautious with these mini hdmi
cables micro HDMI cables yeah yeah

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740
cables micro HDMI cables yeah yeah
 

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.740
cables micro HDMI cables yeah yeah
but what's really really interesting

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:33.750
but what's really really interesting
 

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.600
but what's really really interesting
about this game is that unlike the soap

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:38.610
about this game is that unlike the soap
 

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.090
about this game is that unlike the soap
well let's let's go ahead and get past

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100
well let's let's go ahead and get past
 

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.720
well let's let's go ahead and get past
the sort of cheesy humorous sections

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:44.730
the sort of cheesy humorous sections
 

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:46.490
the sort of cheesy humorous sections
here they actually are pretty funny or

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500
here they actually are pretty funny or
 

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.560
here they actually are pretty funny or
is good yeah well it's right up at the

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:48.570
is good yeah well it's right up at the
 

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:50.780
is good yeah well it's right up at the
like Captain Underpants level exactly

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:50.790
like Captain Underpants level exactly
 

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.550
like Captain Underpants level exactly
just where we like us work we like it

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560
just where we like us work we like it
 

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.110
just where we like us work we like it
okay I so so so like many tower defense

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120
okay I so so so like many tower defense
 

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.990
okay I so so so like many tower defense
games your enemies will come on a path

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000
games your enemies will come on a path
 

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.460
games your enemies will come on a path
what makes this one interesting is that

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:01.470
what makes this one interesting is that
 

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.730
what makes this one interesting is that
you will set the path by building blocks

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740
you will set the path by building blocks
 

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.430
you will set the path by building blocks
now a lot of games will let you set the

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440
now a lot of games will let you set the
 

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.350
now a lot of games will let you set the
path your alter the path by building

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360
path your alter the path by building
 

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.260
path your alter the path by building
towers but in this case you can't build

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:12.270
towers but in this case you can't build
 

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.810
towers but in this case you can't build
towers on the path you have to build

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820
towers on the path you have to build
 

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.750
towers on the path you have to build
towers on these existing black squares

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760
towers on these existing black squares
 

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.720
towers on these existing black squares
but you also get a certain number of

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:20.730
but you also get a certain number of
 

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.910
but you also get a certain number of
these black squares that the blocks to

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920
these black squares that the blocks to
 

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.130
these black squares that the blocks to
set yourself so if I set up these

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:25.140
set yourself so if I set up these
 

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.510
set yourself so if I set up these
modules I can actually lengthen or alter

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:29.520
modules I can actually lengthen or alter
 

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.240
modules I can actually lengthen or alter
the path and this turns out to be one of

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.250
the path and this turns out to be one of
 

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:37.700
the path and this turns out to be one of
the major innovated in a well it turns

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:37.710
the major innovated in a well it turns
 

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:38.990
the major innovated in a well it turns
out to be want to major strategy now you

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000
out to be want to major strategy now you
 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.090
out to be want to major strategy now you
have to think about there's a lot of

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100
have to think about there's a lot of
 

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.370
have to think about there's a lot of
levels where you're absolutely hopeless

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380
levels where you're absolutely hopeless
 

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.010
levels where you're absolutely hopeless
unless you've built the correct path but

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.020
unless you've built the correct path but
 

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.450
unless you've built the correct path but
if you have built a path that makes

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:47.460
if you have built a path that makes
 

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.270
if you have built a path that makes
sense that you know for instance you've

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:50.280
sense that you know for instance you've
 

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.070
sense that you know for instance you've
got aliens coming at you from two

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.080
got aliens coming at you from two
 

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.080
got aliens coming at you from two
different areas you need to build a path

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.090
different areas you need to build a path
 

00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.840
different areas you need to build a path
so that one of them takes so long that

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:56.850
so that one of them takes so long that
 

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.790
so that one of them takes so long that
you get it second right instead of

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800
you get it second right instead of
 

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.260
you get it second right instead of
getting both of them at the same time

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:00.270
getting both of them at the same time
 

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.470
getting both of them at the same time
and the the other innovation the other

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480
and the the other innovation the other
 

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.460
and the the other innovation the other
thing that I think is really interesting

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:04.470
thing that I think is really interesting
 

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:09.620
thing that I think is really interesting
is that towers miss the towers actually

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:09.630
is that towers miss the towers actually
 

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.810
is that towers miss the towers actually
have aim I and they rotate around at a

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:14.820
have aim I and they rotate around at a
 

00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.380
have aim I and they rotate around at a
fixed speed so sometimes and you're

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:18.390
fixed speed so sometimes and you're
 

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.610
fixed speed so sometimes and you're
seeing it right now every now and then

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620
seeing it right now every now and then
 

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.260
seeing it right now every now and then
one of those bullets will just miss one

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.270
one of those bullets will just miss one
 

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.580
one of those bullets will just miss one
of the enemies so you have to be really

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:22.590
of the enemies so you have to be really
 

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:24.200
of the enemies so you have to be really
careful about your tower placement

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:24.210
careful about your tower placement
 

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.030
careful about your tower placement
because you don't want to make it so

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040
because you don't want to make it so
 

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.590
because you don't want to make it so
they have to rotate around really quick

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600
they have to rotate around really quick
 

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.150
they have to rotate around really quick
you don't want to make it so the shots

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160
you don't want to make it so the shots
 

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.740
you don't want to make it so the shots
are hard for instance if you place a

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:30.750
are hard for instance if you place a
 

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.510
are hard for instance if you place a
tower where the aliens are coming past

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520
tower where the aliens are coming past
 

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.820
tower where the aliens are coming past
it then it's going to be harder for it

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:34.830
it then it's going to be harder for it
 

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.170
it then it's going to be harder for it
to make the shots because they're coming

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:36.180
to make the shots because they're coming
 

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.870

you an interest bonus between between

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:54.990
you an interest bonus between between
 

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.890
you an interest bonus between between
rounds right I which gives you an

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900
rounds right I which gives you an
 

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.330
rounds right I which gives you an
incentive to spend the least money

00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340
incentive to spend the least money
 

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.919

possible now they capped that at five

00:21:00.919 --> 00:21:00.929
possible now they capped that at five
 

00:21:00.929 --> 00:21:03.650
possible now they capped that at five
hundred dollars so right so if you get

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:03.660
hundred dollars so right so if you get
 

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.690
hundred dollars so right so if you get
more than 500 you're not going to get

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:05.700
more than 500 you're not going to get
 

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.340
more than 500 you're not going to get
any more interest which is good you know

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:07.350
any more interest which is good you know
 

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.610
any more interest which is good you know
makes sense yeah but then what they do

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620
makes sense yeah but then what they do
 

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.620
makes sense yeah but then what they do

these games you know this is this is a
 

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.070
these games you know this is this is a
great strategy and actually I think even

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080
great strategy and actually I think even
 

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.659
great strategy and actually I think even
if even if you are selling these things

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:47.669
if even if you are selling these things
 

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:49.730
if even if you are selling these things
individually I think the idea of also

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740
individually I think the idea of also
 

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.650
individually I think the idea of also
selling them in packs is really

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:51.660
selling them in packs is really
 

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.990
selling them in packs is really
appealing yeah and especially you know

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000
appealing yeah and especially you know
 

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.840

I've I mean what i really want shadowgun
to do actually is have an upgrade that

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:58.710
to do actually is have an upgrade that
 

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.130
to do actually is have an upgrade that
turns out that that doubles the amount

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:01.140
turns out that that doubles the amount
 

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.470
turns out that that doubles the amount
of coins you get for everything in the

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480
of coins you get for everything in the
 

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.870
of coins you get for everything in the
game and then turns everything you had

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880
game and then turns everything you had
 

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.820

which is the quote slow currency that
 

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:10.789
which is the quote slow currency that
you basically don't get during the game

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799
you basically don't get during the game
 

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.140

something that you can just grind

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:15.510
something that you can just grind
 

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.630

through for like seven or eight dollars
 

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.240
through for like seven or eight dollars
right I think this is this is actually a

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:20.250
right I think this is this is actually a
 

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.620
right I think this is this is actually a
nine or ten dollar game mmm I which

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:23.630
nine or ten dollar game mmm I which
 

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.909
nine or ten dollar game mmm I which
absolutely I is in line with the

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919
absolutely I is in line with the
 

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:27.830
absolutely I is in line with the
enjoyment that I got out of it had a lot

of fun could have spent nothing mm-hmm
 

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.890
of fun could have spent nothing mm-hmm
and still had a lot of fun but I getting

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900
and still had a lot of fun but I getting

now here's here's a question for you by

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780
now here's here's a question for you by
 

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.270
now here's here's a question for you by
the way about pricing okay would you

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280
the way about pricing okay would you
 

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.450
the way about pricing okay would you
rather get something that is fifty

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460
rather get something that is fifty
 

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.820
rather get something that is fifty
percent off mm-hmm or something where

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:46.830
percent off mm-hmm or something where
 

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:51.530
percent off mm-hmm or something where
you get fifty percent more free you know

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:51.540
you get fifty percent more free you know
 

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.630
you get fifty percent more free you know
usually it's that's an interesting

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640
usually it's that's an interesting
 

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:58.310
usually it's that's an interesting
question I want both and because your

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320
question I want both and because your
 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.870
question I want both and because your
hand galloping you'll probably get it

00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880
hand galloping you'll probably get it
 

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.580
hand galloping you'll probably get it
but let's pretend you're me no I mean I

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:01.590
but let's pretend you're me no I mean I
 

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.460
but let's pretend you're me no I mean I
I think I think honestly fifty percent

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:04.470
I think I think honestly fifty percent
 

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.430
I think I think honestly fifty percent
more free makes a lot of sense when it

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440
more free makes a lot of sense when it
 

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.590
more free makes a lot of sense when it

mean you know and at some point you just
 

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.210
mean you know and at some point you just
have to say I'm just going to drop them

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220
have to say I'm just going to drop them
 

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.730

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480
these are going to add up you know and
 

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.180
these are going to add up you know and
you only have a limited number of those

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:32.190
you only have a limited number of those
 

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:34.280
you only have a limited number of those
retries and so there is a certain amount

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:34.290
retries and so there is a certain amount
 

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.560
retries and so there is a certain amount
of luck involved here what's even cooler

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:36.570
of luck involved here what's even cooler
 

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.480

to 12 and now you'll see whether I can

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.370
to 12 and now you'll see whether I can
 

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:52.070
to 12 and now you'll see whether I can
actually add anything to 12 which I

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080
actually add anything to 12 which I
 

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.690
actually add anything to 12 which I

added to this and i hit the back key to
 

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.300
added to this and i hit the back key to
get back out and then i was stuck

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:15.310

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.180
get back out and then i was stuck
forever oh really yeah but that's hasn't

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:18.190

need to watch out for that yeah but but
 

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.190
need to watch out for that yeah but but
right the in-app purchase is always

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200
right the in-app purchase is always
 

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.140
right the in-app purchase is always
gonna pop up as a dialogue on on the

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:25.150
gonna pop up as a dialogue on on the
 

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.780
gonna pop up as a dialogue on on the
ballot yeah right you know I kind of

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:27.790
ballot yeah right you know I kind of
 

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.970
ballot yeah right you know I kind of
wish we'd do that on the phone too yeah

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:29.980
wish we'd do that on the phone too yeah
 

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.830
wish we'd do that on the phone too yeah
it's kind of a it's kind of a mixed bag

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:31.840
it's kind of a it's kind of a mixed bag
 

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.720
it's kind of a it's kind of a mixed bag
honestly in terms of in terms of how

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:33.730
honestly in terms of in terms of how
 

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.460
honestly in terms of in terms of how
good it is the advantage of it popping

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:35.470
good it is the advantage of it popping
 

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.440
good it is the advantage of it popping
up full screen is it the system is

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:37.450
up full screen is it the system is
 

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:39.000
up full screen is it the system is
guaranteed to have enough memory to

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:39.010
guaranteed to have enough memory to
 

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.450
guaranteed to have enough memory to
actually launch the Play Store the yes

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:42.460
actually launch the Play Store the yes
 

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.370
actually launch the Play Store the yes
but the advantage of it not popping up

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:44.380
but the advantage of it not popping up
 

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.050
but the advantage of it not popping up
full screen it is that it's not going to

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:46.060
full screen it is that it's not going to
 

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.380
full screen it is that it's not going to
try to reclaim your yeah and ninety

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:49.390
try to reclaim your yeah and ninety
 

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.349
try to reclaim your yeah and ninety
percent of time I mean there are a few

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359
percent of time I mean there are a few
 

00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:54.330
percent of time I mean there are a few
games that we've found that where the

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:54.340
games that we've found that where the
 

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.760
games that we've found that where the
Play Store and your app really can't

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:56.770
Play Store and your app really can't
 

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.580
Play Store and your app really can't
coexist but in general you know the

00:41:59.580 --> 00:41:59.590
coexist but in general you know the
 

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.030
coexist but in general you know the
issue is what's the plate if the place

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040
issue is what's the plate if the place
 

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.590
issue is what's the plate if the place
where needs more memory what's it going

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:04.600
where needs more memory what's it going
 

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.599
where needs more memory what's it going
to kill first is it going to kill like

the background now so I'm going to kill
 

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:32.710
the background now so I'm going to kill
it off so that's a stay tuned on that

for right now the lesson to be gleaned

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680
for right now the lesson to be gleaned
 

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.099
for right now the lesson to be gleaned
from this is if you've got anything that

00:42:42.099 --> 00:42:42.109
from this is if you've got anything that
 

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:46.030
from this is if you've got anything that
hides your app whether it's an ad or an

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.040
hides your app whether it's an ad or an
 

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.330
hides your app whether it's an ad or an
in-app purchase or you know like a some

in-app purchase or you know like a some
 

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.300

wall yeah any of those things if they're
in a different process and they need

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:57.650
in a different process and they need
 

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.520
in a different process and they need
more memory it could result in your

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:00.530
more memory it could result in your
 

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.050
more memory it could result in your
process stopping so you need to be

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:02.060
process stopping so you need to be
 

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.060
process stopping so you need to be
really careful about testing that sort

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:04.070
really careful about testing that sort
 

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:05.410
really careful about testing that sort
of thing and making sure that your

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:05.420
of thing and making sure that your
 

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.000
of thing and making sure that your

in this game even making a relatively
 

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:04.280
in this game even making a relatively
minor change like adding a lot

background graphic that could extend and

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880
background graphic that could extend and
 

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.370
background graphic that could extend and
not changing any other part of the

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380
not changing any other part of the
 

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.829
not changing any other part of the
gameplay made an enormous difference the

00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839
gameplay made an enormous difference the
 

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:11.720
gameplay made an enormous difference the
experience to someone who's using it

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:11.730
experience to someone who's using it
 

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:13.490

really made it feel like i was playing

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500

some it was meant for my device you know
and this this brings up an interesting

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:16.080
and this this brings up an interesting
 

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.200
and this this brings up an interesting
point because we've we've talked a lot

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.210
point because we've we've talked a lot
 

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.280
point because we've we've talked a lot
about different screen aspect ratios and

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:21.290
about different screen aspect ratios and
 

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:25.099
about different screen aspect ratios and

that's been aged in bourbon barrels so
 

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.829
that's been aged in bourbon barrels so
another thing I'll tell you when we

00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839
another thing I'll tell you when we
 

00:45:33.839 --> 00:45:37.070
another thing I'll tell you when we
first got this game all of no hang on or

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:37.080
first got this game all of no hang on or
 

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.310

even you you can always interrupt me

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:40.320
even you you can always interrupt me

with beer but you get in trouble with
other thing okay anyway the point is

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:43.950
other thing okay anyway the point is
 

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:46.550
other thing okay anyway the point is
that we know it can be frustrating to

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560
that we know it can be frustrating to
 

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.579
that we know it can be frustrating to
deal with different aspect ratios but

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:49.589
deal with different aspect ratios but
 

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:52.280
deal with different aspect ratios but
there's always some way to do it that

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:52.290
there's always some way to do it that
 

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.500

some games don't but you can add a
 

00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:01.579
some games don't but you can add a
little bit too to either side you know

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:01.589
little bit too to either side you know
 

00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:04.730
little bit too to either side you know

had your scoring area your head over the
top of the game and now there's some

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480
top of the game and now there's some
 

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.510
top of the game and now there's some
area above that that's just blank why

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520

defining compatible screens and making

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:24.810
defining compatible screens and making
 

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.620
defining compatible screens and making
really really specific aspect ratios for

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:27.630
really really specific aspect ratios for
 

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.570
really really specific aspect ratios for
each set of screens because you know

what's happened to all the people that
 

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.339
what's happened to all the people that
declared on compatible screens today

00:46:33.339 --> 00:46:33.349
declared on compatible screens today
 

00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:35.390
declared on compatible screens today
they're not showing up on this that's

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400
they're not showing up on this that's
 

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.120
they're not showing up on this that's
right none of them show up on the nexus

7 you know why because we didn't

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480
7 you know why because we didn't
 

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:45.180
7 you know why because we didn't
about it exactly no more the problem is

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:45.190
about it exactly no more the problem is
 

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.370
about it exactly no more the problem is
that the Nexus 7 is a geometry that's

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:47.380
that the Nexus 7 is a geometry that's
 

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.620
that the Nexus 7 is a geometry that's
never been seen before in Android it's a

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:49.630
never been seen before in Android it's a
 

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.230
never been seen before in Android it's a
7 inch device well it's 1280 by eight it

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240
7 inch device well it's 1280 by eight it
 

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.910
7 inch device well it's 1280 by eight it
isn't most importantly it is a dpi that

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920
isn't most importantly it is a dpi that
 

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.109
isn't most importantly it is a dpi that
is definitely seen before that's what I

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119
is definitely seen before that's what I
 

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:58.140
is definitely seen before that's what I
meant it's not it's quite a court TV DPI

00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:58.150
meant it's not it's quite a court TV DPI
 

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.300
meant it's not it's quite a court TV DPI
yeah that's it well I we haven't really

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:00.310
yeah that's it well I we haven't really
 

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:03.840
yeah that's it well I we haven't really
named it it's 213 DPI so that's the you

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:03.850
named it it's 213 DPI so that's the you
 

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.180
named it it's 213 DPI so that's the you
said the number I know I know so um so

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:06.190
said the number I know I know so um so
 

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:07.830
said the number I know I know so um so
don't use compatible screens is the

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:07.840
don't use compatible screens is the
 

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.510
don't use compatible screens is the
moral of that yeah if you can possibly

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520
moral of that yeah if you can possibly
 

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.730
moral of that yeah if you can possibly
all right go back to I know you're just

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:11.740
all right go back to I know you're just
 

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.640
all right go back to I know you're just
really talks on all of alanis so so on

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:14.650
really talks on all of alanis so so on
 

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:16.109
really talks on all of alanis so so on
so one thing we notice when you're first

00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119
so one thing we notice when you're first
 

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:19.290
so one thing we notice when you're first
play in the game is that the fonts were

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:19.300
play in the game is that the fonts were
 

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.109
play in the game is that the fonts were
very very low resolution and it's

00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119
very very low resolution and it's
 

00:47:22.119 --> 00:47:24.780
very very low resolution and it's
interesting because when a font is

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:24.790
interesting because when a font is
 

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.510
interesting because when a font is
really really low resolution your I

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:26.520
really really low resolution your I
 

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:31.320
really really low resolution your I
tries to focus that font it tries to say

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:31.330
tries to focus that font it tries to say
 

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.560
tries to focus that font it tries to say
because it looks blurry yeah and it just

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:33.570
because it looks blurry yeah and it just
 

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:36.570
because it looks blurry yeah and it just
makes its makes you strain to read all

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:36.580

tricks your iron into actually trying to
get it to focus when it can't and so

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:45.460
get it to focus when it can't and so
 

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.580

You Ian now back to the game so we we so

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:58.150
You Ian now back to the game so we we so
 

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.550
You Ian now back to the game so we we so
we asked them me he said look you know

00:47:59.550 --> 00:47:59.560
we asked them me he said look you know
 

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.930
we asked them me he said look you know
can you do anything about the fonts and

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:00.940
can you do anything about the fonts and
 

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.570
can you do anything about the fonts and
they did and honestly the game is much

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:03.580
they did and honestly the game is much
 

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.880
they did and honestly the game is much
much more playable it's right and they

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:05.890
much more playable it's right and they
 

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.109
much more playable it's right and they
even though the background is still the

00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119
even though the background is still the
 

00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:09.120
even though the background is still the
equal low resolution you but don't even

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.130
equal low resolution you but don't even
 

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.310
equal low resolution you but don't even
really noticed that the back for the

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:11.320
really noticed that the back for the
 

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.750
really noticed that the back for the
most part the backgrounds in much lower

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:12.760
most part the backgrounds in much lower
 

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.980
most part the backgrounds in much lower
resolution than the font in the

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:13.990
resolution than the font in the
 

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:15.960
resolution than the font in the
foreground but the whole game feels a

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:15.970
foreground but the whole game feels a
 

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.030
foreground but the whole game feels a
lot more crisp it didn't take that much

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040
lot more crisp it didn't take that much
 

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.220
lot more crisp it didn't take that much
more space and it made a huge difference

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:20.230
more space and it made a huge difference
 

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:24.090
more space and it made a huge difference
in the game play and to put it more

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:24.100
in the game play and to put it more
 

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.040
in the game play and to put it more
technically what you want to do is watch

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:26.050
technically what you want to do is watch
 

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.450
technically what you want to do is watch
your your high frequency art so fonts

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:30.460
your your high frequency art so fonts
 

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.130
your your high frequency art so fonts
are always expected to be high frequency

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:32.140
are always expected to be high frequency
 

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.370
are always expected to be high frequency
you can get away with lower frequency on

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:35.380
you can get away with lower frequency on
 

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.849
you can get away with lower frequency on
other pieces of art you know on your

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:38.859
other pieces of art you know on your
 

00:48:38.859 --> 00:48:41.760
other pieces of art you know on your
backgrounds for instance you can't

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:41.770
backgrounds for instance you can't
 

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.040
backgrounds for instance you can't
always get away with it but in general

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:44.050
always get away with it but in general
 

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:47.940
always get away with it but in general
you can but you know basically you need

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:47.950
you can but you know basically you need
 

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.220
you can but you know basically you need
to you need to look at your game on

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:50.230
to you need to look at your game on
 

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:52.560
to you need to look at your game on
different displays and ask yourself

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:52.570
different displays and ask yourself
 

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:54.240
different displays and ask yourself
especially on

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:54.250
especially on
 

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.750
especially on
the 720p or even I when it releases the

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760
the 720p or even I when it releases the
 

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.350
the 720p or even I when it releases the
new 1080p tablets look at them and ask

00:49:01.350 --> 00:49:01.360
new 1080p tablets look at them and ask
 

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.320
new 1080p tablets look at them and ask
yourself does your game actually still

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.330
yourself does your game actually still
 

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.170
yourself does your game actually still
look good and if it doesn't you might

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:07.180
look good and if it doesn't you might
 

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.500
look good and if it doesn't you might
want to start considering switching up

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:10.510
want to start considering switching up
 

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.370
want to start considering switching up
some art you just did doing a set of

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:14.380
some art you just did doing a set of
 

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:16.290
some art you just did doing a set of
larger bitmap spring and that's and

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:16.300
larger bitmap spring and that's and
 

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.490
larger bitmap spring and that's and
that's it and that's mostly what they

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:17.500
that's it and that's mostly what they
 

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:19.440
that's it and that's mostly what they
did I mean there but there are some they

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:19.450
did I mean there but there are some they
 

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:20.790
did I mean there but there are some they
didn't bother to do and for the most

00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800
didn't bother to do and for the most
 

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.440
didn't bother to do and for the most
part you don't notice them and I think

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:22.450
part you don't notice them and I think
 

00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:25.290
part you don't notice them and I think
the key thing is be strategic you know

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:25.300
the key thing is be strategic you know
 

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.910
the key thing is be strategic you know
you know you don't actually need to

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920
you know you don't actually need to
 

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.650
you know you don't actually need to
necessarily change every piece of art in

00:49:28.650 --> 00:49:28.660
necessarily change every piece of art in
 

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.150
necessarily change every piece of art in
order to get something feeling like a

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160
order to get something feeling like a
 

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.830
order to get something feeling like a
real tablet app but all of a sudden this

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:31.840
real tablet app but all of a sudden this
 

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.190
real tablet app but all of a sudden this
app which really felt very low

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200
app which really felt very low
 

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.200
app which really felt very low
resolution very outdated all of a sudden

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:37.210
resolution very outdated all of a sudden
 

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.390
resolution very outdated all of a sudden
feels like a modern application and so

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400
feels like a modern application and so
 

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.700
feels like a modern application and so
really does it looks very crisp from

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:41.710
really does it looks very crisp from
 

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.500
really does it looks very crisp from
back here yeah it looks great night I

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:43.510
back here yeah it looks great night I
 

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.270
back here yeah it looks great night I
see what you mean about the backgrounds

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280
see what you mean about the backgrounds
 

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.010
see what you mean about the backgrounds
aren't necessarily the same resolution

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:47.020
aren't necessarily the same resolution
 

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.690
aren't necessarily the same resolution
but I think it's a perfect trade off

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:48.700
but I think it's a perfect trade off
 

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.820
but I think it's a perfect trade off
what they've done is they've taken the

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:50.830
what they've done is they've taken the
 

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.010
what they've done is they've taken the
elements that are relatively small but

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:53.020
elements that are relatively small but
 

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.820
elements that are relatively small but
high frequency and put a lot of effort

00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:56.830
high frequency and put a lot of effort
 

00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:58.740
high frequency and put a lot of effort
into making those sharp and they've

00:49:58.740 --> 00:49:58.750
into making those sharp and they've
 

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.690
into making those sharp and they've
taken the elements that are lower

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:00.700
taken the elements that are lower
 

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.840
taken the elements that are lower
frequency but really really large and

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:03.850
frequency but really really large and
 

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.940
frequency but really really large and
they've kept those at a lower effective

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:05.950
they've kept those at a lower effective
 

00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:07.860
they've kept those at a lower effective
resolution which means they use less

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:07.870
resolution which means they use less
 

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.930
resolution which means they use less
memory without actually disturbing the

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:09.940
memory without actually disturbing the
 

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.850
memory without actually disturbing the
user experience exactly and so you know

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:11.860
user experience exactly and so you know
 

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:14.040
user experience exactly and so you know
that's and I think that so I again I

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.050
that's and I think that so I again I
 

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.450
that's and I think that so I again I
part of reason I want to highlight this

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:15.460
part of reason I want to highlight this
 

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.010
part of reason I want to highlight this
was because I really like the trade off

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:17.020
was because I really like the trade off
 

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.240
was because I really like the trade off
so they made I think they think they

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:18.250
so they made I think they think they
 

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.130
so they made I think they think they
need to made some very smart decisions I

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:20.140
need to made some very smart decisions I
 

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:21.870
need to made some very smart decisions I
will say the only thing that left that I

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880
will say the only thing that left that I
 

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.700
will say the only thing that left that I
really really don't like about this game

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:23.710
really really don't like about this game
 

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:25.470
really really don't like about this game
is their iconic we can go you can see

00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:25.480
is their iconic we can go you can see
 

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.360
is their iconic we can go you can see
that I kind of paint screen it just

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:27.370
that I kind of paint screen it just
 

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:29.820
that I kind of paint screen it just
makes me sad yeah because Android icons

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:29.830
makes me sad yeah because Android icons
 

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:32.430
makes me sad yeah because Android icons
are not supposed to be you know rounded

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440
are not supposed to be you know rounded
 

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.200
are not supposed to be you know rounded
cornered thing let's talk about all of

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:34.210
cornered thing let's talk about all of
 

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.300
cornered thing let's talk about all of
these icons because every single one of

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:36.310
these icons because every single one of
 

00:50:36.310 --> 00:50:38.040
these icons because every single one of
them makes me sad they're all let's just

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:38.050
them makes me sad they're all let's just
 

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:39.420
them makes me sad they're all let's just
talk about how each of them could be

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:39.430
talk about how each of them could be
 

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:42.000
talk about how each of them could be
better dead trigger does not need a

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.010
better dead trigger does not need a
 

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.190
better dead trigger does not need a
rounded rectangle around you no reason

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200
rounded rectangle around you no reason
 

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:47.730
rounded rectangle around you no reason
why not just put LMK you know an outline

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:47.740
why not just put LMK you know an outline
 

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.040
why not just put LMK you know an outline
around the letters yeah it'd be so cool

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:50.050
around the letters yeah it'd be so cool
 

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.690
around the letters yeah it'd be so cool
of it what's gonna have yeah cool like

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:51.700
of it what's gonna have yeah cool like
 

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.060
of it what's gonna have yeah cool like
glowing outline in the back of red and

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:54.070
glowing outline in the back of red and
 

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:57.570
glowing outline in the back of red and
the next one crossers yeah say the same

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:57.580
the next one crossers yeah say the same
 

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.110
the next one crossers yeah say the same
basic deal I why not just a pickaxe in

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.120
basic deal I why not just a pickaxe in
 

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.030
basic deal I why not just a pickaxe in
Flint why does it have to have a

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040
Flint why does it have to have a
 

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:06.210
Flint why does it have to have a
background yeah the next one is well
