00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's see. Let's try mg.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If we replace F with mg, then we get mg = ma.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, that's easy. The m's just cancel.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The mass of the object, it turns out, doesn't matter at all.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Isn't that a beautiful cancellation?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Disproving Aristotle with a simple mathematical cancellation.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
g = a, which is exactly what we wanted to find, so this force must be equal to m  g.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We give this force the subscript g to remind us that the cause of this downward force

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is gravity, and the acceleration due to gravity is this 10 m/sÂ².

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We can see that no matter what your mass is,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we can see that regardless of your mass,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the mass cancels out.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Acceleration on earth will always be equal to g--pretty amazing.
