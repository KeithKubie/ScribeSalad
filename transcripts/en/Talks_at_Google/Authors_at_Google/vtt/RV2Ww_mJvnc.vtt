00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.590
MALE SPEAKER: We're
here with Josh Weltman.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.300
So Josh is a 25-year veteran
of the advertising business,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.200
a working creative director,
a co-producer, a writer,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.210
and an artist.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.210
He's a real-life "Mad Men."

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.470
He's created commercials
and ad campaigns

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.520
for Taco Bell, Doritos, Carls
Jr., BMW, Earthlink, Microsoft,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.700
Whole Foods, Green
Burrito, and Cuties.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.110
He's authored everything from
online guerrilla marketing

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.090
efforts for small clients
to national campaigns

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.370
for global automotive
companies like Kia Motors.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.150
Josh has been part of "Mad
Men" since its first season.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.030
He worked closely with Matt
Weiner and the show's writers

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.110
and producers to ensure that
"Mad Men" accurately depicted

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.650
the process of creating
ads and servicing clients.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.960
He also created most of the
original ads seen in the show.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.090
Josh's first book,
"Seducing Strangers:

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.300
The Little Black Book
of Advertising Secrets"

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.856
is a great read.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.230
We have them here
for sale today,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.150
and we're going to be talking
about that for the first part

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.880
of interview.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.630
We'll talk about the
show for a little bit

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.004
and then turn it
over to you guys

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:05.099
for all your
wonderful questions.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.010
So here we go.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.340
JOSH WELTMAN: All right.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.370
MALE SPEAKER: I'm going to
begin with the question, OK?

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.270
The biggest one.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.510
It's all downhill from here.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.060
JOSH WELTMAN: How
does it end, right?

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.739
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:15.280
JOSH WELTMAN: How
does "Mad Men" end?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.720
MALE SPEAKER: That's a good one.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.011
JOSH WELTMAN: I can't tell you.

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.060
MALE SPEAKER: Trying to
do no spoilers today.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.904
What is happiness?

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:21.820
We talk about it with
each other all the time.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.960
We ask ourselves the question.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.120
I'm sitting here with an ad man.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.750
What is happiness?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.550
JOSH WELTMAN: I think
happiness-- let's see,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.216
I wrote it down.

00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:32.280
Happiness is when reality
meets or exceeds expectations.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.856
That's what I
think happiness is.

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:34.856
MALE SPEAKER: That's it.

00:01:34.856 --> 00:01:38.040
JOSH WELTMAN: I think
that's pretty good.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.810
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.190
Does it matter what we
have or what we don't have

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.840
in terms of happiness, or--

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.520
JOSH WELTMAN: I don't think
what we have or don't have makes

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.600
as big a difference as what
we have or don't have-- well,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.620
of course, after
basic needs are met,

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.120
what makes a lot of difference
is what we have or don't have

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.150
vis a vis what we
expect to have.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.979
That sort of thing.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.722
I think people-- I think
that's what makes people happy.

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:14.430
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
So as a marketer, how
you go actually go about,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.530
I guess, managing expectations,
setting expectations?

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.960
What's that process like?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.340
JOSH WELTMAN: Well, I think that
the process from an advertising

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.280
point of view is to
try and figure out

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.540
what it is your
prospect wants, and then

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.400
figure out how your products
can deliver on that.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.780
You know, what do they
expect from their life?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.530
What do they expect from
the things they buy?

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.850
What do they expect from an
experience with your company

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.970
or brand?

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.720
And then figure out if your
products and services are

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.660
in line with your
customers' expectations,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.280
and what needs to
change to bring them

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.420
into alignment, either their
expectations or your products

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.320
and services.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.028
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:13.970
So is that a-- is that an
explicit thing that gets

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.866
discussed around the table?

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:17.990
You know, like we need to
set people's expectations

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.490
different?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.415
Or is it more of a subtle
skill that really great ad men,

00:03:21.415 --> 00:03:23.000
ad women have?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.580
JOSH WELTMAN: I think
that's most of the meetings

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.440
that I attended were about.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.580
I remember one campaign that
is actually still running.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.650
I worked on it
maybe 15 years ago.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.480
It was a campaign for
hamburgers called Carl's Jr.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.680
And at the time, when we
first picked up the project,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.570
the burgers were known
as big sloppy messes that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.520
were as close to a mistake
as you could ever receive

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.930
from a drive-through window.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.920
I mean, there was stuff
coming out of them,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.210
and lettuce and
things like that.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.550
And they were kind
of a disaster.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.110
And then we went in and talked
to focus groups about what

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.240
people wanted from a hamburger.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.820
And we were talking
specifically to 18-

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.444
to 34-year-old men who had
between $4.00 and $6.00

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:21.610
to spend at lunch every day.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:28.990
And they tended to be working
people, and hungry people,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.140
and every one of them, every one
of these groups that we taped,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.630
these guys would
be sitting around,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.990
and they'd start talking
about the burger that

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.730
made them happy.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.310
And they'd be making this
gesture, like, they'd

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.270
turn into these animals.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.530
And they'd talk about it's
drippy, it's like bloody

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.000
and stuff like that.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.040
And when we took the
tape to the client,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.720
we turned the sound off
because we said, you know,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.930
you're creating these ads
now that talk about how clean

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.860
the restaurant is and how
decent the ingredients are.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.080
And you're trying to
satisfy that animal

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.570
that you see on the screen
that's doing-- this caveman

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.570
kind of guy.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.297
And we said, we're not
gong to change the product.

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:19.880
That thing that we've
been delivering,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.190
that messy in the
bag, they want that.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.790
What we're going to do is we're
going to start promising that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.770
to them, because
what was out of whack

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.020
was the customer's desire was
not in line with the promise

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.335
that the company was
making about their product.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.210
They had the product.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.880
They had exactly
what they wanted,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.030
this big, messy, drippy thing.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.600
And so instead of
changing it, we

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.420
recognized we started speaking
the language of the people who

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.990
were hungry.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.130
MALE SPEAKER: Made them
happy in the process.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.296
JOSH WELTMAN: Made them
really happy in the process,

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:54.970
made the company
over in the process,

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.125
made the owners of the
company really happy.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:00.220
A lot of people got happy.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.600
MALE SPEAKER: That's good stuff.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.640
You're in the business
of making people happy.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.280
I like it.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.380
All right, another big
definition question.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.150
The book is called
"Seducing Strangers."

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.900
JOSH WELTMAN: Yes.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.233
MALE SPEAKER: What is seduction?

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.590
JOSH WELTMAN: I think
seduction is figuring out

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.880
what people want to
hear about themselves

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.230
and telling them just
that, that you figure out

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.810
what people are itching for,
and basically you scratch it.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:25.854
That's seducing.

00:06:25.854 --> 00:06:28.020
MALE SPEAKER: Telling people
what they want to hear.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.410
JOSH WELTMAN: Telling people
what they want to hear.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.000
If you want to
know how to seduce,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.551
I think that's how you do it.

00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:34.550
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.180
How does this apply
in advertising?

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.721
How does this work
in the real world?

00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:41.740
JOSH WELTMAN: I
don't particularly

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.750
know how it works
in the real world.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.900
I'm not good at it one on one.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.630
I'm very bad at it one
on one, because I'm not

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.070
the type of person
that's willing to change

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.940
who I am to be satisfying or
to make other people happy,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.040
personally.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.980
But I seem to have a really
good talent for figuring out

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.580
what large groups of people
want to hear about themselves

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.890
and being able to tell stories
that they can see themselves

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.310
in, that satisfy them.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.680
So it depends on what
part of the real world

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.610
you're talking about.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.130
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
talk about advertising.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.630
We talked about
making people happy.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.272
Now we're talking about
affirming people as they are.

00:07:25.272 --> 00:07:26.980
Can you talk about an
ad you've worked on

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.700
or a story in advertising
that reflects that?

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.650
JOSH WELTMAN: That
affirms what people--

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.100
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, you're saying

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.850
seduction is telling people
what they want to hear.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.650
How to ads do that,
is my question.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.980
JOSH WELTMAN: Well--

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.720
MALE SPEAKER: Or I could have
a salad, is what I'm saying.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.580
JOSH WELTMAN: Well,
that's actually a good one

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.038
to talk about, because that
one worked counter intuitively.

00:07:45.038 --> 00:07:47.810
I worked on a product-- I
don't know if anyone's ever

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.150
been to Green Burrito.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.710
It was really not
ready to be advertised.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.410
But contractually, we had to.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.530
And it's a long story.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.680
So a bunch of us from the agency
went to try out the product.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.300
And it was a sort of a fast
food Mexican type thing.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.190
And we went there and were
completely disappointed.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.570
A lot of things were
made using a microwave,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.570
and this sort of thing.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.350
And at the time we said, take
your million-dollar ad budget

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.530
and work on your menu.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.140
Get it ready to-- because
there's an old advertising

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:32.260
adage, nothing will kill a
bad product quicker than good

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:32.870
advertising.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.870
You make people come in.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.411
They try it, they'll
be disappointed,

00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:37.370
you'll never see them again.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.820
But the client was
insisting that they

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.070
wanted to spend their
million dollars, which

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:47.560
was about 1/14th of what
the other big Mexican food

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.050
player in the market
was spending annually,

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.679
so they were outspent 14 to one.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:54.220
They didn't have a
very good product.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.620
But still they said, can
you do something for us?

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.030
We really want to advertise.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.920
OK.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.670
We came up with a little singing
green dot in a black field.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:13.350
And the little dot
would say things like,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.230
if it's green it's good.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.150
If it's bluish green,
you're going to need shots.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.440
And then it would cut to the
logo and say, Green Burrito.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.070
If it's green, it's good.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.300
And one of the
other ads, I think,

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.440
said, if you get guacamole on
a green burrito, it's good.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.430
If you get guacamole on your
lip, it looks like boogers.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.360
Green burrito.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.330
It's good.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.760
So anyhow, what
we did was we said

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:50.220
that the food is so bad that
by talking about gangrene

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:57.050
and boogers we could lower
expectations to a level

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:02.730
that your products may be
able to meet or exceed.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.280
And that was the only
thing that we could really

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.780
recommend the client
do in good conscience.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.950
And we did, and they did it.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.790
And it kind of worked.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.380
Not a lot of people went to
the restaurant for that year,

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.080
but they all knew the
little talking dot.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.109
They were very-- you know,
the audience knew that.

00:10:22.109 --> 00:10:23.900
As a matter of fact,
I think after spending

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.840
a million dollars
that year, the company

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.260
had achieved parity awareness
with the other company,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.900
the competitor that was
spending $14 million.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.440
So we had achieved awareness.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.540
We hadn't set anybody's
expectations really high.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.010
And we solved the problem.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.110
But that's sort of a
counter intuitive, lower

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.112
the bar kind of success story.

00:10:47.112 --> 00:10:49.320
MALE SPEAKER: Look, the
question was about seduction.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.220
The takeaway about
seduction is gangrene--

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.140
JOSH WELTMAN: Being seduced
with gangrene and boogers.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.130
MALE SPEAKER:
Gangrene and boogers.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.690
OK.

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:55.570
Seduction.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.140
JOSH WELTMAN: Seduction.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.560
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.300
So I want to talk
a little bit just

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.350
about some of the specifics in
the book. f A couple of quotes

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.380
from the book.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.570
"Advertising is not about
changing the audience's beliefs

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.380
or the things that drive them.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.650
It's about confirming them.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:12.900
Nobody needs to lie about
how rewarding a product is

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.140
or isn't.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.730
You just need to
remind people who

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.100
feel they deserve a reward
that they're absolute right

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:18.850
to feel this way."

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:20.512
And then my favorite,
"It's mostly

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:22.970
about persuading people to do
a little more of what they're

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.640
already doing.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.320
The money is in telling
people they're right,

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.320
and to keep doing what
they're doing, preferably

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.990
with your particular brand,
product, or service in mind."

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:36.090
So I think the obvious
question there,

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.190
what if what people think, do,
feel, and believe is wrong,

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.610
or it's harmful to them?

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.890
How do you respond to
questions about, I guess,

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.250
the moral compass
you have when you

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.440
are trying to get people to do
something one way or another?

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.470
JOSH WELTMAN: Let's see.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.970
OK.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.845
Let's just go with the
one we've been talking

00:11:53.845 --> 00:11:56.280
about for the last 20 minutes,
which is getting people

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.690
to eat hamburgers
and bad Mexican food,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.360
which I spent a lot
of my career doing.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.380
What we talked about
before is, most of the time

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.540
I'm not the dumbest
person in the room.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.590
Sometimes, a lot
of the times, I'm

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.080
not the smartest
person in the room.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.420
But I do know when
lunchtime comes around,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.200
I like to choose what
I want to choose.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.620
I don't particularly feel like
the smartest person in the room

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:32.260
should be choosing what they
think I should eat for lunch.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.010
I think what I said when
we were talking beforehand

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:44.050
is, I understand why society
has laws that protect people

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:48.890
from products that are
dangerous to society

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.290
under the best of circumstances.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:57.300
But I don't particularly think
we need laws or regulations

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:05.880
that protect individuals
from risky products,

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.370
products that are risky under
the worst circumstances.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.390
I think that's what being an
individual is about evaluating.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:18.020
So I don't think it's
about lying or deceiving.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.900
I think it's the difference
between products or things

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.920
that are always
dangerous to everybody

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:31.251
versus things that can sometimes
be dangerous to individuals.

00:13:31.251 --> 00:13:33.500
I think those things have
to be looked at differently.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.970
Does that answer the question?

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.640
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I think it does.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.140
OK.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.684
Very good.

00:13:36.684 --> 00:13:39.100
Just one or two more questions
about advertising before we

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.933
talk about the show.

00:13:39.933 --> 00:13:41.196
What are emthymemes?

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.070
That was interesting.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.106
And how does it work with
our dopamine, our adrenaline?

00:13:45.106 --> 00:13:46.730
I'd be curious to
hear more about that.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:49.063
JOSH WELTMAN: There's a section
in the book where I talk

00:13:49.063 --> 00:13:50.500
about a thing called enthymeme.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.460
And an enthymene is a thing
that Aristotle refers to

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.760
in a book called "Rhetoric."

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.500
And it's basically--
the translation

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.960
is "within the mind."

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.540
And when I was about 25,
I was reading this book

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.670
while taking my first
class in advertising

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:15.740
and learning how to come up with
concepts that were intriguing

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.100
and arresting to people.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.820
And I came across
this line that said,

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.770
when using this enthymeme
technique to try and engage

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.320
somebody, here's how it works.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.840
The first part of
the phrase confuses--

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.740
if the first part of the phrase
confuses, the second part

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.580
explains.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.210
If the first part explains,
the second part confuses.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.050
And this discord, people
trying to figure this out,

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.300
is what engages their mind
in a speaker's argument.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.760
And the example
I use in the book

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.700
is that Samuel Johnson
could have said,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.700
there are a lot of things
to do or see in London.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.340
But what he said was, when
a man is tired of London,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.260
he's tired of life.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.860
And the first part sort of
confuses, and the second part

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.890
explains.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.620
And you're engaged as you
go through the beginning

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.420
of this thing to the
end of the thing.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.270
And I think that modern
advertising sort of

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:17.040
started in the mid
'60s when someone

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.100
discovered that if
the picture confuses,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.860
the headline explains.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.600
And if the headline confuses,
the picture explains.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.960
And using images and words
together in this fashion

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.870
is sort of a modern
enthymeme to engage people

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:39.340
in an image that was used
to stop them from flipping

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:42.580
through a magazine, get them
interested in a television

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.260
commercial, make them stare
at a poster on the street.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.550
But this technique has been
being used for the last 40

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:51.259
years to engage people's heads.

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:52.550
MALE SPEAKER: It's interesting.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.630
We were talking about
the way Aristotle

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.550
mentions it's rhetoric.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.694
This enthymeme gets you
to listen to a speaker

00:15:58.694 --> 00:16:00.860
or to get more tuned into
what the speaker's saying.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.490
I was thinking about a magazine.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.700
Endless pages, you're
flipping, you're

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.400
seeing a lot of
stuff you expect,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.790
articles, images, words
trying to sell things to you.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.000
And I remember a classic
ad I think they referred to

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.880
in the show is a Volkswagen
ad for, I think, the Beetle.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.440
It's a tiny little car
on this big white page.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.160
The ad itself is very small.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.430
It's a lot of wasted space.

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.314
And I think the tagline
is, think small.

00:16:26.314 --> 00:16:27.730
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.235
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:28.235 --> 00:16:29.730
MALE SPEAKER: It confuses
you, catches your attention.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.310
JOSH WELTMAN: Imagine, we
talked about on the show.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.980
You're flipping through
this magazine circa 1961,

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.030
and you come across this
big, empty white page

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.130
with a little teeny car.

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.930
And your head is
going, what is this?

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.670
This is not-- this
should not be here.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.300
This is confusing.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.730
What are they trying to say?

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.500
Is this a mistake?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.080
Where's the rest of the
stuff that goes on the page?

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.420
Oh, think small.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.270
I get it.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.200
I'm engaged.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.180
I see that they're
trying to say that it's

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:06.650
about being different, or being
unexpected, or being unique,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.349
or whatever that is.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.109
But for that
fraction of a second,

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:17.810
when somebody's trying to
resolve that confusion,

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:23.170
you have an opportunity as a
seller of goods and services

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.940
to engage them in a discussion.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.464
They're open because they're
trying to figure something out.

00:17:29.464 --> 00:17:31.880
MALE SPEAKER: I think you
also-- last thing on this point.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.152
You mentioned adrenaline
and dopamine specifically

00:17:34.152 --> 00:17:35.360
get released in this process.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.401
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah, sure.

00:17:36.401 --> 00:17:37.860
I mean, what your head is doing.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.400
I don't know, but I've read
articles like everybody else.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.470
I'm not doctor, but--
when you're confused,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.692
it's that fight or flight.

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:45.400
You know, you're trying
to figure it out.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.350
And then when the tumblers
fall in your mind,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.850
you feel that reward.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.020
I've felt it trying
to come up with ideas.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.760
I know when I've
solved the puzzle

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.870
and what that feels like.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.130
And I think that
it's the combination

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.220
of chemicals that make you
feel that way going off

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.650
in your head.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.930
That's the reason that an
enthymeme, literally translated

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.630
from Greek, means "in
your mind," you know.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.990
It's happening in your head.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.310
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
talk about "Mad Men."

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.030
So for those of you
watching on YouTube,

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.790
we took a quick look at a clip.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.511
I think it's Episode 13,
Season 1, "The Carousel."

00:18:22.511 --> 00:18:23.510
Feel free to look it up.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:25.710
We're going to talk
about that a little bit.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:27.460
I'd love to know-- I'm
sure a lot of folks

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.190
here too as well-- how
were these pitches created

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.795
for the show?

00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:31.670
What was the process?

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.459
Could you walk us through that?

00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:35.750
JOSH WELTMAN: One of the
things Matt Weiner-- if you're

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.030
familiar with the show, Matt
Weiner is the showrunner.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:39.630
The person who
invented "Mad Men"

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.780
is a stickler for accuracy.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:48.010
And early on we were friends--
or we're still friends,

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.839
but we were just friends before
he had a show on television.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:52.380
And he was talking
about advertising,

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:58.590
and we said, to be accurate
about creating ads,

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.240
ads are created in the agency
environment, at that time

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.090
a team of an art
director working

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.810
with a writer, the
pictures and the words

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.550
working together to come
up with a concept the way I

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.310
was just describing.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.830
Typically, shows based
in the advertising world,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.060
or movies based in
the advertising world,

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.580
before "Mad Men," a writer
would write the script

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.920
and they'd march the script
down to the art department,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.670
and the art department
would make up the ad the way

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.490
they make up any other prop.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:29.510
And that's how you
got advertising.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.610
And Matt recognized
that we would probably

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.600
get more accurate ads if the
writer's room began working

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.990
the way real agencies did.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.820
And I'm an art
director by background,

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.360
and he brought me
in one day a week

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.800
to work on the business
stories and the concept

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.530
for ads with the writers
as they happened.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.332
And that's how--

00:19:49.332 --> 00:19:51.290
MALE SPEAKER: Could you
walk us through, maybe,

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.310
how "The Carousel" came about?

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.070
JOSH WELTMAN: At
the end of Season 1,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.690
the main character,
Don Draper, has

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.230
had-- his marriage
is breaking up,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.640
his business is falling
apart, his brother

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.240
has just committed suicide.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.650
And Matt said, we need a
business story or a product

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:14.250
that explains, lets
the audience see

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.040
what Don is feeling
about his marriage,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.330
his business, his
brother's suicide.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:23.459
And that's sort of
a tough-- I'm not

00:20:23.459 --> 00:20:25.250
sure there are a lot
of products like that.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.960
But one of the
things that I used

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.814
to do before going
into the writer's room

00:20:29.814 --> 00:20:31.230
to work with the
writers and stuff

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:38.460
is, I would leaf through the
PDFs of "The New York Times"

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.572
advertising section of the
week that the story on the show

00:20:42.572 --> 00:20:43.280
was taking place.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.660
And so I'd go-- it
was October of 1961.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.760
I'd read the advertising
column in "The New York Times."

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:57.250
And I noticed that Kodak was
working on a slide projector,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.830
or there was something,
and I checked and saw

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.170
that it came out the next year.

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:02.580
It was called the carousel.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.600
I figured whatever they were
doing at the time in real life

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.310
was probably happening
about that time,

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.330
with a year kind of thing.

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:19.350
And I remember my father--
in the '60s, cameras and film

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.890
and Super 8 cameras
and hi-fi equipment.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.900
They were the high tech
gadgets of their time.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.670
And these guys like Don
Draper spent a lot of time

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:36.020
with photographic equipment,
single lens reflex cameras,

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.460
all that sort of thing.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.330
And I thought maybe he
did what my dad did,

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.730
which is have a bunch of
slides of trips in the closet,

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.670
and sort through them.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.070
And if we could use
some of his slides

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.630
from his life in
a pitch, we could

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.460
understand what he was
feeling about his business,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:59.440
his marriage, his
life in general.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.980
And so that's what
we brought in.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.030
We probably could have
done the same thing

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.660
if the product had been a Super
8 movie camera or something

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.950
like that, anything
where he could've

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:13.240
used his own images in the
sales pitch to the client.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.227
But the slide projector
worked really well.

00:22:16.227 --> 00:22:18.310
MALE SPEAKER: So one of
the tag lines for the show

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.020
is "Where the truth lies."

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.300
And you write that the main
insight into Don's character,

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.960
and the most important
conceit of the show,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.350
is that Don Draper can lie
anywhere except in advertising.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.860
And why is that?

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.810
JOSH WELTMAN: He's lying to his
wife, he's lying to his kids,

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:36.960
he's lying to his partner--
he lies to everybody,

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.490
he lies to himself.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.710
But it was very
important to Matt Weiner

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:47.830
that Don, as the main
character, be good at his job.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.570
He thought that
the audience needed

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.370
him to be good at
something, to respect him

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.677
on some level, or else all this
other stuff that he was doing,

00:22:56.677 --> 00:22:58.010
that no one would stick with it.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.550
It was just too dark.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:04.710
And so I felt that
what we were looking at

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.620
was a guy who
could lie anywhere,

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.980
except in the advertising.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:15.440
In the advertising, he's basing
his work on truthful insights

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.990
that he has into people.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:23.040
He obviously understands what
makes people tick very well,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:26.060
or he couldn't write good ads.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.950
And that makes his own
kind of internal struggle

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.700
to understand what's motivating
him, and what makes him tick,

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.160
even more poignant.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.880
MALE SPEAKER: So I wonder, are
there Don Drapers out there?

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.790
Were there, are
there people who just

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.592
walk into a pitch
like that and just--

00:23:44.592 --> 00:23:45.550
JOSH WELTMAN: And kill?

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.190
Yeah, sure.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.410
Not as often and
consistently as a guy

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.190
who's working in
front of clients,

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.420
who will do exactly what
12 smart writers tell

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.530
the clients to do.

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:02.510
But yeah, he's kind
of based on an amalgam

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.910
of people who are really
good salesmen, who

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.400
understand how people tick.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.844
MALE SPEAKER: He's a composite.

00:24:07.844 --> 00:24:09.010
JOSH WELTMAN: Oh sure, yeah.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.360
I mean, there's 30
different writers

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360
working in the writers'
room since the beginning

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.859
of the show.

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:18.690
They all bring different
experiences to Don.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:24.720
And there's all sorts of
different stories about ad men

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:28.447
that me and Bob Levinson, the
other advertising consultant,

00:24:28.447 --> 00:24:29.530
would bring into the room.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.800
There's all sorts of books about
different advertising people

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.320
that all the writers
were expected to read.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.350
Matt had done
extensive research.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:43.770
People knew what good
salesmen were like.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:47.720
And we just took whatever
worked and created,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:52.430
like, Frankenstein,
the ultimate ad guy,

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.860
bits and pieces from everywhere.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.780
MALE SPEAKER: So one
of my favorite comments

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.470
about the show-- I think it was
the week of the last episode--

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.420
so Matt Weiner was
being interviewed,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:08.860
and he said that the show "Mad
Men" is about what people want,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.190
what they can get, and how
happiness lies somewhere

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:12.770
in between.

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.600
And it reminded me of what you
talked about happiness being,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.560
as this different
expectation reality.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.840
Could you talk about that
in relation to the show?

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.298
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah, I think
that's what the story is about.

00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:24.630
I think it's about trying to
bridge that gap between a man's

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.050
expectations and his reality.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:31.300
And every story is
the story of how

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.710
someone got something,
or didn't get something

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.272
that they desired.

00:25:36.272 --> 00:25:37.980
And that's what we're
watching, or that's

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.650
what we watched, over the course
of eight seasons of "Mad Men."

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.040
How does he get the
life he thinks he wants?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.560
Or how does he get what
makes him feel happy?

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.560
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I've
got questions for days,

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.351
but I'd love to take
some from the audience

00:25:52.351 --> 00:25:54.180
if you guys are curious at all.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.729
There's Mike, right
in the middle.

00:25:55.729 --> 00:25:56.520
MIKE: I'll ask one.

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.810
So my question is, would you
see advertising in utopia?

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:05.760
And so going back to that
expectation around advertising,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.000
could we see the explosion
of ways of advertising

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.052
as a barometer for getting
farther from utopia?

00:26:13.052 --> 00:26:13.760
JOSH WELTMAN: OK.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.870
Would there be
advertising in utopia?

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.042
You mean, where everybody's
happy, do we need--

00:26:19.042 --> 00:26:20.250
MIKE: There's no expectation.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.240
JOSH WELTMAN: There's no
expect-- I don't know.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.282
It's a tough one.

00:26:25.282 --> 00:26:26.740
I was thinking
about that, kind of,

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.730
when I saw
"Tomorrowland" come out,

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.660
because I think that what's
missing a lot from people's

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:41.730
lives today are basically
somebody's vision of where

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.710
we should be heading.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:50.140
It sounds cute that, when you
think of Walt Disney building

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.140
Tomorrowland, and
when I was little,

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.490
how you'd go to the
Monsanto exhibit

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.600
of the kitchen of tomorrow
and all that sort of stuff.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.070
And it was kind of
funky, but it made

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.490
you feel good that we
were heading somewhere,

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.510
you know, that those
expectations were--

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:10.980
they may be right, they may be
wrong, they may be whatever.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.810
But they were shared
by so many people.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.980
And we had this
idea that we were

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:18.430
all kind of heading
towards this one direction.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:23.120
And I think that people's
vision of the future,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.475
and their expectation
is so fragmented,

00:27:25.475 --> 00:27:28.120
it doesn't feel like
there's any one person

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.350
or group of visionary
thinkers who are saying,

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:37.410
yeah, maybe let's get together
for the World's Fair of 2018

00:27:37.410 --> 00:27:40.610
and lay out where we're going.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:42.930
So I don't know if that
answers the question or not.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.520
But yeah, I think you
really do need expectations.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.770
And I think the angst going
on today, or part of it,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.840
is that people don't
know where we're heading.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when
you talk about Don Draper

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.510
as a profile of an ideal
"Mad Men" in his time, two

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.880
questions.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.950
How did you put
yourself in that era?

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.510
Was there much of an adjustment?

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.160
And secondly, what is
the profile of today,

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.810
and how might be different?

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.951
Do we value different things
than a successful advertising

00:28:15.951 --> 00:28:16.450
person?

00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.930
JOSH WELTMAN: In a persuader?

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.300
I don't even think we
call them successful

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.140
advertising people anymore.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:30.270
You know, because
advertising is sort of

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.290
in such a state of
transition and flux,

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.970
it's hard to think of what
makes advertising successful

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:39.670
nowadays.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.470
And it's hard to
think of someone

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:43.430
who feels successful doing it.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:48.010
I had a friend say, maybe six
months ago-- a seasoned ad

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:55.500
person, a very good writer
and good at his job--

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.240
and he was talking and
lamenting the place

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.550
that he worked spends a
lot of time sort of talking

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.590
about creating
experiences rather

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.010
than tools of persuasion.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:13.290
And he said, we used to
make tools for clients,

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:15.350
and now we make toys.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.820
We used to really
think about what

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:22.890
the messages that
we were making,

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.460
what they were
supposed to do, what

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:25.970
the payoff was supposed to be.

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.210
I talk a lot about
that in the book,

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.850
because with each of those
four different types of ads,

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.750
there's a different
metric involved.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.690
And you knew what you
were trying to do,

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.290
and you knew if you
were making progress.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.760
Yeah that one, I
really didn't think

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:53.690
things had changed a lot between
when I was working even 2010.

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:58.190
And I'll tell you the big moment
that was really different.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.930
I remember in 1989, when the
big advertising conglomerate

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.500
that I was working for
sent out a memo that

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.850
said they were no longer going
to expense liquor at lunch.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.390
And one of the old
copywriters, really

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.830
genius guy who'd been doing
it for a long, long time,

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.740
came and sat down in my office.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.860
And I was the young
20-something guy,

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.520
and he was-- really
had been doing it

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.000
since like the '40s or '50s
at least, but just a genius.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.670
And he says, that's it.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.630
That's the end of this.

00:30:36.249 --> 00:30:37.790
I'll tell you how
he meant it, but he

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:46.880
said, what kind of person
would approve this stuff sober,

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.690
you know?

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.400
And he didn't mean that the
account guys were getting

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.730
the clients drunk at lunch
to try and pull something

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.100
over on them.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.910
But he was trying to
say, look, when you're

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.390
trying to do something edgy
or exciting or engaging,

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.480
or something that
can't be rationalized

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.530
in a cost-benefit
type of way, you've

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.030
got to make these
guys brave, you know?

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.810
And that's what the liquor did.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:20.450
And after that, people
were much more tentative,

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:27.430
and sort of-- I never I heard
the phrase "risk averse"

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.305
until they said they weren't
going to expense liquor

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:31.940
at lunch.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.920
I'll just put it that way.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.580
Yeah.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:35.050
JOHN: How you doing?

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.591
I'm John.

00:31:35.591 --> 00:31:37.090
I'm from the YouTube
marketing team.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.780
And I gotta say, "Mad Men" is
as much a case study for us,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.250
in some respects, as it
is like an episodic thing.

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:47.110
We talk about it a lot at work,
and a lot of fans at YouTube

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.910
and I know Google wide.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.670
My question was, I was
hoping you could help me

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.860
kind of sort through a
moral dilemma I sometimes

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:55.850
think about when it
comes to marketing.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.750
And I talk about
this with friends

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.530
who are on the agency side
and go through this as well.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:03.820
And I wonder, what do
you think about how

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.660
advertising and
the need for it had

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:08.730
led to materialism and
consumerism in the world today?

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.580
Like I feel like a lot
of us tend to buy things

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.850
that maybe we don't need.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.180
And being in marketing and
having friends in advertising,

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:18.390
sometimes we think about,
are we pushing messages

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.500
that we don't believe in?

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:22.040
Are we selling products that
maybe people don't need?

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.080
And--

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.320
JOSH WELTMAN: No, I
know what you're asking.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.080
MALE SPEAKER: You should
tell the Taco Bell story

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.413
while you're trying to say that.

00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:29.830
JOSH WELTMAN: No, the first day
that I went into the writers'

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.439
room on "Mad Men,"
I remember I brought

00:32:33.439 --> 00:32:34.480
in three pieces of paper.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.420
They're now hanging
in the Museum

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.960
of Moving Images in New York
with the set-- or not the set,

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.280
the whole writers' room has
moved there-- but on one

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.500
of them it said, "Scary.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:54.590
There are big corporations out
there that are-- what was it?

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.300
It's scary.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.060
There are big
corporations out there

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:02.890
who are controlling what
you think and what you feel

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:07.390
and making you buy things
that leave you broke

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.930
and feeling empty.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.760
And then it said, scarier.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.550
There are no big
corporations out

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.310
there controlling
what you think, feel,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.360
and making you buy things
that leave you broke

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.500
and feeling empty, that
it's kind of in your head.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:29.320
I think that people
believe that they can make

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.850
their life better, you know.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:33.510
I don't think I put
that belief there.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:35.640
I don't think you put
that belief there.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.030
I think that's the
human condition, that we

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:41.570
believe things can be better.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.430
I think that the problem
is that we think things

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.770
that we buy-- we think
that better can be bought.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.260
And usually, it can't be.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.140
You gotta sort of
look at who you are

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.140
and what you're asking
for and those sort

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.080
of things kind of thing.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.470
So I don't think that the
desire to make your life better

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.400
is something that's instilled--
that's caused consumerism.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.820
I think that what causes
consumerism is thinking

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:13.659
that stuff that you can consume
will make you feel better

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:14.870
about life.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:21.832
And that's not what-- the
advertisers aren't planting

00:34:21.832 --> 00:34:22.790
that thought in people.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.429
There's a lot of reasons that
I think that that exists.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:31.750
And it's about people finding
what truly makes them happy,

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:37.070
and not the stuff
that's being advertised,

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.380
or how it will make them happy.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.690
JOHN: I'm just curious
as, like, a follow up.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.340
Do you why, or do
you have a thought

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.290
as to why consumerism is higher
today than it was before?

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.370
JOSH WELTMAN: I mean,
consumerism of some things

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.380
are-- what specifically?

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.530
Because I don't know-- I think
there's more people with-- you

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.170
know, like when I
was coming up, China

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:03.090
was not consuming the same sort
of things that they are now.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:05.550
But I know the stuff
that they were consuming

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:07.700
wasn't making them
particularly happy.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.310
They wanted to
have what you have.

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.910
They wanted cars and
city life and choices,

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:18.480
and the supermarket
and stuff like that.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.000
So they think they're
consuming stuff

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.201
for the same reason you do.

00:35:22.201 --> 00:35:23.950
They think this stuff
will make you happy.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.990
Maybe it will,
maybe-- I don't know.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.850
The more dissatisfied
with the stuff

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:36.304
we got, we try and improve it
and get new stuff, I think.

00:35:36.304 --> 00:35:36.970
JOHN: Thank you.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.160
JOSH WELTMAN: Sure.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.160
AUDIENCE: So storytelling
is very in vogue today

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.370
in business and speaking.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.610
Can you take us to where your
vision is on storytelling

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.470
the next 10 years?

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:49.845
What should we be
thinking about?

00:35:49.845 --> 00:35:52.450
Or is it really the same
from Don Draper's time today

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.870
and tomorrow?

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.670
JOSH WELTMAN: I think that
a lot of the difference

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:00.100
between the industrial economy
and the knowledge economy

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:04.450
is that in the industrial
economy, managers that

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.760
could manage things that could
be measured, like time, space,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.890
and energy, were
really the ones that

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:19.830
made a huge difference
in the price of goods

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.200
and the profitability
of companies.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.450
Then in the information
economy, there's

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.600
sort of good services
and ideas that can't

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.290
be quantified or measured.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:36.610
And those things are sort of--
since they can't be measured,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:41.870
they're really more
about-- how do I say this?

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.790
They're really
more about stories

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:47.610
and the emotional connections
between those things.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.090
So I think the more our economy
becomes more based on goods,

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:57.290
services, and ideas, things that
can't be quantified, measured,

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.690
or really managed
in the same way

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.530
that measurable
things are managed,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.925
storytelling becomes
more important.

00:37:04.925 --> 00:37:05.800
Does that make sense?

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.130
Thank you.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.969
MALE SPEAKER: Just two
more questions here.

00:37:08.969 --> 00:37:09.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.230
I wanted to get
your opinion on what

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.290
you think the story behind
"Mad Men" really means.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.520
Like what is the main
message that the show is

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.270
trying to convey to the audience
through the journey of Don

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.770
Draper?

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.020
MALE SPEAKER: How does it end?

00:37:23.686 --> 00:37:27.340
JOSH WELTMAN: You know, I
couldn't possibly answer that.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:33.640
It's so different being
inside the eye of the storm

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.630
and working to put it together.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.050
And I think it's really best if
people like me who are in there

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:46.090
leave it up to other people
to get what they get.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.812
Sometimes I got what
Matt got, and sometimes I

00:37:49.812 --> 00:37:51.520
didn't get what the
writers got, or I got

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.590
something completely different.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.730
I mean, I'm just like you.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:58.720
When I see it on TV, it's
like, oh my god, you know?

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.390
It sure doesn't feel
when it's put together,

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.290
and you're looking at
it, like it did when

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:07.430
you were trying to make it.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.982
I don't know.

00:38:07.982 --> 00:38:10.190
AUDIENCE: Perhaps a different
way to ask the question

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.490
is, what has his journey
meant for you personally

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:14.114
over the time that
you've worked on it?

00:38:14.114 --> 00:38:18.800
JOSH WELTMAN: Oh, it's been just
fantastic to go with him on it.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.020
I got to find out so much
about so many smart people.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.390
And it was like a graduate
course in human behavior.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.500
And to see-- to work on
anything that successfully

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.360
connects with a lot of people
is just satisfying in every way.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.940
That's great, thanks.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.580
MALE SPEAKER: Last
question for you, Josh.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.660
We're at a tech company.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.900
And you talk about tech
companies in the book.

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.290
You say that they fall prey to
throwing things over the wall.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.227
And you actually mention
Google, which I love.

00:38:49.227 --> 00:38:50.060
JOSH WELTMAN: Sorry.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.620
MALE SPEAKER: No, it's great.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:55.160
You actually mention the first
product I worked on here.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.960
What do tech companies do when
they throw it over the wall?

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.860
What does that mean?

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.235
JOSH WELTMAN: The first time
I heard the phrase "throw it

00:39:01.235 --> 00:39:04.060
over the wall" was when I was
Creative Director on Microsoft.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.180
And what that meant
was bringing a product

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:13.650
to market because you
can, without necessarily

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:20.830
thinking about why or how you're
going to get people to buy it.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.400
It's making it--
I'm sorry, bringing

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.330
it to market because
you can make it,

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.790
rather than bringing it to
market because you think

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.190
you can make people buy it.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:38.140
So without considering that,
sometimes things fall flat.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.420
It doesn't really--

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.794
MALE SPEAKER: How does a tech
company make people buy it?

00:39:41.794 --> 00:39:43.149
How do you create that itch?

00:39:43.149 --> 00:39:44.940
JOSH WELTMAN: I think
a high tech company--

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.890
I think the hardest thing, or
the most important thing to do,

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:57.720
is to keep control of the
metaphor, the metaphor being

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.770
sort of what it's like,
what the product is

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.640
like in the real world.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.630
You know, IBM spent
a lot of money 10,

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:14.290
15 years ago
advertising e-Business.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:15.920
e-Business was the metaphor.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.640
It was the idea of
business done online.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.450
None of the machines or the
software that allowed business

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:26.770
to be done online
really existed.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.800
So the money was
spent so that IBM

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:33.760
would be the company that
controlled what it meant

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:39.060
to do business online
by showing people

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.830
a story, a fiction of
what it looked like when

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.760
so and so in Poland could
create a cheese shop

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.820
and post i6 and get an order
from someone in-- before any

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.470
of this could actually happen.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.030
You had to create
that Tomorrowland,

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.550
that vision of the future,
that that's where we're going.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:01.679
MALE SPEAKER: Did Google
ever do this, do you think?

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:02.470
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah.

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.465
I think Google did it.

00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:07.340
I was telling you the
story of the first time

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:09.990
I heard that-- Google did it
when they came up with the name

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.180
Google, because I can
remember like it was yesterday

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:18.620
the first time I heard
somebody say, in an agency,

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.780
go Google that.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.320
I didn't know what they meant.

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.682
I thought they could have
been telling me go fuck myself

00:41:24.682 --> 00:41:25.640
or something like that.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:28.120
I mean, what do you
mean, go Google it?

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.170
And when they said,
you know, there's

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:35.730
this thing on the Internet
that'll answer any question,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:39.190
it made me very curious to
find out more about that,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.980
because suddenly there was
someone in the office who

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.450
had a tool that I didn't have.

00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:44.477
They had an edge.

00:41:44.477 --> 00:41:46.060
They had all the
answers in the world.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.185
MALE SPEAKER: An enthymeme.

00:41:47.185 --> 00:41:48.400
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.400
And I had to go
and check that out.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:58.450
And it was having a word
for a product and a service

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.820
that had never existed before.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.890
And calling it something that
I'd never heard before that

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.060
made me absolutely have
to scratch that itch.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.160
I couldn't allow there
to be another person

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.140
in the agency who knew
about this valuable thing,

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.270
or wonderful thing that
I didn't know about.

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.770
So yeah.

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:16.010
MALE SPEAKER: And you
scratched a couple times a day,

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.510
I take it.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:17.840
JOSH WELTMAN: Yeah, lots.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.506
MALE SPEAKER: Josh
Weltman's first book,

00:42:19.506 --> 00:42:21.020
"Seducing Strangers."

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:21.941
Available in the back.

00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:22.690
It's a great read.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:23.780
Josh, thanks for
coming to Google.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.821
JOSH WELTMAN: Absolutely.

00:42:24.821 --> 00:42:25.940
Thanks for having me.
