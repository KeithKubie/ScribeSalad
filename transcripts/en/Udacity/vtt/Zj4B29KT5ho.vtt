00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.594
let's assume that we have a csv file called

00:00:02.594 --> 00:00:08.840
hr_year.csv, which contains two columns, yearID and HR. YearID

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.960
is the year and HR is the total number

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.970
of home runs. With these two columns, the csv file

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.020
contains the number of home runs hit in Major

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.388
League Baseball every year. Can you write a function line

00:00:19.388 --> 00:00:22.196
plot that creates a pandas data frame from this

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:25.508
csv file and then creates a chart with points connected

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:28.460
by lines, both colored red, showing the number

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.645
of home runs by year? You want to do this

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.583
using the ggplot library with the syntax

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.560
that we just discussed. Your code should go here.
