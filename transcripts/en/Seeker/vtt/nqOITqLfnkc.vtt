00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.670
Yes, partially decayed zombies are gross,
but what REALLY happens to THIS BEAUTIFUL

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.670
SPECIMEN OF HUMAN MEAT after it dies?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.340
Let's get grossly detailed!!!

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.680
Death is as natural as birth, but celebrated
a lot less.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.960
At the moment of death, the brain has a surge
of activity as its last oxygen is depleted,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.060
and it then goes dark.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.431
Hormones which regulate body functions stop
being secreted by the brain, and though some

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.929
physical functions continue for a few minutes,
eventually all human functions stop and the

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.129
post-death process begins.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.920
Firstly, at death, all muscles relax.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.300
It takes burning oxygen for energy to keep
you tense, no O2, no tension.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.229
This includes the body's sphincters, which
is why death often cause defecation and incontinence.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.199
Now, just because the body is medically DEAD,
doesn't mean everything is.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.410
Some cells continue burning remaining energy,
which contributes to what happens after we

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.410
die.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.969
Not to mention the 100 trillion bacteria living
in our intestines, on our skin and elsewhere.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.040
They've been with us our whole lives… no
reason to stop now.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.640
Algor mortis, or the death chill, begins immediately
at death.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.939
On average, a human body loses 1.5 degrees
(.83 C) an hour until it reaches room temperature.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.090
Without a heartbeat, blood and fluids begin
the lividity process, succumbing to gravity

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.740
and pooling at the lowest points in the body.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
In light-skinned people, pooling blood is
visible outside the body as a dark purplish-blue,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.249
and after two hours it clots!

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.570
This is how forensic specialists can tell
if a body has been moved.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.200
Within three to six hours, rigor mortis sets
in, tensing the muscles again.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.510
After death, calcium floods the muscles, and
bonds with proteins that control muscle contraction.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.289
This uncontrolled bonding causes muscles to
tense for 24-to-48 hours.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.150
The eyes will cloud over during this time,
especially if left open.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.009
And once rigor sets in, they're stuck that
way for a while, so that whole closing eye

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.009
thing in movies?

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.149
It's possible as long as you get to them quickly.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.679
Though you might not have to, because according
to a study in the Indian Journal of Palliative

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.080
Care, 63 percent of people fully closed their
eyes at death!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.849
Which seems like a lot to me...

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.849
OKAY.

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.849
SO.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.769
You're dead, and decomposition is starting.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.459
Your cells are dead, and are begining to break
down.

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.220
In this case, cell death happens because of
necrosis.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.040
It's messy, and without circulation, the body
can't come clean up the dead cell.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.150
As carbon dioxide builds up and the pH of
the tissues rise, the cells weaken and eventually

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.260
their membranes break, releasing their insides
into the surrounding tissue.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.750
Enzymes in that fluid cause damage, blistering
and color changes, this continues for a while...

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.040
By the second or third day putrefaction sets
in.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.420
Oxygen is been depleted by the natural microorganisms
in our respiratory and gastrointestinal systems,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.880
and they've begun to spread into other sections
of the body.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.750
For example: enzymes in the pancreas cause
it to digest itself, and the gut bacteria

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.510
LOVE that, so they eat it too -- which turns
the abdomen a greenish color.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.210
Gas begins to build up, forcing any non-digestibles
like feces; out of the body.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.450
This is when the smell is just… beyond horrible.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.590
I've smelled it, you don't want to.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.140
Two organic amine chemicals: putrescine and
cadaverine are created during this interaction,

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.910
and eventually it makes its way into the blood
vessels.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.140
Picture a post-apocalyptic highway… using
that, they get to the rest of the body and

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.750
ooze out causing a horrid rotting smell.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.690
Eventually, necrosis and the work of bacteria
changes the greenishness, to purple, and then

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.950
BLACK.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.250
The smell causes more insects to come lay
eggs and invade the body.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.890
A single blowfly can lay 300 eggs which will
hatch in a single day.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.189
Their larvae will hatch and eat tissues nearby
for a week as a maggot before transforming

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.549
into a fly itself!

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.370
Over the next week, maggots and bacteria pop
holes in the body, releasing the gas (and

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.319
the smell) even more.

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.870
These maggots can consume 60-percent of a
body in just a week!

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.330
But there's still a lot to go, this was just
the first WEEK.

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.290
Next, butyric fermentation starts and the
organs and tissues begin to dry out and wax

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.270
over, sort of like a mummy!

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.260
The tissues are being slowly digested by MORE
bacteria, insects, protozoa, and fungi.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.970
This stage takes a long time, maybe as much
as a year or more in moderate temperatures.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.240
Once the fluids are mostly dry, post-decay
starts.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.600
The soft tissues and organs are dried up and
consumed, but bones, hair, cartilage and sticky

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.020
byproducts of the earlier stages are still
around.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.351
This is when a variety of beetles and flies
move in each species looking to eat away at

00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.430
part of what's left.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.550
Over the subsequent years, plants and animals
will eat away the skeleton and eventually…

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.670
dust to dust.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.670
Gone forever.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.690
Of course, in modern life, we usually never
get past the first few days.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.440
Embalming helps delay much of these processes,
as does cooling the body!

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.100
This is if you left a human laying around,
like an old pizza.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.020
Sure, we die, but all these things live on
thanks to our gross wet corpses!

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.930
It's inevitable, and fascinating.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.890
I could do five more episodes on this stuff!

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:33.530
Let us know what you think about this down
below… not like… buried or whatever…

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:43.450
like in the comments.
