00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.650
What kind of company is LogicBlox,
what sorts of things they sell?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.450
&gt;&gt; So LogicBlox's primary product
is what we call a smart database.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.550
It's an active cloud
database that has much

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.450
of the business logic that one would
normally need to write in a traditional

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.500
imperative language running on separate
machines down in the database.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.050
So that when data
are added to the database,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.910
these business rules kick in and
update views automatically.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.930
It specializes in doing really
large-scale analytics and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.720
applications that are kind of a hybrid
between transactional and analytic, and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.310
that's really our sweet spot.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.070
&gt;&gt; And
what sort of customers do you have and

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.460
the kinds of products that they need?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so most of our customers that
are longer-term customers have been

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.060
customers in the retail domain,
that need to do analysis to decide how

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.750
many products they should order for a
given promotion, or forecast demand for

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
a given set of products at their stores,
or do financial planning.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.788
These tend to be really large,
often multi-terabyte

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:17.670
applications that have years and
years of sales history that we use

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.100
to try to do a good job of forecasting
or predicting how products will move.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.010
And we use our smart database
to analyze that and roll up and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.630
roll down those data very efficiently.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.450
&gt;&gt; So the terabytes is not
the size of the source code but

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.040
it's the amount of data that
they have to deal with.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.750
&gt;&gt; That's correct.
Yeah,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.470
the amount of source code
is meant to be very small.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.340
The idea is that you want to declare
your business rules as concisely and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.060
compactly and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.260
as close to the way you'd want to
just say them in English is you can.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.258
And then we install those
business rules into our database,

00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:54.090
which then we load with
the terabytes of data.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.332
&gt;&gt; And you mentioned in the cloud,

00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:57.470
is this what they call softwares and
service?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.340
&gt;&gt; It is, yes, so all of our
applications are sold as a service.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.500
So our forecaster, which I think we're
going to talk about in a little while.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.570
In particular, our forecast manager,
is a service that

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.290
big retail customers will pay
us a monthly fee to access.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.830
Part of our model is that they
can at any time choose to.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.094
They don't have to install
a lot of special hardware and

00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:26.130
have IT expertise in house,
they can just subscribe to our service.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.250
They access it through
standard web browsers.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.440
They can turn it off and
on as they desire.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.170
If they decide that they don't like
it anymore, they can just quit.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.960
And so it's really nice for customers.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.980
Part of our business proposition
is that we can quickly get into,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.660
give access to a customer and
let them see the benefits.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.680
They don't have to make a lot of upfront
commitment to use our technology and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.260
they can decide to leave anytime.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.420
&gt;&gt; So would you call this
a real time application?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.110
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I'd call
it a real time application.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.330
It is an interactive application in
the sense that there will be users who

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.580
will be executing queries and
analyzing data

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.760
in what they would consider to be real
time so they need fast response time.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680
It's an interactive system.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.660
It doesn't have hard
real time deadlines,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.850
the way we normally think about
real time stuff being developed.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.820
&gt;&gt; And how does the customer's data,
their sales data or

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.890
their product data get to you?

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's actually a little bit complicated.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.502
So, customers tend to keep their data in
database systems that they've had for

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:31.430
50 years and
have their own special format and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.700
they're very difficult
to integrate with.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.710
What we tend to do is get them to export
the data that they need to send to us

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.440
and usually in just big CSV files or
some kind of delimited tabular file.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.860
And they'll send us these
files at various times.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.550
We have servers that will receive the
files and put them off to Amazon's S3

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.440
storage, it's a nice, very scalable,
very reliable storage system that we

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.499
use to keep the incoming data and from
that we load them into our databases.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.340
&gt;&gt; But,
this data might be periodically updated.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.180
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Often, on a daily basis, and

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.140
sometimes, for some customers,
even more frequent than that.
