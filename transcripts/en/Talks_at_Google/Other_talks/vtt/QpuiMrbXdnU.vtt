CHARLIE: So my name
is Charlie [? Lai, ?]

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.040
and this is my
colleague Alex Garcia.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.440
We're part of the Google
Bay Area Farm To Table Group

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.450
here at Google.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.570
And our mission is to
promote events and ideas

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.570
related to food sustainability.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.770
And that is why we're
very excited today

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.240
to have two very special guests,
Curt Ellis and Sara Ting,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.530
who Alex will now introduce.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.650
ALEX GARCIA: Thank you.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.170
Curt is the CEO and co-founder
of Food Corps, a fast growing

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.370
national nonprofit.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.360
Food Corps' mission is working
together with communities

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.040
to connect kids to
healthy food in school.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.910
Joining Curt on stage
today is Sarah Ting,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.940
who is an alumni of
the Food Corps program.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.240
So with that, I want to welcome
Curt and Sarah to tell us

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.732
a little bit more about it.

00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:48.800
CURT ELLIS: Fantastic.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.060
Thank you all so much
for coming today.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.846
And a huge thanks to Charlie,
and Alex, and my old friend

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.470
[? Krista Essig ?],
who's been involved

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.710
in Food Corps since
the earliest days,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.890
for hosting us
through Google Food.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.000
I'd like to start by sharing
a little bit of the story that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.760
brought me here today.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.670
If you go back to the year
that I graduated from college,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.520
I remember our classmates
setting out for Wall Street

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.710
and for Silicon
Valley, and the feeling

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.580
that my best friend
and I had of wanting

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.770
to go somewhere different.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.580
The path we took was a
little less than a path.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.750
It was more like
I-80, and we followed

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100
it all the way to
Iowa with our goods

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.030
packed in the back
of a pickup truck

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.080
until we reached a curmudgeonly
farmer's house in rural Floyd

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.480
County and convinced him to
lease us one acre of land

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.920
on which we could grow
food in the blackest dirt

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.540
that I had ever seen.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.730
Like any good Iowa corn farmer,
we planted our field in corn.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.670
And like any good member
of our generation,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.800
we followed the
cardinal rule of pics

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.720
or it didn't really happen.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.571

-It's America's
best kept secret.

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:21.352
We don't think of what we're
putting into our system.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:23.950
We don't really think about it.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.450
-Pork.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.355
-Beef.

-Bread.

-Soda.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.058
-French fries.

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:30.530
-Spaghetti sauces.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.531
-Biscuits with gravy.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.541
-Everything on
your plate is corn.

00:02:42.774 --> 00:02:44.690
GEORGE W. BUSH: When
you're good at somethin',

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:45.750
we ought to be encouraging it.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.916
We're good at growing corn,
and we're now selling it

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:49.015
all around the world.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:50.976
[CHEERING]

00:02:53.904 --> 00:02:54.820
-What is is this here?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.120
-That's excess corn.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.030
-That's what couldn't
fit in that huge thing.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.770
-That's right.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.730
-Huh.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.156
-I'm movin' from Boston to Iowa.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.370
-Could I have a Big
and Tasty sandwich?

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.010
-I used to weigh
over 300 pounds.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.320
-Lot's of corn means
the raw material

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.800
for an overweight society.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.070
-Hello, carbs.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.730
-All that corn goes somewhere,
and in fact a lot of it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.750
going onto our bodies.

00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:41.700
-We aren't growing quality.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.200
We're growing crap.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.322
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:16.380
CURT ELLIS: Now in
retrospect we could

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.829
have made this film
infinitely shorter

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.970
than we actually made
it, because it turns out

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.770
that somebody else had
already told the same story we

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.110
were trying to tell.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.110
It was Steve Martin
who, back in the 1970s,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.660
used to do stand up comedy.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.850
And he had a bit where
he would conjecture

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.080
that maybe everything that
actually shows up in McDonald's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.390
is made out of the same stuff.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.020
And if you could go
into the back room

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.450
and peel back the
door on the kitchen,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.280
you would see this
conveyor belt going

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.300
by with these
different molds on it.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.210
And you would see this
vat full of this stuff,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.024
and there would be the
cook going [SLAPPING SOUND]

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.440
hamburger, [SLAPPING SOUND]
French fries, [SLAPPING SOUND]

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.010
paper box.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.520
And of course what Steve didn't
really realize at the time

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.230
is that's actually true.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.646
The hamburger in the typical
fast food meal is corn fed.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:10.330
The soda in the
typical fast food soda

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.130
is sweetened with an incredible
amount of high fructose corn

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.720
syrup.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.560
And the French fries are
quite often fried in corn oil.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.430
And pleasingly, even
the box now typically

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.240
has a corn based
wax on the coating.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.220
That acre of land that my best
friend and I grew in the year

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.480
after college was
not a very big plot.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.090
I mean, it's about the
size of a football field.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.690
But just that one acre
produced 10,000 pounds

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.180
of corn, five tons of food.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.200
And that is enough to raise
4,000 corn fed hamburgers,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.490
or enough to sweeten
57,000 cans of soda

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.330
with high fructose corn syrup.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.430
We grew just one acre, but
America's farmers on the whole

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.410
grow 94 million acres
of corn each year,

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.790
harvesting 14 billion
bushels of grain.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.000
Agricultural economists track
where all of that harvest

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.690
ends up using a term
called corn disappearance.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.490
But the reality, if you look
around America these days,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.300
is that that corn isn't
really disappearing.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.740
We're each carrying a
significant portion of it

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.060
with us every single day.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.420
The reality is that
half of all Americans

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.770
are overweight or obese,
and diet related disease

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.920
like type 2 diabetes
is affecting

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.330
kids younger and younger.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.410
The government's own
estimate is that by 2030,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.010
when the current obesity
generation is all grown up,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.920
we will face a $1 trillion
annual economic cost related

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.890
to diet related disease.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.650
Half of that comes in the
form of direct obesity related

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.210
medical costs.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.920
And the other half of
it comes in the form

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.140
of lost economic productivity.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.250
And I want to pause on that
lost economic productivity

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.360
for a moment, because it sounds
like it's sort of a throw away.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.310
But $500 billion a year
is not monopoly money.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.640
And it's not actually
money that matters.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.280
It is the broken
dreams of people

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.710
who attain less education,
advance less in their careers,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:33.240
are out sick more at
work, and raise families

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.410
who themselves are at elevated
risk of diet related disease.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.420
That lost economic productivity
is real people missing out

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:43.240
on social mobility.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.010
Obesity is fuel for the
relentless cycle of poverty,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:56.180
and poverty is fuel for the
relentless cycle of obesity.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.510
Diet related disease
in all of its forms

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.780
deepens the systemic
inequities that

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.370
already hold our country back.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.580
And it doesn't just
discriminate by income.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.900
Half of all kids of
color are expected

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.540
to develop type 2 diabetes
during their lifetime, a rate

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.860
50% higher than white children.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.950
In the decades that we
have been incentivizing

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.060
corn production in this country,
brewing high fructose corn

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.150
syrup in our factories,
and raising corn fed

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.580
meat on our farms,
we've developed

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.070
a powerful and now deeply
ingrained set of food habits,

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.080
most of them revolving
around a culture

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.970
of refined grains, added fats,
and added sugars, processed

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.940
food, and empty calories.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.040
Corn in the way we grow,
and process, and consume it,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.530
looks very little like
a vegetable today.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.950
Those eating habits get
set incredibly young,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.690
and they shape us both
figuratively and quite

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.618
literally throughout
the rest of our lives.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.620
I remember the night that
we were preparing to harvest

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.060
our corn in the morning.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.000
We decided to lay
out sleeping bags

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.950
between the rows
in our cornfield

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:14.940
and sleep out under the stars.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.350
Our year had passed.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.520
My best friend and I had
had a grand adventure

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.090
in the heartland.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.380
But ultimately, we
were left feeling

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.660
like we had done little good.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.520
The film we had made
was going to go off

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.910
to movie theaters that would
show it alongside 72 ounce

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.160
sodas that people in the
audience would be drinking.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.750
We wanted, on some level,
a chance at a do-over.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.930
We wanted to know what we
could have accomplished

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.440
if we had spent our year
after college not reinforcing

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:54.580
America's broken food happens,
but helping to set new ones.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.340
Not long after, I
started traveling around

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.380
to college campuses, and giving
talks, and showing our film.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.340
And I was amazed with
the number of students

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.570
who would show up and break with
their 21-year-old busy routine

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.280
of drinking beer and writing
code to come out and watch

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.660
a corn film.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.240
First I realized
they were probably

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.670
thinking they were going
to see a porn film,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.800
and they were disappointed
when they got there.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.980
But then ultimately I
understood why they had come.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.710
Food is a prism, and
people in this generation

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:31.030
recognize what a powerful
story food has to tell us.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:33.210
When you peer into
that prism of food,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.280
you see our nation's greatest
challenges refracted.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.130
You see human health.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.690
You see environmental
sustainability.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.660
You see the cultural shift
away from the dinner table.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.590
You see issues of social
justice and racial justice

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:54.230
in terms of who has
access to healthy food.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.470
And you realize
that maybe somehow,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:02.060
if we could address
these issues in our food,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:07.420
that simple fundamental thing
we put in our bodies every day,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.630
we might begin to
see a roadmap for how

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.650
we could address those same
things across our society.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:18.540
Meeting those students
and hearing their passion

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.980
for creating a more just, and
healthful, and sustainable food

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:27.810
system, we realized that the
do-over we were hoping to have

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.390
could be had not by us, because
we couldn't go back in time,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.805
but by other people who
wanted to go forward.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.970
So with a group of friends,
we launched a nonprofit

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.860
that we called Food Corps.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.150
Food Corps is a nationwide team
of leaders who connect kids

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:49.500
to healthy food in school.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.390
Our core members
dedicate themselves

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.300
to a year or two of
AmeriCorps service,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.570
working hand-in-hand with
community partners across 18

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.680
states, and hundreds
and hundreds of schools,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.270
to make those
schools fundamentally

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:08.680
healthier places for kids to
eat, and learn, and grow up in.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.680
We have Corps members
from Maine to Mississippi,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.110
from California to,
yes, Iowa, where

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.690
we have a team just a few miles
from that acre of corn, doing

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.790
simple good work
day in and day out,

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.400
helping kids fall in love
with fruits and vegetables

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.920
and set new eating
habits in place.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.290
Our sixth class of Food Corps
service members is in the field

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.560
now, 215 passionate
and talented people

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.480
selected from about
1,000 who applied.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.770
Most of them recently wrapped
up college or grad school,

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:46.730
but a number of them
were non-college bound

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.146
or have returned to
service as grandparents.

00:12:50.146 --> 00:12:51.520
The majority of
our Corps members

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.370
are serving in their home state.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.680
Many of them are serving
in their home communities.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.522
And some are serving in the
various schools they themselves

00:13:00.522 --> 00:13:01.022
attended.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.410
I'm honored to introduce
you to a Food Corps alum

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.330
today, Sarah Ting.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.280
Sarah served in her
hometown of Oakland

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.040
where she built school gardens.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.630
She taught nutrition lessons
to 16 classes a week.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.610
And she surveyed and analyzed
145 different California

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.730
farmers who were supplying
food to Oakland unified schools

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.240
to figure out how
we could scale up

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.520
the connection between
school children's lunch trays

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.680
and those local
farms and farmers.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.320
Visiting Sarah in her schools,
it was apparent every time

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.264
just how dedicated she was
to the service she was doing.

00:13:43.264 --> 00:13:45.430
Sarah, what brought
you to Food Corps.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.300
SARAH TING: Thank you, Curt.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.130
Yeah, so leading
up into this year

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.340
that I served in Food
Corps, I actually

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:58.790
had a similar experience being
out in agricultural fields,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:05.760
in the food system, exploring
what it meant right now to be

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.510
a part of a food system.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.530
But I wasn't a part of my
home community food system

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:11.070
at the time.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:14.590
I actually was far
away in India working

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.570
with a trade union
of women who were

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.940
all a part of a collective
of informal workers.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.200
And many of them
were in agriculture.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.860
Some were contract
farm laborers,

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.000
and some were street vendors.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.670
But what I witnessed
there was that there

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:37.790
was this amazing power in the
collective they had formed

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.800
and that, despite the
fact that they had faced

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.110
enormous struggle, and
most of the society

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.480
they lived in and did
not consider them to have

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.970
much power, they came together
to work on the issues that

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.010
mattered to them and form
new food systems that

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.340
nourished their communities.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.860
And so that really
inspired me to want

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.640
to go home to join an
organization that I

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.070
could really do the same
in my own home community.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:13.650
So I came back to Oakland,
and I found Food Corps.

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:17.560
And in that service,
I really wanted

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:24.030
to know what were sort of the
historical contexts for food

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:25.820
in my community.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.500
And when I think of that, I
think of the Black Panther

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:30.320
Party.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.310
And many of you might
know the Black Panther

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.460
Party is from Oakland.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.270
But you may not know
that they actually

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.840
had a lot of service programs in
the community, and one of them

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.230
being a school breakfast
program for kids.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.220
And so in the
midst of the 1960s,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.970
there were a lot of school food
programs that were rolling out.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.020
There were still black
children in Oakland

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.700
that were going hungry.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.550
And so the Black
Panther Party served

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.750
thousands of school
breakfasts every day

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.840
to serve the community.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.220
And I think that's a great
reminder, in this context,

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:15.180
working with food inequities,
that there's-- like the women

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.220
in India-- that there is
always this strong leadership

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.070
and power in community.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.380
And in that context, I went
into my Food Corps service

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.940
really wanting to
know how can we

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.520
work and be inclusive
of communities

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.260
and their leadership and work
towards a more equitable system

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.280
with that.

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.950
And I found that
partner in Ford Corps

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:42.200
and in Oakland Unified
School District,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.870
and figuring out
how we could really

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.830
apply that on the ground.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.080
CURT ELLIS: Awesome
Food Corps believes

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.840
that, if we are going to be
successful at driving change,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.680
it's going to be that we were
not the ones who ultimately

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.640
drove it.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.310
Solutions need to be co-created
with the communities we're

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.815
serving, or else they
will have no relevance

00:17:05.815 --> 00:17:06.690
to those communities.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.660
Food Corps needs to look
different in the Mississippi

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.470
Delta from how it looks in
Detroit, from how it looks

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:16.750
in Hawaii, to how it looks in
rural Maine, or rural Montana,

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:20.030
or rural Iowa.

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.760
But underneath the
difference that

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.599
makes our country
special and the need

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:27.630
to adapt our programming
to match its place,

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.750
the reality is that there
are also some foundations

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.130
of evidence that hold true.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.600
There are some
strategies that are

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.230
known to be effective
at connecting kids

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.030
to healthy food in school.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.800
And if you can adapt
those strategies to match

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.090
the cultural context and
the climate in which you're

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.350
working, then you can
really unlock impact.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.020
Food Corps has worked with a
team of researchers at Columbia

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.290
to develop a framework for our
work planning and our impact

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.700
tracking school
by school that is

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.000
all about finding those things
that the evidence shows truly

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.250
move the needle on kids eating
more fruits and vegetables

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.620
and putting those building
blocks in place to create

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.719
a healthy school
food environment.

00:18:08.719 --> 00:18:10.510
There are things I
wanted to share with you

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.720
today, because there are
things you can replicate

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.340
in your children's schools.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.900
And there are things in many
ways you can replicate at home.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.820
The first one is that the
research makes it very clear

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.080
that, if you want a child to
fall in love with healthy food

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.070
and to begin to choose
it, you start by getting

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:32.870
their hands in the dirt.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.070
For too long, we've
treated nutrition education

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.730
as something where
somebody points

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.380
at a poster on the wall
for about 3.4 hours a year

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.560
in the case of a typical
elementary schooler's

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.520
education.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.435
And we expect some
good to come of that.

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:48.910
It doesn't actually work.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:51.190
What works is getting
kids the chance

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:54.200
to smell the leaves
of a tomato plant,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.080
to pull carrots
out of the ground

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.760
and taste them with
the dirt still on,

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.240
and to have the sense
of joy, and pride,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.400
and ownership that
comes from creating

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.345
their own plate of food.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:13.040
Researchers will tell you
that kids who have a garden

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.410
eat on average one more
serving of fruit and vegetables

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.650
than their peers each day.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.030
Kids will tell you
something different, which

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.900
is that gardens are magic.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.280
As one student told us, I want
to rename our garden the Golden

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.420
Garden.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.030
Because when I think of that
garden, everything I see

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.940
turns to gold.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.370
Cooking with kids
can be magic, too.

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.410
As we heard from a Corps member
of ours in New Jersey recently,

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.765
dang Miss Rachel,
this Collard pesto

00:19:48.765 --> 00:19:50.140
tastes better than
cheeseburgers.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.910
The research also shows
that, even from a young age,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.930
food should not just
be about sustenance.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.660
It should be about values.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.560
By connecting with one child's
commitment to environmentalism,

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.580
we heard from her recently that
worms are the only true rock

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.170
stars to me.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.160
Most importantly, we need
to help kids get over

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.670
the fear of trying new things.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.300
Neophobia is one of the greatest
concerns for researchers

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.510
in the nutrition science field.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.190
And for all the effort we
put into helping kids develop

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.690
a growth mindset
in the classroom,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:35.570
we fail to cultivate one
around the dinner table.

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.570
For Food Corps, we do
taste tests all the time,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.300
where we introduce new foods,
not covering somebody's plate,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.050
but just a little bit.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:48.610
And we invite kids to vote
in three categories-- loved

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.630
it, liked it, or tried it.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:57.780
I don't see any reason to
set the bar lower than that.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.030
We know this kind of
hands-on discovery

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.240
really works for connecting
kids to healthy food,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.640
because 7 out of 10 kids
taught in Food Corps

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.820
classes shift their attitudes
in a positive direction

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.005
about fruits and vegetables.

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.380
And the numbers
go off the charts

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.213
for the fruits and
vegetables they've really

00:21:14.213 --> 00:21:16.740
focused on in their lessons.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.800
Kids also try new
food in Food Corps.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.360
And it takes an
incredible discipline

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.920
of trying new foods over,
and over, and over again

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.300
before you may crack through
to that food being one

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.390
a kid truly loves.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.630
The reality, though, is
that too many families

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.270
don't have the luxury
or the privilege

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.850
to do that trying, and
trying, and trying again,

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.300
because it means
throwing out the broccoli

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.660
that you've worked
so hard to buy.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.380
That's why Food Corps focuses
our efforts on high needs

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.230
schools, places
where kids may not

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.310
have that opportunity at home,
and where we have an obligation

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.310
to make sure every
child has the chance

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:59.120
to try, and try, and
try new foods until they

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.540
learn they love them.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.726
Sarah, what was your experience
with hands-on education?

00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:08.350
SARAH TING: Yeah, I
really appreciate--

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.470
so I think this point
about an environment where

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:14.440
a kid's growing up
is really important.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:18.680
What a child is exposed to, and
what their family is exposed

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.260
to, or the environment
that they're growing up in

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.850
can really shape
your food choices.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.280
So in that way, there's
a sort of assumption

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.560
that we can all choose
to eat healthier.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.290
But I think, while food is
a very personal thing-- it's

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.450
something that we associate
with love, family, culture,

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.270
our community--
like Curt has said,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:46.080
it's also something that's
now very commoditized,

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.270
artificial, and
something highly marketed

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.060
to young kids, especially
black and brown kids

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.160
in communities like
mine in Oakland.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.220
So when you come across
this intersection

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.990
where our food
becomes something that

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:07.360
leads to chronic diseases like
diabetes, and at the same time

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:11.870
leads to food insecurity
in my community,

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.440
there's this real
disconnect between children

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.250
and the personal and
cultural relationship

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.910
that they had to food.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.270
So what I saw in the garden
was where we could really

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:31.240
make a space, an environment,
a safe green space

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.540
that kids could just be kids
and get their hands dirty.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:41.040
And I saw this when we had
lessons where we planted

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.150
radish seeds into the ground.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.860
And you could see the
wonder on children's faces

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:51.310
and see how a seed
could grow into a plant.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.600
And for some of the
kids, that meant trying

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.090
a radish for the first time.

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:58.465
When we harvested them out of
the ground, they would say,

00:23:58.465 --> 00:24:00.380
oh my gosh, what is
this, and then would

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.430
be able to try a brand new
veggie that they had never

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.620
been exposed to before.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.990
And then for other students
who were very familiar

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.880
with radishes-- for
a lot of our students

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.070
with Mexican heritage--
they would say, rabanos?

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:17.030
Like, that's what my
mom puts in our pozole.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.870
That's so cool.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.180
I had no idea they
came from the ground.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.450
And that way we could
make that connection

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.980
and solidify that personal and
cultural pride in the foods

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.280
that our kids were eating, and
know that healthy food came

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.160
straight from their homes.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.090
So that was a really great way
that our garden could serve

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.300
so many different purposes.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.230
CURT ELLIS: Awesome.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.580
The second thing you
need to do, of course,

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.840
is figure out how
to move from kids

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.720
liking a taste of something
to actually eating

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.560
a plate full of it.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.360
And once you've gotten
them interested,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.499
that becomes possible.

00:24:58.499 --> 00:25:00.040
There's a bunch of
really interesting

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.470
behavioral economics
research into how

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.800
you can shift food
choices and consumption

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.780
habits of kids who show up
in a school cafeteria or kids

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.470
who show up around your
family dinner table.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.760
You can do things like give
kids a range of choices

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.700
so that they feel valued.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.700
But make sure those choices
are all healthy choices.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:28.850
These are basic design
thinking principles

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.520
you can start to bring to
how you re-imagine a school

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.220
cafeteria that in many ways
starts to respect children

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.420
as customers.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.750
You can move the salad bar to
the front of the lunch line,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:45.300
when kids show up with their
plates and lunch trays empty.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.880
And you can move
the unhealthy food

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.830
to the back of the lunch
line, when those trays

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.020
are going to be full.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.009
You can pause long
enough and observe

00:25:56.009 --> 00:25:57.800
what's going on in the
lunchroom around you

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.370
to realize something that
shockingly few schools seem

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.640
to realize, which is that
kids in the second grade

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.530
have an incredibly hard
time biting into an apple,

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.560
because they're missing their
front teeth, and realize that,

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.360
if you cut up the
apple, suddenly

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:14.150
you could change the
behavior of the children

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:15.732
you're encouraging
to eat more fruit.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.050
You also can't let junk food
companies be the ones who

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.360
have a monopoly on advertising.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.140
I was talking to
somebody recently

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.280
who had worked for a large
processed food company

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.350
and had been in
meetings in that company

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.480
where they were
trying to hatch a plan

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.350
to increase the
lunchroom trading

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:41.260
value of one of the foods
they were marketing to kids.

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.750
And if we are not doing anything
on the healthy food side

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.100
to compete with that,
we are certainly

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.629
going to be left in the dust.

00:26:47.629 --> 00:26:49.420
And the research is
clear that you actually

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.960
can have a huge impact just
with a simple change of naming

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.270
a menu item something
engaging and putting

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.730
a poster behind the salad bar
of a super hero eating spinach.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.480
Suddenly kids' behavior
starts to shift.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.960
Slogans like "eat the
rainbow" actually work.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.900
And simple messages
like challenging kids

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.870
to cover half their plate
in fruits and vegetables

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:19.250
begin to move people
in the right direction.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:21.090
Interestingly, the
research also shows

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:25.890
that kids are responding to
the same local food enthusiasm

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.520
that grownups are,
or it's possible

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.680
that actually both
of us are tapping

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.000
into something more innate.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.280
The research is
clear that kids who

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.460
are told where a
food is coming from,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.920
and have some reason to care
about the farm or the farmer

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:45.720
who brought it to them, eat
more of those healthy foods.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.370
Ultimately though, one of the
most powerful things we can do

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.220
is put people in
school cafeterias who

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.340
serve as role models,
people like Sarah, who

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.860
make healthy eating
actually cool,

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.340
and who let their enthusiasm
catch on with kids.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.030
And it doesn't just
catch on with kids.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:08.250
Pretty soon idealism and a
sense of what is possible

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.250
catches on with food
service directors, too.

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.520
So far this year, Food
Corps service members

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.700
have introduced 600
new recipes or menu

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.020
items that are being served
at scale in schools and school

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.690
districts across the
country, showing just

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.740
how possible it is to
make this change actually

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.530
happen in a way that shifts
what arrives at a child's plate

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.010
at lunch.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:34.330
Sarah, you did some cool
lunch work in your service.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.810
What was that?

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:40.480
SARAH TING: Yeah, I think in
shifting the school menu, one

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.450
of them amazing things that we
did at Oakland Unified School

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:46.070
District was come in
with the assumption

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:50.130
that every single child has
a history with healthy food,

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.890
that whether it was the last
generation or their ancestors,

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.180
every single kid comes
from a culture that has

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.860
healthy food at their roots.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.110
So what we did with the
Nutrition Services director

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.150
Jennifer [? Lebar, ?] and the
Farm To School supervisor Alex

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.600
Emmett-- they came together to
think about what are the ways

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.930
that we can help the
community drive this process,

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:17.770
to drive the taste
buds and the flavors

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.680
that we're going to be
trying to appeal to.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.190
And so we did this in a
couple ways in Oakland.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.270
The first was to
crowdsource the recipes

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.410
for reforming the school lunch.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.150
And that was reaching out to
families, to students, to folks

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.750
in the community to see what
are the recipes that you already

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:42.400
have in your kitchens that
have healthy food in them.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.470
And then what we could do
is kind of work backwards

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:51.190
and source those recipes
from local, sustainable, fair

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.550
sources.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.800
And then second, once
we had those recipes

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.480
and were developing
them, we collaborated

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.480
with a community organization
that had youth leaders do peer

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:06.630
to peer taste tests so that the
youth could decide what they

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:10.750
wanted on the school menu, which
is incredibly important given

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.030
that, in Oakland,
for many students

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.370
the school lunch is the
majority of calories they're

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.360
taking in on any given day.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.910
So you really need these
kids to love the food, right?

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.130
And so in that way, we
were able to both shift

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.080
the menu so that it was
more fresh, and local,

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.700
and sustainable,
but also reflect

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:36.510
the diversity of healthy food
and what healthy food really

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.150
is.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.970
It could be from a Mexican
dish or a Vietnamese dish,

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:45.960
but it really showed our
kids that healthy food

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.850
comes from their roots.

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.830
And it's not
something necessarily

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.320
new to their culture.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.030
CURT ELLIS: Awesome.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.570
The last body of work
that Food Corps focuses on

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:01.510
in our efforts in schools around
the country, and that all of us

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.630
really can be focusing on in
our communities and our schools,

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.192
is around creating
a culture of health.

00:31:09.192 --> 00:31:12.010
It's the difference, I
think, between attending

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.230
a foreign language
class once a week

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:17.070
and actually moving
to a foreign country

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:21.792
and immersing yourself
in a place and a people.

00:31:21.792 --> 00:31:24.200
Those 3.4 hours of
nutrition education

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.720
we give a kid, if that's how
their nutrition education is

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.260
bucketed, it will
never have an impact

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.840
able to overcome the
same 3.4 hours of TV

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.750
that they watch
every single evening.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.760
It has to be an
immersive experience.

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.690
In schools, creating
a culture of health

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:47.450
means not having healthy food
be one person's responsibility.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.860
It means you have to catalyze
interest from all corners.

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.970
There's nothing more
demoralizing than giving

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.740
an amazing lesson in the
garden and then returning

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.670
to the classroom and finding
the teacher behind their desk

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:01.370
with a giant soda in
their hands getting

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.680
ready to throw candy to kids
who answer questions correctly.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.180
The culture of health
has to transcend

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:13.750
the borders of the classroom
or the cafeteria as well.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.460
It needs to echo
through the halls.

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:16.880
There needs to be signage.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.720
There need to not
be vending machines.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.590
You should see "let
us turn up the beat"

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.290
badges on kids' backpacks.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.330
And ultimately, getting this
level of buy in means that

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.000
creating a culture of health
cannot be the work of one

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.410
person, either.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.340
It has to be the work of a team.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:39.000
And Food Corps, in
every school we serve,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.980
now forms a school team at
the beginning of each year,

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:44.900
pulls in community
members, sometimes

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:48.030
kids, a particularly engaged
parent, a food service

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:52.060
director, and works together
to co-create our vision

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.960
for what that healthy
school needs to look

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.170
like by the end of the year.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.200
Suddenly that small team
has a leadership role.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.241
They've got goals
for themselves.

00:33:01.241 --> 00:33:03.240
And by the time they get
to the end of the year,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.170
they're already setting
their sights higher

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.310
for the following fall.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.860
The results of
that kind of work,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.610
where you build a small team,
and then you carry the work out

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.170
to a far larger school
and community culture,

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.640
means suddenly you
create momentum.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.040
You create a culture that
people want to be a part of.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.130
I think that's why Food
Corps now has 7,000 community

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.070
volunteers around
the country who

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.200
are joining us side
by side, Corps members

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.820
like Sarah, to put in
place those building

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:35.020
blocks of a healthy
food environment.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:38.260
And they're doing it in a
way that's going to stick.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:42.360
They're doing it in a way that
will truly have staying power

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.327
for the long term.

00:33:46.247 --> 00:33:48.830
SARAH TING: Yeah, I think that's
an incredibly important piece

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.830
of the work, that we have to
include the whole community

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:54.280
in the process.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.620
And that was true
for me, especially

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.930
in my community
of Oakland, and I

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:02.050
think true with other low
income communities of color

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.170
where folks have been
historically excluded

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:10.690
from safe spaces, healthy food,
from high quality education.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:14.010
And so it comes as no
surprise when some folks feel

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:17.070
that they're just not-- don't
have a seat at the table

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:21.400
when it comes to something as
close to home as school lunch.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.194
So when we think about ways that
we can build effective school

00:34:26.194 --> 00:34:28.110
food programs that
are really going

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:31.020
to have a high impact
in the community,

00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.270
I found that, when
we invited folks in,

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:37.920
when we let the
community lead, that's

00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.300
where we found the results
that we were looking for.

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:45.310
That's when we we're shifting
and changing our food system.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.639
And so I feel that
the work that we're

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.199
striving to do in Food
Corps, and the work

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.300
that we were doing in my
community in Oakland really

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.110
reflected that new
way of thinking,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.640
of including all
folks at the table,

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.180
trying to have an inclusive
program and an inclusive system

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.770
where we could drive
to build institutions

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.760
that nourish all children.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.640
CURT ELLIS: There's a way to do
this work that is deeply rooted

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.630
in the data of what actually
moves the needle on kids eating

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.820
fruits and vegetables, what
actually shifts food habits,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:31.680
and to do it in a way that
is personal, and human,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.150
and reflective of the
cultures we're serving.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.650
Food Corps strives to strike
that balance of consistency

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:42.130
from place to place, to
build a proof point that

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:47.600
can be held up to policymakers
and others for replication,

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.050
while also ensuring that
our work is adapted enough

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.830
to the realities of
climate and culture,

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.550
that it truly has
relevance, and that it truly

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:01.940
lasts beyond the time any
one Corps member might serve.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:05.090
Though the beauty of Food Corps
is that, every single year,

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:08.490
as each new class
comes on board,

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.740
there is one more
chance for a do-over.

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.960
There is a chance to do this
year's work better than last

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.450
year's.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:21.460
We believe firmly that we have
to do that, because that's

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.250
the only way we go
from the 500 schools

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:28.730
Food Corps serves
today to the 100,000

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:32.560
schools across our country,
not with our program

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.910
scaling as some kind of
widget, but with people

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.350
around the country learning
what works, replicating it

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:43.760
in their own places, and us
getting smarter and better

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.340
every single time we try.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.120
That's something we
believe firmly we

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.120
have an obligation to do.

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:55.850
Food Corps does not exist
to do small acts of charity.

00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:00.930
We exist to solve the problem
of our nation's broken

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:05.340
food happens and to solve
that problem at the scale

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.460
at which it exists.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:13.940
And that ultimately is a 100,000
school, 50 state challenge.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:18.380
And we look to people like Sarah
and to partners like all of you

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.610
to make that work possible.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.350
Because inside those
100,000 schools

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:27.400
are millions and
millions of children

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:31.180
who deserve to know
what healthy food is,

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.820
to care about where
it comes from,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.110
and to eat it every single day.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.400
Thank you.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:41.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.010
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.240
-These are the next
generation of leaders

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.390
in food and agriculture.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:54.806
These are the
people who are going

00:37:54.806 --> 00:37:57.440
to make sure all
Americans have access

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.290
to healthy, fair,
affordable food grown

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.576
in a responsible,
sustainable way.

00:38:03.576 --> 00:38:04.950
-The thing I'd
like to accomplish

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:09.720
is at least change the mind of
one child about healthy eating

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.083
and know that, hey, there is
other alternatives rather than

00:38:13.083 --> 00:38:14.690
fast food.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:16.860
-I want to create
something that can sustain

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.640
itself, that can be
passed on, something

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.660
that will last beyond me.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:28.270
-We definitely have the power,
the sources, the intelligence.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.770
So what's stopping us?

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.030
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.510
CHARLIE: So one of
the big audiences here

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.800
is parents at Google.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.140
And I think that there's a lot
of confusion around when you're

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.930
just at the grocery store,
whether you're at Whole Foods,

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.280
or like another
market, or what not,

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.990
like what do these
terms even mean,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:59.610
and how do I even make
sure that what I'm buying

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:02.150
is actually accomplishing
the goal of helping

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.930
my kid eat healthy.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:08.380
So on that note, do you have
any kind of, first of all,

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.060
one thing that you
would advise parents

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.532
to do to better educate
themselves so that they know

00:39:12.532 --> 00:39:14.490
what to feed their kids
and how to kind of sort

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:17.220
through the terminologies
and kind of the confusion

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.580
around the market?

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:24.789
And then second of all, I
guess, how do you enforce that

00:39:24.789 --> 00:39:26.330
especially in the
Bay Area, where not

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:30.300
every kid has access to
a backyard or a garden

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:31.707
to play with?

00:39:31.707 --> 00:39:32.540
CURT ELLIS: Awesome.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.990
Do you want to take that?

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.960
SARAH TING: Sure.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.650
My first thought when you
were asking that question is I

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:43.065
think for any family, if you're
able to, getting into a kitchen

00:39:43.065 --> 00:39:43.940
and cooking together.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.470
I think about memories that
I have growing up with food.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.190
And it was those
tactile moments of being

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.400
able to touch the food
that you're making,

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.220
or that you're
just about to eat,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.690
and getting in the kitchen
with any sort of fresh produce

00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.940
and making a meal out of
it is a really fun thing

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.210
for kids to do, and to
learn to love maybe foods

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:11.150
that they think that
are gross to begin with.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.560
Also, if you have the ability,
maybe just to have a pot, not

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.520
even the whole garden,
but just a singular pot

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.220
to plant a few seeds--
I remember growing up,

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.610
my mom would grow just
one pot of tomatoes.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.720
And I hated tomatoes
at the time.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:32.180
But every summer, she would
plant this one pot of tomatoes.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:36.670
And every summer she made
me try a cherry tomato.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:40.620
And I grew, over the years,
to love cherry tomatoes,

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.750
not necessarily because I
naturally had an inclination

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.290
to love them, but
because I had that memory

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.680
of picking a sun kissed
cherry tomato from the vine

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.850
with my mother.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:55.038
And so creating those memories,
I think, is also really key.

00:40:55.038 --> 00:40:56.026
CURT ELLIS: Love it.

00:40:56.026 --> 00:41:01.800
Yeah, a quick guide is
Michael Pollan's "Food Rules".

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.970
I don't really like the
idea of having food rules

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.499
that much, I think.

00:41:05.499 --> 00:41:07.290
But those rules are
actually really simple.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.620
It's just about eating real,
food mostly plants, and not

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.197
too much.

00:41:11.197 --> 00:41:13.280
ALEX GARCIA: Have you guys
run into any roadblocks

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:13.988
with the schools?

00:41:13.988 --> 00:41:15.655
Like when I was kind
of looking into it,

00:41:15.655 --> 00:41:17.946
one thing that I think about
is I know a lot of schools

00:41:17.946 --> 00:41:19.430
have contracts
with big companies.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:21.062
Is that something
that you've seen?

00:41:21.062 --> 00:41:23.547
CURT ELLIS: Yeah, I mean the
roadblocks are always there.

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:25.130
And they're always
really interesting.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.930
I think what I love
about the Food Corps

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.900
model is we have
people like Sarah who

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.880
are very disarming in a
conversation with a food

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.480
service director,
because she's not

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:38.410
a hired gun outside
consultant there to tell

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:40.110
you're doing something wrong.

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.660
And she's not a finger
wagging upset parent.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.560
She's there as a young
person who is devoting a year

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.520
or more of her life
to service to help.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.110
And I have a colleague
who served in Food Corps'

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:59.880
first class but is now on
the national staff with us

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.430
who told me about how,
during the first six

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.020
months of his service
in northern Michigan,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.680
every single day he put on
his hair net and his beard,

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.810
and he went into the back
of the school kitchen,

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:13.420
and he said how can
I help you today.

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.160
And it took six months
of doing that before he

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.650
knew it was safe to say, hey,
so I've got an idea for how

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:21.720
you could help me.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.540
There's local asparagus,
local cherries,

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.000
a bunch of local farmers
here in northern Michigan

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.740
who are eager to
start selling to us.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.410
How would you feel
about piloting that?

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.618
How would you feel about
starting this work together?

00:42:32.618 --> 00:42:35.370
And the pace of change
he was able to achieve

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:38.910
by being an ally to
a food service worker

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:42.410
who has a ton of other
responsibilities on their plate

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:44.814
was really, really
pretty fantastic.

00:42:44.814 --> 00:42:46.480
SPEAKER 1: So certainly
in the Bay Area,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.480
I imagine it's not that hard to
get parents or schools on board

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.920
with the idea of healthy eating.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.290
But what's it like
in other markets?

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:56.370
I understand you guys have
members all over the country.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:58.210
What's it like in
other markets where

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.190
healthy eating and
local food isn't

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.119
as prevalent of a conversation
topic as it is out here?

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:04.910
CURT ELLIS: I think
one of the things Sarah

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.710
said is really right
and really important,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.640
which is every culture has
a version of healthy food.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.450
And your job is to kind of
unearth that and help bring it

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.270
to life.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:19.160
Our sense is there's a real risk
of an organization like Food

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.320
Corps kind of airdropping
kale around the country

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.230
and thinking we've done
good, when I think actually

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.920
that risk's doing a lot of harm.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.850
So for us, it's about
finding the ways to make

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:36.320
our work relevant to the
food culture of Jackson,

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.445
Mississippi, not imagining that
the food culture of Jackson,

00:43:39.445 --> 00:43:41.320
Mississippi should look
exactly like the food

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.620
culture of Oakland--
super different places.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.740
I think it's been really
interesting to see how,

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.620
in a number of places, what is
most resonant about the work

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.420
Food Corps does is that it's
about teaching old skills.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.900
It's about teaching kids to grow
a garden, and to cook a meal,

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.520
and to be self-sufficient in
ways that are really understood

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.300
by members of an
older generation,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:12.960
or members of the older
parts of American culture.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.670
So we tap into that a lot.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.940
In our work in
Montana, we've been

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:20.620
really successful with
grass fed beef to school

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.260
and supporting some really cool
efforts to make that transition

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.550
start to happen there.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:29.184
It's because the families in the
school are ranchers themselves

00:44:29.184 --> 00:44:30.600
and are excited
to have the chance

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:33.190
to sell beef that they've
raised on the range in Montana

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:34.615
straight into
their kid's school,

00:44:34.615 --> 00:44:37.240
and to be able to show up with
a horse, and show up with a cow,

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.510
and say, look, you know this
is what farming is like.

00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:47.130
So we're very careful to
remain above the partisan fray

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:51.160
and above the kind of
politicization of food,

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.470
because food is meant to
be personal and cultural.

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.340
And our job is to kind of
help unlock that in a way

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.960
that is good for kids.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.460
CHARLIE: We have schools.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.471
We have the home.

00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:03.470
I think also a lot of our
relationship with food

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:06.570
comes from restaurants
that we frequent.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.942
What do you see is the role of
restaurants in promoting this?

00:45:09.942 --> 00:45:12.400
And what do you think that,
whether you're a parent or just

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.816
somebody who loves
food-- what can

00:45:13.816 --> 00:45:16.720
you do to kind of
send the signal

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.940
that the restaurants
out there in our area

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.080
should take part
in this mission?

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.672
CURT ELLIS: Yeah, I mean I
think it's hugely important,

00:45:23.672 --> 00:45:25.630
especially as our food
habits have shifted more

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.530
towards eating out.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.480
We've got a real role
for restaurants to play.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.560
And you can see it happen quite
easily at high end restaurants

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.000
where the farm to table
thing has really gone off

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.770
the charts in terms of being
celebrated and fetishized maybe

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.720
a little too far in some ways.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.050
I'm most excited to
be seeing it happening

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.944
at restaurants that are down
the street from our cornfield

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:47.443
in Iowa.

00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:51.050
I'm really excited about
the work Panera is doing up

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:53.510
their supply chain
to make sure they're

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.780
sourcing food from
responsible places,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.150
and that they're not using
additives that they could use

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.870
and that a lot of other
companies have used.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.200
That stuff is really important.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.560
It makes a huge difference.

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.890
So beginning to
push as a consumer,

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.830
to show that you care
about those things,

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:13.870
is really important.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.910
One of the challenges
Chipotle faces

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:20.530
is that, for all of their
efforts to improve the supply

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.000
chain, every time they
do market research

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.817
it seems to come back that
the consumers aren't actually

00:46:25.817 --> 00:46:28.150
going there because they've
improved their supply chain.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.790
And those of us who do
go there because they've

00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:31.410
improved their supply
chain, I think,

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.410
have a real responsibility
to stand up and say, hey,

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:38.780
I'm here because you are more
responsible than other parties

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.310
about where you source
the food you're serving.

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.920
So for a while I was carrying
around these really annoying

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.970
business cards in my wallet that
explained I did not order meat

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.560
at this restaurant,
because your meat did not

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.550
come from a sustainable source.

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.970
I would encourage you to check
out the following resources

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.500
to improve your supply chains.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.300
It was a little less
snarky than that.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:01.430
But the point was the same.

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.890
I've stopped doing that, just
because it was too weird.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.180
But I think on some level
that is the message we all

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.460
need to be communicating
is, I'm making

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.610
choices for whether I
come to your restaurant,

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.110
and I'm making
choices then for what

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.470
I order at your restaurant
through a lens of health,

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:20.940
and sustainability, and
social justice, and values

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.119
that I care about.

00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:23.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.750
So it definitely
makes sense why you'd

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:29.910
start with kids in schools, but
I'd imagine in high poverty,

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.680
inner city areas
decisions from parents

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.830
is still something
that'd be really hard

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.590
to change, especially
from a price point

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:38.670
perspective and what not.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.500
So I'm curious what
you guys are seeing

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.580
in terms of changes
and challenges,

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.890
as well as what
maybe you see ahead

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.534
for you guys in
terms of that arena?

00:47:47.534 --> 00:47:49.450
CURT ELLIS: Do you want
to take a first crack?

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.240
SARAH TING: Yeah,
I think absolutely.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.130
I mean, these are large scale
problems that we're talking

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.410
about, as Curt was outlining.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:03.960
These are big, national,
international scale issues.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:08.380
And so the solutions that we
have to come at the problem

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.130
with have to be big.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:15.660
But we can do it on a
smaller scale in school food,

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:20.350
because for a lot of inner
city, low income areas,

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:23.810
school food is one of the
primary places where kids get

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:25.600
their nourishment for the day.

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.110
That's an incredibly impactful
program, potentially, for kids.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:32.980
So when you're looking at
the majority of your calories

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:36.100
coming from school food, if
we can shift the food products

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:43.490
there for kids, we can
potentially change the exposure

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:48.210
that kids have to
healthier fresh foods,

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:52.550
connect them-- reconnect them--
to their personal, cultural

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:57.020
relationship to food, and just
have the bottom line better

00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.030
nourishment so kids
can focus in school

00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:01.980
and realize their potential.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.410
And those are really big things.

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:08.260
So I think never
under estimating

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:11.650
the potential of a school
lunch or school breakfast

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:12.920
is a way to start.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:15.850
But in terms of
the larger cultural

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:22.410
and political economic
forces, it's a big challenge.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:28.250
But I think acknowledging
that it is a bigger problem,

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:33.500
and then coming to the parents,
and school administrators,

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.670
and the Nutrition Services
repairmen with that attitude

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:40.360
of saying we know this is
bigger than you all, this is not

00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:42.730
something any one
person can carry,

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:45.720
but why don't we collaborate
and collectively, together,

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.520
work on some solutions-- I
think that's a way that we

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.450
can get some real work done.

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:54.950
CURT ELLIS: Yeah, and in terms
of where Food Corps is headed

00:49:54.950 --> 00:50:00.120
from here, we have had a
really amazing first five

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.010
years of running this program.

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:03.510
And we've grown by
leaps and bounds.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:08.100
We went from a start-up that
nobody had heard, didn't exist,

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.770
to a $2 million, $4 million,
$6 million, $9 million budget.

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:14.710
We're heading
towards a $12 million

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.850
budget for the year
that's beginning now.

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.700
We have an amazing national
staff team of 35 folks

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:25.840
and then 215 Corps members in
the field across the country.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.130
And I've talked a
fair amount today

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.650
about our kind of direct
program in schools,

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:33.870
because that's really the
foundation on which all

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.760
of Food Corps'
aspirations are built.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.270
But the rest of
those aspirations

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:42.050
are really real and
important for us.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.900
The first is, if you
take that direct program,

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.170
and you get it strong
enough in enough places,

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:51.210
you can really prove the impact
of having healthy school food

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.320
environments for
kids in a way that

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.220
will be meaningful
for ultimately driving

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.190
systemic change up
here that starts

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.410
to reach towards the
100,000 school scale

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.410
at which this problem exists.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:06.840
So you start with the
refining our program

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:11.610
to really get the impact we're
all trying to drive towards,

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.516
as measured by meaningful shifts
in kids' consumption of fruits

00:51:14.516 --> 00:51:15.140
and vegetables.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:18.130
We're doing a big study with
Columbia University research

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:21.810
partners right now where they're
testing school food consumption

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.270
levels around fruits and
vegetables in particular

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.480
in a bunch of different
Food Corps schools

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.440
across eight states to help
build that evidence base.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.590
So we can scale that program
up and need to, not only

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.530
in the places we already
work, but get to critical mass

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.110
in places that are particularly
important to really

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:45.490
be operating at a meaningful
level across a school district.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:48.540
And then, on top of that
foundation of direct impact,

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.270
we have amazing
people like Sarah

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.690
who are going on to lifelong
careers in the fields of food,

00:51:54.690 --> 00:51:58.410
and health, and equity that
have incredible potential

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:01.340
to keep shaping this work
for the next generation.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.720
So already the food
service director

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.700
for all of Fayetteville,
Arkansas, that's

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:09.296
a Food Corps alum who they
loved, and created a job for,

00:52:09.296 --> 00:52:11.420
and brought back, and then
promoted to Food Service

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:12.960
Director.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.890
Here in California, we have
senior food service folks

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.585
in Monterey and North
Monterey Unified.

00:52:18.585 --> 00:52:23.310
So getting our alums on those
paths makes a huge difference.

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:27.160
Second, what could we
be doing to harness

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:28.950
the network of
other organizations

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:31.390
across the country that are
doing this work in partnership

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:33.710
with Food Corps in
other ways on their own?

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:36.620
How can we get them using
a consistent framework,

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.730
speaking with a common voice,
leveraging shared data?

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:41.720
And then ultimately,
together, how can we

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.450
take the direct impact and use
those two networks to amplify

00:52:45.450 --> 00:52:48.820
it to drive systemic change
that's around policy shifts

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.670
and culture shifts that really
help make healthy school food

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:54.705
environments the norm
rather than the exception?

00:52:54.705 --> 00:52:56.330
CHARLIE: This point
we are out of time.

00:52:56.330 --> 00:52:58.350
But I wanted to thank
Curt and Sarah again

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.190
for bringing great insight and
experience to a problem that

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.130
is very important to our
generation and future

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:04.075
generations as well.

00:53:04.075 --> 00:53:06.700
Thank you again, and I'd like to
have another round of applause

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:07.890
for Curt and Sarah.

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:10.640
[APPLAUSE]
