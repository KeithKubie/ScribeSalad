know so what makes you know it's the
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.169
know so what makes you know it's the
questions come up and we never really

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
questions come up and we never really
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.090
questions come up and we never really
thought about it that much it's more

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100
thought about it that much it's more
 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.910
thought about it that much it's more
that people ask us about it a lot and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
that people ask us about it a lot and
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.160
that people ask us about it a lot and
that there's conferences like the you

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170
that there's conferences like the you
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.840
that there's conferences like the you
know unfortunate most powerful women's

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850
know unfortunate most powerful women's
 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.150
know unfortunate most powerful women's
conference like it's really fun but I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160
conference like it's really fun but I
 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.650
conference like it's really fun but I
find that people then end up talking a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660
find that people then end up talking a
 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.150

woman and to be honest for me the
 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.240
woman and to be honest for me the
biggest change was that there was

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250
biggest change was that there was
 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.530
biggest change was that there was
in the bathroom so but other but other

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540
in the bathroom so but other but other
 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.870
in the bathroom so but other but other
than that you know it was it was great

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
than that you know it was it was great
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.520
than that you know it was it was great
it was great when we had more people who

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530
it was great when we had more people who
 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.050
it was great when we had more people who
were all pregnant at the same time and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
were all pregnant at the same time and
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.850
were all pregnant at the same time and
everyone was couldn't commiserate about

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860
everyone was couldn't commiserate about
 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.320
everyone was couldn't commiserate about
breastfeeding you know I could which I

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
breastfeeding you know I could which I
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.300
breastfeeding you know I could which I
guess is unique but it's it's you know

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310
guess is unique but it's it's you know
 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.820
guess is unique but it's it's you know
it's it's it we never really thought

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830
it's it's it we never really thought
 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.360
it's it's it we never really thought
about that much

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
 
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.100
 
I'd say 23

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110
I'd say 23
 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.530
I'd say 23
so as much as we have the reputation for

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540
so as much as we have the reputation for
 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.020
so as much as we have the reputation for
being the consumer oriented company and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030
being the consumer oriented company and
 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.150
being the consumer oriented company and
we are consumer oriented were so heavy

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160
we are consumer oriented were so heavy
 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.300
we are consumer oriented were so heavy
on the science that to us it was it was

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310
on the science that to us it was it was
 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.010
on the science that to us it was it was
sort of obvious you know of course

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020
sort of obvious you know of course
 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.940
sort of obvious you know of course
you're gonna want your genetic

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950
you're gonna want your genetic
 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.470
you're gonna want your genetic
information we all want our genetic

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
information we all want our genetic
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.120
information we all want our genetic
information why would you not want a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130
information why would you not want a
 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.400
information why would you not want a
Matic information and I think that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410
Matic information and I think that
 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.560
Matic information and I think that
that's probably something that we we

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570
that's probably something that we we
 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.480
that's probably something that we we
underestimated in terms of the fact that

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490
underestimated in terms of the fact that
 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.050
underestimated in terms of the fact that
people don't really necessarily know

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
people don't really necessarily know
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.699
people don't really necessarily know
exactly why you know what what do they

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709
exactly why you know what what do they
 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.170
exactly why you know what what do they
want to do with them what do they want

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180
want to do with them what do they want
 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540
want to do with them what do they want
to do with the genetic information why

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550
to do with the genetic information why
 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.540
to do with the genetic information why
would they want it and and creating you

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550
would they want it and and creating you
 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.620
would they want it and and creating you
know I think about other industries

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630
know I think about other industries
 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.660
know I think about other industries
where it's been a big technology shift

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670
where it's been a big technology shift
 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.420
where it's been a big technology shift
so something like TiVo TiVo was a big

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430
so something like TiVo TiVo was a big
 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.250
so something like TiVo TiVo was a big
shift in how people watch TV but

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260
shift in how people watch TV but
 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.010
shift in how people watch TV but
everyone understood the concept of TV no

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020
everyone understood the concept of TV no
 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.660
everyone understood the concept of TV no
one really understands the concept of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670
one really understands the concept of
 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.800
one really understands the concept of
well why would I want my genetic

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810
well why would I want my genetic
 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.020
well why would I want my genetic
information and and I think one of the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030
information and and I think one of the
 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.460
information and and I think one of the
other big challenges that we have is

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470
other big challenges that we have is
 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.180
other big challenges that we have is
that people healthcare is not a true and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190
that people healthcare is not a true and
 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.800
that people healthcare is not a true and
just health care's on a true free market

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
just health care's on a true free market
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.750
just health care's on a true free market
because you are used to going to your

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760
because you are used to going to your
 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.150
because you are used to going to your
doctor and saying you want XY and z and

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
doctor and saying you want XY and z and
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.910
doctor and saying you want XY and z and
not paying for it and and so for that

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920
not paying for it and and so for that
 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.650
not paying for it and and so for that
reason us telling people why you can get

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660
reason us telling people why you can get
 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.600
reason us telling people why you can get
access to your genetic information it's

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610
access to your genetic information it's
 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.580
access to your genetic information it's
much cheaper than you know some of the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590
much cheaper than you know some of the
 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.440
much cheaper than you know some of the
other ways you could get it and it's all

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450
other ways you could get it and it's all
 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.140
other ways you could get it and it's all
within your control that that's actually

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150
within your control that that's actually
 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.759
within your control that that's actually
a hard leap for a lot of people because

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769
a hard leap for a lot of people because
 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:04.900
a hard leap for a lot of people because
they're not used to paying for anything

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910
they're not used to paying for anything
 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.150
they're not used to paying for anything
for healthcare so it's one of the things

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160
for healthcare so it's one of the things
 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.460
for healthcare so it's one of the things
that we fact we've discovered that we

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470
that we fact we've discovered that we
 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.820
that we fact we've discovered that we
have to educate people a lot more about

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830
have to educate people a lot more about
 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.250
have to educate people a lot more about
you know preventive care why they should

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260
you know preventive care why they should
 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.380
you know preventive care why they should
actually invest in that and what are

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390
actually invest in that and what are
 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.310
actually invest in that and what are
things that they should do with the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320
things that they should do with the
 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.420
things that they should do with the
information and the fact that they

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430
information and the fact that they
 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.740
information and the fact that they
actually are going to have to take a lot

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750
actually are going to have to take a lot
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.080
actually are going to have to take a lot
more responsibility for for their health

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090
more responsibility for for their health
 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.420
more responsibility for for their health
and and that's a that's a pretty big

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430
and and that's a that's a pretty big
 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.600
and and that's a that's a pretty big
adjustment for people

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610
 
 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.779
 
I think those huge those huge questions

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:32.789
I think those huge those huge questions
 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.270
I think those huge those huge questions
- to deal with it was funny early on in

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280
- to deal with it was funny early on in
 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.800
- to deal with it was funny early on in
the company we engaged with a number of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810
the company we engaged with a number of
 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.020
the company we engaged with a number of
different bioethicists and we actually

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030
different bioethicists and we actually
 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.580
different bioethicists and we actually
talked about employing someone and then

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590
talked about employing someone and then
 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.439
talked about employing someone and then
we actually couldn't get anyone to join

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449
we actually couldn't get anyone to join
 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.420
we actually couldn't get anyone to join
because everyone found that this topic

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430
because everyone found that this topic
 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.369
because everyone found that this topic
was so interesting that they felt that

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379
was so interesting that they felt that
 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.719
was so interesting that they felt that
they this was going to be pivotal to

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729
they this was going to be pivotal to
 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.209
they this was going to be pivotal to
their academic career so so we've

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:50.219
their academic career so so we've
 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:51.679
their academic career so so we've
engaged with a number of people we've

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:51.689
engaged with a number of people we've
 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:53.510
engaged with a number of people we've
gotten them to you know always give us

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520
gotten them to you know always give us
 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.300
gotten them to you know always give us
feedback on it but fundamentally one

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
feedback on it but fundamentally one
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.469
feedback on it but fundamentally one
things we've realized it's an it's an

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479
things we've realized it's an it's an
 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.330
things we've realized it's an it's an
incredibly interesting area for the

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340
incredibly interesting area for the
 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.779
incredibly interesting area for the
ethics community to talk about you know

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789
ethics community to talk about you know
 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.939
ethics community to talk about you know
fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes is

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949
fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes is
 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.070
fundamentally what 23 Emmy believes is
that it's really about choice and if you

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080
that it's really about choice and if you
 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.540
that it's really about choice and if you
want to get access to something that is

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550
want to get access to something that is
 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.700
want to get access to something that is
fundamentally yours we believe it's your

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710
fundamentally yours we believe it's your
 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.459
fundamentally yours we believe it's your
right to get access to it it's not for

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469
right to get access to it it's not for
 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:16.010
right to get access to it it's not for
everyone that's abundantly clear to us

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020
everyone that's abundantly clear to us
 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.510
everyone that's abundantly clear to us
and those people should not have to do

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520
and those people should not have to do
 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.450
and those people should not have to do
it and so you know 23andme really wants

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460
it and so you know 23andme really wants
 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.209
it and so you know 23andme really wants
to encourage the debate we want to

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219
to encourage the debate we want to
 

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.350
to encourage the debate we want to
encourage the debate we want to be a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360
encourage the debate we want to be a
 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.089
encourage the debate we want to be a
participant in it we want to be

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099
participant in it we want to be
 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.339
participant in it we want to be
supportive of it and I think we've

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349
supportive of it and I think we've
 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.379
supportive of it and I think we've
remained very firm in that we believe

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389
remained very firm in that we believe
 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.760
remained very firm in that we believe
individuals should have the right to get

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770
individuals should have the right to get
 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.790
individuals should have the right to get
access to this information and how it's

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800
access to this information and how it's
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.700
access to this information and how it's
going to be used and what are the right

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710
going to be used and what are the right
 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.809
going to be used and what are the right
what are the good things or what are the

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819
what are the good things or what are the
 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.999
what are the good things or what are the
bad things that society really needs to

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009
bad things that society really needs to
 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.769
bad things that society really needs to
have that debate and 23andme will be

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779
have that debate and 23andme will be
 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.930
have that debate and 23andme will be
there but it's society too should put

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940
there but it's society too should put
 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.879
there but it's society too should put
the limits on it

out here and we have individuals with
 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.129
out here and we have individuals with
Parkinson's were given a discounted

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139
Parkinson's were given a discounted
 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:01.279
Parkinson's were given a discounted
version of the 23andme so we've designed

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289
version of the 23andme so we've designed
 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.920
version of the 23andme so we've designed
the 23andme site so that individuals can

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930
the 23andme site so that individuals can
 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.320
the 23andme site so that individuals can
get access to their data they can fill

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330
get access to their data they can fill
 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.999
get access to their data they can fill
out surveys specifically about

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009
out surveys specifically about
 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.950
out surveys specifically about
Parkinson's as well as about their

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960
Parkinson's as well as about their
 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.559
Parkinson's as well as about their
general health and they get all the

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569
general health and they get all the
 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:14.719
general health and they get all the
other access so information about their

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729
other access so information about their
 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.909
other access so information about their
ancestry they can connect and share with

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919
ancestry they can connect and share with
 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.589
ancestry they can connect and share with
individuals there's a community portion

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:18.599
individuals there's a community portion
 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.809
individuals there's a community portion
they can learn from people so we want to

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:20.819
they can learn from people so we want to
 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.519
they can learn from people so we want to
have a really engaging experience for

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:22.529
have a really engaging experience for
 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.320
have a really engaging experience for
people so that we can keep getting

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330
people so that we can keep getting
 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.749
people so that we can keep getting
information from them so we have one

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759
information from them so we have one
 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.700
information from them so we have one
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.080
Parkinson's survey now we will plan to
have additional Parkinson's surveys

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090
have additional Parkinson's surveys
 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.570
have additional Parkinson's surveys
because the long-term goal is how do I

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580
because the long-term goal is how do I
 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.700
because the long-term goal is how do I
get information about you today but

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710
get information about you today but
 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.959
get information about you today but
let's say I want to know how does your

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969
let's say I want to know how does your
 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.019
let's say I want to know how does your
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24
 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:41.329
Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24
months in 48 months because that

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:41.339
months in 48 months because that
 

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.219
months in 48 months because that
information will be really valuable to

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229
information will be really valuable to
 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.439
information will be really valuable to
correlate with your genetic information

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449
correlate with your genetic information
 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.510
correlate with your genetic information
so then comes in 23 and we on the back

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
so then comes in 23 and we on the back
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.300
so then comes in 23 and we on the back
end our researchers in house are

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310
end our researchers in house are
 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.369
end our researchers in house are
actually analyzing all the data so all

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379
actually analyzing all the data so all
 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:53.779
actually analyzing all the data so all
the information that we're collecting

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789
the information that we're collecting
 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:55.610
the information that we're collecting
through the surveys they then compare

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620
through the surveys they then compare
 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.529
through the surveys they then compare
with the genetic information and what

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539
with the genetic information and what
 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:58.670
with the genetic information and what
we're finding is we're actually making

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680
we're finding is we're actually making
 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.050
we're finding is we're actually making
really interesting discoveries so on all

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060
really interesting discoveries so on all
 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.040
really interesting discoveries so on all
the different questions that we're

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050
the different questions that we're
 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.439
the different questions that we're
asking about so we'll hope to announce

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449
asking about so we'll hope to announce
 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.800
asking about so we'll hope to announce
soon information about you know because

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810
soon information about you know because
 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.029
soon information about you know because
this Parkinson's community came together

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039
this Parkinson's community came together
 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.459
this Parkinson's community came together
what are some of the discoveries that we

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:13.469
what are some of the discoveries that we
 

00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:15.139
what are some of the discoveries that we
have made and what are those discoveries

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:15.149
have made and what are those discoveries
 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:16.790
have made and what are those discoveries
what kinds of discoveries will benefit

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800
what kinds of discoveries will benefit
 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.950
what kinds of discoveries will benefit
that community so that might also

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960
that community so that might also
 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.839
that community so that might also
integrate with a lot of the clinical

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:20.849
integrate with a lot of the clinical
 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:22.909
integrate with a lot of the clinical
trials that are happening where clinical

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919
trials that are happening where clinical
 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:24.559
trials that are happening where clinical
trials are happening you know either on

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569
trials are happening you know either on
 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.029
trials are happening you know either on
drugs where we can potentially help

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039
drugs where we can potentially help
 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.159
drugs where we can potentially help
figure out why some people respond some

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169
figure out why some people respond some
 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.920
figure out why some people respond some
people don't respond what where there's

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930
people don't respond what where there's
 

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.409
people don't respond what where there's
toxicity or there's not toxicity and

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419
toxicity or there's not toxicity and
 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.610
toxicity or there's not toxicity and
some of a lot of the Parkinson's

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620
some of a lot of the Parkinson's
 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.559
some of a lot of the Parkinson's
patients are eager to participate in

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:36.569
patients are eager to participate in
 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:38.510
patients are eager to participate in
clinical trials so we might be able to

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520
clinical trials so we might be able to
 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.159
clinical trials so we might be able to
help make sure that they're they can

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169
help make sure that they're they can
 

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:41.570
help make sure that they're they can
find a clinical trial that makes sense

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:41.580
find a clinical trial that makes sense
 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.820
find a clinical trial that makes sense
for them

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830
 
 

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.860
 
I think the biggest problem in clinical

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870
I think the biggest problem in clinical
 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.270
I think the biggest problem in clinical
trials is that they're underpowered and

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:48.280
trials is that they're underpowered and
 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.310
trials is that they're underpowered and
that fundamentally that the studies are

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.320
that fundamentally that the studies are
 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.110
that fundamentally that the studies are
just too small and they're designed in

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120
just too small and they're designed in
 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.220
just too small and they're designed in
such a way because they're so expensive

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:53.230
such a way because they're so expensive
 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.690
such a way because they're so expensive
they're designed in such a way that

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:54.700
they're designed in such a way that
 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.840
they're designed in such a way that
they're just there's a small cushion and

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:57.850
they're just there's a small cushion and
 

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.790
they're just there's a small cushion and
so you know they're expensive to run if

00:07:59.790 --> 00:07:59.800
so you know they're expensive to run if
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.980
so you know they're expensive to run if
you need if you need a thousand patients

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990
you need if you need a thousand patients
 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.140
you need if you need a thousand patients
to really get the Clint the power that

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.150
to really get the Clint the power that
 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.110
to really get the Clint the power that
you're looking for maybe you have 1,100

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120
you're looking for maybe you have 1,100
 

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.130
you're looking for maybe you have 1,100
but what we're finding is that those

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.140
but what we're finding is that those
 

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.080
but what we're finding is that those
actually are still underpowered so the

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.090
actually are still underpowered so the
 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.420
actually are still underpowered so the
advantage of 23andme that we can do is

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:12.430
advantage of 23andme that we can do is
 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.820
advantage of 23andme that we can do is
we can actually have huge datasets where

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:14.830
we can actually have huge datasets where
 

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.590
we can actually have huge datasets where
we're not looking to collect you know a

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:16.600
we're not looking to collect you know a
 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.270
we're not looking to collect you know a
hundred people with cancer or a thousand

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280
hundred people with cancer or a thousand
 

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.190
hundred people with cancer or a thousand
people with you know multiple sclerosis

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.200
people with you know multiple sclerosis
 

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.710
people with you know multiple sclerosis
we want you know tens of thousands so

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720
we want you know tens of thousands so
 

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.420
we want you know tens of thousands so
the Parkinson's initiative we've

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:24.430
the Parkinson's initiative we've
 

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:25.830
the Parkinson's initiative we've
announced you know we have over 3,000

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840
announced you know we have over 3,000
 

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.960
announced you know we have over 3,000
people with Parkinson's in it which is

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:27.970
people with Parkinson's in it which is
 

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.270
people with Parkinson's in it which is
you know on a relative basis one of the

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280
you know on a relative basis one of the
 

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.610
you know on a relative basis one of the
largest cohorts out there now so we're

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:32.620
largest cohorts out there now so we're
 

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.320
largest cohorts out there now so we're
looking to develop these large cohorts

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:34.330
looking to develop these large cohorts
 

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.020
looking to develop these large cohorts
and keep asking questions I think one of

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.030
and keep asking questions I think one of
 

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.610
and keep asking questions I think one of
the other advantages that we have is

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:38.620
the other advantages that we have is
 

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.260
the other advantages that we have is
that we can ask these Parkinson's

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.270
that we can ask these Parkinson's
 

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.300
that we can ask these Parkinson's
patients about their Parkinson's but

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:42.310
patients about their Parkinson's but
 

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:43.980
patients about their Parkinson's but
we're also learning about all these

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:43.990
we're also learning about all these
 

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.870
we're also learning about all these
other aspects of them so we asked the

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880
other aspects of them so we asked the
 

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.520
other aspects of them so we asked the
general health survey and then we're

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:47.530
general health survey and then we're
 

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.290
general health survey and then we're
asking about commonly is drugs so you

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.300
asking about commonly is drugs so you
 

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.330
asking about commonly is drugs so you
know do they get a stomachache when they

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:51.340
know do they get a stomachache when they
 

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.010
know do they get a stomachache when they
take Advil how do they respond to

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.020
take Advil how do they respond to
 

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.200
take Advil how do they respond to
benadryl things like that so it's a

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.210
benadryl things like that so it's a
 

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.970
benadryl things like that so it's a
cohort where we can keep learning more

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:56.980
cohort where we can keep learning more
 

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.290
cohort where we can keep learning more
and more things from them I think we're

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.300
and more things from them I think we're
 

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.080
and more things from them I think we're
very focused on developing or

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:01.090
very focused on developing or
 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.640
very focused on developing or
understanding the the relationship

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:02.650
understanding the the relationship
 

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.530
understanding the the relationship
between genetics and drug response and

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:04.540
between genetics and drug response and
 

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.970
between genetics and drug response and
so that could be either on the efficacy

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:05.980
so that could be either on the efficacy
 

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.280
so that could be either on the efficacy
side or the safety side but you know

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.290
side or the safety side but you know
 

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.020
side or the safety side but you know
there's it's a well-known studies that

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:10.030
there's it's a well-known studies that
 

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.090
there's it's a well-known studies that
have come out that said 50% of all drugs

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.100
have come out that said 50% of all drugs
 

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.280
have come out that said 50% of all drugs
that we take to have no effect on you so

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.290
that we take to have no effect on you so
 

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.170
that we take to have no effect on you so
what we would like to understand is if

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:16.180
what we would like to understand is if
 

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.880
what we would like to understand is if
you're given a drug is that going to

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:17.890
you're given a drug is that going to
 

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.220
you're given a drug is that going to
respond yes or no and is it going to be

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:20.230
respond yes or no and is it going to be
 

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.080
respond yes or no and is it going to be
safe yes or no and that's going to be a

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.090
safe yes or no and that's going to be a
 

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:26.650
safe yes or no and that's going to be a
critical mission of 23andme

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:26.660
 
 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.809
 
to me it's very interesting that it's so

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:28.819
to me it's very interesting that it's so
 

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:30.699
to me it's very interesting that it's so
controversial the fact that it's it's

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:30.709
controversial the fact that it's it's
 

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:33.189
controversial the fact that it's it's
it's not deterministic because

00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:33.199
it's not deterministic because
 

00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:34.990
it's not deterministic because
throughout my life in medicine

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000
throughout my life in medicine
 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.689
throughout my life in medicine
I have never I've very rarely get a test

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:37.699
I have never I've very rarely get a test
 

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:40.090

high cholesterol again that's a risk

00:09:58.749 --> 00:09:58.759
high cholesterol again that's a risk
 

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:00.220
high cholesterol again that's a risk
base it means that I have a risk factor

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.230
base it means that I have a risk factor
 

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.769
base it means that I have a risk factor
for heart disease but it didn't tell me

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:02.779
for heart disease but it didn't tell me
 

00:10:02.779 --> 00:10:04.600

specifically you are gonna die of heart

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:09.769
specifically you are gonna die of heart
 

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:13.179

disease so in my opinion my you know

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:13.189
disease so in my opinion my you know
 

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:14.410

I've been very comfortable with having
 

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.259
I've been very comfortable with having
diagnostic tests that that tell me that

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:17.269
diagnostic tests that that tell me that
 

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:19.420
diagnostic tests that that tell me that
I might be at higher risk or lower risk

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:19.430
I might be at higher risk or lower risk
 

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.199

the things that he's found is that it's
not that well studied just yet because

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:45.230
not that well studied just yet because
 

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.920
not that well studied just yet because
it was a relatively recent discovery but

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:47.930
it was a relatively recent discovery but
 

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.480
it was a relatively recent discovery but
there is information there about things

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:49.490
there is information there about things
 

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.460
there is information there about things
you can do to prevent Parkinson's so

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:51.470

critics all three of those things are
 

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.819
critics all three of those things are
great for his health regardless so he

00:11:03.819 --> 00:11:03.829
great for his health regardless so he
 

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:06.309

coffee so so I'm really you know I'm

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:14.059
coffee so so I'm really you know I'm
 

00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:15.189
coffee so so I'm really you know I'm
really happy that we got that

really happy that we got that
 

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:17.590
really happy that we got that
information because even if it comes out

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600
information because even if it comes out
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.120
information because even if it comes out
later that though he has other genes

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.130
later that though he has other genes
 

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.030
later that though he has other genes
that you know decreases risk and

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:22.040
that you know decreases risk and
 

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.410
that you know decreases risk and
therefore he's sort of at average risk

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.420
therefore he's sort of at average risk
 

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.189
therefore he's sort of at average risk

so I think that Google's been really

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:24.580
so I think that Google's been really
 

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.330
so I think that Google's been really
inspiring in that way and that they keep

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:26.340
inspiring in that way and that they keep
 

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.590
inspiring in that way and that they keep
you know things like the the book

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600
you know things like the the book
 

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.150
you know things like the the book
settlement like even you know all these

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160
settlement like even you know all these
 

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.350
settlement like even you know all these
things that they're doing I'm I'm

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360
things that they're doing I'm I'm
 

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.180
things that they're doing I'm I'm
continuously impressed by the challenges

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:33.190
continuously impressed by the challenges
 

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.310
continuously impressed by the challenges
that they take on and I hope that the

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320
that they take on and I hope that the
 

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.740
that they take on and I hope that the
same thing happens for 23 me

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:39.750
 
 

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.949
 
the amount of information I think it's

00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959
the amount of information I think it's
 

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:44.449
the amount of information I think it's
we definitely are suffering from an

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:44.459
we definitely are suffering from an
 

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:46.819
we definitely are suffering from an
information overload but I believe that

00:12:46.819 --> 00:12:46.829
information overload but I believe that
 

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:47.990
information overload but I believe that
there's going to be better and better

I'm really excited about radiology I

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959
I'm really excited about radiology I
 

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.780
I'm really excited about radiology I
think I'm I've never seen there's a

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:38.790
think I'm I've never seen there's a

every October and the stuff that's
 

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.259
every October and the stuff that's
happening in radiology is fascinating

and the stuff you can do with imaging

00:13:47.179 --> 00:13:47.189
and the stuff you can do with imaging
 

00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:49.730
and the stuff you can do with imaging
and I just think that technology and

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740
and I just think that technology and
 

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.160
and I just think that technology and
information is it's overwhelming at the

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.170
information is it's overwhelming at the
 

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.299
information is it's overwhelming at the
moment but I think it's really going to

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:53.309
moment but I think it's really going to
 

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:55.429
moment but I think it's really going to
have a major it's really going to make

mother than my my biggest concern
 

00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:07.389
mother than my my biggest concern
becomes is the health you know coming if

00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399
becomes is the health you know coming if
 

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:10.509
becomes is the health you know coming if
I was diagnosed with something you know

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519

and so for me health health is we know a

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:18.889
and so for me health health is we know a
 

00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:20.350
and so for me health health is we know a
lot about technology and we know a lot

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360
lot about technology and we know a lot
 

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.210
lot about technology and we know a lot
about you know the world but I think

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:22.220
about you know the world but I think
 

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.799
about you know the world but I think
health is the one area where I find that

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:23.809
health is the one area where I find that
 

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:26.439

and how that was the next big area but

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160
and how that was the next big area but
 

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.520
and how that was the next big area but
people like that who were just so

to say I was lucky to live in an area

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:31.470
to say I was lucky to live in an area
 

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.010
to say I was lucky to live in an area
where I was surrounded by such great

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.020
where I was surrounded by such great

me so you know it's a lot of local
 

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.960
me so you know it's a lot of local
heroes but but it's the people who

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:41.970
heroes but but it's the people who
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.740
heroes but but it's the people who
impacted me the most

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:45.750
 
 

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.720
 
the worst advice I probably ever got is

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:47.730
the worst advice I probably ever got is
 

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:52.790
the worst advice I probably ever got is
when I I was done with Wall Street in

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800
when I I was done with Wall Street in
 

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.950
when I I was done with Wall Street in
2000 I took off here to travel I was

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:54.960
2000 I took off here to travel I was
 

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.150
2000 I took off here to travel I was
gonna go to med school and and I got a

00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160
gonna go to med school and and I got a
 

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.300
gonna go to med school and and I got a
job offer to go back to Wall Street and

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:01.310
job offer to go back to Wall Street and
 

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.500
job offer to go back to Wall Street and
and I kind of did it probably mostly

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:03.510
and I kind of did it probably mostly
 

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:04.910
and I kind of did it probably mostly
just I was like wow that's I can make

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920
just I was like wow that's I can make
 

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.890
just I was like wow that's I can make
enough money to pay for med school it

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:06.900
enough money to pay for med school it
 

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:10.370
enough money to pay for med school it
will be easy and and everyone was really

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380
will be easy and and everyone was really
 

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.410
will be easy and and everyone was really
supportive of that and and I think that

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420
supportive of that and and I think that
 

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.120
supportive of that and and I think that
when you have you know Wall Street was

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.130
when you have you know Wall Street was
 

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:15.680
when you have you know Wall Street was
sort of at the height of the fame

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:15.690
sort of at the height of the fame
 

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.720
sort of at the height of the fame
everyone thought it was really cool and

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:17.730
everyone thought it was really cool and
 

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.600
everyone thought it was really cool and
I think doing taking that job was
