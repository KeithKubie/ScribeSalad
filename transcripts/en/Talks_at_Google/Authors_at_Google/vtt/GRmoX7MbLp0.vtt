00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon, everyone.
And welcome to another exciting Authors at

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.509
Google Talk.
Today, we're very honored to host Viktor Mayer-Schonberger.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:15.130
He's the Associate Professor of Public Policy
and the Director of Information and Innovation

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.560
on Policy at the Research Centre at the National
University of Singapore.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.590
He's also a faculty affiliate at the Belfer
Center of Science and International Affairs

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.250
at Harvard University.
And his love of the tech world dates way back.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.430
Even in the early 80's, he led one of the
first companies to work on antivirus protocols.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.469
And he developed Virus Utilities, which became
one of the bestselling Austrian software product

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.570
of that time.
And, as you know, the Internet has developed

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.910
and keeps acquiring data by the gigabyte every
day, just like a giant, virtual addict.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.480
Much of the work we do here at Google, of
course, is to make sense of all the mass,

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.920
and bring order to the chaos, and also to
place it in the context of history.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.570
As an impulsive saver myself, I'm a huge fan
of Gmail's archive, you know, uploading my

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.790
files to the picasa as a permanent storage.
And, you know, having all my blog posts saved

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580
in Google Reader.
But, what does that all mean for the future?

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.540
Like, how are folks from the future going
to make sense of it, and how am I going to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.390
make sense of it later on?
Do we really need everything?

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.170
In this case, Viktor's book paints the picture.
The book is called "Delete: The virtue of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.960
forgetting."
Do we really need tools that automatically

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.170
capture everything?
For those of you who may have been here for

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.580
our previous talk a few weeks ago, we hosted
Gordon Bell and Jim Gemmell, who are two researchers

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.079
a little bit at the opposite end of this spectrum.
They literally record everything that happens

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.840
to them at 24 hours a day.
But, is that really necessary, and how will

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.930
future researchers and lawyers use our corpus
of information?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.540
So Viktor will help us answer those questions.
Towards the end of the talk, we will have

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.979
time for a Question and Answer session.
So we'll have a mic available.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.450
And, without further ado, please join me in
welcoming Viktor.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:22.030
Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt; [applause]

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.030
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
Thank you for having me.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.629
This is an interesting experience for me to
talk about forgetting at Google.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:42.379
So, I have not a real presentation in the
"presentation" sense, and it's also not like

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.080
a bookreading.
It's more like a meditation -- a meditation

00:02:48.080 --> 00:03:00.569
of the importance of forgetting and remembering.
We okay with the audio and everything?

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:10.140
Stacy Snyder wanted to be a teacher.
By spring of 2006, she had completed her coursework,

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.990
and she was looking forward to her teacher's
certificate.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.990
Then, from one day to the next, her dream
was over.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.599
She was summoned to the administration of
the university, and told that she would not

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.190
receive her certificate.
She would not be a teacher, she was told,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.140
although she had the credits, passed the exams,
completed the practical training.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.129
She would not be given her certificate, because
her behavior was unbecoming of a teacher.

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:52.810
Her behavior? A photograph, showing her with
a cap and a cup, captioned, "Drunken Pirate."

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.010
Stacy Snyder had put this photograph on her
MySpace page for her friends to see and perhaps

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.370
to chuckle.
But the university administration found the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.409
photo, and found the photo to induce minors
to consume alcohol, and therefore, to be unbecoming

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.579
of a future teacher.
When Stacy was confronted by the university

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.680
administration, she considered taking the
photo offline, but it was too late.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.970
Her photo had been indexed by search engines
like yours and archived by web crawlers.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.360
As much as Stacy wanted the photo to be forgotten,
the Internet wouldn't permit that. Remembering

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:44.970
instead of forgetting.
Remembering. Forgetting.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:53.810
In 2001, Andrew Feldmar, a Canadian psychotherapist
living in Vancouver, wrote an academic article

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.900
in a journal.
In the article, he mentioned that in the 60's

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:07.120
he had taken LSD.
In the summer of 2006, like many times before,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:14.650
Andrew Feldmar wanted to cross into the United
States to pick up a friend from Seattle International

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.500
Airport.
The immigration officer Googled "Feldmar,"

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.460
and discovered the academic article from 2001.
Because Andrew Feldmar had failed to disclose

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.620
to the administration office -- although he
had never denied it -- that he had taken drugs

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:41.910
40 years earlier, he was barred from entering
the United States forever.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.539
Remembering instead of forgetting.
Of course, you may say, "Now, Stacy's and

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.090
Andrew's cases are tragic, but at least, in
part, because of their own fault.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.400
Had they not put the information online, Stacy
would now be a teacher and Andrew could still

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.759
drive into the United States.
Everybody has to decide for herself or for

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.240
himself what to make available online."
To paraphrase [indistinct], "What once has

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.590
been put on the web is no longer forgotten."
Really?

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:22.860
Do we really know every time information about
us is being collected, stored, and made accessible?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.800
Do you know that the information, for example,
you put on your change-of-address-card in

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.560
your local post office when you move does
not go to the post office?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.740
It goes directly to the Direct Marketing Association.
Do you know that most states in the United

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:47.230
States have no policy to delete DNA information
that has been collected from you when you

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.639
were a witness or a victim of a crime?
Instead of deleting that DNA information once

00:06:52.639 --> 00:07:00.389
the case has been closed, law enforcement
in this country will run criminal searches

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:06.130
against you, against your DNA information,
for decades to come.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.800
You're an automatic suspect.
Remembering. Forgetting.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:17.740
For millennia, for us humans, forgetting has
been easy.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.430
It's built into us.
Biologically, we forget most of what we experience

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:28.740
every day: Our feelings, our thoughts.
Remembering is the hard part.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:35.150
Since the beginning of time, therefore, we
humans have tried to overcome biological forgetting

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.539
and to hold to memories that are precious.
For thousands of years, we have tried -- like

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:47.990
this Navaho in this picture -- to pass on
our memories to our children in the hope that

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.470
they may too be thus able to remember.
This is how the great epics of the world came

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:59.669
into being thousands of years ago.
But human memory, as we know, is not fixed.

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:03.509
It changes as we reconstruct continuously
our past.

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:10.120
Depending on it may not be sufficient, especially
when we want to capture something precisely,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.750
or for a long period of time.
Painting, as humans found out, is one way

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:22.190
of encapsulating a visual impression to create
an external, more precise, and more-lasting

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:29.889
memory, like this beautiful cave painting
from the caves of Alta Mira.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.640
Script, originally developed -- whether you
believe it -- by accountants, searching for

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:42.130
a precise method of remembering, has for millennia
remained humanity's preferred external memory.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:49.940
Language, painting, script provided us with
the capacity to remember through generations

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.160
and across time.
But these tools have not altered a fundamental

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:02.029
fact that, for us human beings, forgetting
is easy, and remembering is hard, time consuming,

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:05.580
and costly.
The book did not change this either.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:11.880
Neither did the phonograph or film.
Remembering remained expensive for most human

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:19.490
beings, and was thus chosen carefully.
Forgetting was the default; remembering, the

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.830
exception.
This enabled us to deal with time.

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:30.519
Through our physiological capacity to forget,
we rid ourselves of excess memory.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:39.110
What has long been past fades in our mind.
Thus, we pay tribute to time and to depreciate

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:45.269
what is no longer important -- what is no
longer relevant to our present.

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:52.899
But, because forgetting is biological, we
humans never had to develop a cognitive capacity

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:57.910
to deliberately forget.
That is, to depreciate memories and to make

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.230
them fade.
Today, this is different.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:07.820
You guys remember, Yahoo remembers, Amazon
remembers, the Internet Archive remembers.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.880
Flight reservation systems remember.
Yes, you didn't know that.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.920
If you look for a flight, never book it, still
remembers it six months with your name,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.829
of course.
From biological forgetting, we have moved

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:24.459
to permanent remembering.
You know, as much as I do, how this came apart.

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:30.890
Four elements: Digitization, the increase
in storage capacity to track, Moore's Law,

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:37.690
the increase of IC density, easy retrieval,
and fast global infrastructures.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.720
Taken together, this has led to remembering
becoming the default, and forgetting, the

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:48.180
exception.
To the extent that should be absolute reason

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:53.340
for celebration.
After all, haven't we humans tried for thousands

00:10:53.340 --> 00:11:02.600
of years to overcome the straightjacket of
biological forgetting and failing human memories?

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.019
And, in fact, our vast digital memories offer
numerous benefits, from improved accuracy

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:15.280
to increased efficiency to, ultimately, the
promise to help us overcome human mortality.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.190
But by the same token, I believe that forgetting
has consequences, or the undoing of forgetting

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:29.610
has consequences far beyond the narrow confines
of efficiency.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:43.860
Two words characterize what I believe is truly
at stake: Power and Time.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.480
Power is a relative and relational term.
As information privacy scholars have long

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:52.029
argued, power over information may translate
into power over the person the information

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:57.360
pertains or relates to.
If others not only have information about

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.339
us, but the capacity to keep such information
in digital storage, accessible long after

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:10.279
we ourselves have forgotten about it, this
informational power increases, and has the

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:14.040
potential to influence how we transact and
interact.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:21.750
But power is not only diactic.
Jeremy Benton in the 19th century.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:29.459
Jeremy Benton proposed the panopticon.
The panopticon is the concept of a prison

00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:35.180
in which the prison guards can watch the prisoners
without the prisoners knowing when they're

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:43.950
being watched.
The aim is behavioral compliance through the

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:49.149
threat of invisible surveillance.
Oscar Gandian Utters have suggested that the

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:55.279
Internet may help create a sense of a global
panopticon in which everybody has to assume

00:12:55.279 --> 00:13:00.290
that she's been watched all the time.
Such a panopticon may lead people to self-censor,

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:06.700
fearing that their utterances could be misconstrued
by any one of the hundreds of millions of

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:08.950
people in thousands of jurisdictions around
the world.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:20.970
A few years back, the American CEO of the
Bavarian of the German subsidiary of CompuServe

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:29.380
in Munich, Bavaria, was apprehended and charged
with criminal misconduct by the Bavarian authorities

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:37.280
for a UseNet posting placed in the United
States, but held temporarily on a CompuServe

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:44.470
server in the local office.
The economists at that time wrote, "If Bavaria

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:50.079
wrinkles its nose, must the world catch a
cold?"

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:56.290
That is what the global panopticon can do.
But today, I believe we may face more than

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.460
just a global panopticon.
Because of comprehensive digital memory, we

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:07.920
have to assume that what we do or say online
is not only being witnessed today, but will

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.470
remain accessible for years, perhaps decades
to come.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.889
This creates a temporal panopticon, in which
we may self-censor, not because we may be

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:25.889
afraid how others may interpret or words and
deeds today, but how people and institutions

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:33.000
in the future might view them.
My second concern is Time, or more precisely,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.310
how we humans deal with time.
As I mentioned, forgetting is biological.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:46.470
So we humans did never have to develop conscious
mechanisms to put different temporally-apart

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:56.510
pieces of memory in a temporal perspective.
So, consider as an illustration the following

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.079
hypothetical.
Jane and John are old friends.

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:04.589
Although they live in different cities now,
they try to catch up at least once a year.

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:10.769
One day, Jane receives an e-mail from John
telling her that he's coming to town and wants

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:12.280
to meet.
Jane is excited.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.400
She hasn't seen him for about a year, and
she wants to reply immediately, suggesting

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.029
a nice place to meet.
To facilitate that, and to remind her where

00:15:23.029 --> 00:15:29.829
the last time when John was in town they met,
she queries her e-mail box folder.

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:34.800
Up pop dozens of e-mail messages she has received
from John over the years.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:41.670
She's quickly browsing through them to find
the right one, but then her eye catches one,

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.949
a ten-year-old e-mail with a strange subject
line.

00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:51.050
Intrigued, she starts to scan the text, and
she begins to read.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:59.560
Surprised, perhaps even shocked, she reads
in the e-mail about how John deceived her

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.110
And she is revisiting an angry exchange between
them.

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:12.509
Slowly, events and feelings triggered by this
very concrete, external stimulus come to her

00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:18.820
mind -- her sense of betrayal, deception.
She reads on about how, over the following

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.410
months, apparently John and her must have
reconciled.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.860
Although, exactly how and why, the e-mails
don't tell.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:34.050
But, at the forefront of her mind at that
moment is that John, her good friend John,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.769
deceived her.
And suddenly, she is not so sure anymore whether

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:43.720
she wants to meet John, or whether she's looking
forward to seeing him.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:52.070
As much as her analytic mind wants to disregard
the revived memory, the angry words she read

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:57.190
triggered her remembering.
There, the external memory that help us remember

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:04.089
things that we thought we forget, but in certain
circumstances, they may also cloud our ability

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:11.319
to evaluate and to decide.
Put in more abstract terms, as cognitive psychologists

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:19.180
remind us, for us humans, it is difficult
to realize time as a dimension of change.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:25.150
When we are confronted with two pieces of
memory, temporally apart, it's cognitively

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:32.770
difficult for us to evaluate them with time
in mind, and not to be captured by the memory

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:39.440
confronting us coming back to us.
We can try, but frequently, the act of remembering

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:45.669
something a long time ago perhaps facilitated
by the external stimulus we receive, will

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:53.070
bring it back into our mind with a certain
freshness and intensity, or not at all.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:59.799
That may trigger incorrect decision making.
Now, that's not something new.

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:04.790
In the analog times, the dangers were there
too, but they were limited.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:11.500
Our biological forgetting then obscured our
cognitive difficulty with time, but what when

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:16.830
we are not permitted to forget?
We know a little bit about the consequences

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:22.629
of this with studies of less than a handful
of people who have biological difficulties

00:18:22.629 --> 00:18:32.210
to forget.
This is AJ, a woman who has difficulties forgetting.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:38.140
Ask her about a particular day, she's able
to tell you she woke up, who called, what

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:45.880
was on television, 30 years ago.
AJ has difficulties forgetting, but to her,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:50.980
she says in many instances, it's not a blessing.
It's a curse.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:57.660
She is haunted at times by her past so much,
in fact, that it limits her ability to act

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:03.559
and decide in the present.
As Argentinian short story writer, Jorges

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:12.400
Borges, said, "Perfect memory pushes humans
to get lost in detail with no ability to generalize,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.710
to abstract, and to evolve
They lose," Borges writes, "what truly makes

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.110
us human."
Tethered to an ever more detailed past, rather

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:32.039
than living and acting in the present.
This is the fate we may face with comprehensive

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:36.270
digital memory.
Through perfect digital memory, we also may

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:43.289
deny each other the capacity to change over
time, to evolve, and to grow.

00:19:43.289 --> 00:19:50.820
Without forgetting, it is hard for us to forgive.
And so, with comprehensive digital remembering,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:20:00.480
we may turn into an unforgiving society.
But, there is another wrinkle to the story.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:09.210
What if? What if frustrated with the shortcomings
of our human biological memory, we begin to

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:17.160
disregard our own recollections of our own
past and depend on digital memory instead?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:25.110
Does that give those that control digital
memory the power to change history?

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:33.120
These are some of the threats of shifting
the defaults from forgetting to remembering.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:42.970
So, what to do?
So far, we have come up with a couple of possible

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.620
responses to deal with digital memory and
digital remembering.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:55.430
First is, the idea of privacy rights.
The idea, the underlying concept, is intriguingly

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.770
simple.
By giving each individual the right to informational

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:07.159
privacy, we empower the people themselves
to fight for their rights.

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:12.340
Therefore, enforcement of the rights, enforcement
of digital forgetting, is both decentralized

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:17.510
and delegated.
It sounds great, but it comes with a number

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:25.400
of inherent weaknesses.
First, in the U.S., the enactment of informational

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.809
privacy rights is politically not feasible,
at least not in the current political climate.

00:21:31.809 --> 00:21:35.860
But, even if it were, I have my doubts about
its effectiveness.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:43.070
Because the Europeans have enacted strong
information privacy rights for decades, but

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:49.390
people have not used them.
Whatever additional incentives frustrated

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:57.530
lawmakers offered the public: no-fault compensation,
attorney fees, shifting the burden of proof,

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:04.170
nothing could change the bitter reality that
individuals do not seem to want to enforce

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:10.059
their information privacy rights.
At least not in courts.

00:22:10.059 --> 00:22:15.980
So maybe, information ecology norms could
help.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:28.710
These norms are the conscious regulatory restriction
of what personal information can be stored

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:34.300
and for how long.
Such norms necessitate government action,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.990
because they have to be passed through Parliament,
and compliance enforcement may therefore be

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.630
costly.
They do have two advantages over privacy rights.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:45.240
They do not require individuals to have to
go to court for enforcement, and they protect

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:54.510
against an unforeseen future.
An unforeseen future.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:05.600
Well, here is an interesting case to consider.
Consider the Dutch Citizen Register.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.840
Put in place in the 1930's for a perfectly
good reason: Do no evil.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:19.049
To ensure the administration of social security,
the register included information about ethnicity

00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:24.090
and religion.
Once the Nazis had occupied the Netherlands,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:32.669
they raided the register, repurposing the
information in it to identify Dutch Jews,

00:23:32.669 --> 00:23:38.830
and to send them to concentration camps.
As a result, proportionally-speaking, more

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:46.970
Dutch Jews were murdered at the hands of the
Nazis than those of from France, Poland, or

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.970
Germany.
Even Jewish refugees in the Netherlands fared

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:49.970
better, because they were not included in
the Dutch Citizen Register.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:24:03.130
It is a horrific lesson.
As we cannot see the future, and thus, how

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:10.130
personal information about us is being used,
it may be better to store less than more.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:16.870
This is the essence of information ecology
norms.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.400
Unfortunately, since nine eleven, we have
seen a backlash here, together with a wave

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:28.700
of information retention norms.
In addition to the pervasive rhetoric of fear

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:35.400
and security, information ecology norms also
go against another emerging dogma in our society,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.120
that of transparency.
Transparency has become our preferred, perhaps

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:47.630
only, mechanism for ensuring good governance,
both in the public and the private sector,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:53.760
requiring information retention, and thus
limiting the political chances for an expansion

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:01.480
of information ecology norms.
So, are there any alternative responses that

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:07.610
we could use, perhaps, to augment our existing
responses with some alternative ideas?

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:14.419
Some have argued for digital abstinence, for
staying away from the technical tools that

00:25:14.419 --> 00:25:20.590
have enabled digital remembering.
Not sharing everything on Facebook, as President

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:26.539
Obama reminded us a few weeks back.
Certainly reduce the threat of digital remembering.

00:25:26.539 --> 00:25:31.940
But is it realistic?
With over six hundred plus million registered

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:39.960
users worldwide on social networking sites,
two out of three young Americans, by the end

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:45.669
of 2007, uploaded and shared information about
themselves with others.

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:52.100
Is it realistic?
Another option, ostensibly the opposite of

00:25:52.100 --> 00:26:00.330
digital abstinence, is the idea of full contextualization,
or to store digitally as much information

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:05.330
as possible.
That might sound strange, but here's the argument.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.400
Perhaps the problem with digital memory is
that it does not capture enough.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.860
That is, enough of an event to let us relive
it accurately enough later on.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.990
If we could only store everything related
to it, including its context, we could avoid

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.100
the negative side effects of memory -- of
digital memory.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:32.850
In essence, full contextualization could help
us regain our ability to think in time, and

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.860
at the same time, it would equalize information
imbalances.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:43.870
At its core, this is Brin's proposal for a
transparent society.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:48.760
But will full contextualization ever be technically
feasible?

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:54.990
You heard Gordon Bell talk about his life-blogging.
He is still not capturing everything.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.049
And if it is, would it actually address the
challenge of digital remembering?

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:06.820
Do we really have the time to relive our past
again and again, only to grasp what experiences

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:13.750
are no longer relevant for us today?
Perhaps.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:21.659
Perhaps we need to look at another alternative,
namely, cognitive adjustment.

00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:27.640
Cognitive adjustment is the hope that, over
time, we'll learn to devalue older information,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.419
and to live in a world of the omnipresent
past.

00:27:32.419 --> 00:27:39.840
Not society has to change its laws, but the
way our individual processes of information

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:47.270
evaluation, and decision making work.
That to me sounds right.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:53.190
And that would solve our problem.
I like this approach.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:28:00.320
But unfortunately, cognitive psychologists
are extremely skeptical of our human ability

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:06.179
to force onto us a change in how we evaluate
and process distant memory that we suddenly

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:09.649
recall through the external stimulus of digital
storage.

00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:15.429
They suggest that it may take us humans a
very long time to change the way we assess

00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:22.330
the information around us, to modify what
we've been doing for ages.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:27.700
And if we could, what would be the appropriate
mechanism to affect such change.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:34.299
I hope cognitive adjustment is working, but
I don't want to hold my breath.

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:41.799
So, perhaps, you guys can help here.
Perhaps you guys can provide us with visual

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:48.029
and contextual cues in how search results
are being presented to users, to individuals,

00:28:48.029 --> 00:28:55.720
so that older and less-relevant information
can be radically reduced in importance.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.550
A different idea is not to change humans,
but to change technology.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:10.570
Lawrence Lecig and others had suggested to
use technology to change human behavior.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.390
The suggestion is to create quasi-property
rights in personal information.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:20.549
Think of personal information copyright.
Oh gosh, copyright -- another conundrum -- and

00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:27.630
build that into our technology, so that technology
can ensure that only those can process my

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.720
personal information who I have permitted
to do so.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:37.529
In short, the suggestion is to create a global
digital rights management system to protect

00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:46.090
privacy.
But do we really need to create a global technology

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:54.360
infrastructure that watches every of our moves
to ensure that nobody abuses somebody else's

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.830
personal information?
Wouldn't we thereby not create a perfect surveillance

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:08.830
system to ensure privacy?
In order for privacy therein to work, we would

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:18.409
have to embed into the infrastructure privacy
very deeply, and I have not seen an engineering

00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:23.610
solution that does that.
So here we are.

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:29.600
I presented six possible approaches to you
to deal with the challenges posed by digital

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.950
remembering.
Privacy Rights and Information Ecology.

00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:39.730
Employ legal norms to address the challenge.
Digital Abstinence and Cognitive Adjustment.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:48.020
Hope that this could be achieved on an individual
level and privacy DRM and full contextualization

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:57.970
mainly rest on achieving a technical breakthrough.
The three on the left-hand-side: Digital Abstinence,

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:04.410
Privacy Rights, and Privacy DRM, mainly target
the power challenge of digital remembering.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:12.250
The three of them on the right aim at addressing
the time challenge.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:18.380
None of these, as you have discovered, offers
us a silver bullet, although all help in their

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:29.400
very unique way to counter the challenge ahead.
Hence, we may need to mix and combine them,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:35.320
and perhaps, even add something else.
So, something else?

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:42.740
If you have followed me so far, I've probably
achieved 95 percent of what I wanted to achieve,

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.429
but here's the five percent that are the controversial
part.

00:31:45.429 --> 00:31:57.169
So I advocate for a revival of forgetting.
That is, to establish mechanisms that ease

00:31:57.169 --> 00:32:03.610
the forgetting in the digital age and that
make remembering just a tiny bit more strenuous,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:07.960
not by much.
I don't want to overly burden remembering,

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:13.140
but just enough to shift the incentives of
forgetting and remembering back to what we

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.630
humans are used to.
One version of this could be called "expiration

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:21.919
dates for information."
It would imply that whenever we want to store

00:32:21.919 --> 00:32:28.510
information, we are prompted to enter a date
until which we want that information to be

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.570
stored.
Once the date has been reached, the information

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.980
has been purged.
Of course, we can choose expiration dates

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:39.669
at will and can change it at any time.
Please understand.

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:48.353
The core of my proposal is not the automatic
deletion of information or the technical infrastructure

00:32:48.353 --> 00:32:51.240
to create compliance.
The core of my proposal is that, by prompting

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.740
for expiration dates, this prompt will remind
us time and again that most information is

00:32:53.740 --> 00:33:02.559
not timeless, but linked to a specific context
and situation -- that it loses its value as

00:33:02.559 --> 00:33:07.850
time passes.
Expiration dates would offer a meaningful

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:16.090
way of linking digital memory with time, and
thereby implementing a temporal dimension

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.490
into it.
It is cognitive reflection of the longevity

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:26.070
of information lifespan, and the importance
of forgetting that I'm after on an individual,

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.309
as well as a societal, level.
I want us to have a meaningful choice again

00:33:29.309 --> 00:33:38.029
of what to forget and what to remember, rather
than to have to accept the implicit bias of

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:42.669
digital remembering.
I'm not suggesting that expiration dates offer

00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:47.940
perfection, only the chance to reflect and
to choose.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:53.049
Now, of course, this is where -- for the lawyers
and the engineers -- the fun starts.

00:33:53.049 --> 00:33:56.390
How are expiration dates negotiated in diactic
settings?

00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.179
How are they maintained?
How is compliance ensured once they have been

00:34:01.179 --> 00:34:04.779
set?
And I talk more about that in the book.

00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:10.300
Moreover, much of the mass acceptance, if
ever, will depend on user experience.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.629
How straight forward is it to select an expiration
date?

00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:19.909
Can developers, like you, help by offering
suitable presets based on information type

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:24.149
and context?
What are the tools available to users to change

00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:29.890
expiration date post fact?
There is no one-size-fits-all expiration date

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:34.950
system, but rather a whole spectrum of instantiation
of expiration dates imaginable, with some

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.169
based mainly on market pressure to assure
compliance, and others depending on more laws

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:49.590
or technical measures.
Make no mistake, while helpful as an illustration,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:55.250
expiration dates come with a bag of weaknesses
of their own.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.010
They're no silver bullet.
They're not designed to solve the informational

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:03.950
privacy challenges beyond digital remembering.
Perhaps the most troubling, from my perspective,

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:10.950
is that expiration dates are still very binary,
while human forgetting is much more gradual.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:16.099
Perhaps, we can develop systems, you can develop
systems of digital forgettings that are more

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:21.290
gradual as well.
Provide a kind of digital rusting if you want,

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.759
and not as dynamically-adapted expiration
dates as our individual preferences evolve.

00:35:26.759 --> 00:35:36.020
It all sounds like a tall order, but hey.
The time challenge outlined earlier, but of

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:43.060
course, not the power challenge, can be addressed
at least to an extent, by ensuring older and

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:49.410
perhaps less-relevant information takes a
little bit longer to be retrieved, so that

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:56.190
we don't stumble over it, like Jane did, and
thus risk clouding our decision-making in

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:59.060
the present.
Remembering, putting photos in a shoe box

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.240
in the attic.
You still have them, and if you want to spend

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:10.960
the time to go up in the attic, you can still
find them there, although some of them may

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:14.300
have faded slightly over the years.
But retrieving them takes a little bit of

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.609
effort, and thereby, it makes forgetting the
default and remembering the exception.

00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:25.790
That little bit of extra effort is what helps
us stay focused on the present and our present

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:28.820
challenges.
And if you can help us individually and as

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:37.800
a society to do that, you not only enjoy,
perhaps a competitive advantage, but you may

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.390
do us all a real favor.
So there are many variants of digital forgetting,

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:50.160
but whatever version one can come up with,
I do foresee two features common to all.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.089
The first is, changing the default from remembering
back to forgetting.

00:36:54.089 --> 00:37:01.240
Forgetting can be slow, gradual, or reconsidered.
But, it must empower users to set it as they

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:06.773
desire, and it must be made the default and
remembering the exception.

00:37:06.773 --> 00:37:14.510
The second core feature is the digital forgetting
keeps reminding us of the temporal nature

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:18.790
of information, that it is not timeless, but
linked to specific context, and thus loses

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:24.210
its usefulness as time progresses.
And that it offers us a meaningful mechanism

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:31.730
to link temporal dimension with information
we commit to digital storage.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:37.990
A revival of digital forgetting, I believe,
if used in combination with some of the other

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.290
approaches, could significantly strengthen
the effectiveness of our overall societal

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:52.880
response to the challenge of Power and Time
that we face.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:59.420
Forgetting. Remembering.
Since the beginning of time, forgetting has

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:08.050
been easy for us, and remembering hard.
In the digital age, the relationship has become

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.160
reversed.
Today, digital remembering is the default,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:24.249
and it is forgetting that is often forgotten.
I ask you -- I ask you to help bring back

00:38:24.249 --> 00:38:57.070
 -- and give back -- to forgetting, the role
it deserves.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:16.099
Let us remember to forget.
Thanks.

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:17.099
&gt;&gt; [applause]
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:39:17.099 --> 00:39:18.099
&gt;&gt; One thing with forgetting is that it strikes
me as permanent.

00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:19.099
If you forget something, you can't bring it
back.

00:39:19.099 --> 00:39:20.099
At the same time, if you save it, you can
always delete it.

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:21.099
So how does that work with defaults if you
are deleting things you regret?

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:22.099
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So the question was, If you delete something,

00:39:22.099 --> 00:39:23.099
it's gone forever.
But if you save something, you can then later

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:28.700
delete it.
And so the implicit is, or assumption is,

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.060
wouldn't it be better to just save it, and
you can always delete it?

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.430
Whereas, if you have deleted it, you can't
go back.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:40.390
Now, of course, that kind of obscures what's
at stake.

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:44.609
If you look at the time challenge, just by
saving it, I'm potentially already confusing

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:48.859
myself if I have fast retrieval, because it's
coming back.

00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:55.400
And it's like Jane, or like the case of Jane,
may cloud my decision-making.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:04.599
So in that sense, saving in the fear that
I might need it in the future, immediately

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:11.400
has consequence in the present, because it
is accessible to me.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:16.369
A more benign version of what you suggested
is the shoe box version, and that is to not

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:23.020
throw stuff away, but to actually put it in
the shoe box and up in the attic, or some

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:31.329
have told me they've saved their e-mails,
but put it in a separate folder and put it

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:32.829
in a backup drive.
So if they absolutely have to go back, and

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:38.250
if it's worth their time and effort to do
that, they can do it, but it doesn't necessarily

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.500
pop up when they search through their mailbox
folder immediately.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:48.960
That's a benign version and that might help
address some of the time challenge.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.410
What it doesn't address is the power challenge.
It does nothing to help protect us from an

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:59.870
unforeseen future.
If the Dutch Jews had done what you just said,

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.660
they would still be prosecuted.
They would still be sent to the concentration

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:14.650
camps.
So, in that sense, the power challenge remains

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:26.599
unaddressed.
&gt;&gt; [inaudible]

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:47.430
&gt;&gt; Right. Sure.
So the question was, Isn't there a lot of

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.220
information from the past that is incredibly
valuable or could be incredibly valuable,

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:57.089
and by deleting it or by forgetting it faster
than preserving it, we would actually rid

00:41:57.089 --> 00:42:03.359
ourself of that potential value?
Is that an accurate statement?

00:42:03.359 --> 00:42:10.150
Yeah, that's -- I don't want to deny that.
Now, two parts of my answer here.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:16.599
Part Number One.
A lot of medical information, supposedly buried

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:25.030
in the archives of the scientific community
or so, are of dubious value.

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:33.050
Because a lot of the technology that was available
ten, twenty, thirty, forty, years ago to the

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:38.290
medical community was comparatively primitive
to our current technology.

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:42.890
And so we wouldn't do certain things the way
it was done.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:48.079
We wouldn't use certain treatments the way
they were.

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:58.960
So the amount of knowledge that can be mined
from these information treasures is probably

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:08.490
somewhat more limited than we might hope.
The only real discipline that I think would

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:20.980
really suffer if we stop remembering completely
or largely would be historians, who now can

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:26.849
use digital records and have much more of
that available.

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:33.970
That brings me to the second part of my answer
and that is, I don't want to enforce or to

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:42.460
force us to forget.
My idea is not to compelling us to forget.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:50.410
My idea is to compel us to choose.
And I want to give choice back to us individuals

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:56.119
to choose.
And that might actually be beneficial both

00:43:56.119 --> 00:44:01.970
for the individual as well as for those who
then use the information later on, because

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.510
the quality of the information might be superior,
might improve.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:11.349
Because, as an individual, I have an interest
in low-quality information that is not relevant

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:17.260
anymore to be purged, and information that
is relevant to my current condition not to

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:22.109
be purged, but to be remembered.
So, I really want to give back choice, and

00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:24.950
choice on a individual as well as a societal
level.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:28.910
So, if I want to keep my photographs, if you
want to keep your blog posts for the next

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:33.260
five hundred years, just set the expiration
date to the first of January 2500, and you'll

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:41.030
be fine.
And by the way, the 31st of December 2499,

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:45.020
you just want to keep it longer, you should
be able to go back and just change the expiration

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.109
date and add another three hundred or five
hundred years to it.

00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:52.650
That's all fine with me.
That's perfectly fine.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:57.950
As long as you have that choice.
And similarly, as a society, I think we should

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.359
have that choice.
We should have that choice as a society to

00:45:00.359 --> 00:45:05.920
decide whether a drunk driver's citation 15
years ago is still relevant today, or not.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.609
Think about that for a moment, what it does
in terms of the legal retention compliance

00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:13.460
issues.
If you are in a human resource department

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:19.140
of a large organization like Google, and you
have a job applicant, and you Google the job

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.740
applicant, and you find out something in the
distant past like 15 years ago in the past

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.440
of that job applicant.
Now, you know it.

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.579
So you have that information.
If something happens, link to that piece of

00:45:31.579 --> 00:45:36.960
information, you as a human resource department
are going to be liable.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.630
So, you cannot not act on it.
Now, you need to act on it.

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:46.640
Even though it might be completely irrelevant,
and guess what, given the precautionary principle

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.041
that most human resource departments heed,
that person is not going to get hired, or

00:45:52.041 --> 00:45:59.020
is much less likely getting hired.
Despite the fact that it has no relevance,

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:02.700
this past fact has no relevance to the present
situation of the person.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:07.849
Just caution.
Pure liability-reducing, risk-reducing caution.

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:12.670
And so, if we had digital forgetting built
into it of those irrelevant information pieces

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:25.000
of our past, we could address this kind of
situation.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.930
Thank you very much.
I appreciate, particularly, let me add one

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:31.970
thing.
I know you're in the business of conserving

00:46:31.970 --> 00:46:38.930
and retaining information, and I really appreciate
you listening in to the dissident.

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:39.520
Thank you.
