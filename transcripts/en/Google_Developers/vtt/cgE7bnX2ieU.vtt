DAN FELD: Hi.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.670
This is Dan Feld here
from Google Developers.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.790
And we are here at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.690
And with me today is Ted
Kraus from Tech-Rx Ventures.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.524
Hi, Ted.

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:14.690
Thanks a lot for joining us.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.129
TED KRAUS: Thanks for having me.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.030
DAN FELD: I know that
we just finished up

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.940
your keynote upstairs and
went into the expo area.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.324
So tell us a little
bit about your venture.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.240
TED KRAUS: Absolutely.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.705
So Tech-Rx is a
unique venture fund.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.960
We invest in companies that
are struggling to scale.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.840
So we typically
invest up to $250,000.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.500
So that's the financial
capital piece.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.300
And we also invest the human
capital piece to help correct

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920
or turn around venture-backed
tech companies that

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.630
have hit some wall or they're
at some inflection point

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.675
and they need to be fixed.

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:54.550
So that's what we do.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.300
DAN FELD: Would
you say that lots

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.610
of startups that reached
a point that they have

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.890
some kind of a traction
in trying to scale,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.944
would actually
struggle to scale?

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:04.610
TED KRAUS: Yeah.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.000
So most companies hit
roadblocks as they grow.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.050
Most tech companies do.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.980
It might be because they
don't have the right sales

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.990
and marketing team.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.448
It might be because
they don't know

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:19.430
what to do from a
marketing standpoint.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.630
It may be because they
were unable to raise money.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.580
Most of the time, if
the company is not

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.500
able to have revenue
coming in the door,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.456
or if they have some type
of social app or something

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:35.830
like this where
they need to have

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.140
millions and millions
of users, that would

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.280
be the traction in that case.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580
We'd come in, and we
help them figure out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.490
what they need to do
to get that traction

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.850
to hit those growth
numbers, and then to scale

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.670
through that inflection point.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.420
DAN FELD: I see.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.600
And on this point, we have
a lot of entrepreneurs

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.680
that are asking themselves,
how do we get funded?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.320
And perhaps they see
themselves fit to your bill

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.040
and to the way you
look at startups.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.470
So what's the best
way to reach you?

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.864
What's the best way to get
you to fund their startup?

00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:13.780
TED KRAUS: Absolutely.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.300
So the best way
to get in contact

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.910
with a VC or an investor is
through a trusted intermediary.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.290
So someone that you know,
that knows them as well-- they

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.160
make the connection.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.800
There needs to be
a bridge there.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.150
We get a lot of blind emails.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.380
And it's very difficult for
us to meet with everybody

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.940
that we see.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.650
So it helps a lot, if you
want to get in touch with us

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.400
or any other investor, to be
introduced through someone

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.570
that they know as well.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.210
If you want to raise money, the
biggest thing you need to do

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.630
is have good traction.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.950
That's by far and away the
best thing that you can do.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.880
Have really, really strong KPIs,
Key Performance Indicators.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.440
I'm a big fan of
actually making money.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.550
I think that it's great to
have an application that has

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.034
millions and millions of users.

00:03:09.034 --> 00:03:11.450
But it's also great to have
millions of users and millions

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.490
of dollars coming in.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.447
So I'm a big fan of revenue.

00:03:14.447 --> 00:03:15.780
DAN FELD: So the answer is both.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.570
TED KRAUS: Both, yeah.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.300
I want to see money,
and I want to see users.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.383
That's what I want to see.

00:03:19.383 --> 00:03:20.640
DAN FELD: Absolutely.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.370
When you look at
the first meeting

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.530
with a founder or
entrepreneur with you,

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.360
and assuming that he sees
himself as ready for what you

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.920
are looking for, how
would the first meeting--

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.900
how a successful
meeting would look like?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.940
TED KRAUS: Usually, we
know in the first 60

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.800
seconds whether or
not the founding team

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.400
and the founder, the person
that we're speaking with,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.410
is fundable.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.170
We know if they have
the confidence that's

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.910
needed to succeed as a
founder, as an entrepreneur.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.700
We usually know beforehand
if their product is good.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.570
So we know pretty
fast whether or not

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.260
we're going to make an
investment and do the deal.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.780
DAN FELD: So once the meeting
actually was scheduled,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.584
there is a high--
it's pre-qualified.

00:04:14.584 --> 00:04:15.250
TED KRAUS: Yeah.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.458
DAN FELD: You know a lot of
things about the founder.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:21.010
TED KRAUS: So if you get a
meeting with the investor

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.930
or with anyone, they have done a
little bit of diligence on you.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.020
They know what you're going to
come and talk to them about.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.061
DAN FELD: So what's left?

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:27.310
What do I need to do?

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.536
How do I nail the 30%
that is left for me

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:31.660
to do at the first meeting?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.740
TED KRAUS: I have a very
clear well-defined ask.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.500
It's very important.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.940
Don't go in into any meeting
and not have an agenda.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.750
Have a very clear ask.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.670
Have a plan.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.187
If the person
you're meeting with

00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:47.270
wants to know how you're
going to get from A to B,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.490
if they invest $1
million in you,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.044
have a plan, and
very explicitly state

00:04:52.044 --> 00:04:53.460
how you're going
to use the money.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.310
What's the use of funds?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.956
Have the ask.

00:04:55.956 --> 00:04:57.580
Have the deal terms
in your head so you

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.880
don't have to say, oh, let
me call my CFO or my attorney

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.289
and remind me of what
the deal terms are.

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.080
Know all of these
things-- top of the mind.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.260
DAN FELD: Let me add
that in many cases, when

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.150
you ask, how can I help you,
the answer is not clear.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.120
People sometimes
don't come ready--

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.190
TED KRAUS: Exactly.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.380
DAN FELD: --just just to
answer a simple question--

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.375
how can I help you?

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:21.000
TED KRAUS: Yes.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.630
DAN FELD: And sometimes,
they're missing the opportunity

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.419
right there.

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:25.210
TED KRAUS: Exactly.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.500
Nobody wants to waste time.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.910
And so you need to know that.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.940
You don't want me saying,
what can I do for you?

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.160
DAN FELD: Yeah.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.570
So Ted, perhaps a
little bit about you--

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.700
how did you get to work
as a venture capitalist?

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.364
And perhaps a little bit about
your professional background.

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:45.280
TED KRAUS: Absolutely.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.970
I started my career in Los
Angeles at Tech Coast Angels.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.970
I was an analyst there
for a number of years.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.000
I started a company
that was funded.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.190
And then I ended up
moving to the east coast

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.640
and I lived very
near Duke University

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.890
in Durham, North
Carolina for a few years.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.670
And I worked at a great
fund there called Eight

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.300
Rivers Capital.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.330
We commercialized several
amazing technologies.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.130
And then in 2013, I wanted
to come back to California.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.450
And I had the opportunity
to move back here and start

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.350
working with Tech-Rx.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.340
I really like the model
that Tech-Rx uses.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.645
It fills a gap in the
venture ecosystem here,

00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:28.270
which is companies
that are struggling.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.920
They're great technologies.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.680
They're great products.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.330
But we don't want to see
them evaporate and go away.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.600
And we can all think of these.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.550
Maybe there was an
application that you used

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.990
or there was a really
wonderful product that

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.670
was hot for a period
of time, and then

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.350
it just kind of
dissolved and went away.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.730
Maybe there was something
they could have done

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.700
to prevent that from happening.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
And so we try to work with
a few companies a year.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.940
We're very hands on.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.750
It lets me--
basically, my role is

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.575
I get to be an investor and
an operator in a company,

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:07.300
in startups, at the same time.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.360
It's a dream for me
to be able to do that.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.827
And it's a really
wonderful thing that we do.

00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:14.660
DAN FELD: Wonderful.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:19.720
And last question-- what
would be the Google product

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.770
that you most use or like?

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.060
TED KRAUS: I love all
the Google products.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.920
My favorite products
are-- I like Google Maps.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.010
I like Inbox on my phone.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.040
I like Calendar on my phone.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.700
The new apps that
have come out-- I'm

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.980
a huge fan of Google Drive,
Documents, and Sheets.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.060
I use them for team
development whenever

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.920
we have anything we want to
do on Sheets or Google Drive,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.870
on Docs.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.245
And also, the one product that
I'm the most excited about

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:51.703
to come out at
Google is definitely

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:52.600
the self-driving car.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.220
I can't wait.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.940
I see them all over the place.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.770
And I'm very excited
about that product.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:57.580
DAN FELD: We share the feeling.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.440
Thank you very much, Ted.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.130
TED KRAUS: Excellent.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:07:59.720
Thank you.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.220
DAN FELD: And thank you
very much for watching.
