Deep sleep, we go around here, because you're not very awake and you're not

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.605
very aware. However, coma, we go here, because you're not aware at all, nor are

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:13.250
you awake. Practicing the piano, we go up here, because you're very aware of

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.024
what's going on and you're also awake. Lucid dreaming would be here, because

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:23.230
you're not awake, but you are aware of what's going on. And finally vegetative

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.652
state would go here, because you might be completely awake, you're not aware of

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.889
what's going on.
