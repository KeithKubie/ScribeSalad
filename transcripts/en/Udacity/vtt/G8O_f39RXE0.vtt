00:00:00.508 --> 00:00:03.340
Some of the reasons
that it was rejected.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.850
People just didn't buy my vision.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.740
People didn't think that
they can execute on that.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.780
People thought that they saw companies
that wanted to do the same thing.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.250
But they failed.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.210
So they assume that I'm
going to fail as well.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.150
People thought the market is not real or
people thought the market is too

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.760
small or people thought the market is
too big and there's no chance that

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.000
the small fish like me would be
able to take a decent cut of it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.950
People thought that we don't have
the necessary skills in the team.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.860
And people thought that we just
don't know what we're doing.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.830
So we were rejected so many times,
many more times than we were accepted.
