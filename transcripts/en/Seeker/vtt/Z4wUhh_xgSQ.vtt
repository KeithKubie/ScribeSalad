00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.400
Sleeping while flying overseas in an airplane
isn’t exactly an amazing physical feat.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.120
But sleeping while physically flying over
an ocean?

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.200
Frigate birds do it.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.890
Because brains!

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.990
Hey frequent fliers, Trace with you on DNews
today.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.279
Frigate birds have an impressive six-foot
wingspan but their feathers aren’t waterproof

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.919
so they can’t rest on water, and yet they
spend most of their lives at sea.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.689
The exception is when they breed; they do
that on land.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.480
So if they can't land on water, and only come
to land to breed… how does this non-waterproof

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.680
bird stay aloft over the ocean for weeks at
a time?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.670
It all comes down to their brains!

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.340
Most of us probably think of birds as flying
around during the day and resting at night

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.340
like we do.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.340
But frigate birds?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.340
Uh-uh.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.250
Earlier this year, a team from the Max Planck
Institute for Ornithology in Germany tracked

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.720
the birds’ brain activity by fitting them
with small devices able to measure electroencephalographic

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.320
(or EEG's / brainwaves) changes, including
slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.250
Data was gathered over 10 days while the birds
flew more than 3,000km, and it revealed amazing

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.250
behaviour.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.240
During the day the birds stayed awake, looking
for fish or other birds to harass and steal

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.180
food from; they’re kinda jerks, but when
you can’t land on water that's kinda how

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.180
you gotta live.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.140
Then, at night, their brains did something
super neat.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.120
Frigate birds, like humans, have one brain
divided into two hemispheres, but it turns

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.720
out frigates can shut down and rest only one
hemisphere at a time, engaging it in short-term

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.430
stages of slow-wave sleep.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.420
In other words, they sleep with one eye open
-- while flying.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.340
The birds typically circle upward on air currents
in the direction of their open eye, which

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880
is the one connected to the awake hemisphere.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.010
The researchers think they do this to watch
where they’re going and so they don’t

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.400
run into other birds.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360
Incredible as this is, frigates are not the
only animal that sleeps with half its brain

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.760
awake at a time.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.080
It’s an unusual sleep pattern called "unihemispheric
slow-wave sleep."

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.940
Behaviourally, sleep is a period of rest in
a species-specific posture.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.750
Physiologically, it’s a state characterised
by specific eye movements, muscle tonation,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.270
and cortical rhythms.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.190
In unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, only half
of the cerebral cortex, the gray matter that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.560
covers both hemispheres of the brain, displays
the characteristic patterns of sleep, while

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.150
the other half shows neural activity of a
waking state.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.980
During this time the brain can’t get into
full REM sleep; it can only fall into shallower,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.660
slow-wave oscillation sleep.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.860
Unihemispheric slow-wave sleep is how dolphins
can rest without drowning or being killed.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.790
A dolphin will shut down one hemisphere of
its brain, leaving the other half of the brain

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.950
to monitor breathing function and keeping
that eye open to monitor its environment (the

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.140
left eye will be closed when the right half
of the brain sleeps, and vice versa).

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.070
It’s also something a lot of birds do, like
mallard ducks -- keeping one eye open to watch

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.050
for predators while the rest.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.980
So this method of getting some shut-eye isn’t
exactly unheard of.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.290
But in the study of frigate birds, the researchers
found something even more amazing.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.959
Apparently, frigate birds also occasionally
shut down both hemispheres of their brain

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.030
at once and somehow don’t drop out of the
sky like a hot rock.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.770
They don’t do this for long; only a few
seconds at a time, and all told, between the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.580
half-brain sleep and occasional full-brain
sleep, they only get about 42 minutes of shut

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.110
eye a day when they’re at sea.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.120
Humans prefer to rest the whole brain at once,
but amazingly in certain situations, we can

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.370
also do it a hemisphere at a time too.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.250
In humans, unihemispheric slow-wave sleep
is associated with the “first night effect,”

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.860
also known as your inability to get a good
night’s sleep in a new location.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.470
It's not a full separation between brain hemispheres;
rather, it’s described as an asymmetry.

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.870
One hemisphere is more active and vigilant,
monitoring the environment for unfamiliar

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.950
sounds in the new surroundings.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.600
So next time you have a bad night in a new
environment like a hotel or a new apartment,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.510
think of how cool it is that your brain is
tapping into the same evolutionary advantage

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.160
that birds and dolphins use.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.069
Even though you’ll be too tired to be amazed.

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.069
Maybe.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.069
So have you guys experienced this “first
night effect”?

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.550
And speaking of weird ways of sleeping in
the air, what about insects?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.209
Do insects sleep?

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.330
Julian has the answer in this video right
here.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.090
Have you guys experienced this first night
effect?

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.389
