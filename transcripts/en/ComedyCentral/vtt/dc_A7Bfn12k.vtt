00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:06.572
 - You look like a video girl.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:07.407 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.241
 Woman.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.609
 - Mm.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:10.877
- You look good.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.146 size:84% position:42%
  - Marzel Dijonet,
  our head of hair.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.181 line:0%
He just nailed that wig.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.591 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Orange is a tricky
 color, but I did

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:28.628 size:88% position:44%
  this hombre, kind
  of creamsicle wig,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.531 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  and I thought that
  it came out okay.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:32.465 line:0%
I was like "all right".

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.000 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  And she can wear anything.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.436 size:88% position:44%
 Any look you put on
 Ilana, she embraces

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.905
it and embodies whatever it is.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.206 align:start position:0%
 So that's cool
 - She's a little chameleon.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.541
 - She is a chameleon.
 - That was really fun.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.076 size:88% position:44%
  - You take it off.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.413
 - What would you want?

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:49.348
 - More like, whoosh!

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.784
 - Thanks for nothing!

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.319 size:88% position:44%
 (screaming)

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.154
- Everyday is like really funny.

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.323 align:start size:88% position:13%
 The girls are always
 in great spirit.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
  - Anyone that has an idea,
  you know, funny wins!

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.594
- Yeah.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.795 size:88% position:44%
  Whatever idea you
  have, that's cool.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
 They're willing to
 try it and go with it.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.899 size:84% position:42%
  - It's cool that they're
  not afraid to look weird.

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.701 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Some jobs, it's
  always about being

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.871
 beautiful, or whatever, and
 with this it's like you said.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.339 size:88% position:44%
 Funny wins.

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.274 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Thank you very much.
 - Ow!

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.509
 - Those are dangerous.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.145
- Oh, but they do come in handy.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.948
 My dear friend, Mae,
 made these nails.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.217
She's an incredible nail artist,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.384 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but this episode
 is all about Ilana.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.953
 - Gettin' money. Makin' money,

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:30.656 size:84% position:42%
  and needing to play hard
  'cause she works so hard.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.492
 - Which I relate to.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:33.726
 - So part of that
 is expressed through

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.029 size:84% position:42%
  her nails, which
  are dollar signs,

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.299 size:88% position:44%
 in dollar bill font themes.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.503 align:start position:0%
 And then Barack and Michelle
 on the ring fingers.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.306
 Then the toes in the
 tag, the fourth act,

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.975
 which is also called the tag.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.744
The big toes are
Sasha and Malia.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.848 align:start position:0%
 I hope the Obamas are honored.
 - Yes.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.951
I hope they are honored.
