00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:12.340
Signing 
letters with an ‘X’ dates back to the

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.340
Middle Ages.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.300
At this time, many couldn’t read or write,
so this was an easy way for someone to sign

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.920
something and, particularly in legal documents,
assert that whatever was said in the document

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.960
was true.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.730
Specifically, the X represented a Christian
cross/Christ at this time, so by signing X,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.400
you’re essentially saying “In Christ’s
name, it’s true / I assert.”

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.090
“X” first started being used as a substitute
for “Christ” by religious scholars about

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.870
a millennia ago, which is actually how we
ultimately got Xmas as an alternative name

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.870
for Christmas.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.140
The X here is not actually the English X,
but rather the Greek letter “Chi”, short

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.570
for the Greek for Christ, greek-for-christ.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.780
In any event, the X was thus used on documents
in this way.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.079
It is thought that perhaps the X made the
jump to “kiss” as people sometimes would

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.920
kiss the X (Christ), in the same way some
would kiss the Bible- in this context more

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.100
or less “sealing it with a kiss”.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.960
An alternate, somewhat less likely theory
that’s popped up very recently is that the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.369
X simply looks like someone puckering up for
a kiss, or two people kissing… two people

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.869
with triangular faces apparently.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.369
Whatever the case, according to the Oxford
English Dictionary, the first usage of X’s

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.970
to mean “kisses” came in a letter by a
priest, Gilbert White in 1763:

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.279
Madame, … In the whole it is best that I
have been the loser [of a friendly bet], as

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:42.159
it would not be safe in all appearances to
receive even so much as a pin from your Hands.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:50.369
I am with many a xxxxxxx and many a Pater
noster (Our Father) and Ave Maria (Hail Mary),

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.369
Gil.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.369
White.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.479
However, while we can’t say for sure, it
seems just as likely that he actually meant

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.859
“blessings” not “kisses”, as pointed
out by Stephen Goranson of Duke University.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.539
He noted the lack of any other instance of
“X” meaning kisses for around another

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.929
century after this letter.

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.160
Further, in Daniel Defoe’s 1719 work Robinson
Crusoe, we have this, among other, reference

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.599
using crosses (in this case physical crossing)
as “blessings”:

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.769
There was a letter of my partner’s, congratulating
me very affectionately upon my being alive,

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.819
giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year; with the particulars

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.980
of the number of squares, or acres that it
contained, how planted, how many slaves there

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.629
were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses
for blessings, told me he had said so many

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.140
AVE MARIAS to thank the Blessed Virgin that
I was alive…

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.110
Whatever the case, around the mid-19th century
we start to have numerous references to “X’s”

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.329
meaning “kisses”, such as in Aunt Judy’s
Magazine (Issue XI p. 669 which is thought

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:55.909
to have been published between 1866-1885),
where one person notes: “All these crosses

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.640
mean kisses, Jemima told me.”

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.990
From this, at least we know the “X’s”
meaning “kisses” preceded “O’s”

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.700
as “hugs” as there are no such references
up to this time of the latter, so that’s

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:08.700
something I guess.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.849
If you weren’t satisfied with the lack of
definitiveness of the “X” part of things,

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.180
you’ll be even less so with the “O”
symbolizing the hug.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.670
The most popular theory here pre-supposes
the reasonably likely X / Christ signing theory

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.860
is correct.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.090
The theory then goes that the “O” is of
North American descent, with illiterate Jewish

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.250
immigrants who couldn’t sign their own John
Hancock arriving to the U.S. and refusing

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.689
to sign with the X (Christ/Cross) and instead
using a circle on documents for a signature.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:43.829
(Incidentally, many etymologists believe this
is how the derogatory racial slur for Jewish

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.980
people “kike” came about, “kikel”
being the Yiddish word for circle- Jews being

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.150
associated with circles as that’s how illiterate
Jews would sign, rather than with the “Christian”

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.150
X.)

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.760
Many people believe the “O” made the jump
to meaning “hug” because, by looking down

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.379
on the O from above and squinting just right,
it sort of resembles two people embracing,

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.590
but this is just pure speculation.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.139
It’s also been speculated that the “O”
was perhaps not chosen for the Jewish reason,

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.700
but rather was in connection with tic-tac-toe,
which popped up shortly after the first confirmed

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.180
references to “X’s” meaning “kisses”.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.320
Thus, once it became common to have a single
letter to mark “kisses”, there was a need

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.080
for a similar letter for another form of physical
affection, hugging, and the game of tic-tac-toe

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.090
perhaps provided the inspiration…

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.410
Or perhaps it was the other way around…
or maybe it really was the Jewish signing

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.410
method that provided the XOXO inspiration.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.410
And perhaps, in either case, the “O” sort
of looking like hugging contributing to the

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.410
choice, or perhaps not!

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.410
We just don’t know!

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.410
This is fun!

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.910
Now I know what you’re thinking, if the
“X” means “kisses” and the “O”

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.810
means “hugs”, why do we say “hugs and
kisses” when someone writes XOXO and not

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.450
“kisses and hugs”?

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.040
That one’s also largely still up for debate
as well.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.040
(I know, you’re shocked.)

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.240
Is it simply because one does not want to
presumptuously go for a kiss when you haven’t

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240
even hugged yet?

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.240
Is it?!?!

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.240
😉

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.330
One alternate theory that has gained a little
traction over the years, is that the above

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.240
theories on the “X” and “O’s” are
all wrong and it is the X that means hugs,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.600
mimicking two people embracing, and the O
that appears to be a mouth puckered for a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.760
kiss, hence why it’s “hugs and kisses”.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.010
Given that we know from documented references
that X’s first meant kisses before XOXO

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.590
came about or “O’s” meant “hugs”,
we can safely ignore this latter theory.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.410
One thing we do know for certain, this post
now holds the new record for being the least

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.910
definitive article ever published by TodayIFoundOut.com.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.370
But, at the least, I hope it was an interesting
read.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:06:03.820
It certainly was interesting 
to research.
