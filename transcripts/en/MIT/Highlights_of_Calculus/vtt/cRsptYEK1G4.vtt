00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:14.820
PROFESSOR: OK, earlier lecture
introduced the logarithm as

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.150
the inverse function
to the exponential.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.940
And now it's time to do
calculus, find its derivative.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.600
And we spoke about other inverse
functions, and here is

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.700
an important one: the inverse
sine function, or sometimes

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.280
called the arc sine.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.930
We'll find its derivative,
too.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.380
OK, so what we're doing really
is sort of completing the list

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.710
of important rules
for derivatives.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.880
We know about the derivative
of a sum.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.120
Just add the derivatives.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.250
f minus g, just subtract
the derivatives.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.950
We know the product rule and the
quotient rule, so that's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.870
add, subtract, multiply,
divide functions.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.810
And then very, very important is
the chain of functions, the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.340
chain rule.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.540
This is never to be mixed
up with that.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.260
You wouldn't do such a thing.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.460
And now we're adding
one more f inverse.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.780
That's today, the derivative
of the inverse.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.020
That will really complete
the rules.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.400
Out of simple functions like
exponential, sine and cosine,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.640
powers of x, this creates all
the rest of the functions that

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.330
we typically use.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.860
OK, so let's start with the most
important of all: the f

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.480
of x is e to the x.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.460
And then the inverse
function, we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.730
named the natural logarithm.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.300
And notice, remember how
I reversed the letters.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.300
Here, x is the input and y
is the output from the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.340
exponential function.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.530
So for the inverse function,
y is the input.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.970
I go backwards to x, and the
thing to remember, the one

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.020
thing to remember, just tell
yourself x is the exponent.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.360
The logarithm is the exponent.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.510
OK, so a chain of functions
is coming here, and it's a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.780
perfectly terrific chain.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.420
This is the rule for
inverse functions.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.460
If I start with an x and I do
f of x, that gets me to y.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.910
And now I do the inverse
function, and it

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.810
brings me back to x.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.560
So I really have a chain
of functions.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.510
The chain has a very
special result.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.940
And our situation is if we
know how to take the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.460
derivative of f, this ought to
tell us-- the chain rule--

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.450
how to take the derivative
of the

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.510
inverse function, f inverse.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.330
Let me try it with this
all-important example.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.090
So which--

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.720
and notice also, chain
goes the other way.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.370
If I start with y, do the
inverse function, then

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.590
I've reached x.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.280
Then f of x is y.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.530
Maybe before I take e to the
x, let me take the function

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.610
that always is the
starting point.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.800
So practice is--

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.030
I'll call this example of--

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.690
just to remember how inverse
functions work--

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:42.810
linear functions.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.080
y equals ax plus b.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.000
That's f of x there.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.800
Linear.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.750
What's the inverse of that?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.640
Now the point about inverses
is I want to solve for x in

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.540
terms of y.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.590
I want to get x by itself.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.140
So I move b to the
opposite side.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.170
So in the end, I want to
get x equals something.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.650
And how do I do that?

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.660
I move b to the opposite side,
and then I still have ax, so I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.450
divide by a.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.000
Then I've got x by itself.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.589
This is the inverse.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.710
This is f inverse of y.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.880
Notice something about inverse
functions, that here we did--

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.740
this function f of x was
created in two steps.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.530
it was sort of a chain
in itself.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.080
The first step was
multiply by a.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.730
We multiply and then we add.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.650
What's inverse function do?

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.990
The inverse function takes y.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.490
Subtracts b.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.020
So it does subtract first
to get y minus

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.660
b, and then it divides.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.810
What's my point?

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.160
My point is that if a function
is built in two steps,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.660
multiply and then add in this
nice case, the inverse

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.950
function does the
inverse steps.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.750
Instead of multiplying
it divides.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.360
Instead of add, it subtracts.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.080
What it does though is
the opposite order.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.370
Notice the multiply was done
first, then the divide is

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.380
last. The add was done second,
the subtract was done first.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.140
When you invert things, the
order-- well, you know it.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.440
It has to be that way.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.770
It's that way in life, right?

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:55.360
If we're standing on the beach
and we walk to the water and

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.700
then we swim to the dock, so
that's our function f of x

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.060
from where we were to the dock,
then how do we get back?

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.850
Well, wise to swim
first, right?

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.420
You don't want to walk first.
From the dock, you swim back.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.090
So you swam one way at the
end, and then in the

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.795
inverse, you swim--

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:22.000
oh, you get it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.440
OK, so now I'm ready
for the real thing.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.670
I'll take one of those chains
and take its derivative.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.290
Let me take the first one.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.080
So the first one says that the
log of e to the x is x.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.165
That's--

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.100
The logarithm was defined
that way.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.100
That's what the log is.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.820
Let's take the derivative of
that equation, the derivative

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.740
of both sides.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.770
We will be learning what's the
derivative of the log.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.360
That's what we don't know.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.120
So if I take the derivative,
well, on the right-hand side,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.320
I certainly get 1.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.610
On the left-hand side, this
is where it's interesting.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.930
So it's the chain rule.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.450
The log of something, so I
should take the derivative--

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.220
oh, I need a little more
space here, over here.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:25.830
The derivative of log
y, y is e to the x.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.620
Everybody's got that, right?

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.860
So this is log y, and I'm taking
its derivative with

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.780
respect to y.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.970
But then I have to, as the chain
rule tells me, take the

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.860
derivative of what's inside.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.170
What's inside is e to the
x, so I have dy dx.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.610
So I put dy dx.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.570
And the derivative on the
right-hand side, the neat

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.410
point here is that the
x-derivative of that is 1.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.060
OK, now I'm going to learn what
this is because I know

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:03.060
what this is: the derivative
of dy dx, the derivative of

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.970
the exponential.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.900
Well, now comes the most
important property that we use

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.010
to construct this exponential.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.160
dy dx is e to the x.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.590
No problem, OK?

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:23.970
And now, I'm going to divide
by it to get what I want--

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.070
almost. Almost, I say.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.910
Well, I've got the derivative
of log y here.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:36.760
Correct, but there's a
step to take still.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.799
I have to write--

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.570
I want a function of y.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.260
The log is a function of y.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.669
It's derivative is--

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.720
the answer is a function of y.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.230
So I have to go back
from x to y.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.770
But that's simple.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.940
e to the x is y.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:55.390
Oh!

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.220
Look at this fantastic answer.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:05.870
The derivative of the log, the
thing we wanted, is 1 over y.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.440
Why do I say fantastic?

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:17.610
Because out of the blue almost,
we've discovered the

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:22.270
function log y, which has that
derivative 1 over y.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:30.860
And the point is this is
the minus 1 power.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.980
It's the only power that we
didn't produce earlier as a

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.590
derivative.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:38.170
I have to make that point.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.990
You remember the very first
derivatives we knew were the

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.220
derivatives of x to the
n-th, powers of x.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.110
Everybody knows that that's n
times x to the n minus 1.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.110
The derivative of every power
is one power below.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.690
With one exception.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.400
With one exception.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:07.570
If n is 0, so I have to
put except n equals 0.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.700
Well, it's true when n is 0,
so I don't mean the formula

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.750
doesn't fail.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.770
What fails is when n is 0, this
right-hand side is 0, and

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.220
I don't get the minus 1 power.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.600
No power of x produces the minus
1 power when I take the

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.930
derivative.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:34.300
So that was like an open hole
in the list of derivatives.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.900
Nobody was giving the derivative
to be the minus 1

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:46.540
power when we were looking
at the powers of x.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.790
Well, here it showed up.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.650
Now, you'll say the
letter y's there.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.170
OK, that's the 25th letter
of the alphabet.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.450
I'm perfectly happy if you
prefer the 26th letter.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.460
You can write d log z dz equals
1/z if you want to.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.075
You can write, as you might
like to, d by dx.

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:15.550
Use the 24th letter
of log x is 1/x.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.820
I'm perfectly OK for you to do
that, to write the x there,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.770
now after we got the formula.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:36.910
Up to this point, I really had
to keep x and y straight

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.880
because I was beginning
from y is e to the x.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.950
That was my starting point.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.980
OK, so that keeping them
straight got me the derivative

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.607
of log y as 1/y.

00:11:49.607 --> 00:11:51.040
End.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.360
Now, I'm totally happy if you
use any other letter.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.970
Use t if you have
things growing.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.370
And remember about the
logarithm now.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:06.240
We can see why it
grows so slowly.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:10.210
Because its slope is 1/y.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:13.870
Or let's look at this one,
because we're used to thinking

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:20.400
of graphs with x
along the axis.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.510
And this is telling us that the
slope of the log curve--

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.760
the log curve is increasing, but
the slope is decreasing,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.170
getting smaller and smaller.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.290
As x gets very small, it's
just barely increasing.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.220
It does keep going on
up to infinity,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.490
but very, very slowly.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:41.470
And why is that?

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:46.350
That's because the exponential
is going very, very quickly.

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.740
And you remember that the one
graph is just the flip of the

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.060
other graph, so if one is
climbing like mad, the other

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.420
one is growing slowly.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:03.970
OK, that's the main facts, the
most important formula of

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.250
today's lecture.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.960
I could--

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.310
do you feel like practice to
take the chain in the opposite

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:16.780
direction just to see
what would happen?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.560
So what's the opposite
direction?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.740
I guess the opposite direction
is to start with--

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.990
which did I start with?

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.060
I started with log of
e to the x is x.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.590
The opposite direction would be
to start with e to the log

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.530
y is y, right?

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.910
That's the same chain.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:43.750
That's the f inverse coming
before the f.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.990
What do I do?

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:47.900
Take derivatives.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.540
Take the derivative
of everything, OK?

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:56.040
So take the derivative,
the y-derivative.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.220
I get the nice thing.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.330
I mean, that's the fun part,
taking the derivative on the

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.650
right-hand side.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.440
On the left side, a little more
work, but I know how to

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.340
take the derivative of
e to the something.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.750
It's the chain rule.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:12.370
Of course it's the chain rule.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.050
We got a chain here.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.940
So the derivative of e to the
something, now you remember

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:25.110
with the chain rule, is e to
that same something times the

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.810
derivative of what's inside.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.950
The derivative and what's
inside is this guy: the

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.180
derivative of log y dy.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.340
This is what we want to know,
the one we know, and what is e

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.590
to the log y?

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.190
It's sitting up there
on the line before.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:50.440
e to the log y is y.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.340
So this parenthesis is
just containing y.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:55.670
Bring it down.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:58.270
Set it under there, and
you have it again.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:05.170
The derivative of log y
dy is 1 over e to the

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.660
log y, which is y.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.430
OK, we sort of have done more
about inverse functions than

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:20.600
typical lectures might, but I
did it really because they're

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.910
kind of not so simple.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:30.150
And yet, they're crucially
important in this situation of

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.240
connecting exponential
with log.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.556
And by the way, I prefer to
start with exponential.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.180
The logic goes also just fine.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.740
In fact, some steps are a little
smoother if you start

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:51.720
with a logarithm function,
define that somehow, and then

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.810
take its inverse, which will
be the exponential.

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:01.680
But for me, the exponential
is so all important.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.150
The logarithm is important, but
it's not in the league of

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.260
e to the x.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:11.640
So I prefer to do it this
way to know e to the x.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.530
Now if you bear with me,
I'll do the other

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.480
derivative for today.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.220
The other derivative
is this one.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.470
Can we do that?

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:29.520
OK, so I want the derivative
of this arc sine

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.610
function, all right?

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.230
So I'm going to--

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.850
let me bring that.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:42.150
This side of the board is now
going to be x is the inverse

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:49.810
sine of y, or it's often called
the arc sine of y.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.060
OK, good.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.190
All right.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.579
So again, I have a chain.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.020
I start with x.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.369
I create y.

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.560
So y is sine x.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:24.569
So y is the sine of x, but
x is the arc sine of y.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.670
That's the chain.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.810
Start with a y.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:27.760
Do f inverse.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.810
Do f, and you got y
again, all right?

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.820
Now, I'm interested in the
derivative, the derivative of

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.270
this arc sine of y.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:37.530
I want the y-derivative.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:43.360
I'm just going to copy this
plan, but instead of e, I've

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.630
got sines here.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.860
So take the y-derivative of both
sides, the y-derivative

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.170
of both sides.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.120
Well, I always like that one.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.250
The y-derivative of this
is the chain rule.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.560
So I have the sine of some
inside function.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:06.890
So the derivative is the cosine
of that inside function

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:11.620
times the derivative of the
inside function, which is the

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:12.870
guy we want.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:24.500
OK, so I have to figure
out that thing.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.500
In other words, I guess I've
got to think a little bit

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.880
about these inverse
trig functions.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:38.560
OK, so what's the story with
the inverse trig functions?

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.740
The point will be this
is an angle.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.000
Ha!

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.020
That's an angle.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.450
Let me draw the triangle.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.250
Here is my angle theta.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.870
Here is my sine theta.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.590
Here is my cos theta, and
everybody knows that now the

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.020
hypotenuse is 1.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.660
So here is theta.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.280
OK, whoa!

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.060
Wait a minute.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.330
I would love theta to
be the angle whose--

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.900
oh, maybe it is.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.430
This is the angle whose sine--

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:25.220
theta should be the angle
whose sine is y, right?

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:30.670
OK, theta is the angle
whose sine is y.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.040
OK, let me make that happen.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.380
And now, tell me the other side
because I got to get a

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.880
cosine in here somewhere.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.740
What is this side?

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.380
Back to Pythagoras, the
most important fact

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.960
about a right triangle.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.560
This side will be the
square root of--

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:57.110
this squared plus this squared
is 1, so this is the square

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.790
root of 1 minus y squared.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:04.510
And that's the cosine.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:12.635
The cosine of this angle theta
is this guy divided by 1.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:23.800
We're there, and all I've used
pretty quickly was I popped up

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.980
a triangle there.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.060
I named an angle theta.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.760
I took its sine to be y, and
I figured out what its

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.110
cosine had to be.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:34.590
OK, so there's the theta.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:40.720
Its cosine has to be this,
and now I'm ready to

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.290
write out the answer.

00:20:43.290 --> 00:20:45.480
I'm ready to write down
the answer there.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.050
That has a 1 equals--

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:55.010
the cosine of theta, that's this
times the derivative of

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.840
the inverse sine.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:15.360
You see, I had to get this
expression into something--

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.750
I had to solve it for y.

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.850
I had to figure out what
that quantity is as

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.120
a function of y.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.060
And now I just put
this down below.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:28.080
So if I cross this out
and put it down here,

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.770
I've got the answer.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:36.850
There is the derivative of the
arc sine function: 1 over the

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.350
square root of 1 minus
y squared.

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:51.670
OK, it's not as beautiful as
1/y, but it shows up in a lot

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:56.570
of problems. As we said earlier,
sines and cosines are

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:01.990
involved with repeated motion,
going around a circle, going

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.780
up and down, going across
and back, in and out.

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:10.310
And it will turn out that this
quantity, which is really

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.690
coming from the Pythagoras, is
going to turn up, and we'll

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.020
need to know that it's the
derivative of the arc sine.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.340
And may I just write down what's
the derivative of the

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.490
arc cosine as long
as we're at it?

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.960
And then I'm done.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.450
The derivative of the
arc cosine, well,

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:32.800
you remember what--

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:37.160
what's the difference between
sines and cosines when we take

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.410
derivatives?

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.230
The cosine has a minus.

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:46.710
So there'll be a minus 1
over the square root

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.310
of 1 minus y squared.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.350
That's sort of unexpected.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.000
This function has
this derivative.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.440
This function has the
same derivative but

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.690
with a minus sign.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.740
That suggests that somehow if I
add those, yeah, let's just

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.750
think about that for the
last minute here.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:21.480
That says that if I add sine
inverse y to cosine inverse y,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.070
their derivatives will cancel.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.100
So the derivative of that
sum of this one--

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.100
can I do a giant plus
sign there?--

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:33.490
is 0.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.580
The derivative of that plus the
derivative of that is a

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.350
plus thing and a minus
thing, giving 0.

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:41.600
So how could that be?

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.580
Have you ever thought
about what functions

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.560
have derivative 0?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.120
Well, actually, you have.
You know what

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.890
functions have no slope.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.670
Constant functions.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:05.270
So I'm saying that it must
happen that the arc sine

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:11.540
function plus the arc cosine
function is a constant.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.490
Then its derivative
is 0, and we are

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.510
happy with our formulas.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:18.770
And actually, that's true.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:24.410
The arc sine function
gives me this angle.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.320
The arc cosine function
would give me--

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.580
shall I give that angle another
name like alpha?

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.750
This one would be the theta.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.260
That one would be the alpha.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:43.690
And do you believe that in that
triangle theta plus alpha

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.320
is a constant and therefore
has derivative 0?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.560
In fact, yes, you
know what it is.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.870
Theta plus alpha in a right
triangle, if I add that angle

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.600
and that angle, I
get 90 degrees.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.350
A constant.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.840
Well, 90 degrees, but I
shouldn't allow myself to

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.880
write that.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.920
I must write it in radians.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.170
A constant.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:23.400
OK, don't forget the great
result from today.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:29.220
We filled in the one power that
was missing, and we're

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.220
ready to go.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.740
Thank you.
