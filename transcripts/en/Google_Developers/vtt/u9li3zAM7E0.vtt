JESSICA DENE
EARLEY-CHA: Hi there.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.700
Building an Action is exciting.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.450
But building an Action
without testing it,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.530
and simply hoping it's going
to work, isn't best practices.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.180
I would never create
a website and only

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.710
render the page at the end.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.797
My CSS would be
all kinds of wonky.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:14.880
Wouldn't it be great that
you could code a little,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.672
and then test your
Action to make sure it's

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:17.960
working before you deploy it?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.710
Ta-da-- the Actions Simulator.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.680
I made an Action that's
all about telling jokes

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.203
about fruit.

00:00:23.203 --> 00:00:24.870
While I was building
it, I tested it out

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.060
on the Action Simulator.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.270
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.270
What did the strawberries say
when they were given a gift?

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.145
Thank you berry much.

00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:33.520

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.253
[FAIL SOUND]

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.340
You could see the requests,
the response objects,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.775
as well as errors and the audio.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.150
You can even test out your
Actions on different surfaces,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.730
like on your phone, audio-only
devices like Google Home,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.820
and smart displays.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.218
You can even test out
in different languages.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:58.545
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:03.218

[FAIL SOUND]

00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:09.090
There are so many tools
in Actions Simulator

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.173
that help you while you're
developing your Action.

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:12.943
Check out the Docs
for more information.

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:15.360
Let us know what you build on
Twitter by using the hashtag

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.680
#AoGDevs.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.060
I'm Jessica Dene Earley-Cha.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.470
Thanks for watching, and I look
forward to see what you build.
