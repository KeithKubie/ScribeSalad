[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.200
DANIEL PADGETT:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.888
How's everybody doing?

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:15.520
It's day two of I/O. Good-- a
rounding "good" from everybody.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.870
I had this idea.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.410
I didn't go with it.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.600
I was going to grab my
guitar from my house

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.734
and bring it on stage.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.400
I wasn't going to
play you a whole song.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.500
I was just going to
play like three chords,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.180
and then I could
tell all my friends

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.520
that I played Shoreline.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.610
I didn't go with it, though.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.500
So title of the talk today--

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.330
"Finding the Right Voice--

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.300
Interactions for Your App."

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.940
By way of introduction,
my name is Daniel Padgett.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.210
And I'm a conversation
design lead here at Google.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.700
I have a very great pleasure
of working on Google Assistant,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.680
with a focus on
voice interactions

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.410
across the services
that we have--

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.480
Google Assistant.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.690
I work with an amazing
cross-functional team

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.660
that's tackling really
difficult problems.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.420
Actually, I've been working
in the language technology

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.120
space for about 15 years.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.100
And it's kind of
like everything's

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.220
coming together in a way
that's really exciting for me

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.760
personally.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.220
I've just been kind of
waiting for this stuff.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.720
This is that stuff
we thought about,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.990
like the sci-fi promise--

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.750
the stuff that "Star Trek" and
"Star Wars" and all that kind

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.490
of stuff--

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.360
things I was really
excited about as a kid.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.000
And I know there's
a ton of work to do.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.630
And we're nowhere near where
those bots happen to be.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.180
But this is a really exciting
time to be in this space

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.660
and working on Assistant.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.760
So a question I get a lot,
what is conversation design?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.950
And thank you for asking.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.120
For me, conversation design
is a carefully curated

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.410
back and forth between human
and artificially intelligent

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.000
machine.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.360
It generates a personalized and
context-sensitive experience

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.880
around tasks and content.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.860
And it's content
that we experience

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.440
in a very visceral way.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.320
It's like an immersive
experience filled with things

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.760
that we can see, that we
can hear, that we can touch.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.310
And it's contact that we can
interact with and control

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.660
by speaking and scrolling and
swiping and tapping and even

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.650
typing, as we announced
yesterday in the keynote.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.260
In that way, it's
a design practice

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.680
that really puts
humans at the center.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.880
It's one of the things
I really love about it.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.800
It lets us be us.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.880
And in the end, when
people ask, what do you do,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.770
I teach robots and
talk to humans.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.160
That's my gig.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.530
But we're here today to talk
specifically about voice-only

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.970
interactions--

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.300
voice-in, voice-out, no
screens, no tap targets,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.540
no navigation bars, just voice.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.020
Now I'm assuming that most
of you are new to this space,

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.510
and you're just starting
down the path here.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.966
Show of hands, has anyone
worked with voice in the past?

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:08.420
OK, a decent amount.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.570
Before we get too
far into specifics,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.670
I just want to say,
designing for voice

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.530
is different-- different than
for mobile and for websites.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.650
Please, take that at face value.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.490
I'm making no claims
about complexity here.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.647
Designing can be a tough thing.

00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:28.480
It's just different.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.870
Voice is different.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680
And that's what I'm hoping to
unpack a bit for you today.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.920
So here's a quick look at
what we're going to cover.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.110
I want to cover off
the value of voice--

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.780
again, voice online, no screens.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.640
We'll cover some
considerations, things

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.590
that you should be
thinking about as you're

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.110
creating voice experiences.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.690
And some opportunities-- really
some ideas around use cases.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.190
All right?

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.860
Sounds good?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.770
Good.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.420
So let's start with
the value of voice.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.140
The question here
really is, why?

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.310
Why voice?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.000
And for me, it boils
down to three things--

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.390
speed, simplicity, and ubiquity.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.330
All right.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.580
Now let's start with speed.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.710
Now voice interactions can
be extremely, extremely fast.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.320
Done well, they're even faster
than pulling your mobile phone

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.399
out of your back pocket.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:26.870
It's like, getting to the app
you want on a mobile phone

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.930
takes a tap or two,
maybe even a swipe.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.640
And when you get
to the app, you're

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.890
another tap and maybe even
some typing away from a result.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.540
With voice, you get
to bundle all that.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.780
And it's like the
ultimate shortcut.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.360
That's what I think
is really cool.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.120
Then there's just the
simplicity of use.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.480
You have users who
already know what to do.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.230
This is language.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.520
It's conversation.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.260
And they've been
doing this forever--

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.570
well, since they were born.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.500
And there's really
nothing for them to learn.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.570
Don't get me wrong, I'm
the first to acknowledge

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.360
the challenges around design
and technologies and things

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.270
like that.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.950
But the promise here
is, say what you want,

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.920
get what you want.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.410
And it doesn't really get
much simpler than that.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.810
And finally, there's just the
sheer number of entry points--

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.090
a number that continues to grow.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.880
You can already reach Google
Assistant and our actions

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.960
on Google partners on
millions of devices.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.870
And it feels like there are new
surfaces and new opportunities

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.060
popping up all the time.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.247
All you need really is a
microphone and a speaker.

00:05:36.247 --> 00:05:38.330
Well, that and a network
connection to the actions

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.650
on Google Platform,
but you get the point.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.950
The reality here is that
the numbers are significant.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.580
The potential here is massive.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.260
By the way, I don't
know if anybody

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.000
saw this thing that was
launched a couple weeks ago.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.140
Literally, cardboard, a
microphone, and a speaker,

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.810
Raspberry Pi, and you're
connected to Assistant.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.070
That's really cool stuff.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.240
Did anyone get one?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.180
No?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.170
Oh, one guy.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.970
Get one.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.810
I have one sitting
on my kitchen table.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.870
It's the next project
with my 11-year-old.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.430
I'm looking forward to it.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.810
Anyway, let's do a quick
thought experiment.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.230
Let's play, "how many
taps would it take?"

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.370
All right.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.165
Simple equation--
what's 15 times 24?

00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:24.290
You don't have to take out
your phones or anything.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.289
But just think about it.

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.384
If you took out
your mobile phone,

00:06:27.384 --> 00:06:28.550
how many taps would it take?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.950
You open your phone.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.080
You navigate to the app.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.910
You tap the app.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.430
You type the equation,
get your answer.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.510
I think I did it in eight
on my Pixel earlier today.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.040
Now how about this one--

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.470
play the latest album by
Guerrilla's on Spotify,

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.780
one of my favorites.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.340
I think on my device
I did it in 12 taps.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.090
I think there are a
couple swipes in there

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.120
to go through my
pretty lengthy library.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.880
Last one-- any direct flights
to Denver next Sunday?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.420
Anyone?

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.800
Right.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.850
I did stop counting.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.510
I actually stopped counting.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.510
So long story short,
with voice, we

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.470
can get our answers and actions
pretty much instantaneously.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.470
So why voice?

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.381
Ultimate convenience.

00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:24.880
It's really, really powerful
stuff, when done the right way.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.370
Now let's talk through
some considerations.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.430
It seemed like a lot of
you didn't raise your hand,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.555
so you're new to the space.

00:07:39.576 --> 00:07:41.200
The first thing I
wanted to talk to you

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.900
about is the nature
of the signal.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.850
I think it's a good
thing to acknowledge.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.320
Fact is, voice is linear.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.050
And it's always moving forward.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.868
It's ephemeral, too, which means
it's always fading behind you.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.280
If you can imagine, it's
like the critical elements

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.710
of your mobile app disappearing
pretty much as soon

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.940
as they appeared.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.600
The Back button, the Hamburger
menu just kind of fading away--

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.230
content appearing once and
only for a fleeting moment.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.350
It's kind of like you
got to catch up with it.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.620
Those anchors are critical to
visual and touch interfaces.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.490
They're persistent.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.200
They're available.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.360
So with voice, we
rely really heavily

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.619
on the users' knowledge
of conversation

00:08:23.619 --> 00:08:24.660
and what they can recall.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.610
So some things to
think through, based

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.280
on the nature of the signal--

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.610
keeping people
comfortable, helping

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.659
them stay in that space and
that thing that they know--

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.590
the metaphor of conversation.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.809
Use everyday language
that users can relate to.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.420
It's a really important one.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.240
Ask questions that
are easy to answer.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.810
You don't want them
thinking too much.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.810
You're going to time out anyway
with the current technologies.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.950
And structure information in a
way that supports easy recall.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.660
Make it easier for
them to remember

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.080
the stuff you're presenting.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.780
The strategies around this--

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.670
or deeper strategies
around this-- and I'm

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.060
not going to go deep here.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.270
I would actually encourage
you, tomorrow, there's

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.280
a talk by a gentleman
named James Giangola,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.020
a friend of mine and colleague.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.005
He's giving a great
talk on what we call

00:09:20.005 --> 00:09:21.130
the co-operative principle.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.890
I'll show you some
details later.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.220
But that's going to
be some good stuff.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.620
All right, moving on.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.340
The other thing that
you want to consider

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.350
is the capabilities
of the technology.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.520
Recognizing the
words people say is

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.860
much different than
understanding what

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.710
they mean when they say them.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:48.190
Now with respect to
recognition, Google already

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.920
had a low word-error rate.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.810
But we continue to
improve, apparently.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:56.950
I saw in Sundar's
keynote yesterday

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.560
that after applying deep
learning to the problem,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.500
we slashed our word-error
rate again significantly.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.260
And now we're down to
something like 4.9%.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.690
That's an absolutely
amazing result.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:13.450
So to some extent, recognition
is a, quote unquote,

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.400
"solved problem."

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.080
Yes, there's still
room to improve.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.690
But it's more or less
a solved problem.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.770
But language understanding is
a more difficult nut to crack.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:29.710
So just a couple examples
maybe to illustrate the point--

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.750
what's the weather
in Springfield?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.600
So which Springfield
are we talking about?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.480
Missouri, Massachusetts,
some other Springfield?

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.160
I did a Google
search, and there's

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.600
I think one in every state.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.270
I think it's the most popular
name for a city in the nation.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.810
Maybe the best
solution to answering

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.580
this question for
the person who posed

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.560
it is to apply some context.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.240
Like, we know that the user
lives in Springfield, Missouri.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.730
Therefore, we provide
them with the weather

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.160
in Springfield, Missouri.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.035
But maybe that's
not the right thing.

00:11:11.035 --> 00:11:13.410
Maybe it's weird that they're
asking the question, what's

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.570
the weather in Springfield,
when they live in Springfield.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.220
Wouldn't they ask,
what's the weather here,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.470
what's the weather like
today-- that sort of thing?

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.480
I don't know.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.810
It's possible they mean one
of the other Springfields.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.490
How about another one?

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.620
Play "Yesterday."

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.130
Is that the song?

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.710
Is that the movie?

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.860
There is a movie.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.590
The playlist, an audio book?

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.440
Maybe it's a game.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.350
Who knows?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.280
Now again, applying
context and the things

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.910
a company like Google
would know about users,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.440
statistically they're
probably looking for the song.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.940
Right?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.800
But that opens up
other complexities.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.301
While I have no idea why anyone
would want to hear anything

00:11:56.301 --> 00:11:58.300
other than the original
version by the Beatles--

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.430
that's my personal preference--

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.480
perhaps they want to hear
the dulcet tones of Boyz II

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.590
Men singing their R&amp;B
rendition and the cover

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.777
that they did in the early
'90s or some other version.

00:12:11.777 --> 00:12:12.610
I really don't know.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.390
Anyway, it's something
to consider as you

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.800
deploy your voice applications.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.040
I have no doubt that you're
going to be running into this.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.390
Some strategies here--
acknowledge ambiguity.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.850
When you don't know
the answer, you

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.720
can't apply the
appropriate context.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.430
And let users clarify.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.110
Don't be afraid to engage.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.590
A lot of people, I hear them
say, well, it's an extra step.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.092
Believe me, taking
that extra step

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:40.800
is way better than
the correction they're

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.910
going to have to do
if you get it wrong.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.630
So just keep that in mind.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.040
And remember, there are choices.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.590
And leverage them
next time, if you can.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.850
This is the learning part.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.572
Keep a record, and
apply that the next time

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:54.780
that they come into your app.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.210
It's going to be super useful
for streamlining interactions

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.793
in the future.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.095
Last, but certainly not
least, we have our users.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.940
Always, always, always,
we need to consider

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.275
our users and their context.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.680
We've always kind of talked
about voice-only interactions

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.490
being the hero for people
whose hands are busy,

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.370
whose eyes are busy,
who are doing some sort

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.540
of multitasking, typically
in private or at least

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.430
in a familiar space--

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:34.432
something he's sharing with a
family or something like that.

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:36.890
It's voice interactions while
they're driving in their car,

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.330
cooking in the kitchen--

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.550
that sort of thing.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.910
And that's absolutely
still the case.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.099
But there's definitely
movement outside of that--

00:13:45.099 --> 00:13:46.640
people leveraging
voice while they're

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.860
on the move in public
spaces, for instance,

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.900
like on their bike.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.940
I see kids a lot using
this stuff on the street.

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.820
But what I really
want to cover here

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.620
is something that we
touched on earlier--

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:05.170
the fact that users
are instant experts.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:09.040
There is nothing to teach, or
at least there shouldn't be.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.180
Again, this is language.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.402
It's conversation.

00:14:11.402 --> 00:14:13.360
It's something that
they've been doing forever.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.290
And because of that, they
have high expectations

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:22.820
and very, very, very
low tolerance for error.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.429
This stuff should
just work, right?

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:27.970
Now let's think about that for
a second-- the difference here

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:35.300
between touch and text input and
for a visual UI and a voice UI.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.750
With a touch UI--

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.450
with visual, tappable UIs--

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:48.200
reasons for errors
tend to be transparent.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.480
You know when you had
a typo or when you've

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.300
hit the wrong top target.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.250
You know when you need
to course correct.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.500
And you're in control.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.770
You know what to do,
you take the step,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:03.770
and you make the correction.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.860
On the voice side,
though, errors

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.490
are typically the system's
fault, not the users.

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:14.250
That is, if the user
is truly cooperating,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.960
if they're not
speaking nonsense.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.990
It really then becomes
the system's fault.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.260
They have to rely heavily,
when there's error,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.940
on the system to get
them back on track.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.020
That said, some
strategies here--

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.610
make sure you're really, really,
really spending time developing

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.800
a strategy for exceptions.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.470
I just can't stress this enough.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.450
This is the thing that
is going to make or break

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.510
your application.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.002
You want to make it really easy
for them to get back on track.

00:15:49.002 --> 00:15:50.460
And you want to
leverage techniques

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.490
that we use in
everyday conversation.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.280
Maybe I could try to
illustrate this one.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.860
So you're collecting
a date from somebody.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.490
You ask them, what date
do you want to travel?

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.060
And somebody says, April 14th.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.440
Let's say you needed the
year for some reason.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
Actually, let's back up.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.550
You asked for the date.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:21.410
They say, yeah, April 14th.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:22.130
I'm sorry.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.570
Brain-- April 14th.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.210
You want you want
the year as well.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.668
For some odd known
reason, they may

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:30.620
be traveling a year from now.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.900
If you force them to
give you the year,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.700
that's going to
create this loop.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.230
You're going to
throw them an error.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.790
You're going to say,
sorry, I didn't get that.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.590
You're going to ask
them to repeat the day.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.199
And you frustrated a user.

00:16:47.199 --> 00:16:48.740
So instead, your
strategy here should

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.290
be, accept the
April 14th and just

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.720
move on and say, what year?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.810
Just use the type of things that
we do in everyday conversation.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.140
Or if you have some sort
of recognition error,

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:07.940
an easy strategy is simply, if
they say a date incorrectly,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.942
sorry, what's the date?

00:17:08.942 --> 00:17:11.150
And just ask them to repeat
it in a very natural way.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.619
Now lastly, we're going to
touch on some opportunities--

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.469
opportunities use cases.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.940
Now from a user perspective,
what they're asking here

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.700
really, or what
they're telling us,

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.470
I should say, in the space
is, answer my questions,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.754
help me get things
done, keep me on track,

00:17:47.754 --> 00:17:48.920
and give me something to do.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.720
From a developer
perspective, I think

00:17:53.720 --> 00:18:00.670
that means supply quick answers,
frictionless transactions,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.450
and give relevant suggestions.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:10.960
So some use cases, just
taken from some verticals

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.564
in the space--

00:18:13.564 --> 00:18:14.980
some verticals
that are out there.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.070
Like if you're in financial,
some things that you might want

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.420
to consider-- what's my current
balance, how much do I owe,

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.280
what was my last transaction--

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.240
some things that should
be quick and fast.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.870
I need to make a payment,
transfer $100 to Joe's account,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.210
or when does my policy expire?

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.645
Maybe some of you are in retail.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:47.180
Is my order on the way, what's
your return policy, do you do

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:49.829
same-day delivery?

00:18:49.829 --> 00:18:50.870
Maybe it's a stock check.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.690
Do you carry milk, are
headphones on sale,

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:56.490
I need to reorder cat food?

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.140
Health care-- actually a
space that I came from--

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.410
is my prescription
ready, can I get

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.830
a flu shot, do you have
any appointments available?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.600
Maybe there's a clinic.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.120
I need to schedule
a follow-up, I

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.880
need to leave a
note for my doctor.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.124
Refill my prescription
is a really fast one.

00:19:17.124 --> 00:19:19.040
Wonder if there's anybody
from Walgreens here.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.560
Anyone?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.660
Hey, how's it going?

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.920
And lastly, just
another vertical

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.630
that I thought through--

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.600
fun and wellness.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.050
What's my horoscope,
got any good dad jokes?

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.700
Actually, I think
every morning, my son

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.050
asks Google Home that
we have in the kitchen,

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.747
he asks him to tell him a joke.

00:19:44.747 --> 00:19:46.580
And then he tries to
pass it off on his own.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.360
He runs into the bathroom
where my wife is getting ready

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.900
and tries to pass it
off like it's his.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.650
Some other opportunities around
reading stories or playing

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.892
a game or meditation--

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.310
in the end, I think the
thing that you really

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.920
need to make sure is that it's
easier than the alternative.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:22.410
If it's not more convenient for
your users to do this in voice,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.724
it really probably
isn't worth pursuing.

00:20:26.724 --> 00:20:28.140
And so I can't
stress this enough.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.265
Make sure it's easier than
the alternative for you.

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.970
Now I mentioned
some related talks.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.660
There is one that was
done earlier today

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.370
on multi-modal design.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.940
And that was done
by my colleagues

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.290
Jared Strotterman
and Adriana Olmos.

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.640
"One Size Doesn't Fit All--

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.170
Defining Multi-Modal
Interactions,"

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.340
and I would encourage you
to go watch that online.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.090
There is one tonight at
6:30 by Nandini Stocker

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.797
called "In Conversation
There Are No Errors."

00:21:03.797 --> 00:21:05.630
and that gets at the
strategies that we were

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.780
discussing a little earlier.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.690
And then finally, the one
that I mentioned by James,

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.510
"Applying Built-in
Hacks of Conversation

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.790
to Your Voice UI" is really
all about that cooperative

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:20.540
principle and making sure
that you are leveraging

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.600
the rules of discourse
and conversation

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.390
to make your users very
comfortable in your speech

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.720
application and your design.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.580
I feel like there
was a massive chunk

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.730
of that that has disappeared
from my presentation somehow.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.050
And I am at the
end, unfortunately.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:44.850
Here's a URL for you to
go to and to check out

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.650
some stuff by the
actions on Google Design

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.440
team and Developer team.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.200
Make sure you take that
down and go check it out.
