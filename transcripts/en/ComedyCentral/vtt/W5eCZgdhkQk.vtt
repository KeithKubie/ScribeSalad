Oh, my story is a tough one.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.940
I'm baring my soul a little bit
here.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:17.577
- I'm not gonna be
the hero of this story.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.313
It's about cheating.
It's about me cheating.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.583
And I know generally I think of
myself as a pretty

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.885
likable comedian.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.621
But once I start talking about
me cheating,

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:30.056
I realize how white trash I
look.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.425

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.678
[laughter]

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.415
But this happened about
13 years ago.

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:57.617
I got caught cheating.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.852
I was with my daughter's mother

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.689
at the time,
and I was a 23-year-old

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.691
fat kid doing comedy.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.627
And after a show one night,
I met a girl.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.295
Very pretty.
I was very insecure.

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.130
It was no nice to have
this really cute chick

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.199
walk up to me,
and she made an offer

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.634
I kind of couldn't refuse.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.003
It was essentially...

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.337
"Wanna fuck?"

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.206
[laughter]

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.974
You know, I was like, "Yeah.

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.278
I would like to."

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:26.946
And we did.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.215
And you know you're supposed to
with a girl

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.617
who walks up
and says, "Wanna fuck?"

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.152
After you fuck her,

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:35.655
you make her
your long-term side girlfriend.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:40.526
[laughter]

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.162
Which I went ahead and did.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.630
And I was seeing her
for a while,

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.666
and it was a wild--a wild time.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.334
A lot of things
out of my wheelhouse.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:49.702
She was younger than me,

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.671
and I was taking
naked pictures of her,

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.139
she was taking
naked pictures of me,

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.141
we're fucking in
all kinds of weird places.

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.709
It was a good time.

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.345
But I'm doing a bad, bad thing.

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:02.882
And one day
I'm at the side girl's house,

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:05.218
and as I'm looking through
my phone for something,

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:10.056
she notices that her phone
number is under a fake name.

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.192
And she goes,
"What's that all about?"

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:14.860
And I was like, "Oh."

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:16.696
Now, here's the mistake
I'm making in cheating.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.531
And I'm not encouraging this
or telling you how to do it...

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.366
[light laughter]

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.034
But if you do,

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.704
you can't lie to both chicks.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.172
[laughter]

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:30.409
One of them has to know what's
going on.

00:03:30.442 --> 00:03:31.677
I really...

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.212
[laughter]

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.881
I really enjoy--there's a girl
nodding her head

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:38.017
like I'm giving a speech
about...

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.218
[laughter]

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.720
The fucking pipeline or
something.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:43.889
She's like...
[laughter]

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:46.359
"Give those natives back their
land."

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:49.962
[laughter]

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:51.564
One of them's got to know the
truth.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.199
I was lying to both.
That's a mistake.

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:55.034
So, when she goes,
"Why is my number different

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.903
in your phone--
my name's not in your phone?"

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:00.973
I was like, "Oh, yeah,
you know, when we first met,

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.743
"I didn't remember your name,
so I put it in

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.077
"as a different name.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.912
I knew it started
with an L."

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.582
And she's like,
"Yeah, but it says 'Larry.'"

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:13.953
[laughter]

00:04:13.986 --> 00:04:17.056
And I'm like, "That it does."

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.293
[laughter]

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.894
She's like,
"You're lying to me.

00:04:21.927 --> 00:04:23.396
Something's weird.
You're lying."

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.898
I go, "You're crazy.
You're being crazy.

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.600
"Let me show you
how not afraid I am

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:28.934
to have your name
in my phone."

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:32.605
I put her name as
her first name,

00:04:32.638 --> 00:04:34.607
my last name.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.677
And then I go home...yeah.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.980
[laughter]

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.285
I go home that night,

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:48.287
and like a real true
piece of shit,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.490
I put my cell phone
every night in my pillowcase.

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:54.794
[laughter]

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.964
I told you I don't look good.

00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:02.868
I promise I get mine at the end
of this.

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.539
I usually turn it off, put it
in my pillowcase.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.307
Why would I tell my ex that?

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.976
Because I don't like
to be bothered when I'm asleep.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.679
So I keep my phone off
and in my pillowcase.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.981
[light laughter]

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:18.684
It was a terrible lie.

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:20.286
But I didn't turn it off
that night.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.687
And in the morning,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.856
this girl--the side girl--

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.158
starts calling my phone a ton.

00:05:26.191 --> 00:05:29.161
And I'm sleeping
like a baby cherub.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.831
I'm so peaceful.

00:05:31.864 --> 00:05:35.634
She eventually--
my ex picks up the phone

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:39.839
and sees this girl's first name
with my last name,

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.374
and is like, you know,

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:43.542
"I've never heard of
this cousin or auntie."

00:05:43.575 --> 00:05:47.813
[laughter]

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.648
She goes ahead
and answers the phone.

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:50.983
"Who's this?"

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.386
"Jay's girlfriend.
Who's this?"

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.687
"Jay's girlfriend."

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.590
And then,
the nightmare happens.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:06:01.060
They have an hour-long
conversation about me

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:04.697
while I am sleeping
like no one's--

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.600
I'm just scratching balls.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.769
Visions of sugarplums.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:13.372
[laughter]

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:14.673
They talk for an hour.

00:06:14.706 --> 00:06:16.075
They figure it all out.

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:18.010
My ex was in law school at the
time.

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:19.845
That's important to the story,
because she woke me up

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:22.181
by pecking me in the face with
a law book.

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:23.883
[laughter]

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:27.453
A very thick book, a lot of
torts, and...

00:06:27.486 --> 00:06:29.054
[laughter]

00:06:29.087 --> 00:06:30.456
That must have been civil law
or something.

00:06:30.489 --> 00:06:31.724
It was a lot.

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.926
And she wakes me up.

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:35.761
We have a terrible, terrible
argument,

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:37.596
and everything blows up
in my face,

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.400
and now two people in the world
absolutely fucking hate me.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:43.636
And I deserve that.
I get that.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.272
But the saving grace of my life
at the time was,

00:06:46.305 --> 00:06:48.474
I feel terrible;
I'm a human being.

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:49.708
I know I've hurt people.

00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:51.410
But I'm like, you know what?

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:53.112
I just remembered.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.247
I think the day after tomorrow,
I'm going to South Africa

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.482
for three weeks.

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:58.117
[stammers]
I get to get away from this

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.619
for a little bit,
let the heat die down.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:03.155
And then that night, I got a
reminder on my phone

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:05.624
that says I'm not leaving for
South Africa

00:07:05.657 --> 00:07:08.427
for an entire other week.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.263
So I've got to live in this
hatred for a week.

00:07:11.296 --> 00:07:13.599
And every day it's just two
people finding me

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:15.668
and cursing me out and kicking
me in the nuts.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.937
I got the whole deal.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.071
And the nights were bad.

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.073
I was drinking a lot.

00:07:21.106 --> 00:07:22.608
I have some weird stories from
that.

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:27.279
I--I was driven home one night
by a midget.

00:07:27.312 --> 00:07:32.318
[laughter]

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.620
I don't know if I knew him
before that night.

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:38.457
I don't think I did.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.626
I just remember the whole drive
going, like,

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:42.261
"How does he get those pedals?"

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:44.129
But...
[laughter]

00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:46.499
There's these big wood sticks
that come up.

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.634
It's freaky.

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.437
The night before I left for
South Africa,

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:55.808
I drunkenly got these two star
tattoos on my elbows

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.843
right before I sat in the
middle seat

00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:02.314
of a 26-hour flight to South
Africa.

00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:03.315
Yeah, it sucked.

00:08:03.348 --> 00:08:05.818
[laughter]

00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:08.020
I'm in South Africa.
I'm very sad.

00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:09.822
Things are not going good
for me in my life.

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:11.156
I'm bummed out.

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.158
I'm there for about a week

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.894
and I'm like, you know what?

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.328
This is before the time of

00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:17.997
international cell phone
plans.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.165
This is calling card shit.

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:23.536
So I go, "Let me check my
messages on my cell phone."

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.338
And I dial up the numbers, and
I go--

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.542
it says,
"You have 19 messages."

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.378
The first message is my friend,
Wayne,

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:35.347
a gay man who lives in the
East Village of New York City,

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.849
very gay.

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:40.319
He goes, "Uh, hey, pal,
I was just cruising through

00:08:40.352 --> 00:08:42.855
Craigslist's
'Men Looking for Men'"...

00:08:42.888 --> 00:08:46.125
[laughter]

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:55.100
"And I saw--I saw an ad

00:08:55.133 --> 00:08:57.703
with your name in it..."

00:08:57.736 --> 00:08:59.171
[laughter]

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:02.007
"A naked picture of you--
and it is you..."

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.278
[laughter]

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:09.048
"With your phone number
and your TV credits."

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:12.318
[laughter]

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.557
He goes, "I don't know
if this is something

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.892
that you wanted..."

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:22.394
[laughter]

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:25.431
"But I feel like it's not.

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:28.934
So I'm gonna go ahead and flag
it for you."

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:31.403
[laughter]

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.572
I'm like, "Okay.

00:09:33.605 --> 00:09:35.240
"Wayne's gonna take care of
that.

00:09:35.273 --> 00:09:36.742
All right, Wayne's on the
job."

00:09:36.775 --> 00:09:38.410
[laughter]

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:40.646
And the picture, by the way,
for the record?

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:43.449
Me and this girl, she got out
of the shower one day--

00:09:43.482 --> 00:09:45.250
the side girl--

00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:48.153
in a towel,
and she flashed it open,

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:49.755
I took a picture of her.

00:09:49.788 --> 00:09:51.423
And she was like, "No fair."

00:09:51.456 --> 00:09:53.058
And I go, "What do you want,
to take a picture of me?"

00:09:53.091 --> 00:09:54.259
And she goes, "Yeah."
So, jokingly,

00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:55.894
as I'm out of the shower, too,

00:09:55.927 --> 00:09:58.430
and I mean with real,
just-took-a-shower dick...

00:09:58.463 --> 00:10:01.166
[laughter]

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.769
It's a picture of me,
full body,

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:08.807
butt-naked, 70 pounds heavier

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.610
with my arms up
in the doorjamb,

00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:13.278
really trying to
stretch it all out,

00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:15.447
just trying to get the best...

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.282
If there was a centerfold of
"Fat Quarterly,"

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:19.018
that's what it would be.

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:20.753
That's the fat Tom Selleck.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.488
[laughter]

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:24.990
- Hell no.
- "Hell no" is right.

00:10:25.023 --> 00:10:26.992
[laughter]

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:29.461
Whoever said that is right.

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:32.431
It wasn't a flattering picture.

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:34.133
However...

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.469
the next 18 messages
on my phone

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:40.773
were dudes really trying hard
to fuck me.

00:10:40.806 --> 00:10:42.775
[laughter]

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:46.879
Which by call seven
was getting flattering.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:49.214
And some of those dudes wanted
to fuck me bad.

00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:50.883
I mean, they put in their...

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:54.186
Steve--a guy named Steve--
called, like, five times.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.455
[laughter]

00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:59.058
And he called me "Bear,"
which was adorable.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.160
[laughter]

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:02.561
He was like, "Hey, Bear.

00:11:02.594 --> 00:11:04.663
Why don't you call me back,
Bear?"

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.733
[laughter]

00:11:11.369 --> 00:11:13.972
"I saw that you were recently
on VH1's

00:11:14.005 --> 00:11:15.908
"Why are you Wearing This?"

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.010
[laughter]

00:11:18.043 --> 00:11:21.513
"40 Celebrity Slim-downs."

00:11:21.546 --> 00:11:23.682
[laughter]

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:25.751
[laughs]

00:11:25.784 --> 00:11:28.020
And I was pretty--oh, shit.

00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:30.522
I was, uh...

00:11:30.555 --> 00:11:32.858
I was pretty panicky about it.

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:34.760
And...but it was flagged.

00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:36.862
And I was like, "All right,
no harm, no foul."

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.331
And...through all this,

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:42.167
me and my daughter's mother
stayed together.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.370
We had a long talk,
and we got through it.

00:11:45.403 --> 00:11:48.907
We're not together now, but...

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.410
this one, we got through.

00:11:51.443 --> 00:11:55.180
And I thought all was well.

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:58.383
And then...I found out

00:11:58.416 --> 00:12:00.853
how you get something flagged

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.588
on Craigslist is,

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:07.025
a lot of people have to do it.

00:12:07.058 --> 00:12:08.927
And I was like, "Wayne,
how did you just flag it?"

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.763
He goes, "No, don't worry.
We got it flagged.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:12.231
It's no big deal."

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:13.632
And I go, "Okay, all right.

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:14.900
"Well, it's gone.
That's all that matters.

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:16.468
You can't find it."

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:18.971
And then...
do you guys remember,

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:20.239
a comedy mentor of mine--

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.440
I'm sure
a lot of you guys know--

00:12:21.473 --> 00:12:23.108
the late, great Patrice O'Neal.

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:24.910
[cheers and applause]

00:12:24.943 --> 00:12:28.180
Yeah.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:32.751
He was like a big brother to me

00:12:32.784 --> 00:12:34.419
and really embraced me
when I went to New York.

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:36.955
And for as long as I lived in
New York,

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:38.423
while we was alive,

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:41.393
every Thanksgiving, me, my
daughter,

00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:44.129
and my ex would go to his
house for Thanksgiving.

00:12:44.162 --> 00:12:47.599
And my daughter's a baby still,
and that next Thanksgiving,

00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:50.636
I go to Patrice's house,
and he goes--

00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.771
he goes, "Hey, man,
happy Thanksgiving."

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:54.506
"Hey, Jay, do me a favor.

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:58.143
Could you go hit the mouse
on the computer real quick?"

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:03.148
[laughter]

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.118
And I was like, "Why?
What's up, man?

00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:07.486
[light laughter]

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:09.421
He was like,
"Just...just go ahead.

00:13:09.454 --> 00:13:13.792
Just smack the..."

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:16.595
Reluctantly, I walk over
and smack this thing.

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:20.199
His whole screensaver is just
a big old picture...

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.034
[laughter]

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:26.004
I'm pretty sure he died with
that on his fucking computer.

00:13:26.037 --> 00:13:29.608
I hope that house burns down.

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:31.944
Either that, or Patrice's mom
has a picture of my dick

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.645
somewhere in her house.

00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:36.515
[laughter]

00:13:36.548 --> 00:13:39.785
I wanna say something,
uh, before I get out of here.

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.453
'Cause you guys are a fucking
awesome crowd,

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:43.322
and I'll tell you this,

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:44.990
this show is very important
to me, man.

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.658
It really is, because...

00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:48.560
with all
some of the cool things

00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:51.029
that have happened for me
over the last couple of years,

00:13:51.062 --> 00:13:52.664
my Comedy Central special,

00:13:52.697 --> 00:13:54.967
and--and being on the radio
and all this cool stuff,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.569
started because Ari Shaffir,

00:13:57.602 --> 00:14:00.305
when this was still
a digital show,

00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:01.707
they were only using
LA comics,

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.842
and he wanted me
on the show so bad,

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:05.878
he personally flew me out
from New York

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:08.513
and put me up at his apartment
to get me on this show,

00:14:08.546 --> 00:14:10.349
which led to so many other
fucking things.

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:13.418
And this my fourth or fifth
story I've told on this show.

00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:15.053
And that means the world to me,

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:16.421
that they keep
bringing me back.

00:14:16.454 --> 00:14:17.522
So keep supporting the show,
man.

00:14:17.555 --> 00:14:19.057
Thank you guys so much.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.192
[cheers and applause]
