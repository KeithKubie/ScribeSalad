00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.780
I hate going to bars.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.640
*cheering*

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.980
You wait in line forever for an overpriced drink.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.800
That will be $75.00.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.880
Times 25.  Plus tax.  And Tip.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.000
And of course there's always that one guy

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.300
who tries to neg you like he just took an online course

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.320
or read a book or something and now he's trying out his experiments.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.240
You know I'm not really into Asians but...

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.940
...for you I'd make an exception.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.540
Trimmed my pubes for nothing.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.880
And no matter what, there is always such a long line

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.020
for the bathroom.  Okay?  Look at this line!

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.180
Why is there only one stall here?

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.240
*screaming*

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.320
There's always that one girl who can't handle her alcohol.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.940
Is this the line for the bathroom?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.340
No, you're lying down sweetie.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.740
Mmhm.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.240
Okay.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.800
And if you're lucky, you just might meet this guy.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.340
Hey, can I buy you a drink?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.680
Sure.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.180
Great.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820
And then maybe later we can both go to the abandoned

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.620
ravine and see how long we can hold each others

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.140
heads underwater.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.760
I'd love to see what you look like without that dress on.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.220
And without that skin on.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.240
I'll get you that drink first.  We'll talk about the skin later?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.020
No!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.140
I'd really like to come back around to that skin.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.580
Okay, I think one of us just crossed the line.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.020
*screaming*

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.780
And of course finally there's always the person

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.100
who gets blackout drunk and doesn't remember

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.760
how much of an asshole they were being.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.120
I'm Anna Akana you stay awesome--

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.300
*crash*

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.920
And, before I go, I do want to say

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.840
thank you to Mike and Megan from Catastrophic Creations.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.940
As you may have noticed, my apartment is full of cat furniture.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.440
I've got sisal poles, I've got raceway tracks, I've got an Indiana Jones bridge.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.920
I've got all the stuff!

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.880
And that is from Catastrophic Creations.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.220
They create functional yet really contemporary

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.160
and modern looking cat furniture to match the decor of my apartment.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160
And if you didn't know, I have 4 cats.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.480
I have four cats!  So territory can be a little bit of an issue.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.280
But with all the cat furniture they have their own little spaces.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.140
And Congress, everyday after dinner, loves to run across the Indiana Jones bridge,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.180
screaming for no apparent reason.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.520
Probably like rejoicing that he had dinner.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.380
So it's just the best so thank you so much

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.040
to Mike and Megan, I love you and I love your cats and love your cat furniture.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.060
And if you're interested, adopt 2 cats

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.140
and I'll put a link to their Etsy shop in the description bar

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.540
so you can give them some fun raceway tracks

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.960
to just like run around with on their little paws.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.920
And the sisal pole is great because, if you can see it right there,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.060
that long pole right there,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.140
they [the cats] scratch that instead of the couches.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.240
So Brad don't get mad heehee.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.980
I'll see you next Monday.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.200
I'm Anna Akana.  Stay awesome Gotham.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.260
It's back!
