of this because we grew up in the in the
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.420
of this because we grew up in the in the
bureaucratic model and so we're trying

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
bureaucratic model and so we're trying
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670
bureaucratic model and so we're trying
to change not just the way we act but

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
to change not just the way we act but
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.170

and it's going to change the battlefield

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
and it's going to change the battlefield
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.360
and it's going to change the battlefield
as well you know it's inevitable that

we're seeing that is the debate around

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
we're seeing that is the debate around
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.700
we're seeing that is the debate around
unmanned vehicles so is is is a

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
unmanned vehicles so is is is a
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010

the question at some point no I think
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910
the question at some point no I think
it's at a question not to think about

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
it's at a question not to think about
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520
it's at a question not to think about
that as a as a possible end state we're

that as a as a possible end state we're
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.730
that as a as a possible end state we're
so on the front edge of these debates

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740
so on the front edge of these debates
 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.950
so on the front edge of these debates

part is if you look at the discussions

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
part is if you look at the discussions
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.490
part is if you look at the discussions
around this type of technology for the
