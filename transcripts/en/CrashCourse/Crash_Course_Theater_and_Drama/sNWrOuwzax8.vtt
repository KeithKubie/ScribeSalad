00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
Hey there!

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.219
I’m Mike Rugnetta and THIS is the first
episode of Crash Course Theater.

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:09.219
Welcome!

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.929
In the episodes to come we’ll have it all:
tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.140
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral-expealidocious.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.860
Yup, this series could go on forever.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.360
And let me introduce you to Dionysus, Greek
god of the theater.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.840
[[[Maybe Dionysus belches from offstage.]]]

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.840
And wine.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.070
They can’t all be charming, genius birdmen,
I guess.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.870
In this series we’ll explore the history
of theater and how we can understand and analyze

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.870
it.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.539
We’ll take a look at significant plays and
performances along the way, but in this episode

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.179
we’re going to define theater and look at
some theories about how it got started.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.720
So, Prologue over!

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.800
Act 1, Scene 1, BEGIN!

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.170
INTRO
First!

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.780
Let’s define “theater, the building”:
a theater is a place in which a play is performed.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.350
If you trace the word back to its Greek origins
and it literally means “the seeing place.”

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.760
It can be big or small, indoors or outdoors,
purpose-built or just borrowed.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.190
Sometimes plays are performed in spaces that
aren’t really theaters at all—in a park

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.160
or a parking lot, on a sidewalk, or in a private
home.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.800
Theater also refers to the performance of
plays and to the body of literature and other

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.390
documentation that has accompanied it.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.880
Some plays, known as closet dramas, aren’t
even written to be performed.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.530
And that’s theater, too.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.640
So are improvised plays that don’t have
a script and plays that have a script, but

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.250
don’t use words, like some of Samuel Beckett’s
shorts.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.380
A familiar definition is that theater requires
at least one actor and at least one audience

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.730
member and that definitely covers a lot of
stuff.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.820
But - what’s an actor?

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.630
What’s an audience member?

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.480
While most plays use human actors, there are
plays performed by robots and laptops with

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.110
voice synthesizers.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.380
There are plays performed by animals and by
puppets, though usually there’s a human

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.900
helping out with those.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.640
I hope.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.709
Sooooo … Is everything theater?

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.599
If you want a really expansive definition,
the composer John Cage said that “theater

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:24.219
takes place all the time, wherever one is;
an art simply facilitates persuading one this

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.430
is the case.”

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.230
So…is this theater?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.319
Well, not for you.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.040
You’re watching a video recorded earlier.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040
But here.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.040
In this room.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.489
I’m performing, right?

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.489
And there’s an audience if you include Stan
and Zulaiha watching me.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.290
Am I doing theater?

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.400
Want to hear my “To be or not to be,”
guys?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.400
Yorick?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400
Aw.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.620
They say no every time!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.159
A plague on both your houses.

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.480
What is and isn’t theater is the kind of
question that can make your head spin.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.349
We’ll come back to it a couple of times,
especially when we talk about political theater

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.189
and protest theater and immersive theater,
but for now we’ll use a more narrow definition:

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:06.609
theater is a deliberate performance created
by live actors and intended for a live audience,

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.769
typically making use of scripted language.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.950
We may meet some exceptions along the way—lookin’
at you, robo-actors—but this’ll work for

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.950
now.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.310
And, before we get too far, let’s confront
the perennial controversy: should you spell

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.879
theatre re or er?

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.189
And the short answer is, both of them are
fine!

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:30.879
RE is more common outside of the US but for
some folks, this spelling acts as a shibboleth.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.129
You may have heard someone say “a theater
is a building; but the theatre is an art!”

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.189
or “theater is a destination, but theatre
is a journey”.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:47.560
Here at Crash Course, we don’t mind either...
but have chosen to stick with er for consistency.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.870
There’s no origin story for theater that
everyone agrees on, but there are some theories

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.870
we can explore.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.700
In the West, at least, up until the sixth
or seventh century BCE we didn’t have theater

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.200
as we know it today, but we did have religious
ritual, which can get pretty theatrical.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.720
Rituals are often ways of mediating between
the human and the supernatural.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.359
They can serve to enact or re-enact significant
events in the human or supernatural world—births,

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.030
marriages, deaths, harvests.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.060
In ritual, according to the mythology scholar
Mircea Eliade, “The time of the event that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.330
the ritual commemorates or reenacts is made
present.”

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.430
So ritual represents, literally re-presents—old
stories or ideas and makes them happen now,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.099
which is a lot like what theater does.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.350
This doesn’t mean that ritual is identical
with theater.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.680
Ritual is sacred, and theater is usually secular
(though not always, as we’ll see!).

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.470
Theater and ritual can draw on similar mythological
sources, but ritual typically treats those

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.980
sources as fact and theater as fiction.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.980
In ritual the audience often participates;
in theatre, they usually sit politely.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.210
Unless there’s audience participation, which
is universally adored.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.500
In the late nineteenth century, a group of
classical scholars decided to search for the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.780
origins of theater.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.409
They took an anthropological approach and
saw theater as a direct evolution of religious

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:15.409
ritual.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.139
This theory really got going with James Frazer,
whom we also discuss in the Crash Course Mythology

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.069
episode on Theories of Myth.

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:28.060
In The Golden Bough, written between 1896
and 1915, Frazer and his contemporaries, the

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.509
Cambridge Ritualists (btw, this is obvs the
name of my new band) tried to take a “scientific

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.120
approach” to the question of theater’s
origins.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.360
He looked around at so-called “primitive”
societies in Africa and Asia, societies he

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.009
didn’t really “know much about,” and
decided that theater had emerged as a sophisticated

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.070
refining of ritual.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.030
According to Frazer, here’s how it goes:
You start out worshipping some kind of god

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.680
or practice, and that worship gets distilled
into rituals to attract the attention of that

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.530
god or guarantee good fortune.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.210
Once your primitive society really gets going,
those rituals generate myths and those myths

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.000
get transmuted ... into theater.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.180
Eventually you get jazz hands and sequins.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.879
As the media theorist Marshall McLuhan puts
it, in this view, “Art became a sort of

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:26.060
civilized substitute for magical games and
rituals….

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:34.650
Art like game became a mimetic echo of and
a relief from the old magic of total involvement.”

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.759
For an example of the (sometimes questionable)
evidence that the Cambridge Ritualists drew

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.539
on to support their idea that ritual evolved
into theater, let’s look at the Greek historian

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:51.159
Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BCE,
describing a ceremony he witnessed in Egypt.

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.379
Take the stage, Thoughtbubble:
Thought Bubble

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:57.570
This ceremony occurs at sunset in a temple.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.110
Some priests attend to a statue of Ares, but
most of the people involved are doing something

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.300
very different:
“The majority of them hold clubs made of

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.070
wood and stand at the temple's entrance while
others make vows, more than a thousand men,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.979
all holding clubs...

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:21.620
And those few left behind with the statue
pull a four-wheeled wagon carrying the shrine

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:27.150
and the statue which is in the shrine, and
the others standing at the front gates do

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.400
not let them enter.”

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.689
If things seem tense to you…

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:32.689
very perceptive!

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:35.050
Probably the clubs that tipped you off, right?

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.820
Herodotus says “Those who vowed to defend
the god strike those resisting [...] As I

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.199
understand, many even die from their wounds...”

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.340
The ritual continues all through the night.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.750
And, as you might if you were Herodotus, he
asks some locals why the poundings?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:58.610
They tell him: “There lived in this temple
Ares' mother, and Ares who was raised elsewhere

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.460
came -- after having become a man -- wishing
to lay with his mother, and the servants of

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.919
his mother, for not having seen him before,
did not look the other way when he entered,

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:15.789
rather they fended him off, and he fetching
men from another city handled the servants

00:08:15.789 --> 00:08:19.490
roughly and went inside to his mother.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:26.439
For this reason this fight in behalf of Ares
at the festival has become a tradition, they

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:27.439
say.”

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.439
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:33.729
So - the Ritualists look to stories like this
to illustrate their idea that worship becomes

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.770
ritual.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.039
Ritual becomes myth.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.580
Myth becomes performance.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.550
Someone writes a few songs to go along with
the skull-splitting, someone else turns the

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.190
battle into a dance, let it all simmer for
a millennia or two, and voila “West Side

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.190
Story”!

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.530
This ritualism theory is useful in some ways
and as we’ll see in the next episode, it

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:56.029
fits very nicely with Greek drama, mostly
because the whole theory was pretty much based

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:57.029
on Greek drama.

00:08:57.029 --> 00:09:02.170
That’s a welcome fix to how previous generations
of scholars viewed Greek drama—as something

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:08.149
very pure and stately, not as something that
might have evolved from passion and magic–but

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:13.110
this theory causes problems when you try to
apply the history of Greek Drama to OTHER

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.110
dramatic traditions.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:18.370
Turns out, Frazer and his colleagues didn’t
actually know all that much about the so-called

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:23.680
“primitive” societies whose theater they
wanted to study; the rich and sophisticated

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.220
cultures the Ritualists encountered throughout
Africa and Asia were lost on the Cambridge

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.029
types ... because Euro-centrism.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:37.050
So they did a lot of pretty non-scientific
guessing, working backward from what they

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:42.830
knew about classical theater and hypothesizing
about what kind of rituals may have produced

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.830
it.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.639
Frazer also operates with the underlying belief
that all societies basically evolve in the

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:54.700
same way and that even though, in his view,
so-called primitive societies are inherently

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.730
inferior, given enough time and care they’ll
get more and more sophisticated until they

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.600
too can produce “Cats.”

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.600
Okay, Frazer didn’t talk a lot about Broadway
musicals, but maybe you’re starting to understand

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.870
a couple of the major problems with this theory
and the assumption that all societies are

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:18.519
on a trajectory toward Western civilization,
which in this view is getting better and better

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:19.570
all the time.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.510
(This view, by the way, is known as “positivism”).

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:26.630
Another theory that gets going after Frazer
is the idea that people create myths out of

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.330
a desire to explain and rationalize the world
around them.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:36.329
In ritualism, myths and theater emerge as
a response to pre-existing rituals.

00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:42.100
But in this other theory, known as functionalism,
myths serve an etiological function, a way

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.019
of explaining how and why things came to be
the way they are.

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:50.670
According to one of the leading functionalist
theorists, Bronislaw Malinowski, myth “is

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:57.580
a statement of primeval reality which lives
in the institutions and pursuits of a community.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.399
It justifies by precedent the existing order.”

00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:06.550
Unlike the ritualists, the functionalists
didn’t assume that all societies operate

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.420
and evolve in the same way or will create
the same kinds of myths.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.899
Malinowski didn’t really discuss theater,
but some of his followers did, and they locked

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:21.709
on to the idea that many early Greek dramas
have their origins in myth and some of those

00:11:21.709 --> 00:11:23.880
myths are etiological.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.240
The “Oresteia,” explains the legal system,
“Prometheus Bound,” explains that liver

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.240
is tasty.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.240
JK.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.380
It explains how we get fire... and technology.

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.210
So, if myths explain the world, and theatre
is based in myth, we can think about theater

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:41.060
as a way of explaining the world to ourselves.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.779
But such a view has some drawbacks.

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:47.930
Take one of the very earliest recorded plays,
Aeschylus’s “The Persians.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:52.639
That was based in contemporaneous historical
events, not in myth.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:56.620
Besides the ritualists and the functionalists,
there are a few other theories, too.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.240
One is that theater derives at least in part
from the clown figure – who is sort of the

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.730
secular equivalent of the shaman in early
societies.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.910
Their job was to make fun of the headman and
other establishment figures and practices.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.040
We can maybe see this influence in satyr plays,
which we’ll visit in the next episode.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.399
And it’s linked, at least a little, to the
idea that theater may originate from games

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:23.790
and the playful instincts of humankind, a
phenomenon called the ludic impulse.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.970
Another related theory, which really gets
going with Aristotle, is that human beings

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:35.259
have a “mimetic impulse”: humans have
an in-built desire to imitate, to act, to

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:38.730
pretend--and that’s how we learn.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:44.470
According to Aristotle, this desire eventually
gets refined and codified into theater.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.940
To sum up: Ritual, myth, clowning, playing
games, playing pretend.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.769
Somehow out of all of this or maybe out of
none of it we get “Hamilton.”

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:59.810
And now let’s turn to our last question
for today: Why should we care?

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.380
In other words, why does theater matter?

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.399
Well, that’s a question we’ll be coming
back to throughout the series as we see how

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:13.180
and why people make theatre, and the impact
it has throughout history.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.660
But let me leave you with one idea borrowed
from Percy from Percy Bysshe Shelley: “The

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:23.990
highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest
species of the drama, is the teaching the

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:31.800
human heart, through its sympathies and antipathies,
the knowledge of itself.”

00:13:31.800 --> 00:14:03.060
Thanks for watching and ... curtain!
