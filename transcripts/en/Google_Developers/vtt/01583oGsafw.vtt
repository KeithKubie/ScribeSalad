MARY RADOMILE: Hi my
name is Mary Radomile,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.140
and welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.680
Today I'm here with
Carol Smith who

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.910
is the program manager
for Google Summer of Code,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.159
and we're going to talk a
little bit about the student

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.110
application process for
the program this year.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:19.700
Hi Carol.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.830
CAROL SMITH: Hi Mary.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.330
MARY RADOMILE: So tell us about
the eligibility requirements

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.177
for GSOC.

00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:25.760
CAROL SMITH: So at
a minimum a student

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.130
needs to be at least 18
years old on April 21,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.800
when the program
opens, and they need

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.820
to be either enrolled or
accepted into a university.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.800
Which means that they
could be, for example,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.760
have been accepted into a
university for the fall term

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.640
but not yet attending,
or they need

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.020
to be enrolled in a university.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.280
They also need to be eligible
to work in the country

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.800
that they're living in for the
time that the program is on.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.800
MARY RADOMILE: Now, will
they need to get a visa

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
and organize a place to stay?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.380
Or where does the
program take place?

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.046
CAROL SMITH: No.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:55.590
It actually takes
place all online.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.050
That's one of the
great things about GSOC

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.258
is that they get to do all
of their coding from home,

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.810
and they can work
with their mentor

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.320
and their organization
all online.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.379
And they never have to
travel if they don't want to.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.920
MARY RADOMILE: So
why would a student

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.760
want to participate in
Google Summer of Code?

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.555
What are the benefits?

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:11.400
CAROL SMITH: Well, lots
of reasons actually.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820
One reason is that
it's a great experience

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.740
to get to know an open
source organization,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.730
and start working with them, and
helping them to sort of do good

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.500
in the world.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.580
Another is that it's
a great experience

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.740
to be able to put
on your resume,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.380
because you'll have a coding
project that you can actually

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.430
point to and say, this
is something that I did,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.660
if you successfully
complete the program.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.076
And also you'll get a
stipend of $5500 US dollars

00:01:35.076 --> 00:01:36.950
if you successfully
complete the whole thing.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.086
MARY RADOMILE: And
that can't hurt.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:38.762
CAROL SMITH: No.

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.220
MARY RADOMILE: When do student
applications open this year?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.803
CAROL SMITH: So they
open on March 10,

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:45.660
at 19:00 UTC, which if you're
on the West Coast of the US

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.550
is 12:00 noon.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.290
And they close on March
21, again at 19:00 UTC.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.410
MARY RADOMILE: And if
someone misses the deadline

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.214
by a day or two is there
any exception there?

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:55.880
CAROL SMITH: No.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.890
Unfortunately not.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.390
Every year we get
a few students who

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.710
ask us to extend the
deadline or can they

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.100
submit a little bit late.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.879
And unfortunately we just
can't accommodate it.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.170
MARY RADOMILE: What about
any like course prerequisites

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.800
or any background information
that the students have to have?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.820
Is there anything there?

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.800
CAROL SMITH: No actually.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.020
We don't require
that the students

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.820
be majoring in computer
science or have

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.740
any kind of coding background.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.210
If there's a student
who's thinking

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.030
that they need to brush
up on their coding

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.700
skills for their
project, I'd recommend

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.560
that they reach out to the
organization they're thinking

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.130
about working with
and talk to them,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.546
and see if there's anything
that they could do to brush up

00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:30.970
their coding experience
before the applications open.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.310
MARY RADOMILE: Great.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.970
And that kind of leads
into the next question.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.760
Are there any special
things that students

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.510
need to know for the
application or should

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.152
put on their application?

00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:39.860
CAROL SMITH: It's up
to the organization.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.310
And so I would really recommend
that they actually, again,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.640
reach out to the organization
and talk to them.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.780
They should choose
the one that they're

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.230
interested in working
with, and then

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.563
talk to them about if there's
anything special that they

00:02:49.563 --> 00:02:50.510
should include.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.960
Most organizations require
a program plan and some sort

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.260
of timeline, but
they'll know more.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.150
MARY RADOMILE: Great.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.190
And last, if a student hasn't
gotten all their questions

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.844
answered here today
where can they

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.760
go to find more information
about the program?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.926
CAROL SMITH: Well, they can
always go to our general

00:03:04.926 --> 00:03:06.496
website, which is
google-melange.com.

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:10.380
And on the website there's
a pretty extensive FAQs

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.042
that they can see if their
question is answered there.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.250
If it's not we also have a
general discussion mailing

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.040
list, so they can ask their
specific question on there.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.099
And then we're also
available on IRC as well.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.140
MARY RADOMILE: Excellent.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.040
Thank you so much Carol.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.320
CAROL SMITH: Thanks Mary.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.130
MARY RADOMILE: And thanks to
everyone for coming today.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.770
This is Google Developers
Live, and I'm Mary Radomile.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.640
See you soon.
