part of spiritual development is to

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760
part of spiritual development is to
 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.630
part of spiritual development is to
recognize the satanic tendencies that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640
recognize the satanic tendencies that
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.640
recognize the satanic tendencies that
characterize you and to fully wrestle

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650
characterize you and to fully wrestle
 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980
characterize you and to fully wrestle
with them and to and to integrate them

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990
with them and to and to integrate them
 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.629
with them and to and to integrate them
that's the thing it's it's not so much

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
that's the thing it's it's not so much
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.450
that's the thing it's it's not so much
to cast them away it's to transmute them

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
to cast them away it's to transmute them
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.790
to cast them away it's to transmute them
you know and you can see the difference

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800
you know and you can see the difference
 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.230
you know and you can see the difference
between people who have done that and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
between people who have done that and
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.640
between people who have done that and
people who haven't at least to some

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
people who haven't at least to some
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160
people who haven't at least to some
degree because people who haven't

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
degree because people who haven't
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410
degree because people who haven't
integrated the shadow at all are naive

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
integrated the shadow at all are naive
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.050
integrated the shadow at all are naive
and you can tell that when you look at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
and you can tell that when you look at
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.820
and you can tell that when you look at
them and you can tell that when you talk

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
them and you can tell that when you talk
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.290
them and you can tell that when you talk
to them and because they're naive

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
to them and because they're naive
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.120
to them and because they're naive
they're often resentful as well because

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130
they're often resentful as well because
 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.490
they're often resentful as well because
they get taken advantage of and someone

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
they get taken advantage of and someone
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049
they get taken advantage of and someone
who's integrated that more they're

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
who's integrated that more they're
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.560
who's integrated that more they're
dangerous in in the martial arts sort of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
dangerous in in the martial arts sort of
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450
dangerous in in the martial arts sort of
way which is they're dangerous but they

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
way which is they're dangerous but they
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.400
way which is they're dangerous but they
don't have to be they don't have to use

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
don't have to be they don't have to use
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.610
don't have to be they don't have to use
it because their presence radiates what

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
it because their presence radiates what
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.939
it because their presence radiates what
would you say it doesn't radiate threat

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949
would you say it doesn't radiate threat
 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.069
would you say it doesn't radiate threat
exactly well certainly strength but it's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
exactly well certainly strength but it's
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.340
exactly well certainly strength but it's
it's it's it's the potential for havoc

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
it's it's it's the potential for havoc
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.649
it's it's it's the potential for havoc
that's the right way of thinking about

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
that's the right way of thinking about
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.100
that's the right way of thinking about
it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
it
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.160
it
there's a there's an implicit potential

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
there's a there's an implicit potential
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.850
there's a there's an implicit potential
for havoc and that's really necessary

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860
for havoc and that's really necessary
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.320
for havoc and that's really necessary
it's one of the things that gives people

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
it's one of the things that gives people
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.880
it's one of the things that gives people
self respect this is an interesting

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
self respect this is an interesting
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.320
self respect this is an interesting
thing about the integration of the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
thing about the integration of the
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.800
thing about the integration of the
shadow because recognizing yourself as

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
shadow because recognizing yourself as
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.179
shadow because recognizing yourself as
the locus of evil let's say actually in

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
the locus of evil let's say actually in
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.330
the locus of evil let's say actually in
some sense gives you far more respect

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
some sense gives you far more respect
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.370
some sense gives you far more respect
for yourself strangely enough because

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
for yourself strangely enough because
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590
for yourself strangely enough because
the same respect that you might have for

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
the same respect that you might have for
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.350
the same respect that you might have for
a wild animal or even a monster it's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
a wild animal or even a monster it's
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940
a wild animal or even a monster it's
like and though so then maybe you learn

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
like and though so then maybe you learn
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.980
like and though so then maybe you learn
to treat yourself differently like I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
to treat yourself differently like I
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899
to treat yourself differently like I
think this is particularly true with

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
think this is particularly true with
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.700
think this is particularly true with
regards to the discipline of children

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
regards to the discipline of children
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.889
regards to the discipline of children
you know if you know that you're a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
you know if you know that you're a
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:46.550
you know if you know that you're a
monster

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
monster
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.819
monster
and that that will manifest itself in

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
and that that will manifest itself in
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.139
and that that will manifest itself in
your life consciously or unconsciously

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
your life consciously or unconsciously
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.899
your life consciously or unconsciously
and if it's unconsciously it's it's it's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
and if it's unconsciously it's it's it's
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.959
and if it's unconsciously it's it's it's
not good then you become better at

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
not good then you become better at
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.700
not good then you become better at
disciplining children and the reason for

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
disciplining children and the reason for
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830
disciplining children and the reason for
that is that you don't want to expose

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
that is that you don't want to expose
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.429
that is that you don't want to expose
them to your dark side and so if they

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
them to your dark side and so if they
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.100
them to your dark side and so if they
behave and don't provoke you which means

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110
behave and don't provoke you which means
 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.630
behave and don't provoke you which means
they'll also behave for other people

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
they'll also behave for other people
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.900
they'll also behave for other people
then you don't the monstrous part can

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
then you don't the monstrous part can
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.370
then you don't the monstrous part can
stay in abeyance

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
stay in abeyance
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.910
stay in abeyance
and then that's great but if you don't

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920
and then that's great but if you don't
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.530
and then that's great but if you don't
understand yourself as capable of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
understand yourself as capable of
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.970
understand yourself as capable of
wreaking havoc and that can be the kind

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980
wreaking havoc and that can be the kind
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.070
wreaking havoc and that can be the kind
of havoc that unfolds over decades right

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
of havoc that unfolds over decades right
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.680
of havoc that unfolds over decades right
because if you're going to abuse a child

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
because if you're going to abuse a child
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230
because if you're going to abuse a child
it's the primitive form of abuse is the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
it's the primitive form of abuse is the
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870
it's the primitive form of abuse is the
physical abuse the sophisticated form of

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880
physical abuse the sophisticated form of
 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.060
physical abuse the sophisticated form of
abuse is the continual undermining of

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070
abuse is the continual undermining of
 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.610
abuse is the continual undermining of
the child's courage across perhaps their

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
the child's courage across perhaps their
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.190
the child's courage across perhaps their
entire life and that there's a terribly

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
entire life and that there's a terribly
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.830
entire life and that there's a terribly
monstrous element to that and if you're

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840
monstrous element to that and if you're
 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.120
monstrous element to that and if you're
not respected properly by the child say

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
not respected properly by the child say
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.600
not respected properly by the child say
you will absolutely take revenge on them

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
you will absolutely take revenge on them
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.090
you will absolutely take revenge on them
and you know that's the holes in some

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
and you know that's the holes in some
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.440
and you know that's the holes in some
sense that's the whole Freudian

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
sense that's the whole Freudian
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750
sense that's the whole Freudian
psychoanalytic story it's not all of it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
psychoanalytic story it's not all of it
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.450
psychoanalytic story it's not all of it
but it's a huge part of it interesting

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460
but it's a huge part of it interesting
 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.300
but it's a huge part of it interesting
that you you say that you have to accept

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310
that you you say that you have to accept
 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.400
that you you say that you have to accept
the fact that you're dangerous or become

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
the fact that you're dangerous or become
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.530
the fact that you're dangerous or become
dangerous because I'd also say that if

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540
dangerous because I'd also say that if
 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.880
dangerous because I'd also say that if
you haven't done that kind of shadow

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
you haven't done that kind of shadow
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.710
you haven't done that kind of shadow
work if you haven't made friends with

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720
work if you haven't made friends with
 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.270
work if you haven't made friends with
your anger if you haven't integrated it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
your anger if you haven't integrated it
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.670
your anger if you haven't integrated it
you're actually more dangerous yes then

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
you're actually more dangerous yes then
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.500
you're actually more dangerous yes then
things will happen that will it will

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
things will happen that will it will
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.940
things will happen that will it will
come out in a way that you don't expect

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
come out in a way that you don't expect
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190
come out in a way that you don't expect
right it comes out disintegrated so it

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
right it comes out disintegrated so it
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.710
right it comes out disintegrated so it
comes out as an autonomous spirit right

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
comes out as an autonomous spirit right
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.870
comes out as an autonomous spirit right
under no one's control and that's like a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
under no one's control and that's like a
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.630
under no one's control and that's like a
burst of rage let's say you know when

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640
burst of rage let's say you know when
 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.130
burst of rage let's say you know when
you when you hear about a mother who's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140
you when you hear about a mother who's
 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.690
you when you hear about a mother who's
done something terrible to one of her

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
done something terrible to one of her
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.460
done something terrible to one of her
children it's that's the reason is that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
children it's that's the reason is that
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.880
children it's that's the reason is that
you know she maybe she's just been laid

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890
you know she maybe she's just been laid
 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.370
you know she maybe she's just been laid
off maybe she went out and and had two

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380
off maybe she went out and and had two
 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.420
off maybe she went out and and had two
meant too much to drink
