00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.360
For anyone who thinks recent US history has never been crazy as it is right now,

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.460
allow me to present to you

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.560
the 1960s.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.980
Extreme cultural division,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.620
major political assassinations,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.540
and the closest the world has ever come

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.740
to nuclear apocalypse.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.480
Shocked by the CIA's intrusive methods for putting down socialism in Latin America,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.200
a certain Fidel Castro met with a certain Che Guevara in a bar in Mexico City,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.320
and the two of them decided they should grow some awesome beards

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.780
and overthrow the Cuban government.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.160
Which is exactly what they did.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.900
Cuba had been America's summer playground,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.560
and America didn't like seeing a communist regime being set up in its own backyard.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.180
So the US immediately began training up Cuban exiles

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.020
to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.200
However, as the day of the operation came closer,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.940
Kennedy wanted to conceal any US involvement in the plan.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.080
So he massively scaled back American air support,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.140
and as a result the Bay of Pigs Invasion was a humiliating defeat for America.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.360
But Castro felt there was still an impending US threat to his regime.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.900
Meanwhile in the Soviet Union,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.180
Khrushchev had a lot of medium-range nuclear missiles that couldn't reach America.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.440
But they could if they were positioned, say, on an exotic Caribbean island off the coast of Florida?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.800
- "Hey, I'm a communist who hates America.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.400
You're a communist who hates America.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.520
You know what that means?"

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.240
- "We should fall in love!"

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.140
- "Uh, I was just going to suggest you set your missiles up in Cuba."

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.420
- "Oh, no - no, you're right, that's a better idea.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.800
Be still, my beating heart..."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.060
On October 14th 1962,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.600
a US spy plane over Cuba noticed something strange.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.340
- "Sir, you need to look at this photograph."

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.840
- "You're right! That's the cutest dog I've ever seen!"

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.380
- "Sir, I was referring more to the Soviet missiles."

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.720
America freaked out as they realized what was going on.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.320
They were completely vulnerable, and they had to act fast.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.580
They knew that airstrikes or an invasion of Cuba would likely mean nuclear war with the Soviet Union,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.200
so Kennedy came up with another idea.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.160
A blockade.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.720
The US navy announced it would stop and search any Soviet ships heading to Cuba.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.460
And would sink any that did not comply.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.780
In response, the Soviet put its military into full combat readiness.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.900
The US did the same, and began drawing up plans for an attack on Cuba.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.360
Things were escalating fast,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.900
and both superpowers were getting ready for World War 3.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.400
Emergency communications between the two sides broke down

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.240
as Khrushchev rejected Kennedy's demands for the missiles to be removed.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.740
And for the first time in history,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.280
the US strategic air command moved to DEFCON 2.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.400
DEFCON 1 means nuclear war.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.660
The Soviets shot down a U2 spy plane over Cuba.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.720
A Soviet nuclear submarine in the Caribbean mistakenly believed war had already broken out

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.160
and two of the senior officers gave the go-ahead to fire its nuclear torpedo.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.720
Thankfully the third senior officer, this beautiful man,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.380
refused to authorise the decision.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.100
The US finalised its preparations,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.820
and I kid you not, the day before the US were set to decide the day and time for the Cuban invasion,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.860
Khrushchev was like,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.700
- "Hey. You know if you just removed your missiles from Turkey, we'd remove ours from Cuba?"

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.440
- "Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good to me."

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.160
It was a bit more complicated than that, but at the last second,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.820
the two sides finally came to an agreement.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.960
Soviet missiles were shipped out of Cuba and the world breathed one gigantic sigh of relief.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.100
Except for one guy, who was bloody livid.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.020
- "Phew! Let's hope that's the biggest crisis of my presidency!"

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.900
Unfortunately for him, his presidency was to end with one.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.540
Having nearly blown up the planet, a few changes were made.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.260
First, the superpowers agreed to a limited Test Ban Treaty.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.140
Secondly, the Soviets ousted Khrushchev, and replaced him with Leonid Brezhnev.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.080
Who was a kisser.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.800
He liked to kiss.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.660
Both sides were deeply concerned at the prospect of nuclear war,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.200
but still the arms race raged on throughout the 60s and 70s.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.060
US intelligence worked out that the Soviets' nuclear arsenal was

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.760
not as powerful as they previously thought,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.020
but in fact it was America that held the advantage.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.980
ABMs and MIRVs were developed.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.100
And the doctrine of MAD.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.420
If both sides knew they would be completely destroyed by a nuclear war,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.140
neither would risk starting one.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.360
But even without war,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.880
the world was already feeling the effects of nuclear weapons.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.180
In 1966,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.420
above the pleasant town of Palomares in Spain,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.880
a US bomber collided with a tanker mid-air,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.840
and four hydrogen bombs fell and landed near the town below.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.240
- "It hasn't exploded so I'm sure everything's fine.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.080
Wooah, boy!

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.580
Uhh, hey, I wouldn't eat that if I were you."

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.220
- "Okay."

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.640
- "What were you going to do today?"

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.500
- "Go for a swim?"

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.220
- "Yeah. I wouldn't.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.580
Are you breathing right now?"

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.300
- "Yeah?"

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.020
- "Yeah...

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.120
I wouldn't."

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.000
It took the Americans two and a half months to find one of the bombs,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.560
which had gone missing in the ocean.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.140
This was the fourteenth time America had lost a nuclear bomb since 1950.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.680
Nobody knows how many bombs the Soviet Union lost.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.360
So sleep well tonight.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.180
After Kennedy's assassination,

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.380
Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took over.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.660
And he inherited a developing crisis in the east.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.600
Vietnam.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.740
Back in the 50s, the Vietnamese had kicked their French colonisers out once and for all,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.560
and the country was divided into two.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.240
In the North, a communist regime.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.360
And in the South, an anti-communist regime.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.440
Both were led by very sweet-looking old men.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.760
But don't let that deceive you.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.340
They were both ruthless dictators,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.400
and both dreamed of reuniting Vietnam under their own regime.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560
So the North established the National Liberation Front,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.100
also known as the Vietcong,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.500
to carry out a campaign of guerrilla warfare in the South

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.580
with Soviet support.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.860
The US sent advisors to help train the South Vietnamese to deal with the threat,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.360
but President Diem's brutal policies pushed more and more South Vietnamese

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.600
to support the Vietcong.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.740
And over the next decade,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.060
the situation escalated to a breaking point.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.380
America feared the Domino Effect.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.420
That is, if South Vietnam fell to communism, would Cambodia be next?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.280
Then Laos? Thailand? Burma? India?

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.860
LBJ had to make a choice.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.460
Between losing South Vietnam,

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.700
or sending in the troops.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.260
And so in they went.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.480
From 1965, America found itself in a war unlike anything it had ever fought before.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.380
Let's Play: Spot the Vietcong Soldier!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.100
(ticking)

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.880
(buzzer)

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.660
Did you see him?

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.620
Of course not.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.660
That's because millions of young American men

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.160
were drafted and sent to fight a ruthless enemy

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.380
who used the thick jungle as its shield.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.140
It was nearly impossible to tell where the enemy was,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.640
Or worse, who it was.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.640
And as a result,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.120
the civilian population got caught up in the brutal crossfire.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.800
The city of Saigon found itself under regular attack,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.780
and America launched a bombing campaign in the North during Operation Rolling Thunder.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.960
The Vietcong used the Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos and Cambodia

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.200
to supply the campaign.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.960
It was a long and brutal war,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.160
and I could never do it justice in this video.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.480
But in terms of the Cold War,

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.980
Vietnam was probably the biggest of many, many global conflicts

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.820
that signalled a turning point.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.580
Under the threat of nuclear war,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.080
the two superpowers began working to make their relationship more constructive.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.420
And as a result their ideological battle shifted away from the potential of direct conflict,

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.020
and more towards attempting to influence smaller proxy wars around the world.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.340
In the Middle East, the Soviet Union provided aid against Israel during the Six-Day War,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.460
and then again when the US backed Israel during the Yom Kippur War.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.940
In Africa, the Angolan Civil War saw US-supported South Africans

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.400
fighting Soviet-supported Cubans.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.820
In the conflict between Somalia and Ethiopia,

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.180
the superpowers interestingly switched sides as regimes changed.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.640
And the US continued fighting the spread of communism in its own backyard,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.240
funding the famous Contra groups to fight the socialist junta in Nicaragua.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.880
These proxy wars were fierce enough to begin with,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.600
but superpower intervention amplified the destruction,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.420
and created alarming levels of human suffering throughout the Third World.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.100
And in Vietnam, that human suffering was all being broadcast back home

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.440
via good old television.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.780
Going into the late 60s,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.440
America was a changing nation.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.940
This became this.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.620
This became this.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.580
And this became this.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.020
The new slogan that was taking route, "Make Love, Not War."

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.900
The majority of Americans did not approve of Johnson's handling of the Vietnam War.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.160
And in 1968,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.340
a silent majority elected Law and Order candidate Richard Nixon.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.880
As the Vietnam War appeared to be increasingly unwinnable,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.400
and public opinion turning increasingly sour,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.300
Nixon made the decision to begin bringing the troops home,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.580
and ended US involvement in Vietnam by 1973.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.720
Two years later, the South fell.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.480
The Cold War was now taking its toll on both superpowers.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.940
In Russia, a huge percentage of the budget was still going to the military,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.120
people were still hungry,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.180
and they just didn't have access to the same lifestyle and goods

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.100
as the West.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.500
And what did they have to show for it?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.580
They weren't even winning the Space Race anymore.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.700
Both sides needed to reduce spending in order to rescue their economies,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.020
and so both welcomed with open arms an easing of hostilities.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.860
Otherwise known as detente.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:52.180
To improve relations,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.620
Nixon became the first US President to visit Moscow in 1972.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.700
And Brezhnev returned the favour a year later.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.080
A number of treaties were signed,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.060
including the 1972 SALT agreement,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.460
that limited nuclear weapons.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.700
Relations with China were even improving via Ping-Pong Diplomacy,

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.720
when the US table tennis team went on a tour

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.780
of the People's Republic.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.380
However, internally, China was still pushing anti-capitalist propaganda,

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.840
which led to some mixed messages.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.820
Nixon even visited China in 1972, and it was a barrel of laughs.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.380
(jaunty theme music)

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.880
Everything was going great for Nixon.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:52.320
Until it was uncovered that back home he was being a very naughty boy and violating Constitutional Protocol.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.580
- "I'm announcing today my resignation as President.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.520
And I'm passing the office to my Vice President, Gerald Ford."

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.720
- "Wow! You mean in America the people can actually remove their leader when he breaks the law?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.140
Why not just rule by force? Where's the corruption?"

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.920
- "And my first act as President is to pardon Nixon!"

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.820
- "Ah, there it is."

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.980
After the whole fiasco, Americans decided what they really wanted

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.500
was just a nice, safe guy who wouldn't cheat on them.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.820
So they elected Jimmy Carter.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.740
And the two sides met in Vienna where they signed yet another Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.480
- "It's an honour, Premier Brezhnev."
- "Likewise, President Carter."

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.240
(kiss)

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.420
- "Please don't do that."

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.560
But that's not to say there was no longer any tension between the two sides.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.500
Because there was,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.180
heaps of it.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.480
Once again, the Soviet Union put down further attempts at reform and rebellion in the Eastern Bloc.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.260
The Euromissile Crisis saw new and improved classes of intermediate-range missiles

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.240
being deployed in Europe.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.400
In 1979,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.160
the Soviets thought it would be a good idea if they had their own Vietnam

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.620
and invaded Afghanistan to prevent a US-sponsored Islamic insurgency.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.560
And in response to these various crises,

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.360
Olympic Games were boycotted.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.640
Conservatives were concerned that US policy had become too soft,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.440
and in 1980, they decided they wanted a President who would be tough on communism.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.960
So they elected Ronald Reagan.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.160
And Reagan came in guns-blazing.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.580
Concerned at the Soviet Union's human rights violations,

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.820
he made a speech calling them an "evil empire".

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.360
And he also wanted to renew the arms race using technological advances in computing and lasers.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.600
He came up with the Space Defence Initiative, also known as Star Wars.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.580
Which was basically a big, defensive anti-nuke shield around the country.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.560
But a lot of people thought it was a pretty dumb idea.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.760
The Soviet Union proceed the shift in rhetoric,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.460
as the USA getting ready for war.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.500
And they were feeling especially threatened as their relationship with their communist ally, China

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.400
had broken down.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.780
Relations took a big hit in 1983,

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.460
when the Soviets shot down a Korean airliner that had strayed into their airspace.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.500
And it looked like the world was going right back to mid-20th-century Cold War tension.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.140
But then Brezhnev got really old and died,

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.160
and was replaced by this guy who was really old and died,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.320
and was replaced by this guy who was really old and died,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.480
and he was replaced by Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.160
Coming into office in 1985, he was the real game-changer.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.060
His philosophy differed a lot from previous Soviet leaders.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.040
He felt that the reason the Soviet system and economy was struggling

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.380
was that it didn't allow the Soviet people to find satisfaction in their work.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.100
Because they weren't allowed to speak freely, and lived in fear.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.260
Gorbachev wanted the Soviet people to be happy.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.980
But unlike previous Soviet leaders,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.760
he actually made the change happen.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.940
Within the first couple of years he began the political movement for more openness and transparency.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.880
And the restructure of the Soviet political and economic systems.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.820
And change very quickly took effect.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.820
People could criticise the government, they could enjoy Western pop culture,

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.440
the media interviewed Margaret Thatcher,

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.600
but most importantly the Soviet people could now enjoy Pizza Hut.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.940
All hail to Gorbachev!

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.860
He also knew that the arms race needed to end in order to rescue the Soviet economy,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.720
and a positive relationship with the West must be established.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.820
Constructive dialogue reopened and resulted in the INF Treaty,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.600
which saw all intermediate-range missiles eliminated.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.560
Which was huge.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.400
Reagan's tone towards the Soviet Union began to soften,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.740
and things were looking up.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.200
But what would these reforms mean for the Eastern Bloc?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.660
For decades, the Soviets had been brutally repressing any attempt at change.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.220
Now would they be allowed?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.500
And that was the exact question on Hungary's lips,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.320
when the Prime Minister visited Moscow.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.440
Gorbachev's response,

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.500
he didn't necessarily agree with the reforms,

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.960
but he wouldn't stop them either.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.860
He was prepared to let the Eastern Bloc

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.080
choose its own future.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.400
This was massive.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.740
And the Hungarian leaders began planning free, multi-party elections.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.540
Poland followed suit, and also held elections in June.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.540
The anti-Soviet party, Solidarity, won 99 out of 100 seats in the Senate.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.680
But not just that. In Hungary the barbed-wire border between East and West was removed.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.720
The Iron Curtain was unravelling.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.660
But not all Eastern Bloc leaders were happy.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.140
Notably, East Germany was still ruled by a hardline Stalinist,

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.060
Eric Honecker.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.560
And many East Germans were still eager to get out.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.900
They had been trapped by the Berlin Wall, but now they were doing the math.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.600
If they could travel to Hungary, and Hungary's border with the West was loosening,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.240
could they now make it to the West?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.520
That summer, East Germans decided Hungary was the latest top holiday destination.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.260
They travelled there in droves, and using various methods,

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.800
tens of thousands crossed the border into Austria and the West.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.440
Honecker was furious, and blocked travel to Hungary.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.760
But that civil liberties train had started rolling and it wasn't stopping.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.360
Thousands more flocked to the West German embassy in Prague,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.400
where they stormed the fence around the embassy gardens,

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.540
and a temporary refugee camp was set up.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.400
In September, deals were struck to allow the refugees to travel West via train.

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.940
Back in East Germany, the people were running on a civil liberties high,

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.380
and they wanted their next hit.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.560
Dissent was growing,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.040
over time, demonstrations turned to mass protests,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.400
with plain-clothed secret police officers doing their best to put down the dissent,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.180
but it had grown well out of their control.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.220
And worse, the biggest demonstration was yet to come.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.940
- "We're gonna put all of this down by force.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.920
Right guys?

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.080
Guys?"

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.200
Unfortunately, everyone had realised what he had not.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.380
This was bigger than them.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.500
And the entire East German Politburo

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.620
voted him out of power.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.460
On November 4th, over half a million East Germans took to the streets of East Berlin,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.840
for many, there was still one big target left in their sights.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.540
That damn wall.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.900
The pressure on the East German government was too great,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.020
and on November 9th,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.540
they made a bit of a chaotic announcement that the travel ban between East and West was being lifted.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.060
The change wasn't meant to take effect until the next day.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.440
And crossing guards still had orders to shoot on sight any who tried to cross.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.300
But that night, huge crowds gathered at the crossing points,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.980
and the guards were overwhelmed.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.120
In an astronomically historic moment,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.200
after decades of family separation and travel restriction,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.060
the people were allowed to pass through.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.840
East and West Berliners couldn't believe it,

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.900
and celebrated together throughout the night.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.620
Some even climbed the wall,

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.000
and began to topple it.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.320
The Iron Curtain had fallen.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.200
And a year later, Germany would be reunited.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.360
Elections in Bulgaria, a peaceful revolution in Czechoslovakia,

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.640
and a violent one in Romania,

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.280
brought to an end communist authority in the Eastern Bloc.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.060
America decided it would be best if it just stayed away and let the change happen,

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.240
as the anti-communist movement continued all the way back to Moscow.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.760
Gorbachev had given the people the freedom to demonstrate.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.240
Now, they demonstrated for an end to the communist single-party rule.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.800
And Gorbachev had to give in.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.040
For the first time in history,

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.140
elections were held in which candidates not officially endorsed by the party were allowed to run.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.960
Ambitious rival of Gorbachev,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.400
Boris Yeltsin led a growing democratic movement.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.160
Now things here get quite confusing.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.200
The dissolution of the Soviet Union is a complicated topic.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.180
So believe me, this is OverSimplified.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.660
But it went a little bit like this.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:00.920
The Soviet Union was made up of a number of smaller Soviet republics,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.660
the largest of which was Russia.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.940
Yeltsin got himself elected the President of Russia,

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.760
and began a struggle for sovereignty against Gorbachev and the Soviet Union.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.880
Communist hardliners were horrified at what Gorbachev was allowing,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.120
so they briefly kidnapped him,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.340
and tried to set up their own emergency government.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.700
But Yeltsin and his supporters all gathered around the White House in Moscow and were like,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.200
- "No. We have a tank."

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.860
So the hardliners had to concede, and released Gorbachev.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.100
- "Wow. Thanks Boris, that was a close one."

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.900
- "No problem. And thanks to you for all the great freedom you've given us."

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.080
- "Anytime, pal!"

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.120
- "And just to inform you.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.060
I've used that freedom you've given us to go behind your back and make a deal with

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.160
Ukraine and Belarus to dissolve the Soviet Union

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.440
and set up the Russian Federation.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.280
In other words,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.300
You're no longer in charge, I am."

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.520
- "Dude.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.020
So uncool."

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.400
And so decades of tension and the everlasting threat of nuclear war finally came to an end,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.760
as democratic governments were established in many of the old Soviet republics.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.300
And the world got along together,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.420
forever after.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.100
Right guys?

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.600
(dramatic music)

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.840
- "Hey, this modern art thing is growing on me.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.140
Where can I learn to do that?"

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.380
Skillshare!
