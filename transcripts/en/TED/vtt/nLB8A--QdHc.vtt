00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:15.953
In March 2017,

00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:20.411
the mayor of Cape Town officially
declared Cape Town a local disaster,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:23.227
as it had less than four months
left of usable water.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.161
Residents were restricted to 100 liters
of water per person, per day.

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:30.846
But what does that really mean?

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.613
With 100 liters of water per day,

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.401
you can take a five-minute shower,

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.476
wash your face twice

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.922
and probably flush the toilet
about five times.

00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:43.546
You still didn't brush your teeth,

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.710
you didn't do laundry,

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:49.709
and you definitely
didn't water your plants.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:54.038
You, unfortunately, didn't wash your hands
after those five toilet flushes.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.864
And you didn't even take a sip of water.

00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.599
The mayor described this as that it means

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:05.522
a new relationship with water.

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:08.964
Today, seven months later,

00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:11.801
I can share two things
about my second home with you.

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:15.027
First: Cape Town hasn't run out
of water just yet.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.151
But as of September 3rd,

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:20.549
the hundred-liter limit
dropped to 87 liters.

00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:25.767
The mayor defined the city's new normal
as one of permanent drought.

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.324
Second:

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:31.858
what's happening in Cape Town
is pretty much coming to many other cities

00:01:31.882 --> 00:01:33.238
and countries in the world.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.537
According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations,

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:39.912
excluding countries
that we don't have data for,

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:43.688
less than five percent
of the world's population

00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:48.327
is living in a country that has more water
today than it did 20 years ago.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.878
Everyone else is living in a country
that has less water today.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.555
And nearly one out of three
are living in a country

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.596
that is facing a water crisis.

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.902
I grew up in Jordan,

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:07.439
a water-poor country that has experienced
absolute water scarcity since 1973.

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:10.363
And still, in 2017,

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:13.442
only 10 countries in the world
have less water than Jordan.

00:02:14.923 --> 00:02:18.238
So dealing with a lack of water
is quite ingrained in my soul.

00:02:18.864 --> 00:02:22.228
As soon as I was old enough
to learn how to write my name,

00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:24.714
I also learned that I need
to conserve water.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.659
My parents would constantly remind
my siblings and I to close the tap

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:30.981
when we brushed our teeth.

00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.510
We used to fill balloons with flour
instead of water when we played.

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.834
It's just as much fun, though.

00:02:37.858 --> 00:02:38.941
(Laughter)

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:40.132
And a few years ago,

00:02:40.156 --> 00:02:43.420
when my friends and I were dared
to do the Ice Bucket Challenge,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.768
we did that with sand.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:46.942
(Laughter)

00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:49.981
And you might think that,
you know, that's easy,

00:02:50.005 --> 00:02:51.246
sand is not ice cold.

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:54.315
I promise you, sand goes everywhere,

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.224
and it took ages to get rid of it.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.731
But what perhaps I didn't realize

00:02:59.755 --> 00:03:02.308
as I played with flour
balloons as a child,

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.724
and as I poured sand
on my head as an adult,

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:09.164
is that some of the techniques
that seem second nature to me

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.758
and to others who live in dry countries

00:03:11.782 --> 00:03:16.275
might help us all address
what is fast becoming a global crisis.

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:20.227
I wish to share three lessons today,

00:03:22.297 --> 00:03:24.441
three lessons from water-poor countries

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:29.160
and how they survived and even thrived
despite their water crisis.

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.841
Lesson one:

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:34.202
tell people how much water
they really have.

00:03:35.185 --> 00:03:36.620
In order to solve a problem,

00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:38.636
we need to acknowledge that we have one.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.499
And when it comes to water,

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:43.009
people can easily turn a blind eye,

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:45.873
pretending that since water
is coming out of the tap now,

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:47.479
everything will be fine forever.

00:03:48.703 --> 00:03:51.771
But some smart, drought-affected countries

00:03:51.795 --> 00:03:54.180
have adopted simple, innovative measures

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:58.061
to make sure their citizens,
their communities and their companies

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:00.071
know just how dry their countries are.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.576
When I was in Cape Town earlier this year,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.500
I saw this electronic billboard
on the freeway,

00:04:07.524 --> 00:04:09.758
indicating how much water
the city had left.

00:04:11.004 --> 00:04:13.972
This is an idea they may well have
borrowed from Australia

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:17.643
when it faced one of the worst droughts
of the country's history

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.322
from 1997 to 2009.

00:04:21.273 --> 00:04:24.783
Water levels in Melbourne
dropped to a very low capacity

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:26.611
of almost 26 percent.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:29.656
But the city didn't yell at people.

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:32.706
It didn't plead with them
not to use water.

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:37.821
They used electronic billboards
to flash available levels of water

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:39.850
to all citizens across the city.

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.826
They were honestly telling people
how much water they really have,

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.495
and letting them take
responsibility for themselves.

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:51.090
By the end of the drought,
this created such a sense of urgency

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:52.761
as well as a sense of community.

00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:57.014
Nearly one out of three citizens
in Melbourne had invested

00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:00.710
in installing rainwater holding tanks
for their own households.

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:05.566
Actions that citizens took didn't stop
at installing those tanks.

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.789
With help from the city,

00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:10.206
they were able to do something
even more impactful.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.910
Taking me to lesson two:

00:05:14.285 --> 00:05:16.702
empower people to save water.

00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:22.135
Melbourne wanted people
to spend less water in their homes.

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:25.623
And one way to do that is to spend
less time in the shower.

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:30.579
However, interviews revealed
that some people, women in particular,

00:05:30.603 --> 00:05:32.619
weren't keen on saving water that way.

00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:35.250
Some of them honestly said,

00:05:35.274 --> 00:05:37.117
"The shower is not just to clean up.

00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:38.775
It's my sanctuary.

00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:42.250
It's a space I go to relax,
not just clean up."

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:47.130
So the city started offering
water-efficient showerheads for free.

00:05:47.638 --> 00:05:51.114
And then, now some people complained
that the showerheads looked ugly

00:05:51.138 --> 00:05:53.316
or didn't suit their bathrooms.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.748
So what I like to call
"The Showerhead Team"

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:58.870
developed a small water-flow regulator

00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:01.407
that can be fitted
into existing showerheads.

00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:06.446
And although showerhead beauty
doesn't matter much to me,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.504
I loved how the team didn't give up

00:06:08.528 --> 00:06:11.276
and instead came up with
a simple, unique solution

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.393
to empower people to save water.

00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:16.941
Within a span of four years,

00:06:16.965 --> 00:06:20.754
more than 460,000
showerheads were replaced.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.062
When the small regulator was introduced,

00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:26.932
more than 100,000 orders
of that were done.

00:06:28.261 --> 00:06:31.457
Melbourne succeeded in reducing
the water demands per capita

00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:32.938
by 50 percent.

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.426
In the United Arab Emirates,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.188
the second-most water-scarce
country in the world,

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:44.348
officials designed what they called
the "Business Heroes Toolkit" in 2010.

00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:47.583
The aim was to motivate
and empower businesses

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.115
to reduce water and energy consumption.

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:53.035
The toolkit practically taught companies

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:55.663
how to measure their existing
water-consumption levels

00:06:56.323 --> 00:06:59.646
and consisted of tips
to help them reduce those levels.

00:07:00.517 --> 00:07:01.820
And it worked.

00:07:01.844 --> 00:07:04.670
Hundreds of organizations
downloaded the toolkit.

00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:06.825
And several of them joined

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:09.659
what they called
the "Corporate Heroes Network,"

00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:13.352
where companies can voluntarily
take on a challenge

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:16.938
to reduce their water-consumption
levels to preset targets

00:07:16.962 --> 00:07:18.599
within a period of one year.

00:07:19.716 --> 00:07:24.536
Companies which completed the challenge
saved on average 35 percent of water.

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:27.223
And one company, for example,

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:31.563
implemented as many water-saving tips
as they could in their office space.

00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:37.005
They replaced their toilet-flushing
techniques, taps, showerheads --

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.218
you name it.

00:07:38.242 --> 00:07:40.709
If it saved water, they replaced it,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:44.365
eventually reducing their employees'
water consumption by half.

00:07:45.335 --> 00:07:50.136
Empowering individuals and companies
to save water is so critical,

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.482
yet not sufficient.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.720
Countries need to look
beyond the status quo

00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:59.109
and implement country-level actions

00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:00.396
to save water.

00:08:01.957 --> 00:08:03.893
Taking me to lesson three:

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:05.711
look below the surface.

00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:09.442
Water savings can come
from unexpected places.

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:13.941
Singapore is the eighth most
water-scarce country in the world.

00:08:14.374 --> 00:08:19.339
It depends on imported water
for almost 60 percent of its water needs.

00:08:20.423 --> 00:08:22.230
It's also a very small island.

00:08:22.933 --> 00:08:26.609
As such, it needs to make use
of as much space as possible

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:27.987
to catch rainfall.

00:08:29.153 --> 00:08:30.720
So in 2008,

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.376
they built the Marina Barrage.

00:08:32.801 --> 00:08:37.714
It's the first-ever urban water reservoir
built in the middle of the city-state.

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:41.885
It's the largest
water catchment in the country,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.068
almost one-sixth the size of Singapore.

00:08:44.716 --> 00:08:46.827
What's so amazing about the Marina Barrage

00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:51.766
is that it has been built to make
the maximum use of its large size

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.491
and its unexpected yet important location.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.506
It brings three valuable
benefits to the country:

00:08:58.506 --> 00:09:02.654
it has boosted Singapore's water
supply by 10 percent;

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:06.243
it protects low areas
around it from floods

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:08.324
because of its connection to the sea;

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.273
and, as you can see,

00:09:10.297 --> 00:09:12.887
it acts as a beautiful
lifestyle attraction,

00:09:12.911 --> 00:09:14.759
hosting several events,

00:09:14.783 --> 00:09:17.595
from art exhibitions to music festivals,

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:21.765
attracting joggers, bikers, tourists
all around that area.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.848
Now, not all initiatives
need to be stunning

00:09:25.872 --> 00:09:27.022
or even visible.

00:09:27.923 --> 00:09:31.816
My first home, Jordan, realized
that agriculture is consuming

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.363
the majority of its fresh water.

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:37.636
They really wanted to encourage farmers

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.886
to focus on growing
low water-intensive crops.

00:09:42.136 --> 00:09:43.335
To achieve that,

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:48.258
the local agriculture is increasing
its focus on date palms and grapevines.

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.577
Those two are much more tolerant
to drought conditions

00:09:52.601 --> 00:09:54.452
than many other fruits and vegetables,

00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:56.528
and at the same time,

00:09:56.552 --> 00:10:01.719
they are considered high-value crops,
both locally and internationally.

00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:04.271
Locals in Namibia,

00:10:05.073 --> 00:10:08.561
one of the most arid countries
in Southern Africa,

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:12.984
have been drinking
recycled water since 1968.

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:16.003
Now, you may tell me
many countries recycle water.

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:18.096
I would say yes.

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:20.789
But very few use it for drinking purposes,

00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:24.189
mostly because people
don't like the thought

00:10:24.213 --> 00:10:27.709
of water that was in their toilets
going to their taps.

00:10:28.295 --> 00:10:30.834
But Namibia could not afford
to think that way.

00:10:31.528 --> 00:10:34.374
They looked below the surface
to save water.

00:10:35.428 --> 00:10:37.190
They are now a great example

00:10:37.214 --> 00:10:41.869
of how, when countries purify waste water
to drinking standards,

00:10:41.893 --> 00:10:44.091
they can ease their water shortages,

00:10:44.672 --> 00:10:46.185
and in Namibia's case,

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:51.403
provide drinking water for more
than 300,000 citizens in its capital city.

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:56.850
As more countries which used
to be more water rich

00:10:56.874 --> 00:10:58.714
are becoming water scarce,

00:10:59.703 --> 00:11:02.384
I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

00:11:03.586 --> 00:11:06.839
If we just look at what
water-poor countries have done,

00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:09.353
the solutions are out there.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.261
Now it's really just up to all of us

00:11:13.285 --> 00:11:14.637
to take action.

00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:16.677
Thank you.

00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:19.317
