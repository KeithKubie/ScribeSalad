00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.470
A former teammate of Babe Ruth’s once recalled
the Bambino by saying, “You’ve got to

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.220
remember, this guy wasn’t born.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.860
He fell out of a tree.”

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.689
Ruth grabbed life by the throat (or maybe
it was another part of life’s anatomy) and

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.510
shook it up… frequently.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.690
Ruth spent a good portion of his youth cooped
up in St. Mary’s industrial school, listed

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.500
as an “incorrigible”.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.490
After he was released, Ruth seemed to spend
the rest of his life “making up for lost

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.490
time.”

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.190
He went through women like they were Lay’s
Potato Chips

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
Most men, even the greatest ladies’ men,
have particular “favorite types” of women,

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.649
subjective turn-ons, and particular traits
they especially like in the opposite sex.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.519
Ruth seemed unusual in his complete lack of
this quality.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.829
Ruth just simply loved women- tall women,
short ones, fat ones, thin ones, beautiful

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.730
knockouts, ugly rejects, socialites, film
starlets, secretaries, other men’s wives,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.829
and hookers.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.280
If the individual was a woman, he was interested.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.850
According to his teammates, it was an extremely
rare day that passed during his baseball career

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.010
(1914-1935) that he did not find some lady
to become “friendly” with.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.510
He liked women as much as baseball.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.720
And during his career, women constantly threw
themselves at him.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.520
This worked out for his teammates too, as
there were more than even he could handle,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.610
and most were happy to go with the backup
options.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.690
(You have to remember, even early in his career
when he wasn’t “The Great Bambino”,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.690
he wasn’t the tubby ballplayer most of us
remember today.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.980
He was quite the physical specimen early on
and very tall for his era.)

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.070
Ruth was crazy about prostitutes and loved
frequenting brothels.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.340
Prostitutes, unlike most women who threw themselves
at him, wanted nothing but money and were

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.470
much less complicated for the star.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.890
Often during his career, St. Louis fans would
be “touched” by the Babe as he would say

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.450
he frequented “The House of the Good Shepherd.”

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.300
Most assumed, given he was Catholic, he was
going to church.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.020
Little did they know, “The House of the
Good Shepherd” was a brothel in St. Louis.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.190
According to one of Ruth’s roommates early
in his career, Ping Bodie, two nights in a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.200
row Ruth managed to go through “all the
girls” at one Philadelphia brothel…

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.560
Most such brothels at that time had around
a dozen women on staff at any given time.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.230
There are numerous similar stories from other
teammates that paint the same picture of Ruth’s

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.950
libido, which even if exaggerated a bit, seem
to make it a miracle he had energy left to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.950
play baseball.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.890
Of course, anyone who lives this type of a
lifestyle is bound to upset a few people,

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.780
especially in the era he lived in.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.370
All this carnal activity had it’s inevitable
casualties.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.410
Once, sports writers were chatting on a train
in 1921 when they were amused to see the Babe

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.040
running like mad through the club car, with
a furious woman chasing him brandishing a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
knife.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.220
It was later discovered that the woman, who
was married, had thought she was the “only

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.319
one” and that he was in-love with her.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.750
When she found out the truth, out came the
knife.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.470
In a similar story, but with an angry husband
in Detroit this time, reporters were treated

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.630
to the sight of a nearly naked Ruth chased
out of a hotel room he’d been sharing with

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.740
the man’s wife.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.930
The man brought a gun, but lucky for Ruth,
chose not to shoot him, but simply give him

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.930
a scare.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.610
In a case that, for a time, looked extremely
bleak for the Bambino, late in 1922, Ruth

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.490
was slapped with a “breach-of-promise”
suit for $50,000 (about $677,000 today), filed

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.110
on behalf of Dolores Dixon, a teenage employee
at a Manhattan department store.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.150
She claimed she had become pregnant by Ruth.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.130
She said he had raped her and later promised
to marry her.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.440
She also claimed they’d met numerous times
for liaisons in his car.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.550
The matter went to trial in 1923.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.240
Ruth claimed he’d never seen the girl in
his life.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.640
Given the number of women he’d slept with,
perhaps this wasn’t a strong indicator that

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.290
he’d actually not done what the girl said.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.670
While she was a teen (19) and technically
underage in the area she lived (21 was the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.720
age of consent at the time there), few of
that era cared about her age.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.720
What the public wanted to know was whether
he’d actually sexually assaulted her and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.520
whether the child was his.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.239
Long story short, nope and nope.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.000
In fact, there was no Dolores Dixon.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.340
It was a made up name.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.950
“Dixon’s” lawyer later admitted they’d
hoped the Babe would settle out of court to

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.230
keep the story out of the public eye.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.410
Ruth called their bluff and took them to court,
at which point it became apparent the girl

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.250
and her lawyer’s story was all made up and
that she was simply desperate for money and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.210
was inspired by Ruth’s reputation as a playboy
to make up a story and extort some money from

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.210
him.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.919
Given his tendencies, she might have pulled
it off had she simply written to him and hooked

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.759
up with him a few times as she said in her
story.

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.349
While he hadn’t committed the despicable
acts “Dixon” accused him of, his behavior

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.830
was deplorable for another reason- during
his peak womanizing years, he had a wife whom

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.289
he sorely neglected.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.080
Ruth went through life like a cyclone, but
of all the people he touched, possibly none

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.350
was hurt as much as his first wife.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.039
Helen Woodford was an auburn-haired Texas
girl, sweet and quite pretty.

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.550
She was a waitress in a Boston cafe where
Ruth met and fell in love with her, or perhaps

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.550
just in-lust.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.229
By all accounts, she was extremely shy and
a very innocent girl, perhaps appealing to

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.319
him because, unlike so many other women, she
wasn’t throwing herself at him.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:13.110
Whatever the case, they were married in a
Catholic church in 1914; Ruth was 2o and she

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.520
was 17.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.169
Throughout their 14 years of marriage, poor
Helen’s life with Ruth was pure hell.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.370
He gave her furs, an 80-acre farm and an adopted
daughter named Dorothy (who was Ruth’s child

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.969
through one of his affairs, this one to Juanita
Jennings, though Helen reportedly did not

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:32.779
know the child was really his); he gave her
neither time, love, nor fidelity.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:37.050
His countless affairs with other women caused
her to have a nervous breakdown.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.099
She finally left Ruth in 1928 and the following
year- while living with a dentist in Watertown,

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.089
Mass- she died in a mysterious house fire.

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.379
At the time, they were still married as, being
Catholic, they couldn’t get divorced.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:53.830
Affairs, at least as far as Ruth was concerned,
apparently didn’t conflict with his religion.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.930
Divorce, though… oh the scandal.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.419
Ruth mourned her briefly.

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.319
Three months later, Ruth married ex-chorus
girl Claire Merritt Hodgson.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.759
She was classy, well-off, extremely strong-minded
and a great beauty who had a liking for ballplayers.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:11.680
(Ty Cobb stated that he dated Hodgson before
Ruth and that things had gotten serious for

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
a time.)

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.330
She was one of the women Ruth were having
an affair with when Helen was alive.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:22.809
He married Claire in 1929 and she did the
impossible, taming him and managing to change

00:06:22.809 --> 00:06:24.749
his entire lifestyle.

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:27.339
She put him on a strict diet and curbed his
drinking.

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.689
She saved his money and forced a ten o’clock
curfew on him when he went to parties.

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.729
Most remarkable of all, he mostly did what
she said.

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:39.969
Claire knew all about the Babe’s other women
and this reckless habit too was finally, mostly,

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:40.969
curbed.

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:43.979
For a time, she even traveled with him while
he was on the road to make sure he stuck to

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:44.979
her rules.

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:48.669
After a while, she got tired of all the travel,
though, and decided Ruth occasionally doing

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:52.520
things he shouldn’t was a fair trade for
getting to spend more time with her family

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.259
and friends back home.

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.949
While he didn’t go back to the extreme playboy
ways he’d exhibited before, while on the

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.039
road at this point, he had the occasional
affair.

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.719
At home, he was generally a dutiful husband.

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:05.789
Apparently the situation worked for them.

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:15.219
Claire was very possibly the one and only
woman Ruth ever met who he actually respected

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:21.319
and, to the end, their 19-year marriage was
by all accounts a relatively happy one.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.889
Babe Ruth died on August 16, 1948.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:30.479
Millions of baseball fans mourned his death-
and so did countless women who cared nothing

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:31.479
about baseball whatsoever.

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.240
Although, from accounts of more than a few
broken hearts he left along the way, there

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.710
were probably a few who secretly rejoiced.
