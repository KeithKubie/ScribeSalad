1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,100
Well, let me think. It's the
wrong way to think about it.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,000
What do you disagree if anything
with what he said so far? Well,

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,950
so far what he said, it hasn't been
particularly reveling the Tori, um,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,623
the,
uh,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,990
I think we have to step back
for a second because you know,

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,310
while the low carb community might have
a more better understanding of where we

7
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:24,960
disagree,
um,

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,961
I think the greater community that Joe
Reaches might not so fundamentally with

9
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,130
Stefan saying and what the research
community is saying and the conventional

10
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,040
thinking in this field is that the brain,

11
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:42,180
and correct me any point I get this wrong,
but the brain regulates,

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,630
does the fundamental job of controlling
how fast we are and the way it does it

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,850
is by controlling or miss controlling
our intake and our expenditure and the

14
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,460
different tents up in fat tissue.

15
00:00:56,461 --> 00:01:00,210
Is that fair to say for the most
primarily intake, but yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,160
So Stefan has a brain centric view of
the universe and the community community

17
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:06,090
at large does as well.

18
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:11,091
So if we go outside and we walked down
in Ventura Boulevard and we see someone

19
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:15,810
who weighs 400 pounds,
um,

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,760
they've clearly taken in more calories
than they should have opened the course

21
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,150
of their life and it's been
stored in their fat tissue.

22
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,950
And Stefan says,

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,980
I think would say that the problem is in
their brains ability to regulate intake

24
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:35,850
to expenditure. Is that
correct? Yeah. Okay.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,770
And let me, I have to fix my headphones.
So how are we going to do this?

26
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,570
I'm getting feedback when I talk. You're
getting feedback? Yeah. It's just weird.

27
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:46,830
Couldn't be the,
hold on one sec.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,370
For those who don't know, I'm
hearing impaired. As I say, kindly,

29
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:58,290
my kids would say deaf as a post, so
better. So I took off my hearing aids.

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,480
It's a little better.
Okay.

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,120
So what I've been arguing, so I come
along my background, I'm a journalist,

32
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:10,740
I'm an investigative journalist
with a science background.
Okay. That's what I do.

33
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:14,820
And I'm curious, and I've gotten
a lot of, you know, and I,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,020
my first two books were studying
what's called pathological science,

35
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,990
which is about people who got the wrong
results in science because a lot of

36
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:26,850
times scientists do so by,
I'm very sensitive to this.

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,360
And as I was doing the
research for my first book,

38
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,250
which took five years,

39
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,850
what I noticed in when you
take a historical perspective
is that the research

40
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,690
community studying obesity
was very focused on the brain.

41
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,790
They just assume that
that people are gluttons.

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,230
And I'm gonna use some
socially unacceptable, uh,
language, because in part,

43
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:52,470
that's how they thought about. And
in fact, when you read the, uh,

44
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,810
obesity literature from
the forties and 50s,

45
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:58,710
it's shocking the way these people
talked about people with obesity.

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,420
And the assumption was
they're gluttons are,

47
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,690
they're neurotic or they're anxious
or they're just, you know, but,

48
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,350
but it was all brain center.
And when they got to the 1960s,

49
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:11,770
the field was being run by psychologists
and psychiatrists who are trying to get

50
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,340
people with obesity to eat less.
And it,

51
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:17,380
my favorite example is one team
that was trying to get the,

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,970
they got the wives to stop having sex
with the husbands if they didn't lose

53
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:24,940
weight every week and
that would motivate them.

54
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:28,570
I think even you pointed out that sex
is a greater motivator in your book.

55
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,290
Then tasty foods.
It didn't say it was greater,

56
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,770
but I said it was on par.
Par So,

57
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,920
and I'm going to just read you a,
I won't read you that the,

58
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,810
so there was this, while the
obesity research community
is focusing on the brain,

59
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,080
there are people studying fat metabolism
endocronologists they study hormones

60
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,010
and hormone related disorders
saying that the, Oh yeah,

61
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,810
fat storage and fat mobilization,

62
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:01,060
the burning of fat and the human body is

63
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,870
controlled by this very diverse set of
hormones and enzymes and the nervous

64
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,320
system is involved in well and our body
does a very careful job of the site of

65
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,460
basically orchestrating how
we use fields after we eat.

66
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,580
And the implication was,

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,280
and I think Stefan kind of stepped into
this with the very first thing you said

68
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:27,040
till the assumption was obesity is a
disorder of excess fat accumulation.

69
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,200
So today when you read the literature,

70
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,800
the article's officer obesity's
a sort of energy imbalance.

71
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,050
You take in more calories
than they expend.

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,520
There were still the best scientists in
the field. The best physician scientists,

73
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,270
which they look obesity is the
disorder of excess fat accumulation.

74
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,350
Let's look at what regulates fat
accumulation. The human body,

75
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,710
some people are programmed or dysregulated
to store more fat and if their store

76
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,230
more fat, they're going to, their
behavior is going to respond,

77
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,200
they'll be hungry or they'll eat more,
there'll be gluttons all of these things.

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,560
So it was switching the causality
instead of the brain determining energy

79
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,840
balance and that determining
fat accumulation.

80
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,500
The idea was the sort of,
let's see,

81
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,940
what regulates fat accumulation
that's dysregulated. If I have a,

82
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,560
if I give birth to a daughter who weighs
a hundred pounds at age four I'm not

83
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,900
gonna worry about how much
he eats and exercises.

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,880
I'm going to worry about what's going
on with fat accumulation and this young

85
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:32,140
girl that her body is just
as if you give a, you know,

86
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,650
if you have a child who's six foot
eight when he's six years old,

87
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,140
you're not going to worry about
how much he eats an exercises.

88
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:42,430
You're going to worry that he's over
secreting growth hormone. So the idea,

89
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,070
basically what I've done,
my role in this is to say look

90
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,840
in this vitally important period in
the 1960s the 1970s when obesity we

91
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,800
searchers came to understand I'm fat
metabolism researchers came to understand

92
00:05:56,801 --> 00:06:00,260
the of that sells the obesity.

93
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,700
People were convinced that the problem
is in the brain and those obesity people

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,880
eventually grew into the world that
Stefan got his PhD in as the neuro

95
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:15,440
biological world where you study what's
happening in the brain and you ignore

96
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,780
what's happening in the fat cells and
fat mobilization and fatty acid oxidation

97
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,840
and Ted Stuart.
And when you look at that,

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,160
you find a whole world of places in
which people can pre be predetermined,

99
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,040
you know, be driven to
be fat. So, for example,

100
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,270
when I was in high school,
senior year in high school,

101
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:43,271
I weighed 195 pounds and I
played football and my brother,

102
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,440
two years older, wait 195 pounds
his senior year and played football.

103
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,460
My brother never got more than 195
pounds and I went up to two 40.

104
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:57,550
We both ate as much as humanly possible.
You know, as you could imagine,

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,430
that's what high school athletes do.
My brother was always lean.

106
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,890
I was always trouble. My brothers stayed
late and it became an endurance athlete.

107
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,200
I became a football player
and I lifted weights.

108
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,460
I put on muscle easily and I fat knee.
Slowly he didn't.

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,190
Um, the conventional wisdom would be the
reason I went to two 40 and he never got

110
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:22,460
the one 95 was that my brain
was different than his.

111
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,630
My argument is our bodies
were fundamentally different.

112
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:29,660
So if I see somebody walking down
the street and weighs 300 pounds,

113
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,510
I don't worry about,

114
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,400
I don't think about what the problem
is with her brain regulating intake and

115
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,930
expenditure.
I think about what's,

116
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:40,910
why is her body driving her to be
300 pounds? So that's, I think,

117
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,920
kind of the fundamental
difference. Um, and is it,

118
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,580
is it the brain that can't do the job
or is it the body that can't do the job

119
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,520
and the brain is responding to
what's happening in the body?

120
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,910
Yeah. Is this a reductionist perspective?
Cause I mean, isn't it a holistic,

121
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,970
I mean holistically you're looking at
the entire machine of the human body.

122
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,350
The idea that the brain is somehow or
another separate from the body is saying

123
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:05,831
it's separate.

124
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:09,490
The question is the brain driving
what's happening in the body or is it

125
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:12,400
responding to a 10? So, um, and you know,

126
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:16,090
the brain of course does respond a lot
to what's happening in the body and we

127
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:20,770
can talk about that and how that
works. Um, but you know, I think it's,

128
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,620
we can tell stories,
but the things,

129
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,330
the thing that differentiates a story
that's true from a story that is not true

130
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,700
is evidence. And so, you know,

131
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,100
you talk about the difference
between your brother and you.

132
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,090
This is where that genetics evidence comes
back in that I was talking about your

133
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:39,610
brother and you only
share half of your genes.

134
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,150
We know that genetics has a strong impact
on who has a greater susceptibility to

135
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,190
body fatness and nut than others.

136
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,940
And we also know what the genes do
that underlie those differences.

137
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,880
And they are primary. I'm not done
Gary, let me finish jeans. Those jeans.

138
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,120
Nope. Nope, not right now. I'm, I'm
in the middle of saying something.

139
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,670
Those genes are um, primarily related
to differences in brain function.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,440
That is what the genetic say.

141
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,620
And so that suggests that the reason why
you had a greater propensity than your

142
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:18,000
brother to become fat probably has to
do with differences in genetics that

143
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,520
relate to brain function. That is what the
research says. Okay, very actually look.

144
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,490
So when you talk to him about two 17 year
olds that way, exactly the same amount.

145
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:29,750
Like how do we know how much they
consumed in calories? I mean,

146
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,330
we don't have any studies.
We don't have of course,

147
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,010
but I mean I could guarantee you we
both paid as much as humanly possible,

148
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,480
but eventually my mother who never got
over one 95 and I apologize for bringing

149
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,440
you up on the air.

150
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:44,310
I know you don't like that used
to say that he never gets stuffed.

151
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,110
He just gets bored of eating after
a couple of hours. Okay. Okay.

152
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:53,220
But I may be even though like maybe
if you looked at it scientifically,

153
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:57,270
you ate more than him or maybe
you ate more sugar, more carbs.

154
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,570
So that's a difference. So the,
that, those are the two hypothesis.

155
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:05,070
Why don't I pause? [inaudible] is my body,

156
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,150
and this is what Stefan is. Cypress. I
want to just, the thing I wanted to read,

157
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,380
how much,
I'll ask you the question,

158
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:14,970
how much of the variation in human
obesity to those genes explained?

159
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,860
So if you look at the genetics
of, no, I didn't ask how much.

160
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,600
Yeah, your question. He needs
to let us talking. Yeah, you
got to love Tamales, Gary.

161
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,080
Um,
so if you look at the genetics of obesity,

162
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,850
what you find is that from twin studies
and family studies that measure the

163
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,950
overall contribution of genetics,

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,400
about 75% of the differences in body
fatness between individuals is due to

165
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:44,790
genetic differences between
those individuals. So, you know,

166
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,370
1995 America,

167
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:51,690
if you just take a cross section of
people and you measure how much is genes,

168
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:55,140
how much is environment,
about 75% is genetic.

169
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:00,170
Now we've only identified
a small proportion of the
specific genes that underlie

170
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,240
the propensity to obesity.

171
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,950
And so if you look at the percentage
that we have specifically identified,

172
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:12,180
it's a very small, and that's what I
refer to in my book. How much it's like a,

173
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,700
right now I think it's up to about 10%
it was 3% when their book was pumped.

174
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah, that's correct. They
did 7% absolutely. Yeah.
The latest. Yeah. Actually,

175
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,600
let me cite the, uh, so the
study, they're not just a second,

176
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:28,050
I'm going to cite this study just a
second. I'm going to cite this study. Uh,

177
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,400
this study is under reference number two.

178
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,300
So you can,
you can go check that out.

179
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:38,130
It's about 10% and these genetic
studies are advancing very quickly.

180
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,470
And that's why in the three
years since I wrote that,

181
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,520
we have explained a lot more than we
did at the time that I wrote that.

182
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,960
And so we have a portion of these genes
identified and what we're seeing is that

183
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,980
most of that portion that we have
identified relate to brain activity.

184
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,960
And so that tells us that primarily the
differences between individuals that

185
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,860
determine differences in body fatness
is about differences in brain activity.

186
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:04,450
And no one should be shocked about this.

187
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,990
The brain generates all
of our eating behavior.

188
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,430
It generates all of our physical activity
behavior and it actually regulates

189
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,780
body fatness. No one should
be surprised by this. I am.

190
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,480
And I was. And how were you surprised
when you get, if you disagree with, well,

191
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,580
virtually everything,
but, um, let's begin with

192
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,660
track back now. The, um, okay,

193
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:35,230
so drugs that explain obesity 10% with
the argument that I was making and the

194
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:39,760
argument I continue to make. Imagine
if you don't, we'll take Stefan's,

195
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,290
uh, car medicine's Stefan. He says,
Stefan, can you say that right?

196
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,490
It's okay. I'm not saying that, but I
mean just people don't get confused.

197
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,490
Thank you. The, uh, if
it takes car now and,

198
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,130
and somewhere in the 1970s I, I've
used the car, now I'm for this too,

199
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,900
but I don't think it's as appropriate.

200
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,900
But when we to think that somewhere in
the 1970s the aliens didn't notice that

201
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:06,400
there were humans driving the car.

202
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,160
So now they're trying to solve the
problem without the humans involved.

203
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,530
Why did you do some cars
drive faster than others?

204
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:18,730
And they come up with all kinds of
hypotheses and some of them can explain it

205
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:23,100
even when they interpret the hypotheses.
One of the common problems at science,

206
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,060
it's called intellectual face lock.

207
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,630
So what I've been arguing is in effect,

208
00:13:28,631 --> 00:13:32,710
the obesity research community
left out of its research,

209
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,300
1960s era endocrinology,

210
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,970
the hormonal metabolic regulation
of fatty acid metabolism,

211
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:44,560
oxidation burning.
And it sucked when they did it.

212
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,840
Pretty much everything they've done
since has been interpreted incorrectly.

213
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,240
Just like the aliens would interpret the
car problem if they never noticed the

214
00:13:53,241 --> 00:13:57,310
humans. So, um, and
Leptin is a good example.

215
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,750
So Leptin is discovered in 1993
and when Leptin is discovered,

216
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:04,930
obesity becomes sort of a
legitimate field of science.

217
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,710
Until then it's a bunch of actually
mostly psychologists studying and,

218
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:12,610
and now it becomes a subdiscipline and
molecular biology and all the molecular

219
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:16,450
biologists jump into the field and
they assume that would let them, does,

220
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,480
is controlled the brain signals how
much fat is available to some kind of

221
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:26,650
satiety or fueled deficiency,
um,

222
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,890
hormone.
And as such,

223
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,330
they studied the brain and they studied
the action of Lipton in the brain.

224
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,070
Now in 2002,

225
00:14:36,071 --> 00:14:41,071
Jeff Friedman who gets credit for
discovering up perhaps incorrectly,

226
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,950
um,
publishes a paper in the journal Science.

227
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:49,270
It's saying perhaps as much as two thirds
or more of what Leptin does is done in

228
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:52,250
the periphery in the body.
And what Leptin does,

229
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:54,380
it's a hormone that sort of is,

230
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,860
is secreted in response to how
much fat you've accumulated.

231
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,140
And then does it stimulate the brain to
tell you to eat more or less depending

232
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,440
on how much fat or it
also works in liver cells,

233
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:08,000
which are the cells that were studying.

234
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,920
And the assumption is it probably doesn't
all cells to tell yourselves to burn

235
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:17,020
fat. So it makes perfect sense if
there's fat available in the fat cells,

236
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,380
now you've got a signal telling sort of
influencing the other cells of the body

237
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:25,970
to burn fat. So now you've got a hormone
that could work in the periphery, in the,

238
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,780
in the, you know, below then neck
or it could work above the neck.

239
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:33,290
But you've got a community that's
almost exclusively studying in the head.

240
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,460
They don't know they're human drivers
down here. So that's what they do.

241
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,590
So even in this world, the, I don't,
I think I know the genome paper,

242
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,840
I'm Stefan is

243
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,250
probably referenced on his
[inaudible] a number of fescue.

244
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,230
That's the heart's research. Is
that, uh, I, I don't remember the,

245
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:58,600
so they had two papers cause it's what
you cited in the article you coauthored

246
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,800
with Rudy Leibel.
So I have two papers.

247
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,190
One is genes associated with obesity and
one is genes associated with body type.

248
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,500
So with body type, they're all below
the neck. They're all you know,

249
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,500
fat metabolism basically.
And the Musk, you know,

250
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,370
the genes had aspects of your body
that you would expect to be controlled.

251
00:16:19,371 --> 00:16:23,990
Like when you build up muscle and you
have to take an excess energy to do it,

252
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:24,651
it makes you hungry.

253
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:28,220
I don't think your brain is regulating
how much muscle you're building other

254
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,200
than your drive to go to the gym.

255
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,610
Basically your body is responding
to the stress on the muscle.

256
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,790
All the things you do in the weight
lifting, it's all below the neck.

257
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,280
So the argument here is again,
simple.

258
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,970
When these people looked at body type,

259
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,430
it was insulin regulated
genes for the most part,

260
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,910
growth hormone, all of these things.
When they looked at excess body fat,

261
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,270
they decided they were in the head.
But the question is when they looked,

262
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,440
they're programmed to think that excess
body fat, it's caused by overeating.

263
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,290
So they look in the brain,
did they do the same kind?

264
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,150
And I was going to call
the researcher involved.

265
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:10,151
I never got around to doing it saying
if body type body shape is determined by

266
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:16,481
these genes and doesn't it make sense
that x has variations of body shape,

267
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,300
we're going to be determined
by the same genes.

268
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,790
And did you do the same kind of searches?

269
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,790
I don't actually know how they
determine where the genes work.

270
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,300
It's the same kind of searches. They just
came up with different sets of genes.

271
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:31,640
So they didn't start with any assumptions.

272
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:34,760
They were just finding them the
questionnaire where the genes work.

273
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:36,470
So there's a common phenomenon,

274
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:39,920
all of this like with Leptin gene that
everybody thinks about working in the

275
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:44,010
hypothalamus seems to work in every,
can I respond to that? [inaudible]

276
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,360
talking cause you say this in your head,
you say this in your book,

277
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,550
I'm prepared to respond
whenever you're done. Okay.

278
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:54,990
In your book you say that gene's work.
Yeah, the body is very, basically,

279
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,991
it puts a different mechanisms to work
as many places that can in there these

280
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,720
homeostatic feedback loops,
you know, something happens.

281
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,400
Your whole body has to respond.

282
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,680
So a gene that my work primarily on
one cell is scattered all over the body

283
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:13,560
because every cell, and it'll do
different jobs on different cells.

284
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,030
But if you think that the problems
in the brain, that's where you look.

285
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,300
So you get this kind of intellectual
phase lock where that's what we do.

286
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:28,290
That's what we study. And
neurobiologists studies the brain, uh,

287
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,770
the Daniel Kahneman,
Stefan like suicide,

288
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,490
Daniel Conaman as well had this concept.
What you see is all,

289
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:40,470
he's a Nobel laureate, uh,
cognitive psychologists.
What you see is all there is.

290
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,010
Okay. And basically if
you're studying the brain,

291
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,610
that's what you look at if
you're studying the gut,

292
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,870
until we all get trapped into that on
some extent. And what I'm saying is,

293
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,400
even in these studies,

294
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
so Stefan and Stefan wrote a book about
the hungry brain that is supposed to be

295
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,710
about obesity.
But in fact,

296
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:06,260
you never mentioned anything about the
metabolic regulation of [inaudible].

297
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
It's just not there.

298
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,580
And I would argue it has to
be there even if it's wrong,

299
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,740
if it's not there,
the absence of it.

300
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,220
Like you can't talk about Leptin without
talking about what it might be doing in

301
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:23,660
the body. You can talk,
you know, so there's a,

302
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,340
the edits put me in a very odd position.

303
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,150
So Stephanie is kind of the defender of
the Orthodox and I'm the one who comes

304
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:34,770
along and says, look, you guys
just, you missed it. You screwed up.

305
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,650
You had psychologists and psychiatrists
running the field when the

306
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,680
endocrinologists sob that and then
you'd discovered Leptin and it became a

307
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,390
molecular biology problem.

308
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,800
And you're now divorced from the very
simplest observations about obesity.

309
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,930
You know, so we can do huge
genome wide association studies.

310
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,940
They sound remarkable.

311
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,610
But if I were to ask a simple question
like why is it I get fat here?

312
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,350
Yeah, the love handle thing, it's in the
back with man. It's not in the front,

313
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:07,350
but it's here and not here.

314
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,190
I don't see what the brain has
to say about that. Um, okay.

315
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,350
So as you mentioned,

316
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:17,250
there have been different genetic
studies that have looked at body fat

317
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:20,460
distribution versus total body fatness.

318
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,760
So total body fatness is what we're
talking about when we're talking about

319
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:25,290
obesity.
Uh,

320
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,950
body fat distribution is what we're
talking about when we're talking about the

321
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,140
fat being on your hips
versus on your wrist.

322
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,560
Now what we see is different
sets of genes that come up.

323
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:38,390
So body fat distribution,
we actually see insulin,

324
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,930
a related genes, so people that have
a central body fat distribution,

325
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:47,931
so body fat around their waist tend
to have these insulin related genes

326
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,460
that are driving that.
But when you look at total body fatness,

327
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,830
the thing that causes obesity,

328
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,530
what you see is that those genes
are dominated by the brain.

329
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:57,520
And the really cool thing,

330
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,260
the point I want to make about the
genetics research 10% that means might be

331
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,680
tolerated by the brain and
say, look, come on Gary.

332
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,720
It is unbiased. That's the really cool
thing about it is that they're just,

333
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,940
this is whatever genes are popping up.

334
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,990
These studies do not care about what
you believe about what causes obesity.

335
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:18,880
This is just whatever
genes are popping up.

336
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:23,350
So it's unbiased and that's what they're
saying. And I'm not done here, Gary.

337
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,520
Now I want to talk about,
um, you mentioned Gary,

338
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,330
that may be Leptin is
having important actions,

339
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,630
not just in the brain but in the
body. First of all, I'm glad,

340
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,870
I'm flattered that you read my book
and I'm glad that you acknowledge the

341
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:41,200
existence of Leptin. Now this is good. Um,

342
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,740
but now you say that researchers focus
on Leptin actions in the brain because

343
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:51,630
we're phase locked and we
can't get out of our, you know,

344
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,230
blinders of thinking about it in terms
of the brain and that that's why we focus

345
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:58,000
on left and action in the brain.

346
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,800
The real reason we focus on left and
action in the brain is because it has been

347
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:07,420
demonstrated that it's effect on body.
Fatness are via the brain.

348
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,790
There are actual experiments
demonstrating this,

349
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,950
and I'll explain how
these experiments work.

350
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,990
This is all in the scientific literature.

351
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,470
So if you knock out the Leptin receptor
only in the brain or only in the

352
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:24,280
Hypothalamus,
you get obesity.

353
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,640
So that is what tells us that actually
the brain is the key site of action.

354
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:34,080
And particularly this part of the brain.
It tells me, Hey, Carrie, Carrie, Carrie,

355
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,710
please let him talk. He let
you talk. Yeah. And that's it.

356
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:43,180
So I mean you get the same obesity if
you knock leaped and how to the brain and

357
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,670
particularly out of the hypothalamus
that you get if you knock it out of the

358
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,504
whole body.

359
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,010
So that shows that the brain is this
site of action that is causing this to

360
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:54,700
happen. And this is no surprise. We
have these mechanisms worked out.

361
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,680
We know specific groups of neurons
that are receiving the left in that are

362
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:03,430
controlling or appetite that are
controlling our metabolic rate.

363
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,760
We have many of these neuro
populations worked out in mice.

364
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,790
We understand these systems so well
we can control specific popular tiny

365
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:16,630
populations of neurons very
precisely caused them to eat a ton,

366
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,670
to stop eating, to gain fat, to lose
fat like the animals are marionettes.

367
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,450
I mean that's the level of understanding
we have right now of how these systems

368
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,010
work. So, I mean,

369
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,070
all of this evidence is converging on
the same thing that the brain is central

370
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,180
and that fat cell metabolism. I'm just
not seeing the evidence for that. I mean,

371
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:37,810
Gary,

372
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:42,810
if you want to cite specific evidence
demonstrating that that is an actual cause

373
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,930
of differences in body fatness between
individuals in the general population.

374
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,190
I'm awaiting that evidence and I'm happy
to sit here and listen to you cite the

375
00:23:51,191 --> 00:23:52,990
evidence that demonstrates that.
Correct.
