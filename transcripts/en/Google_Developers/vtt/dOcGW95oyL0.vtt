00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
On the web, speed matters
because if your website's

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.900
slow, customers are going
to go elsewhere.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.970
Now with PageSpeed Service,
speeding up

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.090
your website is easy.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.310
PageSpeed works by taking the
stuff that people look at the

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.220
most then optimizing it using
Google's technology.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.010
So everything is faster.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.040
Adding PageSpeed is easy.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.440
It takes only a few minutes.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.880
And you don't have to know
anything about code, only that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.710
being faster means more clicks,
more exploring, and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.000
more people staying engaged on
your site, which adds up to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.630
more smiles especially
for you.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.230
PageSpeed service from Google.
