00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 align:start position:0%
office I'll show you and so we basically
 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
office I'll show you and so we basically
work<00:00:57.950><c> together</c><00:00:58.160><c> and</c><00:00:58.550><c> he</c><00:00:58.820><c> started</c><00:00:59.180><c> telling</c><00:00:59.420><c> me</c>

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 align:start position:0%
work together and he started telling me
 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.990 align:start position:0%
work together and he started telling me
about<00:00:59.630><c> you</c><00:01:00.410><c> know</c><00:01:00.470><c> these</c><00:01:00.920><c> Boltzmann</c><00:01:01.640><c> machines</c>

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 align:start position:0%
some of the tricks which I didn't at
 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.469 align:start position:0%
some of the tricks which I didn't at
that<00:01:06.800><c> time</c><00:01:07.159><c> quite</c><00:01:07.400><c> understand</c><00:01:07.940><c> what</c><00:01:08.210><c> he</c><00:01:08.330><c> was</c>

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
that time quite understand what he was
 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.560 align:start position:0%
that time quite understand what he was
talking<00:01:08.750><c> about</c><00:01:09.370><c> but</c><00:01:10.370><c> that</c><00:01:10.520><c> really</c><00:01:10.909><c> really</c>

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 align:start position:0%

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 align:start position:0%
excited that was very exciting and
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.180 align:start position:0%
excited that was very exciting and
really<00:01:14.180><c> excited</c><00:01:14.540><c> me</c><00:01:14.690><c> and</c><00:01:14.810><c> then</c><00:01:15.440><c> basically</c>

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 align:start position:0%
really excited me and then basically
 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
really excited me and then basically
