SPEAKER 1: In the CNN Newsroom.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.540
DON LEMON: You know, it
is the largest, largest

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.530
school in the world.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.580
It is online.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
It is free, and it's expanding.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.870
We'll talk to the founder and
the winner of a $2 million

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.150
prize from Google.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.220
OK, so it was two years ago
today that Google announced

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.140
Project 10^100.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.100
The goal-- well, it
was to change the world

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.440
by helping people.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.160
Google got 150,000 entries.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.150
And today the company
announced five winners.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.930
One is the Khan Academy,
which is a nonprofit that

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.100
lets the world learn for
free through its 1,600

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.300
online videos.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.844
Now the man behind the Khan
Academy is Salman Khan.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.885
And he joins us now live
from Google headquarters

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:46.850
in Mountain View, California.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.429
Happy day for you?

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.220
SALMAN KHAN: It is.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.100
It's pretty exciting.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.710
DON LEMON: Listen--
so tell us, what

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.449
do you plan to do
with the Google money?

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.740
SALMAN KHAN: Well, as you
mentioned, Khan Academy right

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.850
now-- it's actually pushing
close to 2,000 videos.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.184
They've all been produced by me.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:07.016
We're going to do two
things with the money.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:09.540
We're going to one, translate
a lot of the content

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.720
into some of the world's
major languages--

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.812
Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic,
Hindi, Portuguese--

00:01:15.812 --> 00:01:17.020
I could keep going on and on.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.440
And we're going to build out the
software part of what we did.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.810
I built out the first version.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.810
But really what this is
going to allow us to do

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.749
is become more than just me.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.290
We're going to be
able to hire a team

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.077
and turn it into an all-out
virtual school for free.

00:01:29.077 --> 00:01:31.160
DON LEMON: Yeah, that's
what people are wondering.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.880
That's what I mean-- that's
the obvious question.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.610
How do you do it?

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.330
How do you do school online,
and is it actually viable?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.651
Does it work?

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.630
SALMAN KHAN: Well, there's
two parts of school.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.140
One is the learning part, and
one is the credentialing part.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.730
We're tackling the
learning part first.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.782
And I think it does work.

00:01:47.782 --> 00:01:49.240
I think when people
go to the site,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.920
they'll see that there's
a lot of testimonials

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.596
from a lot of people
who are not just

00:01:54.596 --> 00:01:55.720
using this as a supplement.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.000
They're using this
as their substitute

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.860
sometimes for what maybe
should go on in the classroom.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.160
We get hundreds of letters
a day from learners

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.550
all over the world who use this
as their primary way to learn.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.271
DON LEMON: So listen,
you were-- can

00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:12.020
we say that you were
one of the tech guys?

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.270
Right, did you do that before?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.145
I know that you worked
in money and business.

00:02:15.145 --> 00:02:17.561
I think you were a hedge fund--
you worked in hedge funds,

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.150
right?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.670
So how did you just decide to
change and say, you know what?

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.045
I'm going to deal
with education.

00:02:22.045 --> 00:02:25.870
I'm going to deal with
education and teaching online.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.350
SALMAN KHAN: Well,
there was always

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.600
a part of me that wanted to
do something in education.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.870
About five years ago I had a
family member in New Orleans--

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.970
I was in Boston at the time--
who needed help with math.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.800
So I started tutoring
her remotely.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.326
And then I started
tutoring her brothers.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.700
And it started
going really well.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.350
But it became hard
to schedule time.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.420
So I said hey, let
me put the-- let

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.047
me do my lectures on
YouTube so that we

00:02:47.047 --> 00:02:48.380
don't have to schedule our time.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.180
And their feedback,
immediately, was

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.370
that they like me better
on YouTube than in person.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.710
Because they got to pause
and repeat, and I guess

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.780
there wasn't the stress
of a live interaction

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.020
with their cousin.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.800
And I also made it
free for anybody else.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.430
And I started getting
letters from random people

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.880
all over the world saying
that these videos allowed them

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.980
to pass algebra, or these
videos are the reason

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.110
why they didn't
drop out of school

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.640
or why they're able
to go back to college.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.750
And I just got excited about it.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.090
I was doing it part time,
really as a hobby while-- as you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.610
mentioned-- working
at a hedge fund.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.070
And then the site kept
growing until last year, where

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.930
it got too exciting for me to be
able to focus on my hedge fund

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.610
job, so I quit.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.600
And I lived off of
savings for a little bit.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.985
We got a few donations
earlier this year

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:28.610
that allowed me to
take a small salary.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.074
But this Google
award really allows

00:03:31.074 --> 00:03:32.865
us to take it to the
next level and turn it

00:03:32.865 --> 00:03:34.460
into a real, free,
virtual school.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.400
DON LEMON: What
was your reaction

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.650
when you got the Google award?

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.250
I'm sure you were ecstatic
because this really helps

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.410
things, helps move things along.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.160
SALMAN KHAN: Oh yeah,
it's super exciting.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.310
Obviously, the money is huge.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.440
We'll be able to
build out a team.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.590
We'll be able to
internationalize the content so

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.240
that more than just
English speakers--

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.730
we can start addressing
the other 5 billion people

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.000
on the world.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.520
And I think probably
the biggest thing

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.620
is that the Google people
are pretty serious thinkers.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.120
And they wouldn't be
throwing around $2 million

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.086
for just any effort.

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:07.960
So I think this is a
pretty strong validation

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.430
for what we're doing.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.510
DON LEMON: Salman, I
want to ask you this.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.718
You know, the movie Waiting
for Superman opens today,

00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:12.780
and it's about education.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.280
And everyone is
trying to figure out

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.800
how do we fix the American
educational system.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.810
Do you have any
advice from what you

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.570
are doing that we can learn
from for our schools, the brick

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.490
and mortar schools?

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.080
SALMAN KHAN: You
know, I think people

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.340
have been talking
about technology being

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.940
a major factor for a while now.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.750
I think the problem is that all
the attempts so far at using

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.920
technology have been
to mold the technology

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.440
to the traditional
academic model.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.410
What we're trying to do
is really just rethink

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.540
how you can learn
now using technology.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.980
And maybe we should mold the
traditional academic model

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.490
to how we can use technology.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.157
But I could go on
and on about that.

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.240
But I think you're going
to see some major changes

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.460
in the next five to ten years.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.060
DON LEMON: Salman Khan
from the Khan Academy.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.630
Congratulations,
and we'll be looking

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.920
to see what you are
doing with that money

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.870
and how it helps
your effort there.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.060
Thanks again, OK.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.840
SALMAN KHAN: Thank you.
